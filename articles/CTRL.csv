4258497,41921,2019-05-09T08:00:00-04:00,"The home automation market is expected to double in size to over $80B annual opportunity by 2023.Connected devices within the home are proliferating but the technology needed to seamlessly control them is not keeping pace.Control4 is a leading provider of professionally installed smart home solutions, providing hardware and software to integrate the thousands of connected devices.The company has less than a 1.5% penetration within the US of its target market (households over $150K income) and is growing its installed base at 20% per year.Shares could see 100% upside as the installed base expands, strategic initiatives take hold, and the size of the platform is seen as an opportunity to drive upgrades and services.","I am personally all in on Control4 as my highest conviction upside call in the last 5 years. The combination of margin of safety and massive upside opportunity provides an alpha rich opportunity that investors could profit from today.I have one previous bullish call on Control4, from April 2015, when the stock traded for $12 per share. Since that time, Control4 shares have twice reached the mid $30s (in late 2017 and late 2018 respectively). The stock currently sits at just over $17 per share as we enter May 2019.In the time since my April 2015 article the stock is up about 40%. However, significantly more has happened both for Control4 and the industry in that time period. Control4 has seen its revenue double from just under $150M in 2015 to guidance of ~$300M in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA has almost tripled from $14M in 2014 to ~$40M in FY 2018. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 500 bps to 14.6% in FY 2018. Finally, and most importantly, the installed base of homes with Control4 systems has more than doubled from 180,000 homes at the end of 2014 to 385,000 homes at the end of 2018. One of the, if not the, most significant parts of the bullish thesis for Control4 is around the company's installed base and the ability to monetize that growing installed base in the future (which the market is ignoring from a valuation standpoint today). The market values Control4 entirely as a book to bill hardware business without any stickiness from its current installed base or opportunity for future product upgrades or bolt on software service offerings.I briefly noted above that the industry has evolved significantly since my original call on Control4 in 2015. Over that time, Amazon (AMZN) Alexa devices have dominated the market allowing a DIY solution for homeowners to take the first step in making their homes ""smart."" Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have both launched consumer devices and solutions in the smart home arena. Major manufacturers of smart doorbells, cameras, and security systems have exploded onto the scene. Ring, Nest, Blink and other smart home devices have been acquired by major players such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google. Voice control, primarily via Alexa, is still in its infancy but is conditioning consumers to speak to and control any electronic device in our homes over time.Almost every major home-builder today now offers a smart home as a standard feature in the homes they build. These homes are WiFi certified and come with the backbone of infrastructure built into the home allowing for scale and growth when it comes to connected and wireless devices.With the rapid change that has occurred in just the last few years there has been one thing that has not happened. The proliferation of devices and options for consumers has not relegated the professional installation market obsolete as many predicted. If anything, as consumers are bombarded with even more offerings and options the need for professional and integrated systems becomes more obvious. Thus, the success and growth evidenced in the results from Control4 since 2015.Technology is complicated and always has been. There is an assumption, which is completely incorrect, that smart devices such as Alexa, Apple Homekit, or Google will supplant the need for professionally designed and installed smart home systems.The majority of our lives is spent in our homes. Most people don't fix their plumbing, repair their electrical systems, install AC systems, or dig up cable lines themselves when the cable/internet goes out. Almost all of us drive cars. We put gas in our cars and air in the tires. But we don't service the engine, repair broken hoses and belts, or replace transmissions. We all use computers or iPads. When they give us the blue screen of death we don't open up the computer and repair software code or hard drives. We can go to the pharmacy and buy medicine over the counter for the common cold. When we can't get better we go to the doctor for diagnosis and treatment.The above logic on how we value service and service providers should hit home for most and form the foundation for why Control4 is a massive buy opportunity for investors: technology in our homes will require professional installation and support, potentially forever, and at least for many more years to come. As connected home devices proliferate consumers will place an increasing value on dedicated systems that can seamlessly integrate and manage these connected devices. For that reason, Control4 is massively undervalued as one of the few companies offering a platform for seamless integration with expert support.Investors need to understand 5 themes around the Control4 story to understand why the Stock can double in value (and then some)Shares of Control4 moved between $22 and $36 per share for the better part of 2017 and 2018. When the company reported earnings in early November 2018 it lowered its revenue outlook for Q418 and FY18. The company followed that up with a somewhat tepid outlook for Q119 and FY19 when guidance was given on the Q418 earnings call in February 2019.It's notable that during that same time period the Dow and S&P were in the midst of 15% corrections as seen below. Given how massive those corrections were, and that the target consumer for Control4 has a household income of over $150,000, it is not surprising that some business was pushed out into future periods.Nevertheless, the stock has been taken down primarily as a result of what the market is assuming to be a sustained business slow down. Additionally, the company guided for Operating Income/Adjusted EBITDA to be down in FY 2019 compared to FY 2018:The company called out a 60-70bps negative gross margin impact related to the tariffs imposed by the US on certain goods imported from China. Recall, that the US has implemented multiple rounds of tariffs on over $250B in goods imported from China dating back to 2018. The US had previously threatened to expand the tariff from 10% to 25% on $200B worth of goods with the increased rate going into effect on March 1, 2019. As the governments of the US and China are engaged in productive talks to end the trade war, the March 1 tariff increase was delayed.During the Q418 earnings call, the CFO said the following with regards to how the guidance from Control4 was modeled with regards to the tariffs:A follow-up exchange between an analyst and the CFO is shown below in which the CFO clarified that the tariffs not increasing to the 25% rate would be upside compared to the guidance provided by the company:As noted, the tariffs did not increase on March 1 which will provide upside to the company's profit guidance for 2019.Also slightly impacting Gross Margin guidance for 2019 is the impact of opening a new distribution center in the US that will allow for 2-day delivery for dealers. The company noted that pre-opening and costs to ramp up this new distribution center would impact 2019 before being a tailwind in the future.Control4 made an interesting acquisition of a company called NEEO in February 2019. More to come on NEEO later and how this acquisition will be a catalyst for a significant jump in 2020 revenue growth. In 2019, NEEO will be a drag on earnings with $3.5M in expenses and no revenue. Without the NEEO drag ($3.5M) and the impact of Tariffs ($2.1) the company would be growing operating earnings in 2019.All things being equal, it's understandable that the market did not like the guidance. A trip down memory lane with regards to the past financial performance and a deeper dive into the 2019 guidance and the NEEO acquisition provides context on why the current market reaction presents a huge buying opportunity.The table below provides the key data points from a financial standpoint over the last 5+ years for Control4:Control4 has an impressive track record of top-line growth, EBITDA margin expansion, and generating substantial cash flow from operations (as a % of market capitalization).With respect to the guidance in FY 2019 there are a few notable items.In summary with respect to guidance, the company is being extremely conservative, and it is likely investors will get the first guidance upgrade of the year during the May earnings call at least with regards to EPS due to tariff increases not yet being implemented.Continuing with the acquisition discussion, the company has used the significant cash flow from operations to buy back stock (limiting dilution from stock-based comp) and to make strategic acquisitions. From 2016 through 2018 almost $50M was spent on acquiring companies specializing in networking, cloud services, remote management, and premium audio speakers. Looking back at the table above you can see that the acquisitions in 2016/2017 corresponded to revenue growth of 28% and 17%, respectively. The average revenue growth in those two years surpassed the installed base growth bolstering the support for sell-through opportunities as the installed base continues to grow. New products equal new opportunities to upgrade or expand existing smart homes. The company was relatively quiet on the acquisition front in 2018 and the NEEO acquisition in early 2019 will likely not impact results until 2020. However, we have a road-map for what that impact will look like as previous acquisitions drove revenue growth to over 20% in the year following a major acquisition.The below pictures show the NEEO remote and a typical Control4 remote:Care to guess which remote is the one the company just acquired? If you guessed the black one on the bottom you are probably still one of the 5 people in the world still using a VCR.Control4 has lacked a visually appealing remote. The company's software works on tablets but nobody wants to hold an iPad to change the TV. The NEEO remote has the potential to be a device that almost every Control4 owner decides they need. If the company continues to increase its installed base at the rate seen in previous years there will be an installed base of almost 450,000 Control4 homes at the end of 2019.Previous acquisitions made by the company were more specialized (speakers, networking, cloud services). The company has a massive opportunity to sell a state of the art remote to its entire installed user base. The NEEO remote and hub (or brain as it was called) retailed for $299. Assuming that the $299 price was the Control4 MSRP, if just 25% of the Control4 installed base purchases 1 remote for their home, the company would see a $33M revenue lift in 2020 from just remote sales. Large custom homes would certainly require more than 1 remote and it is not hard to see the opportunity for this acquisition to materially move the needle for the company.The Street is currently modeling 10% revenue growth for FY 2020. I would confidently project that Control4 will continue to see at a minimum its 10% organic growth, and with the launch of a new remote, would likely see another $30M+ in revenue for total growth that would approach 20% in FY 2020. The average analyst price target on Control4 is at $29 per share (compared to a $17 price for the stock currently) with models assuming 10% revenue growth for 2020. As the company's plans for the NEEO remote come into focus, the analyst community will in turn come to ratchet up 2020 guidance and price targets.Charlie Kindel/Amazon AlexaIn mid-2018, without much fanfare outside of the home automation industry, Control4 hired Charlie Kindel to be the SVP of Product and Services. Typically an SVP hire is no big deal, but in this case, Control4 hired the guy that ""created, led, and grew Amazon's Alexa Smart Home division"" as noted in the press release. Charlie had previously spent over 20 years at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) working with the Windows Phone and other consumer applications. This hire has been mentioned by analysts but is largely flying under the radar. Why would the guy who ran Alexa, without a doubt the most successful smart home gadget on the market, leave to come work for Control4? Why would he choose to commute from his home in Washington each week to work at the Control4 headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah? Martin Plaehn, the CEO of Control4, had this to say about Charlie on the Q2 2018 earnings call when discussing the hire:I continue to think back to the bearish argument that Control4 is a hardware company. Nothing in the above comment about why Charlie was hired speaks to hardware. Control4 may not yet get credit for being a software company with a massive installed base but the time is coming.Time will tell why exactly Charlie left Amazon. His own personal blog and experiences give a glimpse as he talks about being tired of the DIY model with regards to true home automation. When the guy who ran the Amazon Alexa program jumps ship to work for the company the bears think Amazon will put out of business, it would be prudent to stop and take note. I would also point out that the proxy statement this year noted that Charlie specifically negotiated for an automatic vesting of all time vested RSUs/Stock Options in the event of a change in control. Typically, and as is the case for the CEO of Control4, automatic vesting only occurs in a two-step process with both a change in control and the loss of a job. Inquiring minds want to wonder if Charlie was just a great negotiator or if he has a gut feeling for how this plays out (i.e., Control4 getting acquired and Charlie wanting the option to decide to stay or go and get paid either way!)Control4 management, on conference calls and at investor events, consistently talks about a deep partnership with the Amazon Alexa team. The engineers at Control4 and on the Alexa team speak on a weekly basis. Do you think Amazon would rather an Echo in the room of my 5-year-old or multiple Alexa enabled devices in custom homes providing voice control for rich people? It's pretty clear that Amazon sees Control4 as a partner, and given the demographic of the core Control4 customer, it should not surprise anyone that Amazon values this relationship.If I had to make a prediction on this front I would predict one of two things:Those are my personal predictions reading the tea leaves. I would be more confident in the prediction of Charlie as the next CEO. The Amazon acquisition would make sense as well. The Control4 system and penetration into affluent households would pay for itself in any number of ways. The ability to leverage the 5,000+ dealers for Control4 and other expert install service would also fit nicely with the Amazon model. The company made one if its largest acquisitions ever when it purchased Ring for over $1B in 2018.Homebuilder ProgramControl4 began working directly with national and regional homebuilders in early 2018 to make their products standard in the homes built by these companies. In connection with this effort, in early 2018 the company launched an entry-level product that retailed for $350. This controller was targeted for more of a single room application (i.e., thermostat, doorbell, security system). It provided the perfect opportunity to begin to penetrate the new home market and build the overall install base. Management has noted on multiple earnings calls how the revenue impact from the base offering in a production home is not going to move the needle dramatically. However, the install base and opportunity for future upgrades and service offerings is the real value of offering a more affordable product.On the Q3 2018 earnings call, the CEO noted that over 25 builders were now offering Control4 products as standard features representing 9,000 new homes being built on an annual basis. The CFO noted during the March 2019 Cowan investor conference that the number of builders had increased to over 30 builders (7:40 mark within webcast) and now represented between 10,000 and 20,000 annual new home closings that Control4 could potentially serve. In a short period of time, between earnings calls and not widely reported, the company rapidly expanded its builder partners. Based on the increased outlook for annual home closings compared to adding just 5 more builders, it is likely at least one large builder partner has been added.The builder partner growth will be an important metric to watch going forward given that it was just launched in Q118. The production builder partnership has the potential to push the install base materially higher.Certified Dealer ShowroomsIn May of 2018 Control4 launched its Certified Showroom program with dealers both in the US and internationally. The initial launch included 140 dealers and as of the March 2019 Cowan conference, over 200 dealers were operating Certified Showrooms with 50 more in the process of opening up.This program is still relatively new. When you consider the time needed for a consumer to decide on a large scale or custom smart home project, design it, order the equipment, and complete the install one can understand how the benefit of these showrooms is not yet baked into the company's results. Control4 is putting some weight behind this program in terms of prominently featuring Certified Showroom dealers when consumers search the Control4 website. Other aspects of this program ensure that consumers will have an ""experience"" with the push of one button driving multiple smart home interactions. When potential home buyers purchase a home, new or resale, they tour the home and touch and feel it. The ability to see what you are buying is paramount in the home buying process. The same can be said for a large scale smart home project. Being able to see a showroom, modeled as various rooms in a house, will drive greater penetration and sales.The company has noted that the revenue growth rate from Certified Showroom dealers is significantly higher than other dealers. With over 5,000 dealers the opportunity to expand the program (and drive brand loyalty from dealers) is immense.If you read a bearish argument on Control4 it usually begins and ends with the company offering a niche product and a target addressable market much smaller than what the company espouses. There are dozens available on Seeking Alpha for your viewing pleasure. There are almost 19M homes in the US with a household income of over $150,000 and for years Control4 has noted this is the company's target market. Control4 has penetrated 1.6% of this market in the US.While the company has not publicly stated a shift in its target addressable market, there are signs this is occurring behind the scenes. One example is the production home program where the total revenue to the company from the product install might only be $500 per house as described by the CFO in the March investor presentation. The company currently shows the following graphic as part of its Q418 earnings presentation:It then transitions to the following graphic which shows the average revenue per customer:In a 2016 investor presentation found here, the company noted that the average revenue from a single room installation was $4,500. Fast forward to 2018 and the average revenue for a Starter project is $1,000. The company does not clearly say it but we can easily infer that a Starter project is similar to a single room installation. Further, almost 50% of the company's revenue as of 2018 now comes from either Starter or Value projects that range from $1,000 to $2,000. Why is this important? Because the TAM for Control4 is increasing. You don't need a $150K household income to do a $1,000 or $2,000 smart home project. The bearish argument does not give credit to Control4 for offering more affordable product, increasing its value proposition, continuing to grow revenue, expanding its TAM, and most importantly rapidly growing the installed base.If the bears were willing to give credit to a larger addressable argument they would quickly pivot back to the argument that Control4 offers a commodity that consumers don't need. That the DIY gadgets offered by Amazon, Google, and countless others will render Control4 obsolete. If that argument was not yet settled by the Amazon Alexa head leaving to join Control4 then let me offer additional evidence.Over 1M new homes are built in the US every year. 2018 is the year that ""smart homes"" went mainstream with regards to new construction. The largest builders including D. R. Horton (NYSE:DHI), Lennar (NYSE:LEN), Pulte (NYSE:PHM), and KB Home (NYSE:KBH) all rolled out smart home initiatives. These builders have over a 10% market share for all new homes in the US and as they go so goes the industry. It is now an expectation that a new production home is a ""smart home."" The definition of ""smart"" differs for each builder. Some include doorbells, Alexa devices, thermostats, and more. Others have even more basic programs or on the high end more elaborate ala carte offerings.There are two commonalities with regards to new homes and how they are being made to be smart. The first is that the homes must be WiFi certified. The backbone of infrastructure with regards to wiring, outlets, WiFi routers, and other infrastructure needed to support a connected home is now included. Almost all builders now highlight homes designed to ensure there are no dead spots with regard to WiFi signals.The second commonality is ""white glove"" installation or service. What this means, in a nutshell, is that the builders realize that simply handing you keys to your smart home and saying ""good luck"" would be a complete failure. The offerings from Pulte, DR Horton, KB Home, and Lennar all feature professional white glove service post closing. Said another way, a dealer or low voltage company which installed the smart home products will meet you at your home and explain how to use the smart products after you move in.The homebuilders are the canary in the coal mine, so to speak, with regards to the debate over DIY or Professional install for smart homes. Experts and analysts can pontificate all they want but the companies that build new homes are unequivocal in stating that professional set-up and service is required. Think about that. The plumber does not meet you after you buy your house to show you how the plumbing works. Nor does the roofer, the flooring installer, or the appliance manufacturer. But you will receive professional support related to your connected home. Open and shut. Case closed. Professional install and support is a foundation of smart homes.This article highlighting a panel discussion of large production builders' executives is a must read with regards to the need for professional installation and support for smart home products. Some of the best quotes are:From the KB Home executive:From the DR Horton executive:Those are pretty powerful quotes and in my mind the bears can argue all they want that DIY will supplant the professional install market. It might happen in the distant future but it is hard to see how. Most people can't get their Alexa to work seamlessly every day. The pace of technological innovation will continue to be frenetic and as one generation of technology is mastered the next will be breaking onto the scene. Hence the importance of an infrastructure and system that can scale like Control4.When I read analyst reports about Control4 I never read about the installed base. Nip, zilch, nada. I understand the importance of quarterly and annual growth and that is how Wall St. is valuing a company like Control4. You absolutely need to judge this company, like any other, on top-line revenue growth and profitability. I think it's ridiculous that Control4 trades at 1.3 EV/Revenue valuation but I will save that for the closing argument.If you leave with nothing else from the thesis leave with this. The installed base of homes with Control4 hardware is the company's greatest asset. Every additional home that is added to the installed base is an additional potential referral for another customer. People move from starter homes to larger homes and back to smaller homes over the course of their lives. Millennials want to do everything different including expecting to live in their current home for less than 5 years. Each time a homeowner moves that creates an additional opportunity for a new owner to be wowed by a connected home and the existing owner to start with a new system in their new home.Consumers are creatures of habit. How often do you change your cell phone provider, cable provider, grocery store, or even barber? On a more comparable front, how many iPhone users are thinking about switching to Android (or vice versa). If you drive a Ford your probably aren't thinking you really want a Kia out of the blue. Consumers desire consistency and a lack of complexity. An integrated smart home system that is working flawlessly is going to be the last thing a consumer wants to ditch to try something new. Control4 is creating an extremely sticky install base and has not even scratched the surface on how to monetize this installed base.Some key examples:The other obvious example is services. Currently, Control4 offers a subscription service called 4Sight which does a number of things including mobile remote access to your home, voice integration with Alexa, and the ability to do simple custom programming changes after the dealer install has happened. This service costs $100 per year. The company began to really market the service offering in 2017 along with the ability for consumers to renew electronically and auto-renew (previously dealers had to handle the renewal). 4Sight subscribers grew to 71,000 (30% YoY growth) in 2018 but still represented less than 20% of the total install base.Management has been coy about the impact of 4Sight and the related financial impact. We know that dealers receive $20 of the $100 subscription for every renewal. It is likely then that the EBITDA margin profile is somewhere north of 50% after taking into account cloud hosting costs and other maintenance costs for the service. With 71,000 subscribers 4Sight is generating just over $7M in revenue on an annualized basis for the company. At an assumed 50% EBITDA margin profile 4Sight would have generated just over $3.5M in EBITDA for 2018 (annualized). This subscription service could have generated just 2.5% of the company's revenue but almost 9% of its total EBITDA using the above assumptions.Herein lies the massive opportunity. With only a 20% penetration of the installed base the ability to scale 4Sight starts with the 80% of Control4 users not yet subscribing. You can bet your bottom dollar that any innovation associated with a NEEO remote offering will feature voice control, and wait for it, the need for a 4Sight subscription to take advantage of all functionalities offered and specifically voice control via Alexa.I would passionately argue that once again analysts are completely missing the freight train coming down the tracks in the form of a massive lift in high margin software revenue. As Control4 approaches an install base of almost 450,000 homes in 2019, if the company could capture just 50% penetration with the 4Sight service, it would generate over $11M in recurring EBITDA (225,000 x $100 x 50% = $11.25M). The path to a large, on a relative basis, recurring software income stream is right in front of our noses and I believe it will happen much sooner than the market is anticipating.4Sight is the company's current SaaS offering but it is likely not the last. I would refer back to the quote on why Charlie Kindel was hired and how it was about everything software, services, cloud, and nothing about hardware. We have likely just scratched the surface with regards to software or service offerings that could be offered in the future.Every investor should look at any opportunity and understand the risks. With Control4, the existential risk to the investment thesis is that a company creates a device that truly integrates all smart home gadgets at the push of the button. The complexity required to do that, given the tens of thousands of smart home devices from different manufacturers, is slim.The death by a thousand cuts risk is that consumer adoption of smart home devices slows. It could be concerns over privacy, concerns of artificial intelligence, or other concerns that cause consumers to forgo adopting this technology. There are not many instances in the US history of where technological innovation was ignored by consumers and it is hard to believe that would happen in the smart home space.Finally, a new competitor could emerge and disrupt the business model. Control4 is making 50% margins selling its products to dealers. The company has noted that dealers are making 40% margins selling to consumers. These products and the installation of them are extremely profitable throughout the manufacturing and distribution stream. These levels of profits invite competition. Growing the installed base rapidly and grabbing market share is the greatest way to fend off future competition which is the strategy Control4 is embarking on.From a margin of safety standpoint, the company has proven to be smart with the significant cash flow generated each year. It is reinvested back into accretive acquisitions and at times to offset stock based compensation dilution. With strong cash flow generation, no long-term debt, and cash equaling almost 20% of the company's market cap, Control4 is set up to weather short-term market gyrations.Control4 sits at the epicenter of a rapidly expanding market, full of complexity and gadgets, and provides consumers an affordable offering to truly live in a smart home.If everything until now makes sense the question is obviously what is the market missing. A few observations:The question then becomes how do you value Control4 and what is the catalyst for the stock to trade higher. I would first remind everyone that this was a $36-stock at multiple points in 2017 and 2018 compared to the $17 level now. The only difference was the revenue growth rate was slightly higher. As I have pointed out, I think the installed base growth rate is more important than revenue growth, and the installed base grew at 17% in 2018. I also believe the company will launch an innovative remote control as a result of the NEEO acquisition. We will likely begin to get some insight into this over the next few months and hopefully a full scale launch at the annual CEDIA Expo in September 2019. During the Cowen analyst presentation in March the CFO noted that new innovative product would be announced in the Q2/Q3 time-frame. 2020 analyst revenue models expect 10% growth, which is the company's organic growth target. If Control4 drops an innovative product as I suspect, that has heavy sell-through to the installed base, revenue could easily grow 20% in 2020. If product innovation drives 4Sight adoption then both the top and bottom line could blow past estimates.A simple approach to highlight the valuation disconnect is to compare Control4 to Alarm.com (NASDAQ:ALRM) as shown below:Alarm.com is receiving a massive premium because the bulk of its revenue is via a SaaS subscription revenue model primarily focused on home monitoring/security services.There are similarities in the businesses. Both use third-party dealers to install the equipment and as the point of contact with the customer. Both recognize that professional installation is required to ensure complex systems function properly.Alarm.com truly does have a larger addressable market than Control4. However, the two companies' growth rates with regards to revenue/EBITDA and the comparable amount of cash generated by the respective businesses do not warrant Control4 being valued at an 80% discount to Alarm.com.The comparison of Control4 and Alarm.com is given primarily to show the disconnect in valuation. 70% of Alarm.com revenue comes from software and services. Less than 5% of Control4 revenue comes from software and services. There should be a disconnect to an extent. At the same time, Control4 is generating significantly higher gross margin from its hardware offerings and has the ability to materially scale its software revenue over time.Control4 should be valued on a combination of its organic growth opportunity, potential sell-through to the installed base, and the growth in service revenue. As noted, the 2020 forward outlook from analysts assumes a flat 10% revenue growth in their consensus estimates. This is simply not going to be the case. The model below provides a bridge from 2018 to 2020 in terms of what the revenue growth trajectory for Control4 could look like:The model starts with what the company has provided us. 2018 actual results come from the annual report with 4Sight subscribers being provided as part of the Q418 earnings call. The guidance for 2019 was provided as part of the Q418 earnings call as well. The Installed Base and 4Sight subscribers for 2019 were assumed to be at a constant growth rate as that achieved in 2018.What analysts are completely missing is the outlook for 2020. My fundamental assumptions for 2020 are shown below and referenced above:The above assumptions are derived from facts laid out throughout the thesis. If the thesis plays out close to what I have modeled above, Control4 will drive revenue growth of 25% in FY20 and EBITDA will approach $60M. The company has proven, as it did in 2016 and 2017, that it can rapidly grow revenues via bolt-on acquisitions that can be sold through to the installed base. Projecting a revenue increase in line with what the company achieved the last time it made a major acquisition, with an installed base that is now double in size feels very conservative.For the better part of 2018 prior to reducing its revenue guidance Control4 shares traded between a 10-20x Forward EV/EBITDA multiple as seen below:The investor community is going to wake up shortly and begin to look past the blip on the radar that is 2019 and into 2020. When they do, they could see a company that is going to re-accelerate growth to north of 20% and push adjusted EBIDTA to almost $60M in 2020.I would expect shares of Control4 to begin to re-rate higher as the strategy comes into focus. The stock has previously front-run expectations for future growth, and these false starts in the stock price leave us the opportunity we have today. The below table provides forward EV/EBITDA multiples at various stock targets:I see shares of Control4 returning to $35 per share, which could be greater than 100% gain from where the stock trades today. At a 14.3 forward EV/EBITDA multiple, Control4 would trade at the low end of its range prior to reducing revenue guidance for 2019 and at a 60% discount to Alarm.com.I don't view the potential for shares of Control4 to double as a multi-year story. I view this as a 2019 story and one that will happen as soon as the cat gets let out of the bag with regards to the company's plans for NEEO and monetizing its installed base through innovation and software offerings.If history is a guide by the time the company tells us exactly what we need to know, the smart money will have already made the easy money.Longer term, as I have noted, where there is smoke there is fire with regards to a deep integration with the Amazon Alexa team and the ability to continue growing and monetizing a sticky installed base. Control4 has a seat at the table in a market that will approach $80B over the next few years and has the potential to continue growing at a rapid pace for years to come.

4263645,102796,2019-05-13T18:28:55-04:00,Control4 is worth way more than the $23.91 a share their acquirer is offering.Even a legal firm has taken notice and is investigating the board for violating fiduciary standards.What may happen from here?,"Control4 (CTRL), a smart home automation company, has been on my watch list for a few months. I was rather shocked when I woke up one morning last week to see that their share price had jumped 40% in an instant, from ~$17 to almost $24. Of course, they announced that they were being acquired.As I read up on the announcement and dug into the details of the transaction, I was further surprised to see that the takeover price was only $23.91 per share. While I hadn't conducted any extensive due diligence yet, I was familiar enough with their fundamental and technical history to know that the price was way too low and for a variety of reasons. My intent today is to explain why I think shareholders should absolutely vote no on the acquisition and exercise their ownership rights to keep Control4 out of the hands of anyone unwilling to pay what they are worth.I am not the one on Seeking Alpha to re-hash what others have already recently stated. If I am going to write an article, I want to bring something fresh to the table. With that, I will refer all readers now to this article by Money Investor who wrote a very thorough article on CTRL that explains their past growth and their future opportunity for expansion. Their article was even given a ""top idea"" designation and, coincidentally, was published the day that CTRL announced the takeover. In short, CTRL has established themselves as a leader in the smart home automation space and has achieved fantastic growth since their IPO five years ago but still has a tremendous runway for growth ahead of them. They have grown revenue and earnings at a double-digit rate and have become increasingly profitable, with an addressable market that is expected to reach $80 billion annually by 2023.If they aren't worth the $23.91 that their acquirer, SnapAV, is willing to buy them at, then what are they worth? I don't think it is necessary to pinpoint a specific figure in order to objectively say that the $23.91 is too low, especially considering where CTRL has traded in very recent history. At the end of 2017 and again at the end of 2018, CTRL was trading in the mid-$30s.Data by YChartsNow, I get it. Sentiment can certainly swing wildly, especially for a tech company. But to have that high of a price in their very recent past and then to be valued by an outside organization way below that threshold when nothing significant in their fundamentals has changed in the meantime is silly. This is a company that has had explosive growth, recently recruited top talent (the man that headed Amazon Alexa), is rapidly expanding their installed base, has zero debt, and recently announced a share repurchase program.So, let's get into the numbers a bit more. While I am not familiar enough with CTRL to run a detailed DCF analysis, I can run a simple EPS growth capitalization to ballpark what they are worth. Since 2013, CTRL has grown earnings at a rate of 58%. While I don't think that they can grow things that fast in the next five years, it is safe to assume that they can at least grow earnings by 10% annually given their execution thus far and their addressable market. If their P/E ratio at that time falls in line with the current index average of about 20, then that would yield a share price of $51. Now, we can pick among several required rates of return to discount that back to today for a present value. Let's go with 15%, which is pretty high. That would give us a share price of $25.62, a 7% premium to what SnapAV is willing to pay. We can even fiddle with all these values to paint a clearer picture of how low SnapAV is valuing the company:I chose the EPS growth rates because I think those are reasonable ranges for a small growth company like CTRL (it is also feasible that CTRL could handily crush those numbers). I chose those P/E values because they represent CTRL current P/E (15), their five-year average P/E (47) minus a bunch to be conservative, and the current P/E for the S&P index (20). I selected 10%, 12%, and 15% as required rates of return because those would all beat the long-term historical average of the index as measured by the S&P. In every case, CTRL is worth more than $23.91.But what do other people think? According to MarketScreener, the price target among the 9 analysts that follow CTRL is $25.9, an 8% premium to the SnapAV valuation.Furthermore, this takeover bid is so woefully undervaluing CTRL that it has garnered the attention of Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., who is investigating the board of directors of Control4 for allegedly ""violat(ing) the federal securities laws and/or breach(ing) their fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders by failing to conduct a fair process and whether and by how much the proposed transaction undervalues the Company."" While I don't know much about Bragar Eagel & Squire, I know that they don't mess around. They are currently conducting cases against or investigating some heavy hitters to include AT&T, Apple, Boeing, CenturyLink, Nordstrom, and Johnson & Johnson.The good news is that CTRL has a 30-day ""go-shop"" period ""during which period the Company Board and the Company's financial advisor are permitted to actively initiate, solicit, and encourage alternative acquisition proposals from third parties and to provide information to, and participate in discussions and engage in negotiations with, third parties regarding any alternative acquisition proposals"".So, CTRL can (and should) look for a better deal elsewhere. If no better deal arises, the deal will go through later this year.The fact that the board of directors even accepted this deal makes me sour on the whole company. The board of directors is responsible for making sure stockholders get treated well. By this agreement, they have shown they are unwilling to do that.If you are a CTRL stockholder, exercise your ownership rights and vote no. While the 40% gain overnight is certainly appealing for a short-term standpoint, don't forego long-term compounding gains for a quick buck. The only other idea I will float is that if the Board of Directors is so pessimistic on the future prospects of the company that they are willing to sell it for a sigh, maybe they are aware of things that should make current or prospective stockholders weary. No doubt, it is a complicated situation. Frankly, I am grateful I don't have skin in the game."
4100979,103596,2017-08-22T12:38:00-04:00,"Control4's non-GAAP consensus EPS estimates are currently untaxed (or partially taxed) due to a valuation allowance against their domestic net operating loss (NOL).Since CTRL is profitable, the NOL will either be utilized over time or management may be compelled to remove the valuation allowance.Either way, utilization of the NOL or removal of the valuation allowance could cut analyst target prices by ~30%, all else equal, due to application of statutory federal tax rate.In turn, when factoring taxes, the P/E multiple is higher than most realize.","Control4 Corp (CTRL) appears to be a controversial stock. The bulls like it because of leverage to secular growth in the home automation market. The bears believe it’s about to be disrupted by Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), among others, with their popular do-it-yourself devices/connectivity, and it seems every week these companies are introducing new features to make their consumer appeal stronger, all at much lower price points (and without Control4's dealer installation). However, this article is not going to address either of the bull/bear debates, but rather focus on analytical and valuation errors by sell-side analysts around the company’s NOL, which I estimate overstates consensus EPS estimates, and in turn, target prices, by ~30%, all else equal. So what are sell-side analysts doing wrong?Simply put, most sell-side analysts are valuing CTRL on untaxed EPS, all while adding back untaxed intangible amortization and stock-based compensation. This makes little sense, in my opinion, as either the domestic NOLs will be utilized over the next few years or the company may remove the current valuation allowance against its domestic net deferred tax asset. In turn, by setting a price target based on a P/E multiple applied to untaxed EPS, analysts are effectively capitalizing the tax benefit despite it having a finite life (meaning sometime in the future, CTRL will be a federal tax payer). A quick accounting note: by having a valuation allowance, the benefits of the NOL are being recognized as a reduction to income tax expense on the income statement, causing CTRL to have an immaterial amount of income tax expense (or sometimes even a tax benefit). Let’s take the analysis a little deeper. Per CTRL’s June 30, 2017, 10-Q filing:Below is the section from the 10-Q substantiating the above, as shown on pages 16-17, located here (EDGAR Filing Documents for 0001558370-17-005930):Income tax expense was $0.2 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, or approximately 6% and 24% of income (loss) before income taxes, respectively. Income tax benefit was $2.5 million and $9.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, or approximately 115% and 362% of income (loss) before income taxes, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 34% primarily due to the domestic valuation allowance offsetting most of the statutory rate, offset by the partial reversal of the Company’s valuation allowance due to the deferred tax liability that was recorded as part of the Triad acquisition, primarily due to the differences between the book and tax basis of the acquired intangible assets. The rate is further increased by foreign income taxes, state income taxes or taxes in states for which net operating loss carryforwards are not available, the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and the impact of incentive stock options as well as other permanent differences. As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s NOL carryforward amounts for U.S. federal income and state tax purposes were $59.5 million and $61.0 million, respectively. The NOL carryforwards will expire between 2017 and 2034. In addition to the NOL carryforwards, as of December 31, 2016, the Company had U.S. federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of $7.1 million and $2.8 million, respectively, which will expire between 2017 and 2034.Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s provision for income taxes, recording valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and evaluating the Company’s uncertain tax positions. In evaluating the ability to recover its deferred tax assets, in full or in part, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Due to historical net losses incurred and the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax assets, for all the periods presented, the Company has a full valuation allowance against domestic deferred tax assets. To the extent that the Company generates positive income and expects, with reasonable certainty, to continue to generate positive domestic income, the Company may release the valuation allowance in a future period. This release would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets, resulting in a decrease to income tax expense for the period such release is made. In addition, the effective tax rate in subsequent periods would increase, and more closely approximate the federal statutory rate of 34%, after giving consideration to state income taxes, foreign income taxes, tax credits, the effect of stock-based compensation windfalls or shortfalls, and exercising incentive stock options.What’s bizarre, in my view, is the way sell-side analysts are treating the NOL because it’s unusual for analysts to derive price targets based on paying little to no taxes, instead of being a full tax payer. In most cases, the present value of the NOL is valued separately, because it’s finite in length, and not capitalized using a price to earnings multiple, with the latter approach taken by most analysts.  CTRL’s statutory federal income tax rate is 34% (per page 16 of the June 30, 2017, 10-Q filing). Applying the 34% tax rate to the $59.5m in federal NOL yields a value of approximately $21m, which theoretically would need to be discounted for the time value. My ""corporate finance 101"" class in college tells me this federal NOL may be worth around $1 per CTRL share. Analysts seems to be implying its worth $6-$7 per share assuming a ~20x P/E.This will play out in one of two ways. First, based on future profits and/or improvement in profitability, the NOL will be utilized over time. For reference, below are the amounts of the declining federal NOL over time, which should accelerate given the improvement in gross margin and operating income in 2017:2013: $77.4m2014: $85.6m2015: $78.1m2016: $59.5mThe second way it could play out is the company could reverse the valuation allowance (which is a reasonable possibility given management's forecast of future market growth and future earnings), causing the effective tax rate to increase in subsequent periods closer to the federal statutory rate of 34%. Either way, both are likely negative outcomes for analyst’s P/E based price targets on untaxed EPS. Of the seven sell-side analysts who cover CTRL, five are basing their targets using a price to earnings multiple and one is using a DCF approach.Another area worth pointing out is that a large percentage of CTRL’s net income is derived through add-backs of stock-based compensation and intangible amortization, both of which are untaxed. Per the company’s reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in the 2Q17 press release (located here: Control4 Reports Financial Results for the Second Quarter of 2017 (NASDAQ:CTRL)), CTRL’s non-GAAP net income during the first six months of 2017 totaled $11.464m, or $0.44 per diluted share, with $6.163m from (untaxed) stock-based compensation expense and $2.551m from amortization. Here, the stock-based compensation and intangible amortization add-backs account for 76% of non-GAAP net income. Likewise during 2016, non-GAAP net income totaled $20.643m, of which $8.37m and $4.598m came from stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangibles, respectively. As a result, CTRL’s stock-based compensation is resulting in meaningful dilution to stockholders, as the 1H17 weighted average diluted share count of 26.024m is nearly 9% greater than the comparable 23.958m shares in the 1H16.Also interesting to note is that non-GAAP net income during the first six months of 2017 ($11.464m) exceeds non-GAAP operating income ($11.142m). It's unusual that net income exceeds operating income, in my experience.Hypothetically, if CTRL’s non-GAAP operating income were tax affected at the statutory federal rate of 34%, the resulting non-GAAP EPS would total $0.28 ($11.142m x (1-34% tax rate), divided by 26.024m) instead of $0.44. Lastly, let’s review free cash flow followed by valuation.2016 free cash flow, defined as cash from operating activities ($17.866m) less purchases of property and equipment ($2.862m) totaled $15.2 million. The $15.2 million of FCF is 26% below the 2016 non-GAAP net income of $20.643m. Similarly, free cash flow for the first six months of 2017 (cash flow from operations of $8.826m less purchases of property and equipment of $1.618m) totaled $7.2m while non-GAAP net income totaled $11.464, or 37% less. CTRL is currently trading at 23.5x consensus 2017 EPS, calculated using the 8/21/17 closing price of $24.44 and the 2017 consensus EPS estimate of $1.04 shown here (CTRL Analyst Opinion | Analyst Estimates | Control4 Corporation Stock - Yahoo Finance). However, this is misleading in my opinion as the consensus EPS estimates factor little to no taxes. Adjusting for the federal statutory tax rate of 34%, I estimate the consensus EPS would drop to around $0.70 per share, and the P/E multiple on this basis increases to 35x. I believe this is a lofty valuation multiple should Amazon and Google solutions become popular with more upscale buyers or consumers balk at paying for higher priced Control4 controllers and dealer installation costs. If analyst sharpened their pencils around the NOL and deferred tax asset, they would see their targets, most of which are based on untaxed EPS estimates, are overstated by around 30%, all else equal.Where could I be wrong with the above tax analysis? First, if the Trump administration lowers the federal tax rate, then sell-side EPS and targets would of course be less overstated. However, even if the federal statutory rate declines to 25%, this still represents a material amount of downside, in my view. Second, sell-side analysts could artificially increase their target P/E multiples to compensate for application of taxes in the future. The consensus target on CTRL is $24.83 (with a range of $22 to $28) currently, therefore implying a 24x target P/E multiple on consensus 2017 non-GAAP EPS of $1.04 (which as we've discussed, reflects little to no tax applied). Theoretically, analysts could justify their current price targets by saying CTRL is worth ~35x taxed EPS (calculated using the $24.83 consensus divided by ~$0.70 tax-adjusted EPS). However, such a change would just ultimately highlight what I see as an elevated valuation for the stock."
4046362,92146,2017-02-15T14:33:27-05:00,"In Q4 2016, CTRL posted a record $57.4 million quarterly revenue and a $208.8% Annual Revenue for 2016.CTRL posted an annual net income of $12.95 million in 2016 compared to -$1.65 million net loss in 2015.During Q4 2016, CTRL experienced strong demand and managed to ship 28,000 EA Series controllers, which represents a 16% growth compared to Q3 2016.As CTRL strengthened and scaled their dealer sales and support services during 2016, it would likely contribute to further growth throughout 2017 as well as in 2018.On February 14, 2017, Imperial Capital upgraded the price target for CTRL to $16 per share, which offers secondary investors an additional 7.24% upside potential.","Figure 1: Year-to-Date, Control4 Corp's Stock Price Has Gone Up by 45.49%Since releasing Q4 2016 and full-year 2016 earnings, Control4 Corp.'s (NASDAQ:CTRL) stock price has increased to $15.46 per share, and currently, it is trading at $14.92 per share, which represents a 45.49% increase since the start of 2016.The strong bullish momentum was accelerated after Control4 Corp posted record quarterly revenue in Q4 2016. However, the bulk of the optimism behind the bullishness seems to have come from the $12.95 million annual net income posted in 2016.We believe the company's growth strategy has paid off in 2016 and the momentum would continue in 2017 and beyond.On February 14, 2017, Imperial Capital reiterated the price target for Control4 Corp to $16 per share, and based on the current market price of $14.92 per share - it offers an additional 7.24% upside potential to secondary investors.Takeaway from Control4's Q4 2016 Financial PerformanceFigure 2: Control4 Corp's Quarterly Revenue Has More Than Doubled in the Last Five-Year PeriodOn February 9, 2017, Control4 Corp released its Q4 2016 financial results which showed the company had earned a record $57.4 million revenue. Compared to $42.9 million revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015, it represented a 33.8% increase in the top line of the company. On the other hand, Control4 Corp posted a $208.8 million annual revenue for 2016, which came out 27.94% higher compared the 2015 annual revenue of $163.2 million.Figure 3: Compared to $1.65 Million Net Loss in 2015, in 2016, Control4 Corp Posted an Annual Net Income of $12.95 MillionBesides posting a record quarterly revenue in Q4 2016, Control4 Corp also managed to earn $4.01 million net income, where in Q4 2015, they posted a net loss of $0.65 million. In fact, the annual net income for 2016 came out at $12.95 million, where in 2015 the annual net loss was around $1.65 million.Figure 4: Control4 Corp's Gross Profit Margin Improved to 51.51% in Q4 2016Last time Control4 Corp managed to maintain a gross profit margin above 50% was in Q4 2015, which sharply declined to around 48% in Q1 2016. However, over the last three quarters, Control4 Corp managed to improve their gross profit margin, and in Q4 2016, it came out at 51.51%. With a fabulous top line growth, the increasing gross profit margin was the key reason they managed to post a $4.01 million net revenue in Q4 2016.ConclusionDuring the Q4 2016 earnings call, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Control4 Corp, Martin Plaehn, mentioned that the $57.4 million revenue was $1.9 million higher than their guidance range. We also learned from him that there was strong demand for their automation platform and Control4 Corp managed to ship over 28,000 EA Series controllers during Q4 2016.Because of the high demand, Control4 Corp's balance sheet was strengthened as their inventory level declined. As a result, Control4 Corp's cash and investment balance grew to $61.9 million as at the end of Q4 2016, nearly $10 million higher compared to the $52.1 million in early November 2016.Besides the solid financial performance and record top line growth, we were delighted to learn that Control4 Corp was recognized as the top home automation brand among the CE Pro 100 highest revenue home technology integrators for the second straight year in 2016.We are optimistic that Control4 Corp will be able to continue their growth momentum in 2017 as they strengthened and scaled their dealer sales and support services during 2016, which we believe, will contribute to further growth throughout 2017, as well as in 2018.Therefore, we recommend that secondary investors consider increasing their exposure to Control4 Corp, as there is a strong possibility that the stock price will continue to travel north in the next few quarters and reach around $16 per share."
4240733,57222,2019-02-13T16:12:43-05:00,Control4 missed on 4th quarter revenue estimates and its stock price declined based on the cautious outlook given by Martin Plaehn.Martin Plaehn's cautious outlook was based on a weak macro environment. This can be seen in the weakened consumer sentiment and the recent NY Fed January Survey of Consumer expectations.Further evidence of a weak and uncertain macro environment can be seen in the expected GDP decline and the potential for rates to be raised twice in 2019.,"Control4 Corporation (CTRL) had 4th quarter EPS totals beat Wall Street estimates by posting quarterly earnings of $0.44 EPS. This topped Zacks' consensus prediction of $0.43 per share and outpaced last year’s estimate of $0.40 per share. While Control4 Corporation’s streak pales in comparison to the amazing streaks of NBA stars James Harden and Russell Westbrook, 4 straight quarters of outpacing EPS estimates is not a bad accomplishment.However, investors were not pleased with the company’s miss on 4th quarter revenue. The company reported record fourth-quarter revenue totals of $72.487 million. While this was a increase of nearly 6.5% year over year, it fell short of Wall Street expectations. In particular, the revenue total missed the Zacks consumer estimate by 0.78%.Control4 Corporation is a leading source of personalized control and automation services. It is keen on its efforts to gain footing in the IoT space through its mission of giving individuals control of any and all devices in their homes. The firm is an industry leader in terms of interoperability. Just recently, Control 4 was named the top whole-home automation brand in CEPRO Brand analysis. This allowed Control4 Corporation to secure its place as the top brand in terms of whole house automation for a fourth consecutive year.In spite of a record year in terms of revenue and net income, Control4’s share price fell dramatically when the company delivered a cautious outlook for 2019. Control4 CEO Martin Plaehn based the company’s conservative estimates on the increased economic uncertainty that has surfaced through the consumer product sector. In his view, the market performance and sentiment of Q4 2018 was a stark contrast compared to recent quarters.The first quarter is usually Control4's weakest quarter seasonally. Yet, the firm’s outlook for Q1 2019 is weaker than prior years.Let’s briefly take a deeper dive to examine Martin Plaehn’s point of view. The following graph has the 4Q 2018 market performance totals by market sector. Particular attention should be paid to the performances of the information technology and consumer discretionary sectors in the 4th quarter.From a macro view, Martin Plaehn’s assertion of caution in the near term appears to be correct. The U.S consumer confidence index had a 6.4 point decline in January while University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment dropped 7.1 points in January to 91.2.According to the NY Fed’s January Survey of Consumer expectations, America’s households have become increasingly pessimistic about the economic outlook in the U.S. Respondents had increased pessimism regarding job security and expectations of income growth. Most notably, consumer expectations of spending growth decreased significantly as opposed to December 2018.In addition to the noted increase in structural unemployment, it has been forecasted that U.S. GDP growth is expected to decline to a total of 2.3% in 2019. It is highly likely that investors will be spooked even further if the Fed does indeed raise the federal funds rate two more times to its target rate of 3.0%.Martin Plaehn is not alone in his assertion that Control4 would be affected by the uncertain macro environment. Needham gave Control4 a downgrade from Buy to Hold based on similar concerns.Plaehn does believe that the company will put up a good fight in its effort to overcome its obstacles. The extra revenue that Control4 expects to get from its acquisition of NEEO should greatly aid in this effort.However, the economic headwinds are clearly evident. In terms of momentum, Zacks has given Control4 a big F. This is indicative of their vulnerability.Martin Plaehn’s assertion is correct. I would avoid Control4 in the near term."

But even during the ups and downs, the company has always been respected for leading the product development initiatives seen in the industry, technologically as well as aesthetically, as evident from product additions like launching touchscreens, Android platform, etc.Industry is gaining momentum that can hardly be ignored anymoreNow that the space is inviting interest from tech biggies, be it Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) with Nest, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with Echo or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with HomeKit, highlighting the revenue potential as well as strategic relevance of the business, the recent proliferation of IoT (interest of things) hardware and equipment manufacturers should only improve the argument for platforms like Control4.Source: Control4The strategy has been to provide networking for connected home solutions, while integrating with a broad range of third-party products by various manufacturers. In the pro-installed Control and Automation category, the company continues to increase its lead over competitors like Creston and Savant, which is partly a result of strategically focusing on solutions for the connected home, including solutions for multi-room audio, lighting, climate control and a full line of mid-market home automation systems.Pockets of weakness here and there, but growth story continues to stay strongThe growth has stayed strong and any weakness has rarely lasted. The topline growth was hit a bit last year, but barring that the company has been consistent in delivering a decent double digit growth rate, including a 24% organic revenue growth rate in the most recent quarter, even though the guidance is still around 10% organic growth for the year. Geographically too, barring Canada that declined, all 23 of the sales regions are growing at a double-digit rate and North America core revenue grew 39% in the latest quarter.Going forward, the expected ramp of new products and integration as well as synergies out of the Pakedge acquisition should help sustain the current momentum, if not pace it.The new EA (entertainment and automation) series of controllers, which began shipping earlier this year, after a gap of almost four years have just started to ramp and looking at the early response to the product in the latest quarterly results, with total controllers up 73%, one can expect the product cycle playing out well for the company. Besides the new OS, the new controllers expand the available market size, with price points above and below the previous HC series controllers. Down the road, the installed base of more than 240,000 homes might help push the replacement cycle as well.Earlier this year, the company also acquired Pakedge Device & Software, which caters to the premium, enterprise-class networking market and has a mere 8-9% of dealer overlap. As the cross training and cross certification of the existing dealers is complete, integration should start providing a nice tailwind to the topline growth. On top of that, the company is already adding new dealers at record levels.Market expectations are lowWith the stock trading around 10-11 times forward earnings, less than 1 times EV/revenue and almost 1.5 times book, the business seems to be priced as a commodity hardware manufacturer, which looks like a bargain considering the improving dynamics, strong long-term potential and the financial profile of the business, with 50-54% gross margins and 8-9% adjusted net profit margins, even though the business does not have the lucrative recurring business model as in the case of Alarm.com (NASDAQ:ALRM), another home automation play."
3584316,52922,2015-10-21T05:00:00-04:00,"Control4's outlook is bleak, as its products face obsolescence from open source competitors.The stock trades at a lofty multiple for a commodity consumer electronics business.Control4 will re-rate to tangible book value as it misses revenue and margin goals.","(Author's Note: This article builds on Howie Man's previous work on CTRL, and is published with his knowledge)Recommendation: Short Control4 Corporation (NASDAQ:CTRL) (""Control4"", ""CTRL"" or the ""Company"") with a ~12-month price target of $4.5 per share, representing 50% upside to the short thesis in our base case.Despite negative year-to-date performance, CTRL represents an attractive short opportunity due to key developments that have occurred within the home automation industry over the past few months. An inflow of new entrants, high-end peers going down channel and VC funds chasing open source and app-based startups have materially impacted Control4's prospects for the worst, more than likely placing the Company in secular decline. This is due to Control4 carrying little to no IP, in conjunction with facing well-capitalized, larger competitors boasting superior distribution capabilities. Despite the negative outlook, the market currently continues to ascribe a SaaS multiple to a broken business. We believe market perception will change as CTRL disappoints on guidance and sell-side estimates for the back half of 2015 and into 2016.A short position in Control4 is merited by the following attributes:Software Multiple For a Commodity Consumer Hardware Business: The stock currently trades for ~17x LTM EBITDA and at a 2.7% free cash flow to enterprise value yield - egregiously high multiples for a commoditized business rendered obsolete by new entrants. Consumer electronic and hardware peers tend to trade in the low- to mid-single digit EBITDA multiples, and often at free cash flow to enterprise value yields in excess of 10%. Noteworthy, another director competitor with a materially larger business, Logitech, trades at ~10x EBITDA (and is likely overvalued as well). As promised revenue growth in the back half fails to materialize and do-it-yourself and open source peers steal market share, CTRL's equity will likely trade at or below tangible book value, similar with other businesses facing a secular decline.Low Barriers to Entry: The home automation industry has few barriers to entry, as defined as having multiple competitors with no pricing power and low switching costs. For example, CTRL competes against name-brand stalwarts such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), as well as multiple higher-end players such as Savant (SVATF), and numerous SaaS/app players, including recent IPO Alarm.com (NASDAQ:ALRM). Barriers to entry continue to decrease, as evidenced by multiple announcements daily of new entrants, significant VC funding available to ""SaaS"" providers, and open source technology which does not require significant hardware or dealer installation. Furthermore, Control4's distributor/dealer channel is not a barrier to entry as larger or profitable dealers tend to have relationships with multiple platforms.Disintermediation & Heightening Competition: Control4 operates a structurally flawed business model selling an obsolete product facing disintermediation. Notably, applications on smartphones as well as other integrated wireless technologies are increasing in momentum and stealing share from CTRL's products. Recent reports indicate consumers are favoring a single connected product, such as monitoring/security systems or platforms that connect smart devices through a phone app, versus an expensive controller which needs to be wired and professionally installed. Simply said, open source renders closed systems such as CTRL obsolete. Below, we note recent developments and product announcements from competitors:Accounting Red Flags Highlight Deteriorating Fundamentals: CTRL's most recent financial statements include the following red flags:Lack of Insider Ownership and Likely VC Exit: Management is not aligned with shareholders, given their lack of ownership per the latest proxy. Furthermore, Control4's VC backers have relinquished their position from the board of directors, likely signaling an exit over the next 6 months. Recall, the Company's VC sponsors own over 20% of shares outstanding.Bull thesis - The consensus bull thesis is predicated on the following data points:Aggressive 2nd-Half 2015 and FY16 Growth AssumptionsRebuttal: Current sell-side estimates call for revenue growth in excess of 15% for the second half of FY15, which we find as hard to achieve, given the negative trends noted above and an acceleration of revenue growth to ~16.5% in FY17E. Additionally, the Street expects gross margins to continue expanding, from 50.6% to ~53%. As seen with other commodity consumer hardware providers, gross margins tend to decline through the life cycle and are consistent with Control4's discounting of products. If CTRL is still around in three to four years, gross margins will likely be in the high-30% to low-40% range.Additionally, bulls point to 2Q revenue acceleration as a sign of momentum for the Company. This is false hope, as CTRL benefited from its acquired audio/video distribution products provider Leaf's revenues, as well a one-time boost from a product refresh.Unique Technology and Dealer/Distributor RelationshipsRebuttal: Control4 has little in way of IP, and does not carry a recurring revenue base, similar to many lower-tier consumer product hardware manufacturers.Moreover, distributor relationships are often cited as being of strategic importance, yet larger profitable dealers are adding additional relationships/platforms and will switch to whichever platform makes them the most money.Interest in Home Automation Derived from Alarm.Com IPORebuttal: Alarms.com shares very little business similarity with CTRL, as it generates recurring, SaaS-like revenues and operates an open-ended system vis-à-vis Control4.Company OverviewFounded in 2003, Control4 is a provider of hardware solutions that automates home appliances, operating as a remote control for lights, video, music and appliances. Notably, at its founding, the Company positioned itself as one of the only mass-market providers of home automation devices - generally households with under $100K in annual income.Its products are sold through third-party distributors who also provide installation and ongoing maintenance. Control4's product costs $750-1,000 for the basic hardware, excluding the cost of installation. Installation generally ranges from $3,000 to $6,000 for one room, and roughly ~$20,000 for a small- to mid-sized house. These upfront costs severely limit its potential customer base. Additionally, on the higher end, where installation costs are generally not a factor, CTRL loses business to higher-end products, such as Savant and Creston.Vastly different from peers such as Alarm.com, CTRL does not generate any recurring revenue from subscriptions or licensing. All revenue is derived from one-time hardware sales. Ongoing maintenance is also required any time the user wants to add an appliance or modify the configuration (CTRL does not receive any of this revenue), and the average rate for a basic service visit from a technician costs ~$200. This creates a favorable revenue tail for a dealer/installer, yet negatively impacts the consumer and steers them towards open source platforms. While this may not have been an impediment to sales a couple years ago, it has become a larger inhibitor to growth today as competing solutions are released.ValuationGiven its poor competitive positioning and the dismal quality of free cash flow, CTRL should ultimately trade at or below its tangible book value of $4.5 per share. We can support our valuation utilizing relatively in-line consensus top line growth assumptions and EBITDA multiples in line with hardware comparables.Short CatalystsThe following are potential catalysts which lead to realization of our target price:Short Thesis RisksThe potential key risks to the short thesis are as follows:ConclusionControl4 is a broken concept operating a business model stuck in the 2000s, and not for the cloud and ""Internet of Things"". As the proliferation of smart devices increase, consumers will continue to demand open source platforms (such as those taken on by Apple) and ease of use at affordable price points - factors not currently addressed by Control4's product offerings. As these headwinds materialize, the Company will likely miss its lofty forward estimates, creating a significant re-rating in the equity."
3961670,24929,2016-03-30T10:52:42-04:00,January cut controller prices 40%.Amazon now making a huge home automation push with Echo platform.Just made a questionable acquisition that consumed half its cash.Challenges exacerbated by unfavorable mix shift and volume headwinds as fewer controller needed per job.,"Investment ThesisWe have written about Control4 Corp. (NASDAQ:CTRL) (""CTRL"" or the ""Company"") twice before - both turned out to be quite timely and accurate calls. We believe current conditions present another, even more attractive opportunity to short the stock. Over the last two months, CTRL's stock has run-up nearly 50% despite significant negative developments including: 1) a 40% price cut to its controllers effective January 15th, 2) a questionable acquisition that consumed half its cash, and 3) a massive increase in Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) commitment to the Echo product line in January with a stated intent of dominating the home automation market. This is compounded by an unfavorable mix shift to lower cost controllers and volume headwinds the Company faces from fewer controllers needed per job.CTRL's current 23.7x LTM P/E multiple is predicated on unattainable mid-teens organic revenue growth and a 100% increase in net income (all number proforma with Pakedge). This aggressive earnings guidance and lofty expectations drove the stock's recent price appreciation. The reality is the recent price cuts and competitive pressures are leading to negative revenue growth and further margin erosion in the near term. We believe the Pakedge acquisition only accelerates the Company's demise. Control4 has limited IP and no discernible strategic value, thus the stock is likely not worth more than its ever-declining net cash position of $1.78 per share for a potential 75% return. A borrow in the security is readily available with a -2% rebate.Current Reality & Recent DevelopmentsLast year, we highlighted how the Company has a structurally flawed business model and sells a single technology product that is rapidly falling into obsolescence. The below developments, ordered by severity, should make it clear that Control4's product is officially obsolete and its demise nearing:The bottom line: in early Q1 prices for a product that represents the majority of CTRL's revenue were significantly cut. This is exacerbated by the volume headwinds the Company faces from fewer controllers needed per job.Business BackgroundControl4 sells hardware that automates home appliances, essentially a remote control for video, music and lights. The Company was founded in 2003 and initially positioned itself as one of the first producers of mainstream home automation hardware. The <$100k income households CTRL targeted were not addressed by the luxury-priced providers at the time. For the next three to four years, home automation remained a nascent market and Control4 was one of few selling hardware at the lower-end of the price spectrum (below $5k per unit).CTRL's hardware is sold through third-party distributors who also provide installation and ongoing service. This is a major structural flaw in its business model. Control4's product costs $600-2k for the basic hardware but when you factor in programming and installations, the cost increases massively to $5k-8k for one room, >$20k for a small to mid-sized house. This is a bit of a hidden cost that typically does not get included in product price comparisons and industry reviews. These upfront costs severely limit its potential customer base.The Company does not generate any recurring revenue from subscriptions or licensing. All revenue is from one-time hardware sales. Control4's product is sold through independent, third-party distributors. These distributors have historically been compelled to sell CTRL's hardware not based on the merits of the technology but because of the installation and ongoing maintenance revenue those distributors can generate.As noted, installation costs range from $5k to $20k depending upon the scope of the project. Ongoing maintenance is also required any time the user wants to add an appliance or modify the configuration. It is important to note, CTRL does not receive any of this revenue. A basic service visit from a technician costs ~$200. This type of tail revenue is obviously exactly what a distributor loves and a customer hates (as indicated by CTRL's poor customer reviews). While this may not have been an impediment to sales a couple of years ago, it debilitates CTRL's competitive position given the ever-growing number of alternatives, including Amazon's Echo, which do not require expensive installation and ongoing service.Valuation & CatalystsAt $8.11 per share, CTRL has a $218M market capitalization (27 F/D shares) and an EV of $170M ($48M net cash adjusting for the Pakedge deal). The Company reported $163M in revenue and $8.1M in adjusted net income in 2015 and Pakedge generated $18.5M in revenue and approximately $1M in net income. CTRL has guided to 2016 revenue of $198M-$202M with adjusted net income of $16M-18M.This implies 10-12% organic revenue growth yet CTRL only grew organic revenue 4% in 2015 (ex-Leaf acquisition) and Pakedge was flat. This also assumes a 100% increase in adjusted net income off the $9.1M base. This is insane given the aforementioned growth and margin headwinds. Yet the current 24.7x proforma EV/LTM net income multiple indicates the market is buying it.At the end of the day, Control4 has a severely impaired business model and the growth story that supports its multiple is imploding. The increasingly bleak competitive picture is leading to negative revenue growth and declining margins. The Company has negligible IP it can monetize. One need only look at the failed sale of peer Wink to get a perspective on how little strategic interest there is for hub hardware manufacturers. At a 15x EPS market multiple (arguably generous given the business profile and prospects), CTRL would trade 40% lower. Ultimately, Control4 lacks any discernible strategic value, thus the stock is not worth anything more than its net cash position of $1.78 per share for a potential 75% return.The primary near-term catalysts include: 1) revenue and margin erosion from recent price cuts and volume declines leading to performance falling well short of current lofty expectations/guidance, 2) increased competitive pressures from Amazon and others, 3) stock re-rating as its fate becomes painfully apparent, and 4) potential share sales from Foundation Capital and Frazier Ventures.Accounting Red Flags& Other Considerations"
3449536,48411,2015-08-18T17:33:53-04:00,"CTRL reported a strong Q2 but so many questions still remain about the quarter and the model.CTRL is looking to continue its share buyback executions as well as ramp into a scaled up marketing campaign.Despite having two major partnerships with two prominent builders dating back to at least Q4/14 CTRL isn't generating ""financially material"" revenues from either.Continue to avoid CTRL.","Control4 (NASDAQ:CTRL) had a nice bounce back quarter after reporting a Q1 that was a disaster. Still, I don't recommend investors rush into CTRL as I feel the name has much to prove before being considered out of the danger zone. But that said, I will admit that the quarter did provide a solid foundation for the company to build on. Revenues reported were healthy in growth Y/Y. CTRL was also able to show a continuation of growth of its dealer network both internationally and via the North American channel.It also looks like CTRL is going to take advantage of the two silver linings in having an imploded share price in being conservative with guidance and executing on share buybacks - even if the latter wouldn't be advised by me. CTRL took down the bottom end of guidance for Q3 EPS and revenue. The market, while not reacting well to this news at first reaction, has decided to give CTRL a pass on this takedown as shares have largely held flat into post-report trading.Still, even in posting a bounce back quarter that by all means was simply in line with expectations (yes, that's the low bar that we've set for CTRL) there's little else to like about the quarter and/or the go forward plan. CTRL's growth strategy now includes, get this, such innovation as telemarketing and internet marketing as a customer acquisition strategy. CTRL believes this will help it better control the flow of lead generation and lead nurturing. In turn, the company believes this should increase overall take rate and lifetime value of customers.Is this the first the company has heard of these strategies? Why have these not been deployed long ago? Why has CTRL not tried to take more control over its model instead of being largely reliant on resellers? All of these are questions that call out the competence or lack of competence of the folks running this company. Frankly, based on the disaster that's been trotted out on the public markets so far I would be calling for both to exit if I was a major shareholder.Then there's the commitment to the share buyback program, to which CTRL did execute into (as stated above). Is this really the best and highest productivity use of capital? What exactly is the all in net return on this? Am I to believe that CTRL isn't better served using this capital in its consumer marketing program? Or better yet, marketing to the Toll Brothers and/or Ryland Homes relationship? Regarding the Toll Brothers/Ryland Homes relationships, we as market participants still haven't been given granularity or even anything remotely resembling key metrics for either. Oh yes, that's right - management did state on the investor call that the revenues being derived weren't ""financially material"" just yet. Well, at least we know that.Again, CTRL is still a very uncertain story and is one that despite The Street continuing to have raging bull price targets for (price targets range from being 13% higher for the bear case to 92% higher for the bull case) I recommend be avoided. I just don't believe the model as-is will be able to be successful longer term. I think the new build integration story is an attractive one but it has been far too long with these agreements in place to not have ""financially material"" revenue to report. I have to wonder at this point what kind of sweetheart deal the builders got if through this amount of time with each deal being in place the revenues still aren't adding up despite CTRL's professed integration into a high volume of homes. Until we get granularity around these deals and why they aren't generating the type of topline I would investors should think they should be generating - not even this part of the story can be bought.Continue to avoid CTRL.Good luck everybody."
3390005,74905,2015-08-03T10:33:31-04:00,"Control4 released earnings Thursday.Although the report was a step in the right direction, many risks remain.Investors should proceed cautiously.","IntroductionControl4 (NASDAQ:CTRL), the much-maligned home automation company, reported earnings Thursday. The small company has been widely bashed over the past 6 months, with two straight below-average quarters that helped drop the stock 40% in a short time. However, Thursday's results were much better, and show that there is still some life in this company. While there are still a lot of issues that CTRL needs to work out and overcome to create sustained growth, this quarter's results show that the market opportunity still exists and the product is still very much relevant. However, anyone investing in this name should be prepared for a long and volatile ride. (Investors note: all financial data and company information from this article is taken from the quarterly press release or conference call unless otherwise stated).Bullish FactorsAs an investor, there was a lot to like in this quarter. The financial numbers looked particularly strong. Revenue growth was back on track, with 22% growth year-over-year ((YoY)) and 24% in the North American core market. Earnings Per Share increased 14% YoY, despite increases in marketing expenses. Controller Shipments were also up 19% YoY. The company still maintains a strong balance sheet with $82.7 million in cash (~$3.40 per share) and very little debt.There are a lot of exciting product related developments at Control4 as well. The SDDP program is continuing to expand, with 8 new partners added this quarter. Control4 now has 129 companies shipping 929 products with their SDDP embedded. On top of that, the open-software Control4 platform is now compatible with 8700+ third party products. A new homebuilder partnership, Ryland Homes, was announced, and the partnership with Toll Brothers continues to gain traction. Control4 now has two of the top 10 homebuilders in the country as partners for their model homes. Marketing efforts have picked up, including the first ever consumer event held in April to introduce consumers to the newest Control4 product line. Total active dealers at the end of the quarter were also up 7%, to 3,421 dealers worldwide. Overall, management is doing a good job expanding the Control4 footprint. The software that Control4 offers is increasingly becoming more open and customizable by the end user. Control4 continues to be the leader in the Home Automation space, and was named the top home automation company by CE Pro and ProSource this June.Bearish FactorsThere are still major red flags investors should keep in mind when evaluating Control4. First and foremost, I think the biggest issue facing the company is brand recognition. Simply put, most of the company's target market is unaware of Control4, or full-scale home automation in general, and how it works. Control4 is putting a lot of effort into fixing this over the next few quarters with major increases in marketing spend. The success of Control4 to market itself will be extremely important, and it needs to happen now before new and bigger competitors enter the space and relegate Control4 into a very small niche- essentially a solution only for those who are extremely rich and/or extremely tech savvy. There is no doubt that Control4 has a strong system that would be appealing to a broad market, however if they cannot make their products and the capabilities their software brings to the table well known to that market, it really won't matter how good their end product is. The ability of management to get the marketing campaigns right will likely be the difference between CTRL generating sustained and consistent growth over the next 5-10 years or CTRL posting lumpy and unpredictable growth such as we've seen thus far in the company's short public history.Financially, the market seems to be pretty disappointed with the company's forward-looking guidance. Although the guidance wasn't particularly strong, it was consistent with what management put out in the last quarter when they dropped their full-year estimates following the disaster that was Q1. At the very worst, I expect management to hit the modified full-year estimates that they put out at the end of last quarter and re-confirmed this quarter. There is a good chance that management will be able to beat these estimates, especially if they can generate momentum with their marketing campaign. As a CTRL shareholder I am personally much more concerned with their ability to gain traction through their marketing campaign than I am about the short-term revenue and profitability of the company, because as I detailed above I believe that is what will make or break this company.ConclusionsControl4 has been, and will continue to be, an extremely volatile stock. There is a lot of risk here that the company never moves out of the small niche market that it is currently operating in. Although failure to expand its market will not necessarily mean that the company will fail, it will certainly severely damage the long-term growth prospects of this company. Still, there are a lot of signs that the company is moving in the right direction. This quarter looked very strong and should give shareholders confidence that the company is again moving forward. Current Long-term investors, such as myself, certainly shouldn't sell at these depressed prices. Currently, the cash position alone makes up 40% of the share price, and the share buyback coupled with low expectations means that management shouldn't need to deliver exceptional numbers to get the stock price moving back up. These results prove that the business itself is not broken, and neither is my investment thesis, so I will continue to hold. New investors with a long-term outlook should think long and hard about whether this investment is worth buying into considering the extreme volatility and risk associated with the business, and it may make sense to be patient and wait a quarter or two to see if the marketing campaigns are successful. On the other hand of the spectrum, Investors with a shorter outlook or who like to speculate might see some value here based on the extreme volatility and low stock price."
3877276,89276,2016-02-10T05:00:00-05:00,"Control4 offers a closed solution in competition with the open solutions offered by Amazon, Google and Apple.The Company's products are far more expensive than the competition, while demanding burdensome installation.Its financial performance has been stagnating, and guidance was unimpressive.Insiders have been selling shares and resigning from the board.","During last Sunday's Super Bowl, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) spent about $10 million advertising its voice-activated ""Echo."" In one commercial, Alec Baldwin turns on the lights merely by telling Echo to so do.[1]Searching Amazon.com for ""Echo"" yields over 40 devices which now interface with Echo, from coffee machines to lights to speakers to thermostats.[2, 2a] Capabilities are being added all the time - ordering a Domino's pizza, requesting a joke, playing bingo and calling for a ride with Uber are just some examples.[3] Echo is on a roll.The ability to control home appliances by voice and/or smartphones grows exponentially with help from Google (Android) (GOOG, GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS9 (which ""contains"" HomeKit).In comparison to these systems, Control4 Corp. (CTRL, or the ""Company"") offers a home automation system that is: (1) closed to outside innovation, (2) very expensive and (3) difficult to install and service.The free/low-cost ""hubs"" made by Google, Apple and Amazon offer an open system where any developer or designer can plug a product into the platform. Over twenty equipment manufacturers have already made their devices compatible with Apple or Google, including General Electric (NYSE:GE), Honeywell (NYSE:HON), and Phillips (NYSE:PHG). Between Apple and Android, there are about 2.3 billion smartphones, a massive base of hardware on which to easily control home appliances and such.[4, 4a] We think this is how you will control your thermostats and music - not via some extraordinarily expensive fickle hardware delivered by a guy in a van, if he even shows up.CTRL's closed system requires professional installation and uses proprietary programming, which works only with a limited number of licensed devices. Much like how AOL (a closed system) was supplanted by an open system approach to the internet, we believe CTRL is going to have the rug pulled out from under it by ""down market"" competition.Despite offering limited functionality (relatively speaking), CTRL's system is significantly more expensive than its open system competitors. According to a check we completed with a local dealer, homeowners can build their own home-automation systems with far greater ease of use and convenience than CTRL allows, in some cases at just 1/3rd the cost:Figure 1: Price Comparison of CTRL Home Install vs. DIY AAPL Home InstallFor $199, Echo owners can buy an Insteon hub, two lamp dimmers, two on/off modules (for things like coffee machines, fans, etc.) and an LED bulb. This Insteon DIY system is cheaper than the rate we were quoted for a single CTRL dimmer ($968/4 = $242) excluding labor.[5]One would think that at these sky-high prices, CTRL would provide an exceptional user experience and support. ASecureLife.com, on December 16, 2015, wrote, ""Installation will usually require two people to come to your home for two days to install even the most basic features.""[6] BestCompany.com, on August 11, 2015, explained that ""because the initial installation requires a great deal of labor, there is no trial period for the system.""[7]If your system breaks (and there are numerous such complaints online), you could be stuck with an entire audio-video, lighting and home automation system that does not work. Imagine if all the lighting in your home ceased to work and you were reliant on a third-party dealer to fix it.After visiting two different Best Buys in San Francisco in March 2015, we discovered that none of the CTRL display systems in the demonstration room worked properly. The sales associates (at each location) blamed the failure on faulty Wi-Fi connections and seemed indifferent about CTRL products.The confluence of a degrading value proposition and mediocre customer service has resulted in slowing growth across key metrics for the Company.Figure 2: Inconsistent Results; Failure to Reach Inflection[8]Although the Company insists that dealers do not keep significant inventory, we have seen large lots of new CTRL equipment selling online on websites such as eBay - often a red flag. Days of inventory outstanding has been trending higher, which, coupled with decelerating revenue, portends looming demand and margin issues.Figure 3: Days Inventory OutstandingFigure 4: Resale Trends for Control4 Controllers on eBayInsider Sales and ResignationsFrom August 2013 to November 2014, insiders sold 455,276 shares of the Company.[9] On February 27, 2015, board members representing Foundation Capital and Frazier Ventures, two venture capital shareholders with a combined 23.7% stake in CTRL, announced their resignation. It is possible these board members left the board in order for these firms to more easily exit their positions.Obfuscation of Deterioration, Grasping at StrawsIn an effort to drive growth, CTRL announced, on February 4, 2016, the acquisition of Pakedge Device & Software for $32.7 million in cash. Based on Pakedge's 2015 financials, the Company paid 33 times its approximate $1 million of earnings and 1.8 times its $18.5 million of revenues - a very rich price even when compared to the high valuations of CTRL.[10; 10a]Pakedge designs and manufactures high-end networking equipment. It serves a very limited market of individuals who require a comprehensive, enterprise-grade IP network in their home. An eBay search for Pakedge reveals routers being sold for up to $500.[11] Needless to say, the Pakedge acquisition represents a step in the wrong direction, adding more expensive product offerings and more closed systems.In response to the Pakedge acquisition announcement, Q4 2015 results and the issuance of fiscal year 2016 guidance, CTRL shares closed 22% higher on Friday, February 5, 2016. We believe this enthusiasm is misplaced.While CTRL management would not disclose the expected growth rate of Pakedge baked into their 2016 guidance, they did say on the February 4, 2016 conference call that it would be ""accretive to our growth rate."" We are not sure what this means. On Pakedge's website, it describes ""exponential revenue growth"", which would seem to make sense for a company that was founded in a garage in 2003.[12, 12a]If you assume Pakedge grows its top line revenues 35% in 2016, we estimate CTRL's 2016 revenue guidance was roughly in line with the consensus number and implies just 8% revenue growth for the legacy business in 2016, down from 10% in 2015.In addition to this mediocre 2016 revenue guidance, CTRL reported Q4 2015 operating margins of 1% (down from 10% in Q4 2014) and controller shipment volume of just 16,964, down 25% year over year.CTRL did not generate any profit in fiscal year 2015. It did, however, generate $4.4 million of cash flow from operations. On an enterprise value to 2015 cash flow from operations basis, the stock trades at a multiple of 24 times. Even assuming the sell-side analysts covering CTRL are correct and the Company sees a sudden rebound of profits in 2016, it would still appear expensive at 22 times 2016 GAAP EPS.Figure 5: Control4 Price to GAAP Earnings MultiplesOur price target for CTRL ranges from $1.60 to $2.40 per share, based on 8-12 times our 2016 GAAP EPS estimate of $0.20. We think even this estimate may be optimistic, however. It is our view that CTRL is DOA, and we question how it can reverse its 2015 loss. According to Bloomberg LP's compilation of GAAP EPS estimates for 2015, the Street cut estimates from $0.55 in August 2014 to (-$0.05) in November 2015. Even at this sharply reduced estimate, the Street was too optimistic and actual results came in lower.Alea iacta est.[13] Why would anybody spend all that money and endure all the headaches when Google and Amazon, to name a few alternatives, are more elegant and cheaper?Figure 6: Control4 Consensus GAAP 2015 EPS Estimates Since August 2014CTRL offers yet another solution crafted by technologists. The Company hides behind adjustments and acquisitions to obscure the fact that it has not, and likely will not, produce meaningful profits. Now that shares of CTRL have moved higher on misplaced enthusiasm, the time to sell the shares is now. This is only our opinion.

(""CTRL"" or the ""Company""). It is not often that a shift in industry dynamics of this magnitude occurs in such a short period of time. This marks a major acceleration in competition from those previously outlined in March. The net result: The prospects for Control4 went from challenged to terminal, thus presenting a more attractive opportunity to short CTRL than ever before. Despite these developments, the stock price has actually rallied recently on news surrounding Alarm.com's IPO. This response is unwarranted, as the two companies have totally different profiles. This move is temporary and has only added to the return potential. CTRL's current 52.9x LTM P/E multiple is predicated on an unattainable high-teens revenue growth and margin uplift. Bottom line: The competitive pressures facing Control4 will likely lead to negative revenue growth and further margin erosion over the next three quarters of 2015. Control4 has limited IP and no discernible strategic value, and thus the stock is likely not worth more than its balance sheet cash of $2.50 per share, for a potential 75% return.Recent DevelopmentsIn March, we highlighted how the company has a structurally flawed business model and sells a single technology product that is rapidly falling into obsolescence. This reality has become even more evident. Following a series of recent announcements, a large shakeup in the home automation industry has ensued. All recent reports have indicated consumers are favoring single connected products like security/ monitoring systems and platforms that connect smart devices through a phone application rather than a controller. Meanwhile, sales of hub systems and hardware in general have been tepid as software and application systems have taken over. It should be clear from the developments enumerated below that Control4's product is officially obsolete and its days numbered:o Closed Ecosystem: Closed ecosystems do not scale to support the expanding ""Internet of Things"" (IoT). These systems limit the ability of a consumer to add new devices, as they are restricted to a small set of compatible options. Some product manufacturers have attempted to control the software solution that enables their products in the connected-home environment, and as a result, are unable to partner with and include competitive products in their ecosystem.o Not Future-Proof: Since most legacy products are not cloud-based, they cannot receive automatic updates of new software, and risk becoming obsolete. These static offerings generally require physical hardware and software replacements once new features, devices or technologies are introduced. These replacements typically have to be done onsite.o Overly Complex and Expensive: Systems that attempt to integrate disparate point products in a closed network are highly complex and require a significant level of customization. As a result, these systems lack flexibility and are often cost-prohibitive to acquire, service and update for most consumers.Business BackgroundControl4 sells hardware that automates home appliances, essentially a remote control for video, music and lights. The Company was founded in 2003, and initially positioned itself as one of the first producers of mainstream home automation hardware. The <$100k income households CTRL targeted were not addressed by the luxury-priced providers at the time. For the next three to four years, home automation remained a nascent market, and Control4 was one of few selling hardware at the lower-end of the price spectrum (below $5k per unit). CTRL's hardware is sold through third-party distributors who also provide installation and ongoing service. As we will discuss, this is a structural flaw in its business model. Control4's product costs $750-1k for the basic hardware, but when you factor in programming and installations, the cost increases massively to $3k-6k for one room, >$20k for a small- to mid-sized house. This is a bit of a hidden cost that typically does not get included in product price comparisons and industry reviews. These upfront costs severely limit its potential customer base.The company does not generate any recurring revenue from subscriptions or licensing. All revenue is from one-time hardware sales. Control4's product is sold through independent, third-party distributors. These distributors have historically been compelled to sell CTRL's hardware, not based on the merits of the technology, but because of the installation and ongoing maintenance revenue those distributors can generate. Installation costs $2k-5k for one room and over $20k for a small- to mid-sized house. Ongoing maintenance is also required any time the user wants to add an appliance or modify the configuration (CTRL does not receive any of this revenue). A basic service visit from a technician costs ~$200. This type of tail revenue is obviously exactly what a distributor loves and a customer hates (as indicated by CTRL's poor customer reviews). While this may not have been an impediment to sales a couple years ago, it debilitates the company's competitive position, given the ever-growing number of alternatives that do not require expensive installation and ongoing service.Valuation & CatalystsAt $10.05 per share, CTRL has a $257M market capitalization. Control4 has a severely impaired business model, and the growth story that supports its current 52.9x P/E multiple is imploding. As we noted in March, lack of innovation, a high price point and a product with limited practical consumer value would come home to roost in the company's performance. This reality indeed further manifested itself in CTRL's subsequent Q1 earnings report. In Q1, organic revenue turned negative and EBITDA dropped to -$2.6M, worse than management had guided just a month before. At the very least this exemplifies the lack of handle management has on the business. The company blamed the shortfall on the timing of shipments of its next-generation product and reduced its 2015 revenue growth guidance to 10-15%. This back-end loaded is unattainable, given all the recent developments and competitive headwinds. The stock came under pressure following the quarterly results, but has recently rallied on news surrounding Alarm.com's IPO and the lofty valuation it is anticipated to garner. This move is totally unwarranted, as Alarm.com is a niche SaaS business with a high recurring revenue (subscription/ license model), strong growth and high returns. CTRL, on the other hand, is a producer of low-margin hardware with zero recurring revenue, declining growth and low returns.Regardless, it is quite clear that the high-growth story that still supports CTRL's current high multiple is now broken. The increasingly bleak competitive picture has led to negative revenue growth and declines in margins. The company has negligible IP it can monetize. Just look at the failed sale of peer Wink to get a perspective on how little strategic interest there is for hub hardware manufactures. At a 16x EPS market multiple (arguably generous given the business profile and prospects), CTRL would trade 60% lower. Control4 has limited IP and no discernible strategic value, and thus the stock is likely not worth more than its balance sheet cash of $2.50 per share, for a potential 75% return.The primary near-term catalysts include: 1) revenue shortfall, margin pressure and guidance cuts from the current lofty expectations; 2) increased competitive pressures, distribution losses and order cancellations from retailers; 3) stock re-rating, as its challenges are illuminated; and 4) potential share sales from Foundation Capital and Frazier Ventures.Accounting Red Flags & RisksAppendix: Industry DynamicsOver the last two years, the competitive landscape in home automation has shifted rapidly: 1) Savant, AMX, Creston and others started selling lower-priced products; 2) Managed service providers ADT, Comcast, Verizon, etc. began cross-selling automation products to their existing customers; 3) Numerous low-cost do-it-yourself options came to market and; 4) Point products began to proliferate. Home WiFi and the Internet of Things eliminated all the technology entry barriers that previously made installed systems like Control4's viable. IoT refers to the ability to virtually connect to home and office devices that have embedded sensors. Now, most appliances are internet-enabled (smart TVs, wireless speakers, LED lights, etc.) and have their own smart device applications. These are free, can be accessed from your phone or tablet and do not require clunky hardware installation or maintenance. For those consumers who still prefer a platform approach, much cheaper, more advanced options now exist. SmartThings sells a standalone hub with sensors and switches supporting almost all common forms of communication for $99-129, and it does not require professional installation and programming. Other comprehensive solutions include Revolv ($299), Mi Casa ($200) and Staples Connect ($99). These allow users to access and control devices (Sonos speakers, Philips Hue lightbulbs, Nest thermostat, internet-enabled appliances, etc.) on a single smartphone app. Yet, CTRL continues to present itself as one of the lowest-priced providers. Even if you exclude installation and service costs, Control4's controller is now much more expensive and far less flexible than all but the high-end, luxury systems. Regardless of cost, the reality is few people want a short life-cycle technology product hardwired into their home. Having a controller touchpad installed in your wall is akin to having a desktop computer built into your house. What do you do when that antiquated device is a relic in two years? Forrester Research estimates that 20% of North American households are using one or more connected-home devices, but of the current adopters, 75% have only connected one device. Consumers prefer the flexibility of phone- and tablet-enabled systems that can address specific needs. This allows users to pick the best product for a given function, rather than being constrained by a single bundled service, such as that of Control4. Demand for integrated, bundled products appear to now be limited to niche new homes and often installed by contractors at the later behest of the homeowner. Further:"

Everything from entertainment to security to lighting and energy use are on the agenda.One company has developed a ""plug and play"" platform that is far outpacing the competition. Even Amazon is partnering with them.Control4 has massive long-term upside and is at the very front-end of a multi-year ramp up, accumulate CTRL on all dips.","- A previous version of this article was provided to Margin of Safety Investing members. The stock has been recommended for a few months now. - The ""Internet of Things,"" a phrase I hated a few years ago because it sounded a little too clever and pithy to me, is quickly becoming one of my favorites. The connected world, for any trepidation I might have about it personally, is becoming a foregone conclusion.Smart homes are going to be a big component of the IoT future. Eventually, we will be able to control everything in our homes from a cell phone, iPad or whatever device comes next that you like. More importantly, the homes will be able to control themselves depending on the ""settings"" we give or what our home ""senses.""While existing homes won't become smart quickly or cheaply, they will become smarter incrementally. New home construction, which will need to boom in the 2020s to keep up with demand, will be where smart homes really penetrate. By the 2020s sometime, I believe almost all homes will be configured for the connected future (as well as, have solar). Getting a piece of that early is a smart move for the long-term investor. Control4 (CTRL) is poised to be one of the biggest (if not the biggest) winners in the smart home space. The company is on the Margin of Safety Investing ""Growth 30"" list of top growth companies for the next decade.Per the company: ""Control4 is a leading provider of automation and control solutions for the connected home. We unlock the potential of connected devices, making entertainment systems easier to use, homes more comfortable and energy efficient, and families more secure. We provide our consumers with the ability to integrate music, video, lighting, temperature, security, communications and other functionalities into a unified home automation solution that enhances our consumers’ daily lives. More than 75% of our consumers have integrated two or more of these functionalities with our solution. At the center of our solution is our advanced software platform, which we provide through our products that interface with a wide variety of connected devices that are developed both by us and by third parties. Our solution functions as the operating system of the home, making connected devices work together to control, automate and personalize the homes of our consumers.""In short, the company has created a plug and play system to connect virtually anything home related into a central management system. Think of it like apps on your iPhone or Android. If you want security, buy a system and plug-in the app to Control4's platform. If you buy a smart refrigerator, plug the app onto the platform. Control4's platform is an operating system for the home.Your next smart home will likely be your first smart home, but it won't be your last, unless of course it's your last home. What's coming in smart home technology and connectivity is going to be truly ""Jetsonesque.""There will be no more making sure to open windows at night to let cool air in or closing blinds to block the hot afternoon sun in the summer. Coffee will make itself not on a timer, but depending on what your schedule is that day. The freezer will know how much meat to thaw based on who is going to be home for dinner tomorrow. Climate controls will become passé they'll be so advanced. Security systems and entertainment are the early adopters of Control4's platform.Smart homes are the future of homes for builders. While adoption is slow for existing home owners, it seems very likely that the homes of the future will incorporate such technology from the build. Control4 is providing deep support for architects and home designers out of the gate.Amazon (AMZN) already is partnering with Control4 to make the future come home earlier. Amazon's Alexa is being transformed from a toy (it sort of was) to a powerful command station that controls your home. The power of Amazon could fuel huge growth for Control4 even sooner than I thought a few months ago.With the field starting to emerge in the smart home space, we will have to monitor closely, but all indications are that Control4 is the platform that others will plug into. There will likely be a at least a couple more entrants into plug and play platforms for smart homes, such as Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which already has purchased Nest and Apple (AAPL). Both of those behemoths also are candidates to buy Control4 outright, as is Amazon.Before I get further into the analysis, please take a look at Core4's most recent investor presentation to get a better baseline on the company:At the top of the list of Control4's advantages is that their technology is the clear leader. The company was named for the third time in row the top home automation provider by CE Pro's Top 100 Brand Analysis report. The company ranks in categories including: multiroom A/V distribution systems, video distribution switchers/extenders, whole house automation, HVAC control and home networking.Control4's software platform is open source which allows applications to be added for thousands of products. Right now there are over 10,000 possible connections available. It is scalable to fit different installation needs at different price points.The company's platform is well integrated with Amazon's Echo, Dot and FireTV. This makes you think that the company has a great avenue for expansion or possibly could be acquired.Control4's systems are professionally installed and can handle dozens of devices. This is a significant difference from limited offerings from AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA) as well as Apollo Management's (APO) ADT offering, which also is professionally installed, but only handles about a dozen products. Over 5,300 local distributors and consultants now operate in 97 nations for the company.The company is focused on the high-end of the market, about 14 million homes with above $150k of disposable income, which is the most profitable niche. As of now, they have about 1.4% penetration into that group, giving them a large runway in an industry likely to grow rapidly in the next decade. Their Q1 quarterly year-over-year revenue growth rate was 17%.Financially the company is debt free and revenue of $216 million over the trailing 12 months with a gross profit margin of 50%. They are reinvesting aggressively into new products and potential strategic acquisitions, so don't expect earnings to surge just yet, although the company has said the right things about growing earnings rapidly. Investors must be willing to consider long-term growth goals versus current earnings as their primary analysis tool.As a pure play on the connected home, the company is very focused and uncluttered for investors to analyze. The technology is certainly adaptable to business though, so I wonder when that market will be opened up. Such an event is another catalyst at some point.The rationale to invest in Control4 is as a potential home run investment. There is no doubt that technology is a fast moving game and that Control4 has some monster companies to compete with. They might not achieve their objectives. The Amazon relationship both gives me hope and pause. It is not unusual for Amazon to cannibalize ""frienemies.""Investors will want to own this in the portion of their portfolio reserved for stocks that could drop 50% and languish on a negative surprise, but could also rise hundreds of percent. I'm inclined to own a dozen to two dozen such stocks at most times. For those who have a smaller allocation to high growth potential stocks, Control4 still belongs even in a group of 5-10 stocks, it has that much potential.Control4 stock has rallied handily this year, up over 150% so far. Normally that could be cause for many to pause. However, what we are witnessing in my opinion is a breakout. The 200-day moving average keeps getting pulled upward after the gap in Q1.While the stock's price to book is over 4, the company is debt free and profitable with extremely high growth in the 15% quarter over quarter range.Any stock price softness seems to be a spot to get involved. If you are familiar with options, I'm suggesting selling puts and buying shares. I 'm actively buying and accumulating shares in Control4.The puts to sell paired with a stock purchase at current price levels are the November $25 puts trading for about $1.30 right now. As you can see on the technical chart, $25 appears to be fairly good support at the 200-day moving average. Buying some shares now and collecting premium on another potential batch allows you to scale in and immediately reduce your cost basis.I do favor selling cash-secured puts on volatile potential home run stocks in order to generate portfolio income and lower cost basis, so if you want to learn options, please do visit the CBOE Option Education Center, it's a great resource."
3091346,65623,2015-04-22T14:56:18-04:00,"Current market price $12.5, estimate fair value of $15.5.A combination of positive earnings, decent cash position, low debt and high growth.R&D, which is usually treated as an operating expense in conventional accounting, for this valuation I will treat it as a capital expense.","Control4 Corporation (NASDAQ:CTRL) is a provider of automation systems for homes and businesses, offering its consumers the ability to connect and control electronic devices in their home in a unified way, from lighting to music, security, video, temperature, communications and other functionalities..Source: PresentationAs we can see Control4 systems are pretty expensive, targeting higher income households. One side of this can be a cause for concern, as some might question how many people would actually pay these prices, in addition you can expect high margins to attract competition. But then again, this is a relatively new market with advanced technology and potentially a lot of room to grow.First time I came across Cotrol4, I got interested in this type of technology, feeling that there's definitely a strong trend developing. I am no expert on tech companies, so I will base my valuation on operating performance and projected cash flows, incorporating past results with current management's guidance to put it all in numbers, in order to determine fair value based on these assumptions. Recently I read a few excellent articles on Seeking Alpha, bullish and bearish, with quite reasonable opposing views, and decided to value the company from my perspective, focusing on cash flows with assumption on potential future developments. A combination of positive earnings, decent cash position, low debt and high growth, is the first thing that caught my attention, and intrigued me to value CTRL for a potential investment.The company's balance sheet looks pristine, with almost no interest bearing debt and a decent cash position, especially compared to current mkt cap. We have 97 million in cash and marketable securities compared to a 300 million mkt cap. Also a high revenue growth rate often holds a lot of potential, especially since the company is profitable.Source: 10kWhen I see a company with positive earnings and a high growth rate in revenues, this usually leads me to deeper analysis, because it can be a powerful combination for value creation. The Company expects revenue growth for 2015 in the range of 16-20%. As we can see from past performance these are reasonable expectations, and the fact that Control4 is operating in a growing market, supports this assumption.Source: 10kThe gross margin is pretty high, and the operating margin has been consistently increasing, which again supports expectations for quality growth.Another benefit that CTRL enjoys is the 0 tax expense, because of the preceding year's NOL the amount is expensed from cumulated losses. I will use a 5% effective tax rate in the DCF (as stated in the most recent financial report) to begin with and gradually increase to a marginal tax rate of 34% as the company matures.Thinking about future cash flows, one thing that I will change, in order to get a more realistic picture of operating performance is the actual reinvestment, since we have almost no capex that can justify this growth rate. I think it's reasonable to assume that a tech company can meet most of its reinvestment need through R&D, which is why I decided to capitalize R&D expenses.R&D which is usually treated as an operating expense in conventional accounting, in this situation I think we can get a more realistic picture if we treat it as capital expense.Operating income will be adjusted to reflect the capitalization of R&D expense. First the R&D will be added back to operating income. Next the amortization of the researched assets is treated the same way that depreciation is netted out to arrive at adjusted operating income.Source: 10kI will use this chart to assume how long it will take for research and development to be converted into commercial products, on average, this will be the amortizable life for these assets. I have chosen to use a 3 year amortization period.DCF ValuationCurrent market price: $12.5 Estimate fair value: $15.5For the model I will use:-risk free rate of 3%-Equity risk premium of 5.86%-2014 base operating income: $8.86 million-Beta 1.25-I will start with a 15% growth rate, set to gradually decrease over the next 10 years to 1.5% representing a stable growing mature company, for the terminal value calculation. Estimating the expected growth rate can change value substantially, so for example if we assume CTRL to have 10% growth instead of 15%, value would come down to 12.5$ per share.ConclusionThe valuation is based on 2014 operating results. For future assumptions on growth, I used managements guide for revenue growth for 2015 in between 16-20%, which I have set at 15% in the model, for the next 5 years before declining. One specific thing I have done in this valuation is the capitalization of R&D, which I believe makes more sense in this case to reflect true value. Currently I don't have an open position in CTRL. I plan to wait for the earnings release on 30 April 2015, before taking positions. Because of usual seasonality the first quarter is the weakest, as management anticipates weaker results, revenues are expected to come in between $32-35 million for the 1st Q 2015, so I will wait for the reaction after the results before taking a position. Playing this strategy can cause you to miss an opportunity, if the market moves before you have taken a position, but over time I have found that most of my big winners came from irrational movements in price after major events.Source: Presentation"

What I found was the exact opposite of the bearish thesis laid out in the article. More importantly, while I will offer a rebuttal of a view of bearish viewpoints, I believe the entire story around Control4 lacks credence for how significant the upside is for this company. Most investors have heard of the Internet of Things ""IoT"" market. I would loosely describe IoT as the coming technological revolution where almost any device or product could be a smart product connected to the internet or a network. You can pick your respected source on growth trends within market segments, and with unusual consistency, all forecasts are for mind-boggling growth in the IoT market over the next 5 to 10 years. Control4 sits at the tip of the spear within the connected home market. This connected home market will likely be one of the largest beneficiaries of the IoT movement given that the home is where the vast majority of one's time ends up being spent. Control4 provides a solution to integrate the hundreds, which will become thousands of devices throughout the home using its hardware and software platform. Control4 trades at a market cap of less than $300M. The company has an EV of ~$200M, thanks to a clean balance sheet with almost $100M in cash and no debt. Revenue has reached ~$150M per year, growing at a ~20% CAGR, and solid profitability is in the rear-view mirror. The target addressable market is much larger than many believe. Through organic growth or as an acquisition target, Control4 is undervalued by at least 65%.The Company And The OpportunityFor a more in-depth background on the company as far as how long it has been in business, its recent IPO, and other details I would point readers to other articles on Seeking Alpha. There are a number of articles that focus on those aspects of the company.If you have never heard of Control4 before, I will describe the company as a provider of hardware and software solutions for the connected home. Control4 provides products that connect, control, and automate the various components of the connected home. At its core, the primary product provided by Control4 is a controller appliance powered by a proprietary operating system that allows homeowners to automate various systems throughout the home. Historically, this has meant media, audio systems, lighting, thermostats, and security to name a few of the more prevalent connected devices that first made their way into the home. As the connected home market grows, the addressable market for products will grow with it including televisions, kitchen appliances, pool systems, and practically anything else that could have a chip installed inside it.Control4 sells its products exclusively through a worldwide dealer network that is over 3,000 strong. These dealers are typically high-end audio visual or electronics companies. To some, this is a knock against the company, the fact that Control4 does not sell direct to consumers. I would argue that a home network, done correctly, is complex enough that it requires professional installation, and this sets the Control4 model apart from the cheap DIY options available in the market. Also bear in mind that the vast majority of homeowners and those buying homes are not entry level or millennial buyers. We all know brilliant and successful people who can use an iPad but struggle to connect to a new wireless network when traveling. Imagine their desire to purchase a home networking system that requires them to set it up for autonomous operation of dozens of components. Tens of thousands of homeowners fit the above description, which is why the argument that DIY options will push Control4 out of the market are just plain wrong.The knock on Control4 from a bearish standpoint is that the product is too expensive to be mainstream. An entry level controller meant to power say video in one room, costs upwards of $750. The premium controller meant to power an entire house of connected devices, costs $1,500. These costs are just for the controllers themselves. When consumers begin to add lighting, media, whole house A/V, and other options the total price with install can approach $25,000. Control4 describes the pricing spread based on their research as follows from the 2014 annual report:The bearish argument very much centers on the entire Control4 experience being unaffordable. I would say this is simply not a good argument. The median home price of a new home sold in the US in early 2015 was over $275,000. For 1 to 2% of that price, a consumer could effectively create a smart home using a Control4 solution. I will expound on this later as a key tenant to the bullish thesis. The ability for Control4 to be an affordable option or upgrade in the new home sales process is an enormous growth opportunity that is relatively untapped at this point.The company currently believes that Control4 systems are in less than 1 out of every 10,000 homes and has aspirations to move that metric to 5 in every 10,000 homes. The opportunity is enormous, and the explosion of connected devices will only accelerate the growth rate for Control4.Competition Will Drive AwarenessIt is a concern of some investors that the changing dynamic and new entrants into the connected home market are a risk to Control4. Home security providers, cable/internet providers, and even Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with its latest HomeKit offering and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with its Nest acquisition represent an existential threat to Control4 in the opinion of some. I look at these major entrants into the connected home space in a completely different way. First, none provide the combined hardware and software offering that Control4 provides which is capable of truly automating an entire home. Second, and probably more importantly, the likes of Apple and Google offering systems for home connectivity will drive awareness for consumers and force companies that manufacturer home goods to accelerate their connectivity initiatives. As consumers become aware of what their connected home could be, and the product begins to flood the market, I anticipate there will be two distinct sets of consumers. There will be the smartphone geeks who are more than happy to use smartphones as a remote control for the television or to set the temperature on their Nest thermostat. There will also be those who want the whole shebang, who want to operate every item possible in their house through one application or touch point. They desire automation, extensive whole house media, audio-visual connectivity, security monitoring, and these consumers will seek a higher end solution such as that provided by Control4.The bearish argument is accurate that competition is increasing. The argument is flawed in many other ways. Just because LED lights, smart televisions, or other household items have built-in connectivity does not mean that any of the myriads of DIY or lower end connectivity solutions will seamlessly integrate with them. For this reason, Control4 developed Simple Device Discovery Protocol, a device discovery technology, launched in 2013. Over 100 third parties have licensed this royalty-free Technology, representing almost 550 devices. Less than a 3rd of the companies that had licensed the technology had begun shipping products as of the end of FY 2014. A substantial ramp in SDDP compatible products that will enter the market in the coming years. Most investors would probably be surprised to know that only about 35% of the total revenue for Control4 in FY 2014 came from the sale of its actual controller units. The balance came from sales of media, A/V equipment, lighting, security, and any other Control4 equipment. Consumers clearly have a gigantic selection of competing products, but they are choosing Control4 products. Why? The answer is the integrated solution offered.Also missing from the bearish argument is the concept that Control4 is a one hit wonder hardware company. Control4 is a software company. Over 40% of the company's employees work in R&D. The company notes in its annual report that the bulk of this R&D work centers around software development. The company spent 17% of its total annual revenue on R&D. Again the bearish argument talks about larger companies spending much more in absolute dollars on R&D than Control4. Not many companies, which are small and profitable, are investing at R&D levels equal to 17% of revenue. There is not a question of obsolescence with Control4 products. The software can, and is continually upgraded. If anything, a Control4 system is far less likely to go obsolete than the majority of electronics that do not have the ability to be upgraded that proliferate our homes today.Get Ready For GrowthHere is where the story starts to get exciting for investors. To recap from earlier, Control4 is already a $150M a year revenue company, growing at ~20% CAGR over the last few years. Non-GAAP operating income of over $13M was achieved in FY 2014, which was about 9.6% of revenue and an over 300bps increase from the prior year. The operating model is built to see massive leverage from top-line growth.To date, Control4 has mainly served the existing home market with the majority of its sales and marketing efforts focused on dealer training and leads. The company has noted that 2015 will mark a major shift in how it reaches the consumer market. On a recent conference call, management noted that it was in the process of building its inside sales team prior to launching a direct to consumer brand awareness and advertising campaign in 2015. Marketing work done over the last 24 months had led the company to realize it was missing opportunities due to lack of staffing from a sales standpoint. Specifically this is what the company said in its latest annual report:Said another way, Control4 lacked internal resources to respond to consumer inquiries directly and appropriately route those consumers to dealers. The result was the decision that it was time to directly market to consumers given the demand for the product and to continue to build awareness. I expect this effort to begin to pay dividends in the latter half of 2015 and moving forward. The company also made it clear that its financial model accounts for this advertising and sales staff ramp while still anticipating that its operating income as a percent of revenue would grow during 2015.The other significant source of growth that the company is tapping into is the new home market. Control4 has already signed on with Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), the largest national builder serving the luxury segment of the new home market. Control4 ended the last quarter with its products available as optional home upgrades in 18 Toll communities. This is a drop in the bucket in terms of how large Toll Brothers is, with over 250 communities nationwide. Toll Brothers expects to deliver up to 6,000 new homes this year, and the average price of the homes it has sold in backlog is about $750,000. Control4 also announced on its last earnings call that it had recently signed another national builder to an agreement and would begin rolling out its product in that builders communities during the coming year. These national agreements are in addition to dozens of regional builders partners the company has already signed. Control4 noted in its annual report that its presence in new home communities starts where home prices average $300,000 or above. This is an important point of information for those who believe the addressable market is not large enough. The average price of a new home sold in early 2015, across the U.S., was ~$275,000. With long-term demand requiring at least 1M new homes to be built annually, the new home market is simply low hanging fruit. Wiring homes and outfitting them with the capabilities of all the connected devices is far simpler during the build process than retrofitting an existing home. Just as importantly, a huge part of the homebuilder model today is selling options or upgrades to buyers. While a $25,000 home automation sounds expensive with no context, it is much different when you think of it as a value added option to a new home, which can be included as part of a mortgage.The company is already deep into the international markets with almost 25% of its FY 2014 revenue related to international business. Control4 has the first mover advantage with its robust international dealer base, and I would look to the international markets to continue to exhibit significant growth.Lastly, while it is a small and immaterial part of the business today, Control4 does offer a software service for $100 per year which is similar to what competitors such as Dropcam offer today. This service functions as a cloud app allowing for storage and remote device control when outside of the home. Management has noted that it expects a high attach rate of this service moving forward. When you consider the company could soon be selling 100,000 controllers a year, an attach rate with new controller sales of 50% would be material. The value would be another $5M in earnings or $.20 in EPS.Financial Outlook and ValuationFor some background, the following table provides key financial data points for the company and current valuation metrics:The table below from the 2014 10-K provides a look at the revenue growth, and non-GAAP earnings and EPS over the last five years.What stands out very clearly is the close to 20% revenue CAGR, gross margin % expanding over 900bps in a five-year period and over 350 bps in just the last three years? You also see significant Non-GAAP operating income % expansion, going from -19% in 2010 to 9.6% in 2014. Comparing just 2014 to 2013, revenue grew by about 15% or $20M while Non-GAAP operating income expanded by over $5M or 250bps. Again, this speaks to the significant operating leverage the company is already realizing and expects to realize moving forward. The company expects its gross margin to continue to expand from the 51% level to closer to 54% and its non-GAAP operating income % to expand to closer to 14% in the long term.Shares of Control4 were trading at around $16 when the company announced its Q4 2014 earnings and provided 2015 guidance. The guidance for Q1 2015 was weaker than expected, with the mid-point implying only about 5% growth. However, Control4 has seen lumpy growth before, with this weakness in Q1 not being a new phenomenon. In fact, if you look at the table below, the company is essentially implying that growth over the remainder of 2015 after Q1 is in the books will approach 22%.I give readers two key takeaways from this. The company introduced a number of new hardware products and a major software upgrade in Q1 2015, which undoubtedly led to dealers and consumers holding off on new installs. Additionally, the back-half loaded growth guidance implies that new marketing initiatives and work with new home builders should begin to bear fruit later in 2015. The stock trades 25% lower today than it did prior to providing its 2015 guidance. Should the company continue to maintain its guidance when it reports its Q1 2015 earnings report in late April or early May, I think the stock has 25% upside immediately. The upside will come from the investment community pounding the table that the story is still intact and that growth is potentially accelerating to over 20% going forward with the new initiatives taking hold. Bear in mind that the average analyst price target is ~$20 per share, with the low target at $17 per share, compared to the ~$12 per share where the stock trades today.From a valuation standpoint, a large number of the competitors to Control4 in the pure-play high end connected home market are private. However, there have been recent transactions that help provide a case for what Control4 should be worth today. Control4 was bid up to the moon, or almost $30 per share in 2014, when Google purchased Nest for over $3B. Putting any type of multiple on this acquisition and using it as a comp for Control4 is useless. Google paid a multiple that was out of this world with the company looking to get into this space at any cost. I point out the acquisition though as how desperately large technology companies want to be in this space and what they are willing to pay. A better comparable is the acquisition of AMX, a competitor or at least complementary provider in the connected home market. The transaction was private. However, it was estimated that the $365M acquisition by Harman valued AMX at almost 2.25x sales. Control4 currently trades at 1.2x on a forward EV/Sales basis and 1.65x sales on a forward basis. Using the sales comp from the AMX acquisition alone, Control4 is undervalued by over 30% currently. However, AMX was thought to be growing revenue at a de-minimis rate. Adjusting for the pristine balance sheet of Control4, a very conservative estimate of valuation a 2x forward EV/Sales would show that shares are 65% undervalued at their current level.The Final Take AwayControl4 represents an extremely undervalued company whose entire business is built to serve the next great boom in consumer spending, with the IoT and connected home market.I honestly would tell you to ignore some of the bearish points that were previously raised. Accounts receivable growth and Accounts payable growth as red flags? These are honestly just silly red flags with a lumpy business in terms of installs being the culprit for any changes in working capital as the company has noted multiple times. The bearish argument talked about price cuts on its controllers being a red flag. If the company is cutting prices, while still growing gross margin, this rebuts another bearish argument about the cost of the product being too high. I would love to see average product prices decline, and gross margins continue to rise, which means the addressable market is growing, and the company is just as or more profitable. Insider share sales or an implied lack of insider share ownership was cited as a red flag. The company has over 4M stock options granted, against a base of 23M outstanding shares. Insiders have a massive incentive to see the company perform well and for value creation to drive shares higher. The stock-based compensation is all you need to look at along with stock options outstanding to know that insiders have incentives to drive the stock higher. I could offer rebuttal after rebuttal, but I truly believe the red flags are more grasping at straws than anything.The true risk for Control4 will be from new competitors who may enter the market. This is a growing and dynamic market. Control4 is certainly a leader today. I would argue that the risk is that Control4 is limited to serving the higher end of the market only, which still proves that the company is undervalued today as the company is not chasing the low-end of the connected home market. The risk to the bearish thesis is that the connected home device market is so fragmented it requires more than just an app on a smartphone to integrate all the possible devices seamlessly in a home. That a company with solutions like Control4 begins to move down the food chain and materially captures a much greater share of the market than the current investment thesis takes into account.The catalysts for shares to move higher are numerous. The first is for the company to continue to execute. If earnings and guidance meet expectations with the next earnings report, I would expect an explosive move higher with almost 20% of the float held as short shares. The second catalyst is continued consolidation in the space, either through other connected home companies being acquired and providing additional valuation insight for Control4 and speculation as was seen with the Nest acquisition. Finally, the company sits on almost $100M in cash and equivalents. The cash balance will lead to one of three potential outcomes. First, the company will continue to bolt on small acquisitions, as it has done in the past, leading to additional top-line growth and aiding valuation. Second, an activist or potential acquirer will be lured by the opportunity to unlock value at these depressed values that will force shares higher. Or finally, the company will take note of its depressed stock price and put in place a material stock repurchase plan. The company is generating material amounts of cash through operations and could easily afford to spend $50M on a buyback that would represent just less than 20% of its current market cap.The time is now to jump into this name. The downside is minimal given the balance sheet strength and the size of the addressable market, not matter the competitive threats. The upside is tremendous and should the company succeed on its goal to see its business grow by a scale of 5 times, the 65% upside target will be a drop in the bucket compared to how high shares could go. I am long the stock through common shares with an entry price under $12 per share as well as long the stock through July dated call options."
3193546,48411,2015-05-18T19:08:54-04:00,Control4 reported yet another absolute nightmare of a quarter.I think CTRL might have a management problem on its hands.CTRL's back-to-back failures to execute are warning signs to investors thinking there's value here.Continue to avoid CTRL.,"What another horrible quarter for Control4 Corporation (NASDAQ:CTRL). I learned my lesson in regards to owning this name the first go round after watching more than half my gains evaporate on a poor Q4/14 report, in which the company made public its first disappointing guidance. In light of how quickly the situation at CTRL has devolved, I feel lucky that I escaped that trade with any gains at all.Now, it appears, things have only proceeded to get much worse (with the company proceeding to capitulate post Q1/15 reporting with a share buyback announcement), as CTRL gave granularity into a laundry list of problems encountered and further revised full-year guidance lower. The PR and the investor call read like an obituary - only they read as an advance one about a company on a death row, ""dead company walking, dead company walking"". All of the cautionary warnings I was advised with prior to initiating my first long position seem to be coming to fruition.Where do we even start? CTRL reported a 1% increase to revenue Y/Y, a non-GAAP net loss of $1.2 million (a total net income to net loss swing of ~$2.0 million), an 8 cent negative swing to EPS (again non-GAAP), a 600 bps uptick to OPEX (as a percentage of revenues) which apparently had zero effect on driving top line (and given guidance, it appears it won't), and maybe worse of all that it shipped only 13,931 controllers in the quarter, which was down significantly from 16,224 a year ago (14% reduction Y/Y). All of these are deeply concerning, but the key metric deterioration on higher OPEX for me takes the cake. I just don't see how CTRL can explain that away as ""weather"", ""construction delays"", or ""seasonal industry pullback"" - all excuses that management tried to conveniently fit as drivers behind the negative narrative.To be fair, there was a bit of all of that (if you take management's word for it and I have no reason to think it would outright lie) that took place during the quarter, and CTRL, because of a failure to execute a product launch correctly, did end the quarter with a historically large backlog of orders. So, some of Q1's performance was simply pulled back to Q2, and this, along with management alluding to a hot start in March and April, should do well to bump Q2 numbers, but should that excuse the fact that there was a product launch debacle? Apparently, the market doesn't believe it should and neither do I. This is two quarters in a row of a failure to execute across several initiatives, and with shares down ~50% from post-IPO highs, it might be time for the Board and for major shareholders to consider new management. I mean, what does CTRL have to lose?A great example of sitting management either being inept or careless, neither are acceptable, is CTRL's mid-quarter announcement of new products (with upgraded capabilities) at a trade show. Immediately following this trade show, according to management, orders sharply declined for existing products. Was this unexpected? If so, management has to go. There's no way a competent manager thought that this wouldn't happen. So that means that either management is not of the capacity to do this job or it deliberately sabotaged the company's quarter. I would opt for the former rather than latter if given the choice. Exaggerations aside, I think my point is made. I mean, how does this happen? Management further gave color, saying that the sharper-than-expected decline in existing product orders exacerbated the inability to fill new product orders. You cannot be serious.Further, what will distributors, I mean direct dealers' reaction be to hearing that the reason they couldn't move units sitting on shelves was because of management? A direct result of foolishness at the top? Remember, they weren't aware of what was going on during Q1 when it was happening. I'm sure management wasn't making personal calls saying how it might have caused the sales drag all the way down to the store level.Worse, on the investor call, management updated that CTRL's engagements with a ""top10"" homebuilder were progressing to the point of installation planning for initial home installations - I wonder how a homebuilder with clearly a lot to lose views a company's inability to deliver product on time as scheduled? I wonder if this homebuilder is considering the reputational risk and the customer experience that would come with such a failure. I'm sure these are the primary table discussions with raw materials suppliers and with that the entire supply chain at the builder. I just think this couldn't have come at a worse time.It will be very interesting to get net new dealer counts and an update as to this homebuilder addition at Q2 reporting. My guess is that we see some disruption to the norm with a worst-case scenario being the homebuilder wanting to delay the installation processes. Who knows, Q2 could report no change to the status quo, but are longs really wanting to roll the dice again on CTRL? I guess it's ""double or nothing, double or nothing"" for those who aren't seeing CTRL clear enough to say ""dead company walking, dead company walking"".I continue to recommend an avoid of CTRL.Good luck everybody."
2968766,74905,2015-03-03T12:20:50-05:00,"Control4 shares fell again today on the news of two board members resigning.The market reaction is understandable, but long-term investors shouldn't be scared away.This represents another opportunity for long term investors.","Control4 (NASDAQ:CTRL) dropped again today on news of two board members submitting their resignations, effective after the annual shareholder meeting scheduled for April 28, 2015. According to the 8K, the resignation was not due to disagreements with the company, but for the members to pursue other opportunities. The board members, Mr. Steve Vassalo & Mr. Len Jordan, are both venture capitalists who were the last two remaining early investors on the board. Mr. Frazier invested in Control4 in June 2004, and Mr. Vassalo invested in Control4 in July 2005. A search is currently underway to find replacements for the board, and in the meantime two current board members have been appointed to fill the duties of the departing board members.How Investors Should ReactConsidering the current short interest in Control4 (which, according to Yahoo! Finance, sat just below 20%, as of February 13), it is not a surprise that CTRL shares took another dip on the news. However, I believe that this is quite a short-term view of the company. As I have stated in previous coverage of CTRL, I think the company represents a wonderful opportunity for long term investors to profit from the growing trends of home automation and the Internet of Things. Investors should remember that both of these board members are venture capitalists, with numerous activities according to their above linked profiles. I believe that this shows investors can have faith that what the company is telling us about their reasoning behind resigning is true.It is worth noting that one of the two firms that they work for does not have Control4 listed as a current investment, meaning it is likely the firm itself exited their initial investment in the IPO. The other firm does have Control4 listed under its companies, however I am not sure if this means that the firm is currently heavily invested in CTRL. If so, it is likely that it will be selling its position with the board member's resignation, which could cause the stock to drop again and give long-term investors another opportunity to buy. Historically speaking, most venture capitalists try to exit their positions on IPOs, and both partners who sit on the board have a long list of other companies that they are actively involved in. Thus is not surprising that both firms would want out of their initial investment. In fact, it is more surprising to me that they have stayed on this long, especially considering that all other early investors exited their positions.There are a few things investors should do to react to this news. First, long term investors should continue adding to their positions at these depressed levels. The current forward P/E is now sitting at 14.65, and the company is starting to look undervalued considering how huge its potential market is. Personally, I added to my long position today and I am prepared to continue adding if it tests or falls below its 52-week low of $11.76. The most important thing long-term investors should remember when the market reacts to news like this is that these types of sell-offs are normally temporary & shortsighted, and do not signify that the company is failing.Second, all investors should continue to follow the company and see who is hired to replace the departing board members. I want to see Control4 find board members with a strong track record who believe in the home automation trend long term & are dedicated to increasing shareholder value. Hiring such a person would serve to increase my long-term bull thesis, and help the stock gain some ground short-term. Even if the new board members don't seem to be perfect fits, it is likely that the negative reaction was priced into the stock today, and investors should feel safe adding to their positions right now.Finally, this could be an opportunity for short-term investors as well, as the growing short interest and huge drop in shares from last quarter's earnings report are beginning to give the stock a look of being oversold. At this point, any good news or an earnings beat could cause a short squeeze that would send the shares upwards significantly. Considering that this management team has been lowballing future estimates in the past, it is certainly a strong possibility that they surpass expectations next quarter.ConclusionsWhether you are a short-term or long-term investor, it is hard to deny the market opportunity that home automation has. Going forward, it is important that investors drown out the noise created by days such as this and focus solely on results & management's ability to capture market share. While last quarter's results weren't spectacular, I still believe in this company long-term and will not be exiting my position unless it becomes clear that management is failing to capitalize on the market opportunity. Currently, I still have faith that this management team is capable of delivering growth that will propel the stock upwards, and I believe Control4 will be a major player in the home automation market. Long-term investors just have to maintain a level head and wait for the market to realize this as well. In the meantime, selloffs like today's are good opportunities to initiate or add to a position in CTRL."
3074936,48311,2015-04-17T10:49:07-04:00,"Fellow contributor called Control4 a fantastic investment opportunity.
        By my calculations the company has to show tremendous growth for 10 years to be considered undervalued.
        The company has no competitive advantage wich will make that virtually impossible to achieve.","April 14, 2015 Seeking Alpha published a Pro Top Idea called IoT Investment Opportunity With Multiple Paths To Significant Share Price Gains. Fellow contributor Money Investor argues Control4 (NASDAQ:CTRL) is a fantastic investment opportunity. Respectfully, I must disagree vehemently.Control4 sells home automation systems through a network of independent dealers. That means it sells smart devices and appliances in all shapes and forms, the control tools to handle it all and the software that ties everything together. It is a small $200 million Enterprise Value company. Money Investor argues it is at least 65% undervalued because of the large addressable market and high growth rate.If there is a large addressable market and a company is growing fast that can be an attractive investment. The first thing to check for is a competitive advantage. Growth does not necessarily equal value creation. A growth market will attract a lot of competition and a competitive advantage is necessary to generate returns above and beyond the company's cost of capital. In a competitive market it can be very expensive to drive revenue so the benefit to the shareholder is non-existent.I grabbed my copy of Competition Demystified (Greenwald, 2007) and applied its stringent criteria for a competitive advantage to Control4. Greenwald identifies three kinds of genuine competitive advantages:-Supply-Demand-Economies of scaleThe firm clearly does not have economies of scale. It is tiny and it competes against much larger firms as it acknowledges in its K-10. To make matters worse it offers solutions that include a wide variety of products.The company does not have a demand advantage. There is little brand awareness among customers as the company has chosen a push marketing model instead of a pull model. This means it is focusing its budget on training and educating independent distributors and awareness among industry people is likely very high. It also helps this is a higher end solution in that regard. Meanwhile, the customer is not asking for the products to the extent he or she would be if marketed to directly and thus not pulling it through the channel. Nothing wrong with the model, it is often a fine choice, but it does not help to setup a competitive demand advantage. To my knowledge this is not easily changed. Dealers who are installers and distributors tend to not like it very much if the company starts to sell directly to customers. If the company switches to that approach it will definitely lose some dealer support.Finally, there is supply as a possible source of a competitive advantage. The company's products are made by contract manufacturer in Southern China so its products are not unique from that perspective but the company does have a number of patents:Intellectual property like patents increase the difficulty for competitors to match the company's products. The number of patents is not impressive but patents can be worth something when they are filed in relation with a new important technology. What I think is a negative is that the patents generally apply to the functions of its C4 Operating System and applications associated with its platform. I am not convinced investing in an OS is going to do much good for the company and do not think its worth very much.Meanwhile there is a lot of capital being invested in the space and the company acknowledges a high level of competition in its 10-K (tickers added by author):It remains to be seen which of these players will achieve a good RoIC here.Money Investor cites two profitable years after losing money for many more as a sign of great things to come. I am skeptical the company will be able to keep up margins because there is basically no valid reason for it to enjoy a good margin.The only way for this to be a great investment is if the IP portfolio or software is worth way over $200 million+.Money Investor estimates the company to be significantly undervalued:Without a sustainable competitive advantage at 28.9x FCF it is hard for me to understand how this is undervalued by 65%. There is nothing about the company's business model that makes it hard for competition to enter the market and compete for share except a few patents.Sure, I think the company will grow the number of systems it sells but I doubt it will grow EPS at the rate required to justify 65% undervaluation. If it were undervalued that much, that would put fair value at $21.2. When I put the current earnings in a DCF model at $0.32 per share and model growth for the next 10 years (0% terminal growth rate) and discount against the S&P 500 average gain of 11%, I need to put in a growth rate of 29% annually to get there. Twenty-nine-percent for the next ten years. That is a high bar.Note that the company is actually not paying a lot of taxes currently and it were profitable from here on that would change. Corporate taxes would be a very significant additional headwind to overcome.At the same time the average acquisition premium falls well short of 65%. Actually according to Valuation for Mergers and Acquisitions:So I don't believe this is an additional road to unlock 65% of value. It may well be the only way to win on this investment but in my experience it is not good practice, to throw in some poker lingo; have only that one out.Up till now I've pretended the company's margins are sustainable. But I don't believe they will be sustainable. The company currently achieves an unbelievable gross margin of 51,3%.I'm calling it an unbelievable margin because think about that; 51.3% gross margins for basically selling electronics and appliances through a network of independent professionals. Logitech is a competitor with a well known consumer brand selling all kinds of electronic gear. With a turnover of $2 billion it should benefit from better economies of scale as compared to CTRL. Most of the stuff it sells is not at the forefront of an exciting new industry (anymore) so margins are just 36.5%. Samsung Electronics, the Korean giant in electronics and a competitor, achieves margins of 38.5%. I'm not saying these competitors are not achieving better margins on their IoT products, my point is that one point the other products they made were also exciting new technology but the margins have come down. Unless you have a solid competitive advantage it is a matter of time.This independent sales force comes at a price to the company. Obviously, the company has to give up some of its margin for these dealers to turn a profit on units sold. When the novelty of connected appliances wears off and prices come down it is going to become increasingly difficult to maintain these relationships.Prices are really high right now. To quote Money Investor:Paying 10% of my new home's price, as Money Investor suggested, for some state of the art electronics does not appeal to me at all. My girlfriend recently bought and installed a Sonos wireless system for a couple hundred dollars. You can control that from your laptop or smartphone or desktop and you can either do one room or many rooms if you want audio everywhere. It is very inexpensive compared to this and I don't believe for a second the affluent buyers of $750.000 homes will not notice the discrepancy in price and the lack of discrepancy in value.To quote an installer:Customers are going to wise up fast and not shell out $25k for systems that are obsolete in 7 years.A customer looking to implement a home automation system for two thermostats, a couple of lights and two door locks received a bid for >$5K. I quote:In my opinion the vast majority of people will like to use their smartphones to access devices in their homes. The dedicated controllers are much faster and more responsive, don't run out of battery constantly and you don't have to get your brother to quit playing Angry birds so you can dim the lights but ultimately I don't think anyone will desire to lug around some control device for their home. Not at home and not away from home.How does that work with a control device in the home? Does the man of the house keep it with him at all times? Opens the garage door from the couch when you send him a Whatsapp driving up to it?Let's face it this functionality needs to be wearable and it requires multiple secure access points. This is a natural fit for smartphones or watches or something like that. A dedicated tablet or remote control just for controlling your home is an early stage solution because there are usability problems with tablet/smartphone controls.Image: New SR-260Because I think the dedicated controller is not a user friendly way feature I view it as a negative 35% of revenue comes in through controller units. In all fairness, sources state the remote is really fast and responsive though. That the rest of revenue comes from the sale of equipment and appliances is even more worrisome. It is possible there is a window of opportunity for companies to sell these things at a markup because of the novelty factor but that won't last. These are commodity products. The only thing that will last is software.In my opinion software and patents are the only valuable assets of the company. However, I don't like its OS. The company can not realistically be expected to build a competitive OS that extends to mobile/wearables. But the OS used to access home control apps needs to be multifunctional. This is very much going to be a game of: One ring to rule them all.There are already a number of OS that are light years ahead in the way of an ecosystem of supporting software. That's why my expectations for Control4 are limited.My final problem with Money Investors thesis is he uses Non-GAAP operating income to substantiate the profitability of the company:And at the same time uses ""massive incentives"" in the form of stock based compensation and stock options as a defense to bear arguments that management owns no shares.These most definitely are incentives for insiders but they do not necessarily benefit shareholders. These massive incentives are a final headwind not factored in my DCF calculation that shows how difficult it is for this company to be considered significantly undervalued.Don't get me wrong; There is nothing wrong with the product. A Mercedes Benz is also a very nice car but that does not make the carmaker a good investment. Think twice before you invest in this thing as I've shown it needs immense growth to be considered undervalued. At best you get bailed out by a takeover bid but otherwise I don't see how this company is worth much more than $8 per share."

2897266,74905,2015-02-10T03:06:00-05:00,"CTRL reported earnings on Thursday.Although CTRL reported strong top and bottom growth, investors were disappointed due to light guidance for next quarter.Despite the market reaction, I think CTRL is a buy.","IntroductionControl4 (NASDAQ:CTRL) released earnings Thursday, and the results were not well received by the market. Although the company reported record revenue and a 50% year-over-year increase in Non-GAAP earnings, they offered light guidance for the next quarter, which caused the stock to shed almost 20% in the next trading session. While many seemed to be disappointed by the earnings, I feel as though the report showed a healthy, growing company that still has a very favorable long-term outlook. I will continue to accumulate shares on dips, and feel comfortable with this investment. As a reminder to investors, CTRL reports both GAAP and Non-GAAP numbers. Unless otherwise specified, I will be dissecting the Non-GAAP numbers, as they are the ones management refers to during the conference call. Furthermore, all data in this article is taken from the press releases found on the Control4 Website, or from the quarterly conference call.The Earnings Report: The Good, The Bad, and The UglyCTRL's numbers appeared extremely strong. Quarterly revenue was up 15%, and full fiscal year 2014 revenue was up 16%. Earnings per share (EPS) increased 40% for the full year 2014, from $0.38 in 2013 to $0.53 in 2014. Also noteworthy, GAAP EPS was up 100% for 2014, and the gap between GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings appears to be closing. If we look at the Non-GAAP EPS to get a P/E ratio based on current stock price, we get a P/E around only 24.5, which represent significant upside given the potential market size of the home automation industry. Margins increased as well this quarter, and the company maintains a strong cash position with little debt.The business itself continues to show strong signs of growth. Mr. Plaehn announced that their SDDP (Simple Device Discovery Protocol) continues to be put into more and more products, and at CES it was announced that the CTRL SDDP will be in the newest Panasonic Ultra HDTVs. Control4 now has over 114 manufacturers shipping over 560 products with SDDP inside, and more manufacturers are coming. Dealer adds, another important metric to follow with this company, continue to look strong. During Q4, CTRL added 77 dealers to bring their total number of active dealers to 2,588, 97% of their certified dealers (CTRL defines active dealers as dealers that purchased products for customers in the previous 12 months). Internationally, CTRL added 34 new dealers, to bring their total to 685 of which 87% were active. They shipped 22,737 main control units in the quarter, representing a strong year-over-year increase of 29.5%. This boost in controller shipments represents the addition of newer, lower cost controllers that are now available and should make home automation more available to the common homeowner. Besides the well-known Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) partnership, management also mentioned they are going to announce another deal with a large homebuilder in the upcoming month which should further increase their market penetration.Management also continues to aggressively acquire smaller companies to streamline their growth, as evident by their announcement of the acquisition of Leaf. These acquisitions, as seen by their previous acquisition of Extra Vegetables, will help streamline their production line and increase margins, as well as solidify their position as the top home automation company on the market. They also announced their expansion into Germany, which they see as a possibly rapidly expanding market. This shows another facet of Control4 that I believe is getting lost on investors- long term, this company will not be dependent on the US housing market to be successful. Many people think that this investment is tied solely to new home builds in the US, but I do not think that is the case. Their large and rapidly growing international presence means that they will have exposure to housing markets across the world, and should not be tied solely to the housing market in the US. Furthermore, I believe that looking at home automation as a housing play is a mistake in the first place, as I believe it will be more commonly undertaken by consumers as a home improvement then to be added on to new builds. This is especially true when considering the price of a full home automation, which many new or first-time homebuyers may be hesitant to add on to the already expensive purchase of a new home. Thus, I believe that looking at home starts in the US to be a poor metric to predict future results for Control4.While quarterly revenue predictions for the next quarter came in lower than expected, management did lay out revenue growth for the full year that was more in line with guidance. It should also be noted that Q1 tends to be their weakest quarter historically, so a weak upcoming quarter should not be surprising to investors. I do not think that this is an indication that Contorl4 is in any trouble long term, and management has specified that the weakness they are encountering for this quarter is not expected to be a long-term problem. Still, investors should monitor this quarter and upcoming guidance with particular scrutiny, and if next quarter they again lower guidance I would expect it to be hard for them to meet their 2015 annual goals. For now, though, I believe that management has the company on the right track to continue growth and that the market has now priced in all downside to the stock for the upcoming year, making it a good long term buying opportunity at present.ConclusionInvestors must be patient with this investment. The market is extremely new, and there will certainly be some rocky times ahead. Despite that, I am pleased with my investment right now and confident that the company will be able to grow shareholder value significantly in the long term. In fact, I believe that the sharp drop in share price on Friday is attributable more to short sellers than a poor quarter. Short interest in CTRL has risen to 17% of the float, according to Yahoo! Finance. With such a high short interest on a thinly traded stock, owners of CTRL should not be surprised that anything short of a perfect quarter was met with a sharp downturn in stock price. I do not see anything in the fundamentals this quarter that lead me to believe that the company is in trouble. Top and bottom line growth were both strong, margins are improving, and the company has an extremely favorable balance sheet with a strong cash position. Long term, the company continues to expand its network of dealers and partners, and seems to be very much on its way to establishing itself as the premier home automation company. Their aggressiveness in acquiring smaller companies in the space and rapid expansion of products & software should give investors faith that long term the company will be a leader in a large market. The expansion of SDDP should especially help drive growth as more consumers become aware of the benefits home automation bring. I believe CTRL has many years of huge growth ahead of it, and I will continue to accumulate shares as long as the market undervalues the company.Author's Note: I have been long CTRL since shortly after the IPO in 2013, and have written previous articles about the company, which can be accessed here)"
2632245,74905,2014-11-04T15:29:41-05:00,"Control4 reported earnings last week, including record numbers in revenue.Revenue growth was 16% YoY, earnings were up 33%, and margins rose by 120 bps.Control4 is executing its business plan as expected, and it is still a buy.","SummaryControl4 (NASDAQ:CTRL) recently reported its Q3 earnings, and the numbers did not disappoint. As recently detailed in my article on the company, I am quite bullish on its long-term prospects, and the recent report has shown that CTRL is executing its business plan as expected. The company is on track to continue its growth and maintain its position as a leader in the home automation market. Revenue was at a record high, and CTRL improved its profitability and margins. Furthermore, the CEO Martin Plaehn detailed exciting new developments on the conference call that should allow for sustainable growth into the future. I continue to hold my shares of CTRL, and will buy shares on dips as opportunities arise.As a reminder, all numbers are discussed on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and litigation settlement expenses. Investors should also note that Control4 classifies its revenue into two main categories, each with two subcategories. The first is International vs. North America (U.S. and Canada). The second is core revenue vs. other revenue, core revenue being the more common residential automation projects and other revenue being the larger, but lumpier, projects for hotels, businesses, etc.The Balance SheetControl4 reported revenue of $39.1 million, a 16% increase year-over-year and a record high for the company. North America core revenue was 15% higher YoY, while International core revenue was 16% higher. There was also $1.1 million in non-core revenue this quarter. Canada reported a 14% increase in revenue, and a 20% increase quarter-over-quarter. This is important to note because Canada was seen as an underperforming region last quarter, and management seems to have turned this around.Internationally, a large spike was seen in the U.K., reporting over 50% increases in revenue YoY. Dan Strong, the CFO, also mentioned that growth is picking up in India and China, although specific numbers were not released. The international numbers are extremely encouraging. As the business grows, the strength of the international network should help stabilize profits, forming a form of diversification that will help protect the company from any downswings in any one region's real estate market.Gross margins for the quarter were reported as 51.9%, which is an improvement of 120 bps year-over-year. Mr. Strong noted that gross margins are closing in on the long-term goal of 52%-54%, and he expects for the improvements of gross margin to slow down and stabilize over the next few quarters. While the company may not see the huge improvements in margins that it has seen over the past year, the fact that it is already reaching long-term operational goals gives confidence to the investor in the management team.Non-GAAP earnings per share for Q3 were reported at $0.16, the high end of the guidance range and a 33% increase year-over-year. Operating margins were 11.7%, compared to 8.9% year-over-year. Control4 continues to improve both profitability and operating margins, and when taking into account Non-GAAP earnings, it drops the company's P/E ratio to a more acceptable level. According to Yahoo Finance, the 5-year PEG is 1.58, which is an attractive level for a growth stock. Investors should also note that there has not been a significant increase in debt, despite the company making an acquisition during the quarter. Overall, the balance sheet continues to look healthy.To conclude the financials of the company, Mr. Strong laid out guidance for the next quarter. He expects revenue to be between $41 million and $43 million, and non-GAAP net income to be between $4.3 million and $5.7 million, or between $0.16 and $0.22 per diluted share. These numbers were roughly in line with previous estimates, and indicate that there are no signs of financial weakness in the immediate future.The Conference Call & the Future of the CompanyThere were numerous developments that the CEO mentioned on the conference call that leave me excited to be a shareholder in CTRL. Mr. Plaehn discussed at length the increase in Control4 certified dealers, which now number over 3200 worldwide. These dealers have posted impressive activity numbers, with 97% of North American dealers and 88% of International dealers active during the quarter. Mr. Plaehn also discussed new software that was released that will help dealers simplify and accelerate the setup of Control4 systems - Composer Express. Composer Express is expected to reduce dealer installation time by up to 70%, and will dramatically reduce device registration and configuration time. The software will help dealers expand their business by decreasing training time and installation time for technicians. The software aims to increase dealer throughput and profitability. In my opinion, it should also lower the total cost to consumers of the Control4 system, as it should decrease costs of installation and maintenance, as well as decrease the amount of service calls necessary by allowing for more services to be done remotely. In the long run, this will be part of the process of home automation technology becoming cheaper and thus more accessible to the average homeowner. Assisting with the decrease of costs to the consumer is the acquisition of Extra Vegetables, which Mr. Plaehn discussed during the conference call. The Extra Vegetables acquisition will allow the company to cut device costs by bringing many third-party devices under the Control4 name, thus streamlining device manufacturing and passing cost savings down through the dealers and the consumers.Mr. Plaehn also discussed the future of the home automation industry and his view of Control4's role as a leader in the industry at length. One point that he discussed thoroughly is that Control4 is not necessarily a standalone option in home automation (although it has the ability to do that as well). The company is selling a product that has the ability to connect numerous third-party devices. Upon reading the conference call, it is obvious that Control4 does not necessarily aim to be the only winner in the home automation market; its goal is to increase the operability of hundreds of different devices and apps by linking them all through the Control4 network. For example, Control4 devices utilize all different sorts of communication standards, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee, to connect devices that otherwise would need their own operating system for connectivity. Through this strategy, Control4 will make companies such as Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Nest a complementary service to a Control4 home. Indeed, during the conference call, Nest is specifically mentioned as being fully interoperable with the Control4 system. This helps assuage the common bear thesis that big competitors will get into the market and run Control4 out. By making Nest and other smart hardware devices complementary, Control4 will be able to make itself the standard option in home automation, able to link your thermostat to your lighting systems, home entertainment systems, and even your pool into one easy-to-use control device.Mr. Plaehn also talks about the use of SDDP, or simple device discovery protocol. SDDP's implementation in devices such as Sony (NYSE:SNE) HDTVs was an exciting development I outlined in my original thesis. During the conference call, Mr. Plaehn also announced that 21 more agreements were signed during Q3 with manufacturers to integrate SDDP into their products. There are now over 100 manufacturers shipping over 530 models with SDDP installed, and the increase in SDDP reiterates my stance that Control4 will be synonymous in the mind of consumers with home automation. A few other announcements were made during the call that will serve to further cement CTRL's place in the minds of consumers. Control4 recently released a new Operating System that includes entire integration with streaming devices from companies such as Denon and Sonus, and the company now has 29 agreements with large-scale regional builders. Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) is fully trained with Control4, and available at 1200 construction sites. These ever-expanding partnerships with industry leaders bode well for the future of the companyThe last major point discussed during the conference call was the shift from a sales focus to a marketing focus for the company. Mr. Plaehn acknowledges that to increase Control4's market penetration, it needs to conduct more marketing campaigns. He has hired two outside firms to help create marketing plans, with the end state being broader consumer awareness of the brand. This should be a good thing for the company in the long run, as the home automation market is still relatively unknown or misunderstood by homeowners. It also signals to investors a new phase in the growth of the company, as sales have stabilized to the point that the financial metrics of the company won't be affected by putting an increase in money towards marketing. Although there is some concern that this may have a negative effect on margins, Mr. Strong was adamant on the conference call that this will not be the case.Red FlagsApart from the possible decrease in margins from an increase in marketing spending discussed above, the biggest threat to the company remains a large outside company coming into the space and competing with it directly. Management has been very consistent with this every quarter, and they see any company coming in as being complementary to their business, as opposed to outright competition. Personally, I don't see this as very likely. It would require a lot of resources and money for an outsider such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Google to come in and build the type of infrastructure and distribution chain that Control4 has already established. While these companies already have name brand recognition and a healthy digital ecosystem that consumers recognize, I think it is much more likely that they work with companies such as Control4 to get their ecosystem integrated into the Control4 platform. This is a much less risky, and likely to be equally profitable, route for them to take. Furthermore, the longer anyone waits to get into the space, the more Control4 will be engrained into consumers as the best option for home automation. If we see any type of movement from the big players into this market, I think it will be a buyout of Control4, the possibilities of which were detailed in a recent SA article. Taking this route would allow a big company to utilize the current systems that Control4 has in place, which are already working well and profitable, and capitalize on the name brand that Control4 is building. If we do see a buyout, I would expect it to be well north of the current market cap of CTRL.ConclusionMr. Plaehn mentions that Control4 and the entire industry of home automation have only begun to scratch the surface of the smart home potential. I agree with his sentiment, and I see CTRL as a long-term growth stock that has the potential to continue its expansion and make shareholders very happy over the next 3-5 years. The potential for CTRL to be bought out by a larger company also looms large, and I expect any offer to be well north of the company's current market cap. The stock will probably continue to rise as shorts cover (short interest was hovering close to 25%), and I think that some of the post-earnings gains can be attributed to the shorts being squeezed. Thus, it is likely the shares will continue to be relatively volatile, and there will be more entry points on the way. I reiterate my bull case for CTRL, and will continue to accumulate shares on dips"
2573105,74905,2014-10-19T08:11:15-04:00,"Control4 is positioning itself as a market leader in an enormous untapped market.Through a growing list of partnerships, Control4 is ingraining itself into consumer psyche.Control4 has potential for explosive earnings and revenue growth, and has little debt on the balance sheet.","Company DescriptionControl4 (NASDAQ:CTRL) is a home automation company. Their main product is a home control system that links all electronics in the house. Control4 builds and installs its own products for home automation (light switches, thermostats, ETC), but is also compatible with most third party products. Control4's business model works through local dealers, which are trained and authorized by Control4. These dealers work with customers to design and install Control4's systems. Control4's products offer a wide range of price entry, from a simple starter kit that could be as little as $500 (easily the cheapest dedicated home automation system you can purchase), to complex installation projects that cost tens of thousands of dollars and connect your entire house.For the purpose of reading through financial statements and conference calls, investors should also note some unique features of the company. Control4 classifies their revenue into two main categories, each with two subcategories. The first is International vs. North America (U.S. & Canada). The second is core revenue vs. other revenue, core revenue being the more common residential automation projects and other revenue being the larger, but lumpier, projects for hotels, businesses, etc. Furthermore, earnings are discussed on conference calls and press releases on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and litigation settlement expenses.Thesis & Catalyst For Control4 CorporationControl4 has rapidly cooled down after its hot IPO last fall. From the time of the Control4 IPO and the news of NEST's sale to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), CTRL more than doubled in share price. Since then, it has greatly underperformed the market, dropping from a high of $32.5 to a recent low of $11.76. While there have been some minor hiccups in the business during this time, for the most part the company has continued to execute its business plan and seems to be on the road to success. I believe that Control4 represents a major opportunity in the rapidly growing market of home automation, which ties into the larger trend of the Internet of Things that is sweeping the tech world.The home automation market could very well play out to be one of the largest untapped markets over the next ten years. This is a market that includes every single homeowner in the entire world as a potential customer; a market that large that is mostly untapped doesn't come around very often. Control4 is a leader in this new and exciting market. With only one serious competitor in the privately owned Crestron, Control4 will have a sizable edge in R&D, customer loyalty, and brand recognition as the market grows and more competitors enter. As more competitors enter, the opportunity will prove to be large enough that everyone should still profit handsomely.With over 3,000 dealers (and counting) throughout the world, CTRL has the ability to deliver their product quickly and efficiently as market demand grows. Control4 continues to expand to better reach their long-term goals. The recent acquisition of Extra Vegetables, a company that developed integration modules and drivers for Control4, will help to streamline the business and perhaps boost margins. It will also allow for Control4 to have more control over its R&D and production. It shows that Control4 is dedicated to growing the business through R&D and acquisitions of companies that translate directly to their core business.CTRL is making themselves synonymous in the mind of consumers with home automation, similar to what Netflix has done with video streaming. Perhaps the best example of this, and the most exciting development at Control4, is the recent release of their Simple Device Discovery Protocol (SDDP). Through partnerships, CTRL has had this new software embedded on smart TVs, entertainment systems, and even backyard pool controllers. Leading companies in their industry, such as Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Hayward Pools, have acknowledged that Control4 is going to be a huge player in the home automation market, and Control4 is poised to profit nicely from the exposure to new customers that the many products carrying Control4 SDDP will bring them. Another exciting recent partnership is the one with Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), a U.S. homebuilder that is now including Control4 as an add-on in new developments. These partnerships could prove to have absolutely huge effects on CTRL's bottom line, although so far it is too soon to see just how huge the impact will be.ValuationKey financial statistics (as taken from Yahoo! Finance) show a company with strong earnings potential and a strong balance sheet. The company has very little debt, with a current ratio of 4.86. They have positive free cash flow. They have more than doubled revenue over the past 4 years, and have doubled earnings year over year, marking their first year as a profitable company. Although it has a relatively high trailing P/E of, it has a much more attractive forward P/E of 19.74 and PEG of 1.33. It is expected to grow earnings and revenue rapidly for the foreseeable future. Analyst estimates are for EPS to triple this year, from $0.14 in 2013 to $0.48. As noted in the May 2014 investor overview cited earlier, management's long-term business plan aims to increase margins from around 8% to about 16% by 2018. So far, management has guided earnings and revenue accurately, and there is little reason to doubt that Control4 is going to meet its projections for the foreseeable future as this market continues to grow.Red FlagsOf course, a stock doesn't drop 70% in a few months if there aren't some red flags. There are quite a few hurdles that the company faces to reaching their long-term goals. The main red flag, in my opinion, is lowering the cost of the technology. One reason that home automation has yet to become the enormous market that it has the potential to be is that it places an extremely high cost burden on the consumer. As outlined in the earlier referenced May 2014 investor brief, a multi-room automation project usually costs over $10,000, well out of reach for much of the average homeowners. If the cost of home automation doesn't come down, it will likely continue to be more of a niche market. However, the price of technology tends to drop over time, and I believe it is highly unlikely that home automation will continue to be so expensive. In fact, I believe that it will soon be an expectation in all households.Another red flag is the possibility of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Google getting into the market. As addressed by management on the most recent conference call, they see this more as an opportunity than anything else; if the large companies get into the market it will likely be in cooperation with the current market leaders, rather than a competition. Even if the large companies do compete with CTRL, management is quick to point out that the market is big enough to accommodate everyone. If this isn't enough to mitigate the risk, consider the fact that Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is already invested in CTRL, perhaps owning as much as 10% of the company. While Control4 may pale in comparison to Apple and Google, a larger company like Cisco so heavily invested in its fate should help keep it competitive no matter who comes into the market.The final red flag for investors to consider comes from the last conference call. While the overall results from the quarter were more or less in line with expectations, management noted that revenue from Canada was down. Management blamed the weather for recent troubles. A similar situation played out in the company's China market, and management has managed to turn that market around and establish strong growth numbers. This gives evidence that these international misses are simply bumps in the road, and nothing serious. That being said, investors should keep an eye on these situations to ensure that they don't deteriorate more."
2963256,24929,2015-03-03T05:00:00-05:00,"Structurally flawed business model and sells a single technology product that is rapidly falling into obsolescence.Facing insurmountable competitive headwinds following Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and others’ entrance into home automation in 2014.Produces an uncompetitive, antiquated hardware product, an overstated market potential, marginal IP, generates no recurring revenue and deserves a significantly lower multiple.","Investment ThesisControl4 Corp. (NASDAQ:CTRL) (""CTRL"" or the ""Company"") has a structurally flawed business model and sells a single technology product that is rapidly falling into obsolescence. The Company now faces insurmountable competitive headwinds following Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and others' entrance into home automation in 2014. These dynamics have only recently begun to manifest themselves and have yet to be reflected in CTRL's stock price. Control4's 41.1x LTM P/E is predicated on unattainable high teens revenue and margin improvement. The reality is Control4 produces an uncompetitive, antiquated hardware product, an overstated market potential, marginal IP, generates no recurring revenue and deserves a significantly lower multiple. Recent product price cuts and unfavorable channel checks indicate the Company is severely challenged and make CTRL a very attractive short with a +50% near-term return potential.Business BackgroundControl4 sells hardware that automates home appliances, essentially a remote control for video, music and lights. The Company was founded in 2003 and initially positioned itself as one of the first producers of mainstream home automation hardware. The <$100k income households CTRL targeted were not addressed by the luxury-priced providers at the time. For the next three to four years, home automation remained a nascent market and Control4 was one of few selling hardware at the lower-end of the price spectrum (below $5k per unit). CTRL's hardware is sold through third-party distributors who also provide installation and ongoing service. As we will discuss, this is a structural flaw in its business model. Control4's product costs $750-1k for the basic hardware but when you factor in programming and installations, the cost increases massively to $3k-6k for one room, >$20k for a small to mid-sized house. This is a bit of a hidden cost that typically does not get included in product price comparisons and industry reviews. These upfront costs severely limit its potential customer base.CompetitionOver the last two years, the competitive landscape in home automation has shifted rapidly: 1) Savant, AMX, Creston and others started selling lower priced products; 2) managed service providers ADT, Comcast, Verizon, etc. began cross-selling automation products to its existing customers; 3) numerous low cost do-it-yourself options came to market and; 4) point products began to proliferate. Home WiFi and ""Internet of Things"" (IOT) eliminated all the technology entry barriers that previously made install systems like Control4's viable. IoT refers to the ability to virtually connect to home and office devices that have embedded sensors. Now most appliances are internet-enabled (smart TVs, wireless speakers, LED lights, etc.) and have their own smart device applications. These are free, can be accessed from your phone or tablet and do not require clunky hardware installation or maintenance.For those consumers that still prefer a platform approach, much cheaper, more advanced options now exist. SmartThings sells a stand-alone hub with sensors and switches supporting almost all common forms of communication for $99-129 and it does not require professional installation and programming. Other comprehensive solutions include Revolv ($299), Mi Casa ($200) and Staples Connect ($99). These allow users to access and control devices (Sonos speakers, Philips Hue lightbulbs, Nest thermostat, internet-enabled appliances, etc.) on a single smartphone app. Yet CTRL continues to present itself as one of the lowest priced providers. Even if you exclude installation and service costs, Control4's controller is now much more expensive and far less flexible than all but the high-end, luxury systems.Regardless of cost, the reality is few people want a short life cycle technology product hardwired into their home. Having a controller touchpad installed in your wall is akin to having a desktop computer built into your house. What do you do when that antiquated device is a relic in two years? Forrester Research estimates that 20% of North American households are using one or more connected-home devices, but of the current adopters, 75% have only connected one device. Consumers prefer the flexibility of phone and tablet enabled systems that can address specific needs. This allows users to pick the best product for a given function rather than being constrained by a single bundled service such as that of Control4. Demand for integrated, bundled products appear to now be limited to niche new homes and are often installed by contractors at the later behest of the homeowner.Further, ""simple, low-cost smartphone-based solutions for specific mobile moments are the disruptive new force in the connected home. Customers can buy just one gadget, and have a very high-quality user experience, for specific scenarios such as automating a Philips Hue light, putting a Kevo smart lock on the back door for the school kids, or setting up video streaming monitoring with a Dropcam. A new step up are small appliances that incorporate multiple functions, such as monitoring sound, motion, temperature, and video, in one device - such as iControl's Piper, Canary, iSmartAlarm, and Scout. These offer more capabilities in a self-contained system or platform that doesn't require installing or replacing multiple gadgets as you do for a comprehensive system"" (Connected-Home News Obscures Advances In Offerings For A Broader Audience; Forrester Research, May 2014). The Company's own 2014 10-K sums it up well, ""companies that provide popular point solutions have eliminated or restricted, and may continue to eliminate or restrict, our ability to integrate with, control and otherwise be compatible with these products.""Current RealityLack of innovation, a high price point and a product with limited practical consumer value are coming home to roost in the Company's performance. Since going public in 2013, CTRL recorded ten straight quarters of +15% revenue growth. This fed the open-ended growth story and high multiple. This trend is now broken. On the recent Q4 earnings call, management guided to only a 5% growth rate for Q1'15 citing ""deeper seasonality in North America."" It is unclear what this near-term excuse means, but it is obviously a very slow start to a year where management has guided to 16-20% full year revenue growth. The Company's recent deceleration in sales is only the beginning of its problems, evidence that these are more than just temporary challenges, which include:· Large New Entrants: The competitive death knell for Control4 likely came last year when these much larger operators entered or expanded into home automation: 1) Apple HomeKit; 2) Google platform with Nest Thermostat, Nest Protect and Dropcam; 3) Samsung SmartThings and 4) Microsoft with Insteon. These are companies that each spends more on R&D every day than Control4 does in a year. Competition from them has just begun and is only going to intensify.· Price Cuts: Unit prices have declined for three consecutive quarters. In the most recent quarter (Q4'14) prices dropped 11.1% year over year. High teens revenue growth over the last two years with flat gross margins further indicates CTRL's lack of operating leverage and pricing power.· Impaired Business Model: The Company does not generate any recurring revenue from subscriptions or licensing. All revenue is from one-time hardware sales. Control4's product is sold through independent, third-party distributors. These distributors have historically been compelled to sell CTRL's hardware not based on the merits of the technology but because of the installation and ongoing maintenance revenue those distributors can generate. Installation costs $2k-5k for one room and over $20k for a small-mid house. Ongoing maintenance is also required any time the user wants to add an appliance or modify the configuration (CTRL does not receive any of this revenue). A basic service visit from a technician costs ~$200. This type of tail revenue is obviously exactly what a distributor loves and a customer hates (as indicated by CTRL's poor customer reviews). While this may not have been an impediment to sales a couple of years ago, it debilitates CTRL's competitive position given the ever-growing number of alternatives that do not require expensive installation and ongoing service.· Lost Customer: Control4's strategic relationship with Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) ended when the joint collaboration never materialized. Cisco had been a 7% CTRL shareholder with intentions of integrating Control4's technology into Cisco's Smart+Connected City and Residential platforms. In 2011, the commercial agreement with Cisco was regarded as a validation of CTRL's technology. In the ensuing three years, CTRL's revenue with Cisco amounted to only $3.7M. The contract was not renewed in 2014. Meanwhile Cisco has partnered with several of Control4's competitors in its rapidly growing IoT program.· Insider Share Sales: In 2014, the CFO and VP of Product Development sold all their shares and co-founder William West sold 80% of his holdings. Now the CEO, CFO, VP of Marketing, VP of Business Development and VP of Product Development collectively own 0 common shares.· Board Members Bailing Out: On February 27, 2015, the board members representing two of the three largest shareholders and original backers, Foundation Capital and Frazier Ventures, announced they were resigning from the board of directors effective April 28, 2015. This may signal that these VC groups are going to begin selling their shares. These two groups hold 23.7% of the shares outstanding so such selling would clearly put substantial pressure on the stock.Valuation & CatalystsAt $13.14 per share, CTRL has a $336M market capitalization. The growth story that supports CTRL's current 41.1x P/E multiple is falling apart. Management's back-end loaded 2015 guidance of 16-20% revenue growth is not credible. The increasingly bleak competitive picture may in fact lead to negative revenue growth and near-term declines in margins. The Company has no recurring revenue, short order lead times and negligible IP it could monetize. At a 16x EPS market multiple (arguably generous given the business profile and prospects), CTRL would trade 60% lower.Often the best time to enter a short position with a higher multiple open-ended growth story is when competition has intensified and revenue growth has shown clear signs of decelerating. This is why we believe CTRL is a timely short. The primary near-term catalysts include: 1) revenue shortfall, margin pressure and guidance cuts from the current lofty expectations; 2) increased competitive pressures, distribution losses and order cancellations from retailers; 3) stock re-rating as its challenges are illuminated; and 4) potential share sales from Foundation Capital and Frazier Ventures.Accounting Red Flags & Risks· Low earnings quality: 2014 levered FCF of $4.4M vs. reported net income of $8.2M.· A/R grew at 2x the rate of revenue in Q4 '14: perhaps indicating aggressive recognition/pulling forward of sales and/or that CTRL is being forced to extend credit terms to its dealers.· Meanwhile A/P has been steadily declining: indicating suppliers and manufacturers are demanding tighter payment terms from CTRL.· The risk of an acquisition is low given CTRL's limited IP and near obsolete product that could be replicated for much less than the Company's current EV. Competitor Universal Electronics (NASDAQ:UEIC) derives the majority of its revenue from licensing arrangements. CTRL generates zero licensing and royalty revenue."
2612185,48411,2014-10-30T15:32:56-04:00,"CTRL just become profitable, and is in the sweet spot of scaling up before needing to grow expenses.CTRL has shown that when only backing out share-based comp, its non-GAAP operating margins and net income get to levels that would be accretive to an acquiring company.CTRL, to me, is an acquisition target to the much larger companies looking to enter this space, a space that, despite my first thought, is attractive.","As I was reading the Control4 Corporation (NASDAQ:CTRL) 10-K and the last few 10-Qs, all I could think to myself was, ""Why in the world would anybody buy shares of this company?"" I mean, the product is expensive and not absolutely necessary, the company is competing in a space that is competitive and growing more competitive, the space itself could very easily become commoditized and be under serious pricing pressure, and the company has a few other issues that definitely need to be noted. I read on, I reached out to a few people in the broader housing industry (builders mostly) and asked around about the company and a few other competitors in the space. I wanted to know if I was disconnected from the reality of the situation and if CTRL had a real shot at ever getting back to the ~$20 it traded at just 4 months ago, because right now if that turns out to be a possibility, CTRL is trading at a huge technical discount. As it turns out, I heard nothing but positive feedback from in-the-trenches sources (at least sources serving the demographic that CTRL sells to) about the response from clients to the product. Some clients, I heard, were even proactive about requesting the CTRL system and other systems like it during new builds. Enthused but not yet completely sold, I finished my research.This initiation coverage article will outline the positive operational developments that have taken place at CTRL during 1H/14, developments that have taken place despite a few headwinds, and will discuss the expansion efforts taking place over the next 12-24 months at the company. This article will conclude that the most recent trend of lower lows and lower highs is unjustified, at least fundamentally, and will make the argument that CTRL shares should experience a swift upward trading trend over the next few quarters.I Don't Have To Agree For It To Make SenseCTRL sells a software/hardware combination that helps automate and make the home environment more convenient. The company ""unlocks the potential of connected devices, making entertainment systems easier to use, homes more comfortable, appliances more energy efficient, and families more secure (Source: CTRL 10-K)"". CTRL creates an ecosystem of the electronic devices in the home, and provides a device that allows for full control of the ecosystem via its proprietary operating system. The operating system itself performs plenty of other secondary functions, like performing auto updates to software, reformatting files across different devices and applications to make them universal for use (for example, taking music files from multiple devices/platforms/file bases and allowing the CTRL client to listen to music via TV or audio outlet, regardless of the above variables) and allowing remote access to the home system when away. The benefits to the client are largely based on convenience, but the system also potentially provides efficiency benefits as well that stem from things like setting timing and other metric-based rules for things like thermometers, lighting systems, etc. While I'm not sure that is the primary selling point for the CTRL system, it does matter, and according to my builder sources, is something that is brought up (at least the conversation of how efficient the new home will be) at multiple touch points, from breaking ground to delivery of the home. The CTRL system is one that makes sense in a broader sense for homeowners to have, if the homeowner can afford it.It's here where the negativity started for me. First, the CTRL system has substantial upfront costs to the home owner, an average cost of $4,000 and a median cost of $2500, which I thought would deter a good portion of the target market, as that type of sticker shock can delay or prevent sales from happening of other similarly priced items. My experience with this anecdote is limited to what I know of the broader electronics market, and this assumption may have been and was eventually shown to be inaccurate. The total costs, including installation, have a wide range, with variance caused by total implementation and customization of systems. That being said, I considered this a negative when competing with, while not fully comprehensive, other automating systems from competitors. For instance, some competitors can help with automation of the thermostat and lighting systems, and other competitors can help with audio and video controls, etc. As I'll soon demonstrate, and as I stated above, this assumption was wrong.I was also negative on what I just mentioned; that while there isn't a competitive (from a product quality standpoint, according to my field-level sources) product that forms a comprehensive solution, the space does have plenty of alternative options for comprehensive home automation, although they would need to pieced together from multiple competitors. Also, the efficiency benefits are beginning to be cannibalized by utility companies themselves, which are attacking this benefit from multiple angles, primary either enrolling customers in programs where the utility can throttle electric usage during peak times, or incenting the customer to set this up on their own via an in-app control system. Competition and the commoditization of the product are the biggest longer-term risks facing CTRL.Finally, I didn't like the idea that CTRL has no true sales force and is completely dependent on distributors and dealers to sell its product. With no exclusivity agreements or barriers to entry from competitors, this could easily become an issue if a larger competitor, say a Google - which has just recently began acquiring companies formerly thought of as competitors (NestLabs, etc.), wanted to come in and price out companies like CTRL. What I mean by this is using this space as a loss leader (selling at a loss to make the space uneconomically viable to competitors, knowing that you have the balance sheet strength to use this strategy of attrition to gain market share) by either pricing its products substantially lower (potentially moving more units or moving units easier for dealers and distributors) and/or creating better incentive agreements for the dealers and distributors. Frankly, I don't see why a company of the size of a Google wouldn't do this as a go-to-market strategy when entering the space. By the way, there are multiple competitors either acquiring companies in this space or allegedly developing the capabilities to enter the space - Microsoft, Apple, Samsung, etc. So keep this in mind when getting long the shares.Improving FinancialsAll of that being said, none of it has mattered to the income statement at CTRL, which has looked better and better with time. In fact, it's looked so good that I think CTRL should be seriously considered as an acquisition target by those same companies I just listed. How much easier would it be to just pay a multiple for CTRL, price down product and expand incentives for dealers and distributors (essentially, use the attrition strategy for everybody else), and ramp up expenses in a big way to aggregate market share. CTRL already has the global footprint (and growing), the superior product, the IP and clearly the operational expertise to become accretive for a buyer right away. I think it makes more sense to ""join 'em"" rather than try to ""beat 'em,"" but it makes more sense to do it sooner rather than later (or possibly less sense if a buyer wants to see how CTRL handles this first step into profitability). Don't overlook the potential for being acquired here when considering going long the shares. The potential is real.Historically, growth has been impressive, and it has been steady within the natural trend line from growth to stability. I'm not sure if CTRL plans to expand at the current (and what has been the current) rate, specifically looking at CAPEX rates and other expense growth rates, but it looks like even with expenses staying mostly flat as a percentage of revenue (demonstrated later), revenues continue to grow at a healthy clip. The CAGR for total revenue from 2006 to 2013 is 28%, and I think that's a number that says ""buy me"" for both individual investors and the potential acquiring company.By the way, just as important as showing that growth has been the fact that CTRL has done this with little leverage:So, what we have to this point in analysis is a growing company, a company that can grow minus getting knee-deep in leverage and a company that is doing this while facing competition and cannibalization. My front-end negativity is misplaced at this point.The income statement confirms this foolish front-end sentiment:I've detailed the growth percentages in the graphic footnotes, but it's important to make note of the continuation of the steady growth trend line and the fact that gross margins are slowly expanding, inclusive of share-based comp and other figures (which we'll detail soon) that I think can be backed out while leaving us with a credible, more closely indicative of operational health figure.The margin improvement, at least to this point, should be sticky as well, as the uptick has come from better supply-side agreements and component cost reductions, lower manufacturing overhead expenses as a percentage of revenue and a favorable channel sales mix. I also think that, and this isn't breaking news, as the majority of the selling infrastructure expenses to this point is showing to be mostly set in place (meaning we're not seeing absolute expense dollar growth move up as quickly as revenues anymore), that margins will expand naturally as economies of scale are further realized. If you're wondering if margin expansion is a good thing, it is.This particular graphic does a good job at backing out the non-operational expenses:So these figures are all non-GAAP, but for the most part, the non-GAAP operating margin is just GAAP operating margin ex. share-based comp, and you can see that that alone was responsible for between 290-400 basis points of operating margin compression, depending on the comparable period analyzed. For 1H/14, share-based comp was responsible for 390 basis points of compression. That is a huge difference when modeling, and is something that I'm not sure how the market is missing, but it clearly is, with the share price tanking the last four months. This company is not only healthy and doing a great job at expanding without debt, but it's also getting more profitable at a base level. I can't tell you how impressive that is, considering again the headwinds.Also, take a look at the non-GAAP net income expansion when backing out share-based comp, the bottom section of the graphic. Notice the consistency with which that line item is growing. I am fully supportive of backing out this non-cash, non-operational expense from numbers. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a better-looking income statement if asked to, than the one showing above. It just looks good from every angle.Especially this one:Again, just reiterating points already made, but the top-line growth isn't forced, and better yet, isn't even being helped along by expense growth. In 1H, CTRL held G&A flat as a percentage of revenue, and actually reduced R&D and S&M (both core top-line drivers) as a percentage of revenue. With the two largest contributors to expenses now allowing more flow-through to the bottom line and the third contributor holding steady profitability, an expansion is and should continue to be in hand. More bullish indicators for an already bullish story.Finally, operating cash flow and C&CE all saw positive builds (C&CE especially). I think the benefits of these items are self-explanatory:Where's the trade?I'm not sure if one large institution wanted out of the CTRL story or if traders were spooked by the growing interest from larger competitors, but operationally, there's no reason for shares to be down ~40%.Numbers have improved, the company entered profitability for the first time and it recently put together a deal with Toll Brothers that has the builder doing new builds with its platform installed at delivery (at the choice of the buyer). I think this has long-term positive implications. CTRL is also expanding in larger capacity into international markets, although management admits this growth is still below expectations.I'm not blind to the risks with this story, both existing and potential, and I get that share prices are discounting mechanisms to future developments; but until something actually materializes to justify this pricing, I think the future risk, assuming it isn't absolutely catastrophic, has been priced in.I'm getting long some CTRL, and I recommend others do as well. I like this company for a quarter-by-quarter assessment of ownership, but I like it nonetheless.I look forward to providing continuing coverage in the future. Good luck to all."

Further concerning was management's guidance of full year expected revenue growth of between 16-20% in the face of an all-time high print in new housing permit filings - CTRL benefits from new housing growth as its technology is implemented at new build by builders, most notably Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL).With shares falling ~18% on earnings, the bad news may or may not be already priced in, but I can't wait around to figure it out. I let quite a bit of my gains evaporate by getting too bullish heading into an unexpectedly poor earnings. With the bull thesis largely shot, I'll sell shares at market open. I recommend readers sell and avoid CTRL going forward."
2156933,52382,2014-04-24T09:27:56-04:00,"Lofty expectations, after the recent stock correction, have been checked.Decent growth in 2014 from macro trends like Internet of Things and company specific catalysts like new partnerships and improving international markets.Stock may gain 30-40% on improving estimates due to revenue growth and under-appreciated operating leverage.","Finally, ""home automation"" bulls seem to have lost control of Control4 Corporation (NASDAQ:CTRL) stock, which has declined 50% over the last three months. Like any other stock correction, reasons attributed are many - expectations of a weak housing market, seasonality, China slowdown and others. The simple reason to understand is broader market related correction, much needed after hyped up expectations, a move that was accentuated by low float.For investors, this is a right opportunity to focus on fundamentals, near-term catalysts and execution, rather than unrealistic comparisons to Nest (NASDAQ:GOOG) and other broad ""home automation"" macro themes. Fundamentally, the business is well positioned for growth as recently launched solutions are pushed through the channel and new partnerships like Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) start to deliver.Earnings estimates look conservative considering the possible operating leverage and improvement in sales, which should also benefit the stock, especially now with muted expectations.Notwithstanding the stock movement, macro trend is still strongNew technology shaping into a trend works well for all stakeholders and home automation movement is clearly providing such an opportunity. The sector has benefited from niche technology getting adopted by mass markets and products turning from high-end gadgets to utilities. The Transparency Market's research report is forecasting 25% CAGR, through 2019, for the sector and Control4 looks well positioned among the few established pure-plays with scale to match.Source: GTM ResearchInvestors' attention, which was drawn after Nest's acquisition and valuation, has dissipated, while the fundamentals have improved. Having installed at more than 150,000 homes, the penetration rate of the solution is less than 0.5% of the company's potential market and low entry price of the solution ($4,000) is drawing more first time customers.The recent acceleration in adoption was driven by the rise in construction of new homes and the availability of more technologies supporting the solution, like Internet of Things ((IoT)) among others. Availability of more solutions and devices that can work with technologies like IoT and interoperability standards like the company's SDDP (Simple Device Discovery Protocol) initiative should keep the momentum going. There are more than 180 third-party devices by 22 companies that can work with SDD protocol, but hundreds of new products, based on the protocol, are expected to launch this year.Discounted, but 2014 growth drivers are still in placeFew Control4 specific growth drivers for the current year can broadly be categorized under:International business grew for the last few quarters, but the growth rate was weak due to weak sales out of China, where the company transitioned from two-tier distribution model to a direct distributor model. Last quarter, revenues improved sequentially and with 13 new dealers added, international revenues should get a significant boost from China.Launching new solutions on the platform, which improves platform utility as well as pricing, and pushing those solutions through the channel does offer revenue growth opportunities for the firm. The company launched Wireless Music Bridge in 2013 that strengthened its audio and video distribution product offering and rolling out the same through its distribution channel should help revenues this year. Lighting products, which grew nicely last quarter after the launch of Gen-3 products, should continue to grow as it expands through the channel. Foresight subscription, a remote access offering should also help revenue growth in 2014 as it expands through the dealer network. 2014 should also benefit from more solution offerings in security, safety and comfort category, which include heating and air-conditioning.Expanding distribution and marketing partnerships offer another opportunity for growth, especially looking at the low penetration rates of the platform. Control4 recently partnered with Toll Brothers to jointly market the company's home automation solutions to the new homebuyers through product demonstrations and marketing materials. This deal is another growth opportunity for the current year, but more importantly, deals such as this open a whole new distribution channel, since approx. 45% of the new homes, mid to high-end, in the U.S. are built by national and regional builders.Operating leverage should also shine through this yearFinancials, after the recent stock correction, look even better and are suggestive of an opportunity, from a timing standpoint. The company should be able to achieve its long-term goal margins this year, which should give a considerable boost to earnings.Source: Control4 presentationR&D and general & administration expense structure is in place to support the necessary growth so earnings should get a considerable leverage from both, but sales & marketing, which is already closer to the long-term model, may continue to grow with the revenues for some time. Gross margins, which suffered due to inventory reserves, should also improve in 2014.Estimates seem conservativeConsidering the revenue growth and leverage, the current earnings estimates look conservative. Street is currently estimating revenue of $151 million and 44 cents of EPS for the current year, but there is considerable room for improvement, as the worksheet below suggestsBiggest upside may come from the operating leverage. The estimates above are baking in operating expenses hitting the higher end of the long-term model, which is not far from the current estimates. Overall, a back of an envelope working on the model should lead to the following leverage estimatesConclusionFinally, after the recent correction, the stock is valued for realistic growth expectations for the management's executional finesse rather than comparisons to the likes of Nest. Expanding distribution network, new partnerships, improving international markets like China and macro trends like Internet of Things should drive decent revenue growth in the coming quarters. Fundamentally, the business enjoys good operating leverage and high margins. The stock should benefit, as estimates seem conservative, float is small and balance sheet strong. Target of $25-29 is based on 25-30 times next year's earnings, excluding cash. The business carries decent strategic value to players like ADT, but the stock is not baking any premium from the same.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1612082,25120,2013-08-07T05:00:44-04:00,,"Control4 Corp (NASDAQ:CTRL) made its public debut on Friday, August the 2nd. Shares of the provider of automation and control systems for the connected home, ended their first day with gains of 25.3% at $20.05 per share. Shares have gained more ground, currently exchanging hands around $21 per share.The company is steadily growing and on track to break-even at the moment. Despite the nice opening day returns, the valuation looks reasonable for this established player in a growing niche market.The Public OfferingControl4 Corporation is a provider of automation and solutions for connected homes. The company's solutions make entertainment systems and security systems easy to use, and homes more energy efficient by integrating lighting, temperature and communications. Crucial for the services is the company's software platform, also known as C4 OS.Control4 sold 4.0 million shares for $16 apiece, thereby raising $64 million in gross proceeds. All proceeds will go to the company with no shares being offered by selling shareholders.The public offering values the equity of the firm at $354 million. The offering took place above the preliminary $15-$17 offer range.Some 18% of the total shares were offered in the public offering. At Tuesday's closing price of $21.06 per share, the firm is valued around $464 million.The major banks that brought the company public were Bank of America/Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), Raymond James, Canaccord Genuity, Cowen and Company, Needham & Company.ValuationControl4's home operating system makes life much easier for consumers. It solutions allow for adjustments for almost all devices at home. When leaving your home, the owner can switch off all lights, and lower the thermostat while enabling the security system. On average, consumers pay about $1,500 per appliance being provided by Control4.The company was founded back in 2003. Since inception, Control4 has automated more than 120,000 homes. The system is sold across a wide range of dealers and is installed in some 81 countries.For the year 2012, Control4 generated annual revenues of $109.5 million, up 17.2% on the year before. Net losses narrowed slightly towards $3.7 million, and were largely caused by a $2.9 million litigation settlement.First quarter revenues were up by 17.4% to $26.6 million. Net losses roughly halved to $1.5 million in the meantime.Control4 operates with $14.6 million in cash and equivalents and long term debt of $3.4 million. Factoring in the $64 million in gross proceeds from the public offering and the company will operate with a net cash position of around $70 million. As such, operating assets are valued around $400 million. This values the company at around 3.6 times last year's revenues.Investment ThesisAs noted above, the offering of Control4 has been a success. Shares were offered at the midpoint of the preliminary offering range. On top of that came opening day returns of almost 25%, followed by gains in the sessions following.Control4 offers understandable and really cool solutions. The company has well established operations which show solid revenue growth. The solid guidance for the second quarter is comforting as well. Control4 guides for second quarter revenues of $32 to $32.5 million on which it expects to generate $1.1-$1.8 million in operating income.The prospects for the remainder of the year, and further into the future continue to be bright. Control4 should be able to generate annual revenues of around $125 million for 2013, and future growth prospects look good as more consumers have Wi-Fi networks and smart phones to control the in-home processes. The international market opportunity remains very large as the company still generates three quarters of its revenues in North America.Some risk factors exist as well. Control4 relies heavily on third party dealers for its sales, while it has outsourced the production. Being able to adjust to changing technologies is key as well, as competition is fierce. Cable provider Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) aims to expand its Xfinity offerings and could be a worthy competitor.It is promising that no existing investors were selling shares in the public offering. Prominent shareholders include Thomas Weisel Venture partners, Signal Peak Ventures and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO).I am cautiously optimistic as Control4's valuation comes down to 3.2 times 2013s expected annual revenues, even after the solid returns. As revenue growth remains solid and operating leverage starts to kick in, earnings should accrue in the coming years, making it quite an interesting pick in an interesting sector with long term growth potential.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1533182,21568,2013-07-03T07:41:40-04:00,,"Home automation is a hot area for investors lately. Witness the $2 billion acquisition of Vivint by private equity firm Blackstone Group, the $136 million raised by Alarm.com last year, and the full-on entry of giants including Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T) and their global co-equals into broadband-connected, smart home business offerings.But home automation has also been around for years, whether in high-end systems like Crestron or in simple, ""point"" solutions like wireless thermostats, and it hasn't yet broken the market open. Control4 (NASDAQ:CTRL), the self-funded company that's linked up about 120,000 homes with its software-hardware automation systems, announced Monday that it's taking a crack at that challenge, with plans to raise about $60 million in an initial public offering.Control4's S-1 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also makes it clear that the Salt Lake City-based company is not in the business of home energy management. In fact, in early 2012, Control4 ditched its utility-specific smart thermostat and wireless hub configuration, and its S-1 notes that it took a $1.8 million loss on inventory purchase commitments that year.In any case, utility business has accounted for less than 1 percent of Control4's revenue, which is primarily driven by sales via channel partners to homeowners who want a ""connected home"" experience, without the high cost of traditional systems. ""We provide our consumers with the ability to integrate music, video, lighting, temperature, security, communications and other functionalities into a unified home automation,"" is how the company's prospectus puts it.That means that this is not, technically, a green technology story -- unless, of course, customers who buy into remotely monitoring their homes from their smart phones end up saving energy as part of the process. In other words, getting into the home with what people actually want -- security, entertainment, comfort, etc. -- could be one avenue to drive residential energy efficiency on a mass scale, if the market ever takes off. That makes Control4's IPO bid worth watching.Here's how Control4 puts it in its S-1:Control4 has racked up consistent, though narrowing, losses on increasing revenues since its 2003 founding. The company lost $3.7 million on revenues of $109.5 million last year, up from a 2011 loss of $3.9 million on revenues of $93.4 million.Here's how the S-1 breaks down the competition:Control4 has combined its own software and device networking expertise with a sales model driven by channel partners, which could help it avoid both the high costs associated with luxury installations and the interoperability problems presented by point products. It relies on third-party manufacturers, and noted in its S-1 that two contract manufacturers, Sanmina and LiteOn, made 82 percent of its inventory in 2012.At the same time, both ends of the market provide challenges to Control4, as its S-1 notes. Here's how the company describes the challenge from point products:As for the challenges from the high end of the business, Control4 notes that companies like Crestron, which has been in business for over 40 years, and Savant Systems, which provides home automation based on the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS operating platform, could present competition if they get their prices down.Any talk of smart, connected homes has to deal with the key question of how the technology is planning to remain relevant in the future, of course. That includes obvious tasks, like making sure that one's devices can run on home Wi-Fi as well as via wireless protocols such as ZigBee and Z-Wave, as well as planning for future interoperability with a host of devices and software offerings built around common standards.Control4's answer to this challenge is its ""Simple Device Discovery Protocol, or SDDP"" technology, which it wants to convince manufacturers of in-home devices to embed at the factory. But as the S-1 notes, ""Although we are making SDDP available on a royalty-free basis to product manufacturers, its adoption is not yet substantial, and may not achieve greater or broad market acceptance.""Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1605102,21568,2013-08-05T15:58:58-04:00,,"Connected home company Control4 (NASDAQ:CTRL) held its initial public offering on Friday -- and, at least in this brief window, it appears to have pulled off a winner.The Salt Lake City-based maker of hardware and software that links entertainment, security and other household systems into a controllable digital platform raised $64 million in its IPO, offering some 4 million shares at its midpoint target price of $16 per share. That set the company's overall valuation at about $400 million, far higher than its initial valuation target of $225 million set in its July 1 S-1 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Shares of the company, traded under the symbol CTRL on the Nasdaq exchange, then rose to more than $20.50 per share on Friday, and have so far hovered in the $19.50 to $20 range in early Monday trading. For a company in a still-nascent industry, and which has yet to show a profit in its 10-year history, it's an impressive showing.CTRL data by YChartsIt's also a good sign for investors in Control4, which had raised about $75 million since its 2004 founding. Early venture capital investors in the company included Frazier Technology Ventures, vSpring Capital and Thomas Weisel Venture Partners, and were joined by Foundation Capital Partners in a 2005 Series C round of $15 million. In 2009, Control4 raised $17.3 million from strategic investors including Best Buy Capital, the investment arm of the electronics retailer, as well as Mercato Partners and University of Utah-linked University Venture Fund, and in 2011 the company raised $25 million from strategic investors including Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).What Control4's success so far means to the home energy management sector is less clear, however. Control4's technology is now installed in about 120,000 homes across the country, giving it a significant market share in a still-new market. But while the company did raise money and set up utility partnerships on the home energy management front back in 2008 and 2009, it publicly abandoned those efforts last year.Instead, it decided to concentrate on what its customers and dealer/installer partners really seem to want: home entertainment, home security, and the ability to manage all these home systems via mobile devices, home computers and other such tools of the modern age.Control4 isn't alone in making these kinds of decisions. Homeowners tend to care a lot more about comfort, safety and convenience than they do about reducing electricity bills that still add up to a relatively tiny portion of overall household expenses. Energy-specific home monitoring and management platforms from Google and Microsoft have been launched with great fanfare, only to fold quietly after being unable to convince homeowners to sign up.Likewise, the rush of venture capital into home energy management startups has yet to yield any significant breakthroughs in terms of realizing a return on that investment, though startups like Tendril Networks continue to soldier on. At the same time, other energy-focused startups have been acquired by companies that are focused on home security and automation -- witness New York startup EnergyHub's acquisition by home automation startup Alarm.com earlier this year.That doesn't necessarily mean that Control4 customers can't take advantage of their systems to save energy, or that the idea of expanding its core capabilities to energy management is completely dead.Take Control4's 2011 partnership with Cisco to join the networking giant's Smart+Connected Communities initiative. Control4 CEO Martin Plaehn told us in early 2012 that its partnership with Cisco was mainly focused on using video and telecommunications technology to connect residential customers to various business and government services, as demonstrated in connected city projects like Cisco's work in the South Korean city of Songdo.While those projects do offer potential avenues for energy management, Cisco has said that the business models have yet to be worked out for delivering high-tech connectivity to apartments and cities. Still, once those high-value technology connections have been established, they could serve to monitor and manage energy usage as well -- at least in theory.The same goes for a long list of connected home service offerings. Comcast's Xfinity Home security service, for example, includes a partnership with startup EcoFactor, which has technology to automate home thermostats to save energy without requiring homeowner input. Home improvement retailer Lowe's has joined forces with U.K.-based startup AlertMe on its cloud-connected home automation platform, dubbed ""Iris,"" and other home automation service offerings, such as those being offered by telcos like AT&T and Verizon, also include partnerships that could expand to include energy as a focus.Likewise, U.S. home security company Vivint, which was acquired for $2 billion by private equity form Blackstone Group earlier this year, has been making its foray into home solar systems and energy management offerings on top of its core services. While going green and saving the planet remain worthwhile aspirations for the home automation industry, it increasingly appears that the path to achieving those goals will come as an afterthought, or an add-on, to giving homeowners the things that matter to them most: protecting their families, and providing the convenience and comfort of a digitally connected home.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

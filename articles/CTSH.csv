        Healthcare vertical came in below our expectations, but we believe growth will accelerate throughout 2020.
        Share repurchases remain solid and more are in store.","Cognizant delivered mixed results on March 8, missing the top-line, while delivering on the EPS. Specifically, revenue of ~$4.2 billion represented 2.2% Y/Y growth, but came short by about $32 MM, while the EPS of $0.96 beat consensus by 3.1 cents. Below, we provide an update on the company by analyzing new information available from 1Q20 earnings. We believe that the company is overall in a good shape, but there are some pressure points around the top line that drive our Neutral thesis at present. We believe our previous 14.5x PE multiple on 2020 earnings remains pertinent; however, we remain cautious around some verticals that could negatively pressure the multiple in the coming weeks. As a result, we remain Neutral on the name, but stand ready to upgrade as soon as some of macro pressures and potential pressure points get resolved in 2Q or 3Q.Revenue growth driven by CMT and Products/Services Verticals: Communications, Media & Technology (NYSEMKT:CMT) and Products/Services groups grew 5.2% Y/Y and 4.4% Y/Y during the quarter, slightly ahead of our expectations. We believe that demand for BPO (business product outsourcing) has been the core driver, as well as continued double digit revenue growth from SMAC (Social/Mobile/Analytics/Cloud) initiatives. The revenue base of SMAC is still under 20% for these verticals; hence, the overall revenue growth was in mid-single-digits during the quarter.Healthcare group at 2.5% Y/Y revenue growth, below our expectations: We modeled 3.2% Y/Y growth, but we believe that this 3% run rate is sustainable for the overall year, hence, we expect acceleration throughout 2020. Given that some of CTSH's clients are seeing their revenues expand as a result of coronavirus vaccine and/or medication development, we anticipate demand for Cognizant's services to grow. There is, of course, a question of a certain lag; hence, in 2021-22, we may see even further acceleration. Mixed performance for Financial Services vertical: As during the last several quarters, there was consistent performance across Banking sub-vertical, with some pressures from Insurance segment. Specifically, Banking was driven by Samlink deal in Europe, albeit some larger clients in the US and North America created a moderate headwind. Within Insurance, several US clients continued to underperform the overall vertical, driving low-single-digit revenue decline. The overall Financial Services vertical grew only 1% Y/Y.Short run immunity from coronavirus economic impact: We also have to remember that Cognizant's revenue is contractual and is not impacted by immediate events, such as furloughing or reduced disposable income. As a result, the European business, where coronavirus pressures developed in February, at least several weeks before the US, was shielded relatively well during the first quarter. Specifically, European revenues grew 5.4% Y/Y, beating North American (essentially US) revenue by 330 bps. We do expect some European deceleration later this year, but not by much, 50 bps at most.Utilization rates remained steady: Onsite utilization rate was at 91%, while offshore rates (excluding trainees) was 83%. We note that this performance was in line with prior quarters. Going forward, we do expect rates to drop during the second quarter, however, we don't see a material impact to the company's financials as a result.Share repurchases remain solid and more are in store: The company bought back approximately $500 MM in stock during 1Q. Furthermore, there is still $1.9 billion remaining under the current authorization. We do not expect CTSH to up the authorization in the near term; however, we don't envision them holding it back either. We estimate anywhere between $300 MM and $500 MM in buybacks during each of the remaining quarters in 2020. Free cash flows steady, but question marks remain: During 1Q20, the company generated $385 MM in free cash flows, which was a steady, yet average, result. As an example, in 4Q, FCF stood at $845 MM while in 1Q19 they were $163 MM. As of right now, it is very difficult to model out FCF at Cognizant by quarter, particularly in light of the virus uncertainty. We still expect the run rate north of $2 billion for the whole year. Cognizant mainly concentrates on three core verticals: Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing/Retail /Logistics, which collectively make up about 90% of its revenue base. The Financial Services vertical focuses on banking/transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services. The Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics group includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers. The Healthcare group includes largely healthcare providers and payers.We see the following four core risks to our thesis.1. Pricing WarsWhile CTSH strives to make the pricing structure attractive to its core clients and, henceforth, attract greater business, we see a number of Indian players, such as Infosys, Tata Consultancy (OTCPK:TTNQY), and Wipro, potentially lowering prices in the foreseeable future.2. Too Much US ExposureCognizant is one of the few major IT services companies with the bulk of the revenue coming from the US (approximately 85%). Such lack of diversification may ultimately lead to significant revenue pressures, should the US hit a recession.3. Legislative UncertaintyThe company heavily relies on H1-B and L-1 visas; over the last several years, Congress attempted to heavily regulate the number of visa workers each company can hire.4. Industry-Specific RisksSince CTSH is so dependent on Financial Services, Healthcare, and Manufacturing industries, a sudden downturn in any of those sectors (e.g., Financial Services in 2008) can lead to a meaningful negative impact to the company's top-line."

We then spoke of Cognizant in our Best Long Ideas piece (see article) on March 31, where we recommended CTSH along with two other IT Services companies, Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and Infosys (NYSE:INFY). Our updated thesis remains unchanged: CTSH should see major tailwinds from the Healthcare vertical, which should benefit from coronavirus-induced research.In this piece, we are reacting to rather troubling news of a security breach: a Maze ransomware attack disrupted the company's internal systems and caused service disruptions for some of CTSH's clients. The company issued a vague statement that,For legal and security reasons, the company did not provide information about the affected clients. We believe, however, that Cognizant will provide more information about the extent of the breach and potential impact to revenues during its next earnings call, on May 7th.Since it is still more than two weeks out, we decided not to wait until May and provide the following thoughts:Until we learn more information about the financial implications of this attack, we are not ready to revise our estimates downward. At present, we continue to believe that CTSH shares merit ~14.5x P/E multiple. We note that this multiple comes at a ~2.3x discount relative to other players in the IT Services space, making our valuation fairly conservative. When we apply it to our EPS estimate of $5.57, we get the target price of $81.Cognizant mainly concentrates on three core verticals: Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing/Retail /Logistics, which collectively make up about 90% of its revenue base.

        Expectations for CTSH's earnings are too low, allowing earnings traders a bullish opportunity over FQ4.
        Many earnings predictors I looked at also imply a rally for CTSH’s upcoming quarterly earnings.","In my earnings newsletter, we have our own vernacular. From my Exposing Earnings Handbook:PhoenixA phoenix is a mythical bird that rises from ashes. These stocks are undervalued, disrespected, and will likely experience a comeback on earnings.Based on the above quantitative models and fundamental analysis, I label a stock as a Phoenix when I believe it will act contrary to analyst expectations and rise after earnings.The probability and risk/reward curve are both in the bulls’ favor. Always play these long.We are going to be looking at three Phoenix plays I found for January 2020. We are starting with one that has particularly good performance in the first quarter of the year. For more in-depth information or particular questions, either contact me in the EE chat or in the comments section below.Stocks with seasonal patterns are the most reliable for earnings plays. Sometimes, we only play a stock’s earnings once per year because of strong reliability in a certain quarter. CTSH has such a reliability in its January earnings, and the post-earnings drift tends to lead to excess gains for the two months following earnings.Take a look at the gains you would have experienced were you to only hold CTSH for its first quarter earnings and the following two months over the last four-year election cycle:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Tiingo)The result is half the drawdown but 4x the Sharpe ratio. CTSH’s major selloffs do not come in FQ4, but its major gains certainly do. Even without an in-depth earnings analysis, holding CTSH over the first three months of the year makes statistical sense.This will be the first FQ4 with CTSH’s new CEO. Expectations are lower than average, as is usual when a CEO changes. This is generally good for earnings, as the shift in a CEO typically has little impact on the company’s short-term bottom line.In addition, as my readers likely know, management optimism is important for post-earnings stock price movement. More optimistic management teams typically imply excess returns. New CEOs are usually quite excited to take the reins, driving the company in a potentially new direction (new CEO Brian Humphries is primarily focused on technological growth, it appears), and thus bring extra optimism to a company.Insiders also can help us find possible tops. When insider selling spikes, insiders typically are taking profit on what they see to be a top for the stock. Buying, however, is correlated with excess returns:(Source: Simplywall.st)Stocks with lots of insider transactions before earnings is usually related to earnings selloffs more so than rallies. You can see in the chart of CTSH that this large amount of insider selling was indeed paired with a peak in the stock. Low amounts of insider transactions prior to earnings, coupled with a large ratio of institutions to general public holding the stock tends to predict better-than-expected returns on the stock after earnings:(Source: Simplywall.st)These are both bullish indicators for CTSH’s upcoming earnings. Many other earnings predictors I looked at also imply a rally for CTSH’s upcoming quarterly earnings. For example, earnings tends to be correlated with stock price movement (this is not true for many stocks, for which guidance is more important), and profit margins are not only high but increasing (12.6%, an 36% increase year-over-year), which is good for earnings in the short-term (high profit margins tend to mean-revert over long periods of time).Add to this that CTSH has risen on Q4 earnings three out of the past four years (2016 saw a selloff, but the stock quickly rebounded), and we see a strong bullish earnings opportunity in CTSH. With CTSH buying back shares, the stock is bolstered from the bottom, pointing to a positive payoff curve. Finally, the existence of an area gap tells us that the current entry point is likely below CTSH’s future, short-term value, as area gaps usually fill:(Source: E-Trade Pro)In short, CTSH looks like a good long earnings play and is one of my best Phoenix plays for 2020. We will be discussing options strategies in my newsletter.Happy trading!"
4306356,105417,2019-11-13T16:42:09-05:00,"Gartner projects acceleration in IT spending in 2020-21.Enterprise Software segment is expected to have the fastest growth, albeit IT Services and Communications Services are still the largest segments.Cognizant should continue its outreach toward China, where cloud is picking up steam. At the same time, the tariff war has little impact on the IT Services spending.","Cognizant focuses on three core verticals: Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, which collectively make up about 90% of its revenue base. The Financial Services vertical focuses on banking/transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services. The Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics group includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers. The Healthcare group includes largely healthcare providers and payers. In addition, the company also has clients in media, entertainment, high tech, and telecom groups, albeit its presence in those segments is much smaller than that of its core competitors, such as Accenture, Infosys, and IBM.Worldwide IT spending is projected to grow 3.7% Y/Y to $3.8 trillion in 2020. This is a major acceleration from 2019, when growth was largely flat. Enterprise software spending is supposed to be the core driver of growth, which is a great read for Cognizant, where about 20-22% of revenue is focused on this segment. Regulatory compliance is at the top of client concerns at present, as spending on security was up 10.5% in 2019 and cloud security is now projected to grow ~41% annually over the next five years. This is another positive read for CTSH, where Horizon III SMAC (social - mobile - analytics - cloud) have consistently demonstrated double digit growth over the last several years. In fact, during some quarters SMAC initiatives grew as much as 30-40% Y/Y.China is catching up on cloud adoption, which means that Cognizant needs to start expanding its Chinese outreach. While the US is leading in cloud adoption at present, accounting for more than 50% of global spending on cloud, by 2023 China is projected by Gartner to overtake US levels.Tariff war with China continues to have minimal impact on IT Services, since China remains of marginal importance in IT spending world, where it's projected to grow only 0.1% Y/Y in 2020. (We note that IT Services specifically is different from cloud's overall impact, referenced in the previous bullet).Data Center Systems remain the smallest contributor to IT spending and are actually declining in 2019. While some pickup is expected in 2020-21, it is not enough to close the gap with Enterprise Software or Devices market. For Cognizant, however, data center systems are of marginal importance, as they largely reside under legacy Horizon I initiatives.Worldwide IT Spending Forecast (Billions of U.S. Dollars)Source: Gartner (October 2019)More information can be found by reading the full reportPer our industry-wide analysis and Cognizant’s favorable fundamentals, and given the company’s strong capital return story, we continue to believe that CTSH shares merit ~14.5x PE multiple.

4301404,105417,2019-11-01T10:22:04-04:00,"Contino brings high-profile client names, such as Morgan Stanley, Adidas, and Dow Jones.Contino's SMAC offerings help CTSH expand to Great Britain and Australia markets.Our preliminary estimate calls for 80 bps of annual revenue growth acceleration from this transaction.","On October 16, Cognizant announced its acquisition of Contino, a European technology consultancy firm. Over the last two weeks we conducted research on this transaction, trying to assess the immediate impact in terms of synergies and culture. We present our key findings below, in addition to commenting on the company's latest earnings print. Cognizant focuses on three core verticals: Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, which collectively make up about 90% of its revenue base. The Financial Services vertical focuses on banking/transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services. The Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics group includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers. The Healthcare group includes largely healthcare providers and payers. In addition, the company also has clients in media, entertainment, high tech, and telecom groups, albeit its presence in those segments is much smaller than that of its core competitors, such as Accenture, Infosys, and IBM.New and Different Client Outreach: Contino both adds to Cognizant's client base and diversifies it with new digital consulting offerings. Among such clients are Dow Jones, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Adidas, Lloyds Bank, Vodafone and Morgan Stanley. We expect that for some of these clients revenue could rise by as much as 50%, though we do not have precise estimates of how much revenue each client delivers for CTSH. Given the list above, we see the Financial Services vertical getting a particularly strong boost. Geographic Outreach: While we do not see much impact from the US market (recall, Cognizant already derives about 81% of total revenue from the United States), expansion into the United Kingdom and particularly Australia is a major positive for the diversification of the company's revenue stream. Incremental to SMAC Offerings: Contino's work is largely focused on what Cognizant calls its SMAC (Social, Mobile, Analytics, Cloud) / Horizon 3 deliverables. SMAC already brings solid double digit growth, which we see accelerating with the new acquisition. It is our understanding that Contino has solid partnerships with Amazon's AWS, Google's Cloud Platform, and Microsoft's Azure. With Cognizant also in sync with some of these players, we envision a lot of potential for revenue growth acceleration. Expect As Much As 80 Bps of Revenue Growth Acceleration: While the devil is in the details, we believe that the impact from this deal may result in as much as 80 bps of revenue growth acceleration, though we are more cautious about the operating margin expansion since we do not yet know about all the incremental costs involved. A lot will depend on the percentage allocation across verticals (not only Financial Services, but also Retail and Telecom). Commentary on the Quarter: There was a lot to like from the recent print, as revenue grew 5.1% Y/Y on a constant currency basis, with banking and financial services vertical in general outperforming in the North American region, in line with how the company guided during the prior earnings calls. Our channel checks indicate that while projects are slowing down at some bulge bracket firms, they are being picked up at others, making it a zero-sum game for Cognizant as a company. Further, back-end tech support remains quite strong, growing revenue in double digits. Digital revenue, meanwhile, grew at 20%+ for Cognizant and represented more than a third of the company's total revenue. Note that Contino, as well as many recent tuck-in acquisitions, come from the digital side. For the Healthcare vertical, merger activity continued to adversely impact the top-line, as the segment declined 0.9% Y/Y. While management didn't mention the patent cliff, we believe that it is a major factor as well. Finally, the CMT group was up nearly 11% Y/Y, largely driven by the technology sector, which is increasingly becoming the star group within Cognizant. Regarding Manufacturing, this is one sub-segment where we expect negative growth in 4Q and possibly beyond, since the US manufacturing industry has essentially entered a recession lately, as evidenced by commentary of CTSH's clients, as well as declining ISM indexes.Per our industry-wide analysis and Cognizant’s favorable fundamentals, and given the company’s strong capital return story, we continue to believe that CTSH shares merit ~14.5x PE multiple. We note that this multiple comes at a ~2.3x discount relative to other players in the IT Services space, making our valuation fairly conservative. When we apply it to our new EPS estimate of $5.57 (up from $5.53), we get the target price of $81 (up from $80).We see the following four core risks to our thesis.While CTSH strives to make the pricing structure attractive to its core clients and, henceforth, attract greater business, we see a number of Indian players, such as Infosys, Tata Consultancy, and Wipro, potentially lowering prices in the foreseeable future2.

4314860,105417,2020-01-02T08:00:08-05:00,"We see continuous traction in what CTSH calls ""four key digital battlegrounds"".CMT and Financial Services verticals should perform better than Healthcare vertical.We expect tepid 2020 guidance, as the company will likely conservatively navigate the year through beats and raises.","In this article, we reiterate our Bullish thesis on Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) and conduct a preview of the 4Q19 quarterly earnings results. Overall, we remain optimistic about the stock going into 2020, seeing traction from Manufacturing/Retail business and even Financial Services, with pockets of softness in Healthcare not enough to derail our thesis.Cognizant focuses on three core verticals: Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing/Retail /Logistics, which collectively make up about 90% of its revenue base. The Financial Services vertical focuses on banking/transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services. The Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics group includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers. The Healthcare group includes largely healthcare providers and payers. In addition, the company also has clients in media, entertainment, high tech, and telecom groups, albeit its presence in those segments is much smaller than that of its core competitors, such as Accenture (NYSE:ACN), Infosys (NYSE:INFY), and IBM (NYSE:IBM).See continuous traction in what CTSH calls ""four key digital battlegrounds"": While we frequently emphasize these four core revenue streams as key to the company's overall growth, we probably don't emphasize them often enough: they are 1) data, 2) digital engineering, 3) cloud, and 4) Internet of Things. These four areas first and foremost allow Cognizant to enhance cost efficiency for their clients across three core verticals, Financial Services, Healthcare, and Retail/Manufacturing. In addition, top line growth for these revenue streams is at least 15%-20% higher than it is for traditional IT revenue streams, such as back-end IT support and BPO (business process outsourcing). We expect most traction during the fourth quarter, likely as much as 60-65% of total revenues to come from these four sources.CMT should have the strongest growth of the three verticals: We expect the Communications, Media and Technology (CMT) vertical to grow 11.6% Y/Y, with traction across all three sub-segments. Technology revenue should continue to benefit from recent acquisitions, in addition to seeing traction from digital engineering. Media should benefit mostly from US clients, with BPO workstreams kicking in. Finally, the Communications segment should see some tailwinds from more beneficial pricing (from new clients), with SMAC Horizon III areas remaining strong across the board.Improvement in Financial Services vertical: We are modeling approximately 4.4% Y/Y revenue growth in Financial Services vertical, while recognizing that insurance should trend slightly better than banking, as some accounts remain under pressure. Larger deals in the pipeline were moving forward slower than expected throughout the year and we don't anticipate them to be better in 4Q, given that it is a holiday season. At the same time, improvement in insurance should help offset the tepid banking performance.Healthcare under pressure: We believe that there may be further softness in the Healthcare space, mainly due to rate reductions and volume discounts from companies (clients) undergoing merger integration. If in 2018-19, we expected more pressures from the pharma side than from the payer, for 4Q19 we see both core businesses impacted, which may result in mid-single digit top line growth at best. We are cautiously modeling a similar traction for 2020, though we believe the company may be even more conservative in its annual guidance.Expect tepid guidance: With CTSH shares largely range-bound throughout 2019, we believe that management is cognizant (no pun intended) of potential reservations the market has about some vertical traction, namely Healthcare, as well as about some of the growth saturation in legacy parts of the consulting and outsourcing businesses. As a result, we may see guidance that is some 100 bps softer on the top-line and about 20, even 30 bps softer on the margin. At the same time, as is true for a lot of companies in the IT Services space, there has to be meaningful room for guidance raises throughout the year.Per our industry-wide analysis and Cognizant's favorable fundamentals, and given the company's strong capital return story, we continue to believe that CTSH shares merit ~14.5x P/E multiple. We note that this multiple comes at a ~2.3x discount relative to other players in the IT Services space, making our valuation fairly conservative. When we apply it to our EPS estimate of $5.57, we get the target price of $81.We see the following four core risks to our thesis.1. Pricing WarsWhile CTSH strives to make the pricing structure attractive to its core clients and, henceforth, attract greater business, we see a number of Indian players, such as Infosys, Tata Consultancy (OTCPK:TTNQY), and Wipro (NYSE:WIT), potentially lowering prices in the foreseeable future.2.

        We expect double-digit top-line growth for the Retail sub-vertical, which should offset weakness in the Manufacturing space.","Cognizant focuses on three core verticals: Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, which collectively make up about 90% of its revenue base. The Financial Services vertical focuses on banking/transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services. The Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics group includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers. The Healthcare group includes largely healthcare providers and payers. In addition, the company also has clients in media, entertainment, high tech, and telecom groups, albeit its presence in those segments is much smaller than that of its core competitors, such as Accenture, Infosys, and IBM.Per our industry-wide analysis and Cognizant’s favorable fundamentals, and given the company’s strong capital return story, we continue to believe that CTSH shares merit ~14.5x PE multiple. We note that this multiple comes at a ~2.3x discount relative to other players in the IT Services space, making our valuation fairly conservative. When we apply it to our EPS estimate of $5.53 (up from $5.51), we get the target price of $80.Demand continues to be strong across Cognizant’s three core verticals. Let’s examine each of them in some detail, ahead of the quarter earnings:Financial Services: With banking sector continuing to outperform insurance business, we still believe that ~14% Y/Y growth is realistic in 3Q, as demand for SMAC (social – mobile – analytics – cloud) initiatives, as well as business process outsourcing in general, remain strong, particularly in the United States. Our channel checks indicate that while projects are slowing down at some bulge bracket firms, they are being picked up at others, making it a zero-sum game for Cognizant as a company. Further, back-end tech support remains quite strong, growing revenue in double digits. As far as signs of slowdown of the insurance sub-vertical, we are not seeing any major softness, except the generic consulting pullback that has been telegraphed back in 2016-17. Overall, insurance remains a solid segment with mid-single-digit top-line growth.Healthcare: We have seen strong traction for both payer and pharma segments over the last several months, each growing the top-line in upper single digits. We do not anticipate these growth patterns to deviate meaningfully in one direction or another for the rest of the year, as equipment-related initiatives remain strong; in addition, recently adopted patents are offsetting some headwinds from the unraveling “patent cliff” (i.e., expiration of patents). We expect the payer business to grow at 8.7% in 3Q, while the pharma business should grow around 9.35%. On the margin side, we may see some acceleration, by about 30-40 bps to around 20%, which is fairly in line with the company’s overall average.Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics: Logistics growth has been growing in low single digits over the last several quarters, so we don’t expect major tailwinds or headwinds for that sub-vertical. We are not familiar if any of Logistics’ major clients are scaling back or increasing their business with Cognizant; our goal, therefore, is to model growth at the neutral pace. Regarding Manufacturing, this is one sub-segment where we expect negative growth in 3Q, likely around -2%, since the US manufacturing industry has essentially entered a recession lately, as evidenced by numerous clients of CTSH as well as declining ISM indexes. Conversely, Retail remains one of the star segments at Cognizant, growing as much as 16% Y/Y in 3Q, according to our model. This goes in line with the macro patterns we’ve seen throughout 2019: while business investments have been slowing down, it is the consumer (accounting for about 70% of the US GDP) that is pushing the US economy forward. By the same token, a number of retail clients of Cognizant continue to boost their BPO and SMAC presence, which should support mid-teens growth over the next several quarters.We see the following four core risks to our thesis.While CTSH strives to make the pricing structure attractive to its core clients and, henceforth, attract greater business, we see a number of Indian players, such as Infosys, Tata Consultancy, and Wipro, potentially lowering prices in the foreseeable future2. Too Much US Exposure:Cognizant is one of the few major IT services companies with the bulk of the revenue coming from the US (approximately 85%). Such lack of diversification may ultimately lead to significant revenue pressures, should the US hit a recession.3. Legislative Uncertainty:The company heavily relies on H1-B and L-1 visas; over the last several years Congress attempted to heavily regulate the number of visa workers each company can hire.4. Industry-Specific Risks: Since CTSH is so dependent on Financial Services, Healthcare, and Manufacturing industries, a sudden downturn in any of those sectors (e.g., Financial Services in 2008) can lead to a meaningful negative impact to the company’s top-line."
4290689,105145,2019-09-10T07:43:21-04:00,"Cognizant's stock has witnessed a brutal selloff, from ~$80 a year ago to $64.24, due to slipping margins and weakness in Cognizant's two largest business segments.This selloff means Cognizant is currently trading at around 16 times forward earnings, historically low for the company.Management's focus on margin improvement and investment in Cognizant's two fastest growing business segments will drive long-term success for the company, making Cognizant attractive at current levels.","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (CTSH) is currently trading at $64.26 per share, down from a 52-week high of $77.87 primarily due to a weak Q1, followed by an unremarkable Q2. This pullback offers an attractive opportunity for entry into a company poised to benefit from the rise of AI and increased usage of big data analytics across all industries.Cognizant is a provider of digital, technology, and consulting services.Source: 10-KThe company’s services are provided to the four primary industries shown above: Financial Services, Healthcare, Communication, Media, and Technology, and Products and Resources.Services provided to these industries include application development and testing, system integration, infrastructure services, and business process services. For digital services, Cognizant offers analytics and AI solutions, as well as cloud services.According to Grandview Research, the global software consulting market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.8%, making it one of the faster growing segments in the economy. This growth is driven primarily from the increased trend toward data analytics and cloud computing for companies worldwide.Growth is also expected to be driven in part by the increased demand for cybersecurity applications and solutions due to an increasing number of cloud-related cyber attacks as of late.While the IT consulting industry encompasses a wide variety of solutions and technologies, Cognizant laid out their focus going forward on the Q2 conference call; data engineering, cloud, and IoT solutions.This is likely a wise strategic move for Cognizant, as solutions across these three groups are highly in-demand and likely to continue to be desired for the foreseeable future.After years of strong growth, Cognizant stumbled significantly in the first half of 2019. Declining margins driven by an increasing cost of revenue has left many investors rightly concerned, as gross margins have declined nearly 400 basis points from 2014, from 40.2% to managements full year guidance of 37% for full-year 2019.To CEO Brian Humphries credit, he made no excuses during the conference call, saying:Source 10-QRevenue was up around 4.2% from the first six months in 2018. This is significantly lower than the growth rate Cognizant has seen over the past few years. Combined with a gross margin decline of around 230 basis points YoY, from 39.2% in 2018 to 36.9% in 2019, this starts to look worrisome.The main cause of the underperformance for the first half of 2019 comes from weakness in Cognizant’s two largest business segments: Healthcare and Financials.Source: Investor presentation As seen from the graphic above, the Financial Services segment saw a YoY increase of 0.3% while the Healthcare segment declined 1.9%.Management attributed weakness in the Healthcare was the result of several large clients involved in mergers, negatively impacting revenue. Management expects this to continue throughout Q3 and begin to subside in Q4.On a brighter note, the Life Sciences segment of the Healthcare vertical saw another quarter of double-digit growth YoY, as momentum for services such as digital operations and other industry specific platforms remains strong.Cognizant’s offerings in this area are further strengthened by the recent acquisition of Zenith Technologies in July, which provides automation and IoT services in the Life Sciences space.For the Financial Services segment, weakness was primarily caused by a lack of increased spend across the segment, as recent market conditions have created a level of cautiousness amongst financial clients. Management expects this to continue throughout the second half of FY19.The weakness in these two segments overshadowed continued strength in Cognizant’s smaller two segments: Products and Resources, and Communications, Media, and Technology.Products and Resources grew 12.3% in constant currency YoY, marking the sixth straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Cloud and digital engineering services led the charge, accompanied by an increased demand for interactive, IoT and analytical solutions.Communications, Media, and Technology saw constant currency growth of 14.1% YoY, driven by an increasing demand for digital content solutions. While management expects this to moderate slightly for the second half of 2019, it is still expected to remain strong.Over time, Products and Resources as well as Communications, Media, and Technology are likely to gain share relative to Healthcare and Financial Services, as demand for Cloud, Digital Engineering, IoT, and digital content solutions remains consistently strong.Going forward, management has stated their intention to continue implementing cost-reduction measures designed to improve margins, including slowing the pace of new hires, improving SG&A expenses, and simplifying the organizational structure. These improvements are likely to start appearing in Q3 and Q4 of 2019.Source: FY18, FY16 10-KWhile it is easy to get caught up in Cognizant’s relative weakness for the first half of 2019, it is beneficial to take a longer-term view to see the full picture.From FY14 to FY18, Cognizant grew revenue at a CAGR of 11.96%, from $10.3 billion to $16.1 billion. EBITDA grew at a CAGR of 11.83%, from $2.1 billion to $3.3 billion, while pre-tax income has grown at a CAGR of 9.8%. This represents exceptional growth, especially for a relatively mature company such as Cognizant.For FY19, revenue is expected to be somewhere in the range of $16.75-$16.9 billion. Given Cognizant’s revenue of $12.4 billion in 2015, this represents a five-year revenue CAGR of 7.8-8%, should management be able to meet expectations. While this is significantly lower than the five-year number from above, it should stay somewhere between 7-9% going forward.This is because even if weakness in Financial Services and Healthcare drags on, continued double-digit growth in Communications, Media, and Technology as well as Products and Resources will lead to an overall increase in the YoY revenue growth rate, as they continue to comprise a larger portion of total revenue.Going forward, management’s efforts to reduce expenses to improve margins should drive bottom-line growth at a similar rate.SeekingAlphaDespite strong historical growth, Cognizant’s weak first half of FY19 has seen the company’s stock plummet to a historically low valuation.With management projecting adjusted diluted EPS for FY19 to be somewhere in the range of $3.92 to $3.98, CTSH is current trading at between 16.1-16.4 times FY19 earnings. This is remarkably cheap for a company that has traded above 20 times earnings for most of the last 9 years.Source: 10-QCognizant’s balance sheet remains more than healthy, as $1.66 billion in cash and $746 million in outstanding debt means the company has negative net debt.Current assets of $7.2 billion compared to current liabilities of $2.82 billion gives Cognizant a current ratio of 2.55, further confirming the strength of the balance sheet.This has and will continue to allow Cognizant to increase shareholder value through acquisitions and share buybacks. YTD, Cognizant has repurchased ~$1.8 billion in shares, and currently has ~$700 million left in the authorized repurchase program.Cognizant started paying an annualized dividend of $0.60 per share in 2017, which was hiked 33% in 2018 to $0.80 per share, where it has remained since. This equates to a current yield of around 1.25%. With expected 2019 EPS of $3.92-$3.98, the payout ratio for FY19 is under 20%. This gives plenty of room for Cognizant to increase the dividend going forward. While Cognizant's management has laid out their plan to increase margins going forward, there is no guarantee they will be able to accomplish their goal. Should margins continue to keep slipping, prolonged weakness in the Financial Services and Healthcare segments becomes much more of a problem. While growth has remained strong in the Communications, Media & Technology and Products & Resources segments, there is no guarantee this will continue going forward. Additionally, the IT consulting industry is extremely competitive, with relatively low startup costs and few barriers to entry. While the current low valuation of Cognizant and future growth potential make the current risk/reward profile attractive, investors should still be aware of the risks to the bull thesis that could cause a further decline in share price.Despite a weak first half to 2019, Cognizant’s product and service offerings are well aligned with future growth trends, including IoT, data analytics/AI, and digital services. Managements decision to focus investment in these areas going forward will likely pay off for Cognizant, as they outweigh continued weakness in the Financial Services and Healthcare segments. While it remains to be seen whether management’s plan to improve margins will be successful, Cognizant’s current valuation of ~16 times forward earnings makes it one of the more attractive stocks in the technology sector."
4283115,23179,2019-08-08T07:54:24-04:00,"I believe it is never wise or prudent to sell an asset for less than its True Worth.I believe that if fundamentals remain strong, a price drop is more likely to initiate a buy decision than it is a sell decision.FAST Graphs Analyze Out Loud Video on Cognizant Technology.","An article on when to sell a stock would not be complete without some discussion about what I consider to be the worst reason to sell a stock. Ironically, this reason may be the one that is most commonly implemented by investors. Personally, I will rarely, if ever, sell a stock just because the price has fallen. If I've done my initial homework correctly, then a falling stock price would represent a great buying opportunity, not a rational reason to sell. If I buy a stock at $20 per share that I believe is worth at least $20 per share or more, then it seems logical to me that I should love it at $15 or even $10 per share. Of course, this is only true if the fundamentals remain solidly intact.I believe that if fundamentals remain strong, a price drop is more likely to initiate a buy decision than it is a sell decision. I believe this is important, because in my anecdotal experience most investors are inclined to sell a stock if the price drops below the price they paid. Admittedly, averaging down doesn’t always work out as expected. However, I have seen more people take unnecessary losses by selling a perfectly good stock than I have seen people losing more from averaging down into a sound and growing business.In June 2007, prior to the Great Recession, I initiated a position in the growth stock Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) for my total return portfolios. Note by the green dot on the graph that I purchased the company at a P/E ratio of 42, which indicated fair value based on its earnings growth rate of 43.5% (P/E ratio equal to earnings growth rate). From that point forward, the stock went on a freefall and by January 2009 right in the throes of the Great Recession, the price of this great growth stock was nearly cut in half from $19.85 when it was first purchased to $10.19.However, as I stated in the introduction, since I loved the stock at $20, I was crazy about it at $10. Therefore, considering that earnings continued to grow at a very high rate over this timeframe, instead of panicking, I enthusiastically doubled down on the stock. Note by doing so, I lowered my cost basis from $19.85 to $15.02. Although my timing actually turned out to be almost perfect, it was actually a combination of luck and good analysis.The lucky part was simply fortuitous timing that was technically unpredictable. In other words, I didn’t know the stock had bottomed out, but my analysis suggested that fundamentals continue to be strong and therefore I saw the stock available at ½ off sale.As you can clearly see, the company’s earnings growth continued and the stock price followed. Consequently, this holding has turned out to be one of the best performing stocks we have ever invested in. Imagine the cost to us if we had panicked and sold out just because the price had dropped even though fundamentals were as strong as ever. Therefore, I believe the worst reason to sell is because the price drops. But once again, that statement is predicated on the fundamentals remaining strong - or at least intact. In the long run, fundamentals matter more than price volatility.When reviewing the transactions it becomes clear that the decision to buy more Cognizant was a lot smarter than had we panicked and sold out. Once again, as I did in part 1 A of this article series, this is a real-life account and real-life results of one of our clients in Cognizant Technologies.FAST Graphs Analyze Out Loud Video Cognizant Technology SolutionsConsequently, for the above reasons and more, I personally eschew strategies based exclusively on short-term price action. I especially shun mechanical strategies such as stop losses. For starters, I believe it is never wise or prudent to sell an asset for less than its True Worth. Therefore, if I bought a stock at its true fundamental value or less, I would hardly be motivated to let someone take it from me at a lower price. I feel this way because I have great confidence in the notion that a stock gets its value from the earnings and cash flows that it generates on behalf of its stakeholders.Moreover, I believe that True Worth is something that the discerning investor can calculate within a reasonable range of accuracy. In contrast, guessing what short-term price action might or might not do is simply too unpredictable. To me, volatility is simply the price investors must be willing to pay for the liquidity that owning a common stock provides. Therefore, when I see one of my wonderful businesses selling for less than my calculation of its True Worth I do not see this as a loss, instead I at first see it as a currently, and temporarily, illiquid holding. But more importantly, I see this as a great opportunity to buy more at a better price and valuation.In summary, I believe it is never wise to sell a great business for less than it is truly worth or simply react to short-term price action. We must always remember that the stock market is an auction. Therefore, over the short run, emotions (sentiment) tend to rule. However, in the long run fundamentals matter most. Therefore, I trust fundamentals over emotions. Consequently, I believe that one of the worst reasons to sell a stock is simply because the price fell. If the fundamentals are deteriorating, then I agree the stock should be sold. Furthermore, if the stock is dramatically overvalued it might also be wise to sell. However, if the stock is fairly valued, or even undervalued, then by selling you are simply allowing others to take advantage of your emotional reaction."
4293383,95006,2019-09-25T01:16:50-04:00,This analysis of Cognizant Technology Solutions stock uses a 10-year time frame and assumes a recession will occur at some point over that period.It projects expected returns from sentiment reversion-to-mean and business/shareholder yield based on the last economic cycle.It offers a Buy/Sell/Hold suggestion.,"SourceTraditionally, most of my analysis on Seeking Alpha has focused on how to avoid losses and how to profit from the price cycles of classic cyclical stocks. There is another group of stocks, however, whose stock prices and earnings fluctuate far less than the classic cyclical stocks I have traditionally written about. While these stocks aren't as cyclical as a ""classic cyclical,"" they can still be subject to large swings in sentiment and can go through what I call ""sentiment cycles."" Recently, I have been adopting some of the techniques I've used with classic cyclicals and applying them to sentiment-driven cyclicals. Today's stock is one of those.One of the major assumptions I make for both approaches is that history is the most reliable guide to the future. My experience has been that 80% of the time, even if we looked at nothing else, a stock will behave in a similar manner as it did the previous cycle or two, unless there is a disruption to its core business. For this reason, I don't rely much on predictions of future earnings or sentiment that aren't supported by their existence during past cycles. That doesn't mean that ""this time is different"" isn't true sometimes - it just means that my analysis isn't counting on this time being much different. That said, if I think a stock is currently a ""Buy"" based on my 10-year, full-cycle analysis, before I invest I will examine the forward-looking trends and narratives more carefully to make sure there aren't major changes in the works that could affect the business.The main differences you'll find between my analysis and others' are that: 1) I focus on a clear 10-year time frame and the compound annual growth rate (aka CAGR) one might expect over that period of time; 2) I assume we will experience a recession during that time period, and I build that into the expected returns; 3) I try to calculate the expected returns based on a full business cycle; 4) I usually share both a basic shareholder return estimate and a more conservative shareholder return estimate, where I lower expected returns for companies with higher debt levels and raise them for companies with higher cash levels; and 5) I usually provide an ""opportunity risk/reward analysis"" if a stock is a ""Sell,"" so that we can get an idea of how likely it is that the stock will trade low enough to become a ""Buy"" again over the next few years.As part of the analysis, I calculate what I consider to be the two main drivers of future total returns: Market Sentiment returns and Business/Shareholder returns. (Within the Business/Shareholder return category, I further break down where the future expected returns will likely come from: dividends, buybacks, business reinvestment and earnings growth. This can help paint a clearer picture for investors who prefer to get their expected future earnings from one category or another.) I then combine the CAGR estimates from Market Sentiment and Business/Shareholder returns to get an expected 10-year, full-cycle CAGR estimate. Currently, I consider an expected 10-year CAGR > 12% a ""Buy,"" 4-12% a ""Hold"" and < 4% a ""Sell.""With that, let's get into the analysis.Since I use different approaches for analyzing a stock based on how cyclical earnings are, historical earnings cyclicality is the first thing I examine. Let's take a look at Cognizant Technology's (CTSH) historical earnings using a F.A.S.T. Graph, which is a great tool for this sort of analysis:I break down earnings cyclicality into five basic categories. The first category I call ""secular growth."" This category describes earnings that continue to rise every year, even during economic recessions. The next three categories are ""low,"" ""moderate"" and ""deep."" ""Low"" is usually for businesses which have earnings that have a history of declining in the single digits percentage-wise during downturns, but not much further than that. ""Deep"" I consider earnings that fall more than -50%, and ""moderate"" somewhere in between low and deep. And last but not least are businesses whose earnings go negative during cyclical downturns but recover soon after that, which I call ""highly cyclical."" For businesses that have earnings in the deep or highly cyclical categories, I use an entirely different type of analysis, so it's important to determine at the outset which category a stock falls into.In 19 out of the past 20 years, Cognizant has grown its EPS. This year, EPS is expected to decline by -13%. All other years saw EPS growth. For me, this is good enough to place the company's historical earnings in the ""low"" category, and on a scale of 1-8, I would rate Cognizant a ""2"" in terms of historical EPS cyclicality.For stocks ranked a ""2"", their price cycles are not usually explained as much by earnings fluctuations as they are by changes in market sentiment. In Cognizant's case, with EPS this stable, it is appropriate to use a 10-year, full-cycle analysis (which focuses on earnings and sentiment) rather than the shorter-term, price cycle-based analysis (which focuses on historical price cyclicality). So, using a 10-year, full-cycle analysis is what I will do.In order to estimate what sort of returns we might expect over the next 10 years, let's begin by examining what return I could expect 10 years from now if the P/E multiple were to revert to its mean from the previous economic cycle. In order to estimate that, I'm going to shorten the time frame of the F.A.S.T. Graph so it starts about 2007, a little before the last cyclical peak.Cognizant's current blended P/E is 14.96, while its normal P/E this past cycle has been 22.01. If over the course of the next 10 years, the P/E were to revert to 22.01 and everything else was held equal, it would produce a 10-year CAGR of about +3.94%.There are four components to the business/shareholder yield: the dividend yield, the expected buyback yield, the portion of the earnings yield that the business keeps to reinvest itself, and the full-cycle earnings growth rate. Ultimately, the business/shareholder yield is going to be limited by the earnings yield, so let's take a look at that.Data by YChartsCognizant's forward earnings yield is currently +6.38%.Since I'm using historical EPS estimates from F.A.S.T. Graphs for many of my calculations, I like to have a way to quickly check to see if a business is taking on debt (or already taken on debt) as a way to prop up those EPS numbers (often through stock buybacks). I like to look at free cash flow to equity/enterprise value yield in order to highlight potential problems. Looking at the longer-term chart typically also will show events like acquisitions, because there will often be a downward spike in the FCFE/EV yield. I tend to avoid stocks that have made bigger acquisitions or mergers and stocks that are borrowing money to buy back shares. So, this is a good, quick check for me to know whether I need to dig deeper or not.Data by YChartsThe FCFE/EV yield as of the end of last quarter is +6.20%, which is almost the same as the earnings yield. The spike down in late 2014 can be explained by their acquisition of TriZetto, but we can see the FCFE/EV yield quickly regained its normal trend by 2016. So, this all looks pretty good.The way I think about the earnings yield is that if I could theoretically buy Cognizant's business for $100, I would earn $6.38 on that investment the first year. Of course, in reality, not all of the earnings get paid out to investors. Some of the earnings might be used to reinvest in the business, and some might be used for stock buybacks or to pay down debt. The portion the investor receives directly comes via dividends. The current dividend yield is ~1.29%. So, right now, out of a $100 investment, you can probably expect to receive $1.29 back this year on that investment.Personally, I don't really care how management chooses to allocate earnings, as long as how earnings are allocated isn't completely irrational. It is perfectly fine for me if a company takes its earnings and reinvests them in the business as long as it can do so successfully. And if the business is no longer growing much, I am perfectly happy collecting a large dividend. Or, if the company's shares are cheap, I'm also happy with it buying back stock. Mostly what I care about is what the earnings yield is, and how much I can expect it to grow over the next 10 years so that I can estimate my likely return on an investment over that time frame.Currently, 1.29% is coming back in the form of a dividend. Let's see if we can expect something to come back in the form of a stock buyback.Examining the buyback history serves two purposes. The first is, much like the dividends, we want to know as investors how our money is being allocated. If the stock price of the business is low, then buybacks are a very efficient way of returning money to shareholders, especially if they are paid for with earnings instead of borrowed money. If the stock price is high, then buybacks are not a wise use of funds, because the returns might be lower than an investor might be able to get if they received a dividend and invested in something else or if the business invested in itself. The worst case is when a business is borrowing money to buy back expensive shares. Businesses that do this are to be avoided. It's a flashing warning sign that management's interests are not aligned with shareholders.Second, since I use long-term EPS trends in order to estimate earnings growth, I want to know how much stock was repurchased over the last cycle, so that I can back out those stock repurchases when making my earnings growth estimates.Data by YChartsSince 2007, Cognizant has repurchased about 3.12% of its shares. I will back these share buybacks out of EPS estimates later in the analysis, but first I want to estimate how much shareholder yield we might expect from buybacks based on the most recent trends of 3 years and 1 year.Data by YChartsData by YChartsWhile Cognizant hasn't reduced shares that much over the long-term, the near-term trend is quite different. Over the past three years, they have reduced shares outstanding by about 4.50% per year. If we combine that with their dividend yield of 1.29%, we get a shareholder yield of about +5.79%. This leaves about +0.59% for Cognizant to reinvest in its business or use for acquisitions.This is a pretty interesting distribution of earnings and one that I find attractive. The +1.29% dividend yield probably isn't enough to attract income investors, and Cognizant's recent EPS decline is probably enough to scare away growth investors. SA's current momentum rating on the stock is D+, so momentum investors are likely on the sidelines as well. What Cognizant is giving us are very big stock buybacks. And if those buybacks are being made at reasonable prices, this could make Cognizant a very interesting sleeper stock for investors like me who don't care where future total returns come from. Let's continue on and see if they are indeed paying a reasonable price for the stock with the buybacks.Since I am interested in how much money Cognizant might be earning over the next 10 years, I also want to take into account any additional earnings from EPS growth that might occur over this time period. I'll estimate that by looking at the previous cycle, which runs about 13 years from 2007 to 2020, and I'll remove the effects of stock buybacks. When I do the math on that, I get a cyclically adjusted earnings growth rate of +20.13%, which is a very fast rate of growth.Of course, one of the reasons Cognizant stock has sold off as much as it has is because that growth rate isn't likely to continue. Fortunately, Cognizant is well-covered by the analyst community. Currently, the sell-side analyst consensus is that Cognizant is a 'hold' (which basically means they are negative on the stock) and their average EPS growth expectation for the next couple of years is +9.00%. So, since they are mostly negative on the stock, I'll use this 9% growth rate as my more conservative or realistic EPS growth rate expectation along with the historical one.Now, what I want to do is to apply those growth rates to current earnings looking forward 10 years in order to get a final 10-year CAGR estimate. The way I think about this is, if I bought Cognizant's whole business for $100, it would pay me back $6.38 per year, and that amount would grow at +20.15% per year based on the last cycle, or +9.00% based on current analysts' projections, for 10 years. I want to know how much money I would have in total at the end of 10 years on my $100 investment. I calculate that to be about $299.96 using the historical growth rate and $205.57 using analysts' expected growth rate, and that translates to a range of +7.47% to +11.61% 10-year CAGR. Since I'm a fairly conservative investor, I lean more toward the lower end of these estimates.Potential future returns can come from two main places: market sentiment or business/shareholder returns. If we assume that market sentiment reverts to the mean from the last cycle over the next 10 years, Cognizant will produce a +3.94% CAGR. If the business/shareholder yield and growth are similar to the last cycle, the company should produce a +7.47 to +11.61% 10-year CAGR. If we put the two together, we get an expected 10-year, full-cycle CAGR of +11.41% to +15.55%. The lower end of this range is near my 12% threshold for a 'buy' rating on the stock, so I am going to go ahead and rate the stock a 'buy' here.Cognizant's business is slowing down compared to its historical growth rate. I think this has caused growth investors to leave the stock, which has in turn caused momentum investors to leave as well. Currently, Cognizant's relatively new dividend has a low yield of +1.29% and isn't enough to attract typical income-oriented investors who tend to want high current yields or long dividend growth streaks. These are the main reasons why I think the stock price is trading down.On the positive side, Cognizant has a long history of very steady earnings growth. Occasionally, almost all businesses are faced with some sort of disruption or bumps in the road. It is very rare to have EPS go up in a straight line forever. Cognizant has a strong balance sheet and the new CEO seems capable and is focused on reviving the company's historical growth trajectory. They are earning over 6% per year and most of that they are using to buy back shares at prices that look very reasonable to me. I am happy to own a company like Cognizant earning 6% in a 1.5% interest rate environment even if they don't have any earnings growth for a while.That said, I am not an expert on Cognizant's business, how it works, and changes that might be taking place under the surface. It is a very complicated global business. For that reason, I will weight my investment with a 1% portfolio weighting so that if there is some fatal flaw here that I am missing, it won't totally destroy my overall portfolio.I think over the next cycle, Cognizant's downside risk seems quite a bit lower than the upside potential so I am adding it to my portfolio. It is only the third large-cap stock I have added in 2019. Altria (MO) and Ryanair (RYAAY) are the other two."
4274891,21815,2019-07-15T05:44:58-04:00,"Cognizant's core growth seems to be slowing, and it hit some turbulence in the first quarter as its two main segments experience cost pressures.The company does have things going for it. The digital transformation of customers and its platform business allows for faster and less linear growth.The company also produces copious amounts free cash flow, allowing it to grow through acquisitions and reduce its share count and pay dividend.Cost cutting and a flatter organization structure should help, but whether this fully addresses the pressures of its financial and healthcare clients remains to be seen.","Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) was a traditional IT services provider, which mostly involves the nuts and bolts of implementation of software, linking it to legacy applications and maintenance of applications.But there is something more fundamental going on in business which can be summarized as ""digital transformation,"" where companies embark on a more or less ground-up orchestrated change (often involving moving to the cloud and/or establishing cloud platforms).This changes the nature of the type of services Cognizant has to provide and it becomes much more of - in the words of its CEO - a ""thought leader and solutions provider."" That is, it is taking a lead role in the architecture of the digital transformation of its clients, rather than just being an implementer of off-the-shelf solutions from third-party vendors (like ERP systems).This transformation is going in fits, depending on industries and clients, so the company's performance is a bit choppy. Acquisitions helped to keep revenues growing (see SA contributor Compass Equity Research article on these):Data by YChartsWhat's not so clear in the figure above is that revenue growth has been tapering off:Data by YChartsTraditional IT services is a pretty linear business where output and headcount go hand in hand. That is still the case for most of Cognizant's business, but it is assuming a broader role:For the first, the company has amassed a wealth of industry-specific knowledge and capabilities which it can put to work in its two main sectors: finance and healthcare (good for two-thirds of revenues). Here is Jared Weisfeld, Technology Sector Specialist at Jefferies, summarizing it (40th Nasdaq Investor Conference):Cognizant has done something clever in acquiring TriZetto back in 2014, which allowed the company to start its own platform in healthcare which takes over clients' entire operations. These platforms have several advantages:The company runs several of these platforms, mostly in healthcare but also in adjacent markets like life sciences and pharma (Nasdaq IR day):We think this is a promising part of Cognizant's business, even if it's unclear how much revenue this generates at the moment.From the earnings deck:Q1 was quite disappointing, as demand from the financial sector especially was considerably lower than what management anticipated. There was a big miss in EPS (15%) and a small one in revenue (1.3%). Here is the revenue over the company's different businesses (10-Q):Comparing that with the Q1 2018 figures:This shows that the company's communications, media and tech sector is its fastest revenue growth business with nearly 20% growth, while its biggest sector, financial services actually shrank a few points.This sector is plagued by pressure to reduce costs and the imperative to make a digital transition, under pressure from more nimble upstarts (""FinTech"") which don't have an expensive legacy network of branches. According to CFO Karen McLaughlin (Nasdaq IR conference):Things seem to be improving and are closely tied to this digital transformation:It's too early to say whether there is light at the end of the tunnel yet and growth will resume in the financial sector. IT spending budgets are also suffering because of recession fears.Mergers, which is one way that financial companies deal with cost pressures, don't help either, as they typically involve a consolidation of contracts and some pullback in their discretionary spending.While the company's healthcare business is still growing, it also faces similar challenges, but they seem to be less immediate (no surprise given that many companies in the medical sector enjoy a great deal of market power).Management argues that roughly 30% of their work is now on digital transformation of the company's clients, and this is expected to expand.Apart from benefiting from the tailwind from digital transformation, what is the company doing to revive growth?The company has embarked on an organizational restructuring which the double aim of cutting costs and empowering the front line (CFO on the Nasdaq day):The company also aims to invest the proceeds of the cost-cutting part back into growth, and argues that growth revival and margin expansion can go hand in hand (Q1CC):While sounding logical in theory, this all remains to be seen, of course.What is also clear is that most of the revenue (75%) is coming from North America and management sees opportunities to expand the company's overseas business, here is CFO Karen McLaughlin (Nasdaq IR conference):Indeed, some international markets provided solid growth (earnings deck):From the earnings deck:The medium-term outlook (Nasdaq IR day):Data by YChartsAs a result of the headwinds, margins, which tend to be rather stable, have taken a dive, although the GAAP operational margin crash (shown in the graph) is significantly affected (Q1CC):The adjusted operational margin was 16%, which is a little lower due to seasonality and accelerated hiring in Q1. Management argues that margins will recover because of the shift to higher-margin digital and the cost-cutting, and expects the full-year adjusted margin to come in at 17%.Data by YChartsQ1 produced quite a dip in cash flow, but the company still produces $2 billion+ of free cash flow a year. The share buybacks run well ahead of share-based compensation, so it isn't surprising that the share count is decreasing quite significantly:Data by YChartsOn top of that, Cognizant pays a dividend (with the yield at a modest 0.8%) and engages in frequent M&A activity. Here is how the company spent its cash in Q1 (earnings deck):Its policy is roughly:The company went well beyond that in Q1 (Q1CC):Data by YChartsWe're at the low end of valuation metrics historically, and this isn't surprising given the growth slowdown.Analyst expect an EPS this year of $3.89, rising to $4.34 in 2020, which gives the company a forward multiple of 15. The shares have taken a big hit from the disappointing Q1, but have made up considerable ground since:There is upside for the company from the shift to digital, international expansion, the cost-cutting program, the enormous cash generation and the related reduction in share count.However, there are considerable uncertainties in its two bread and butter sectors, where many clients seem to be under considerable cost pressure.While it's likely Q1 was the low point given the accelerated hiring, shares have made half of the ground lost since the Q1 results were published already. Though we think it's likely the shares can make up some more lost ground if market sentiment stays positive, cautious investors might want to wait for confirmation of the Q2 figures before plunging in."
4265037,95206,2019-05-18T00:29:13-04:00,"Cognizant is a high-quality IT services company that generates a high level of return on invested capital and stands to benefit from long-term structural growth drivers.The recent downward adjustment in FY19 growth targets following a weak 1Q19 has resulted in a material share price correction of approx. 20%.However, the long-term thesis for an investment in Cognizant remains largely intact, and the current valuation provides an attractive buying opportunity.","Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) recently reported its 1Q19 results which came below expectations due to softness in its financial services and healthcare segments. As a result, the company made a downward revision in its full-year outlook, which prompted a stock price decline of approx. 20%.Despite this temporary setback, we believe that the long-term investment case on Cognizant remains largely intact. As a result, we have recently increased our stake in the company, which we have owned since 2016.This article briefly outlines our investment thesis on Cognizant.Established in 1994 in New Jersey, Cognizant is a leading provider of professional services aiming to assist clients transforming their business model for the digital era. Its services include digital services & solutions, consulting, application development, systems integration, application testing & maintenance, infrastructure services, and business process services.In 2018, Cognizant derived some 76% of revenues from North America, 18% from Europe (nearly half of which from the UK), and 6% from the rest of the world. By end markets, the company serves customers in the financial services industry (35% of 2018 sales), healthcare (29%), products & resources (22%), and communications, media & technology (14%).Source: Cognizant corporate factsheetCognizant provides its services to some of the largest corporations worldwide, including 48 of the Fortune 100 companies. In 2018, the company employed close to 282,000 people, of which over 195,000 are located in India.Cognizant operates in a highly competitive environment. According to the company, key competitors include Accenture (ACN), Atos (OTCPK:OTCPK:AEXAF), Capgemini (OTCPK:OTCPK:CAPMF), Deloitte Digital, DXC Technology (DXC), EPAM Systems (EPAM), Genpact (G), HCL Technologies (OTCPK:OTCPK:HCTHY), IBM Global Services (IBM), Infosys Limited (INFY), Tata Consultancy Services (OTCPK:OTCPK:TTNQY) and Wipro (WIT); as well as a number of smaller local competitors in various markets.The principal competitive factors affecting the markets for its services include performance and reliability, quality of technical support, training and services; responsiveness to customer needs; reputation and experience; financial stability and corporate governance; as well as pricing.IT services has been a fast-growing market over the past two decades, and there is little sign that this will change going forward as a result of the accelerating digitalization of the world economy. While historically, this mainly referred to basic IT services (e.g., a company outsourcing its servers), it is now increasingly about an integrated approach bringing together all key aspects of business management, including strategy, technology, data analytics, sales & marketing, etc. A growing number of corporations are recognizing the fact that digital technology is both a potential source of disruption for established business models, as well as a source of opportunity to innovate, be more efficient, and enhance one’s competitive position.Arguably, this trend of digitalization remains in its infancy, with many more industries and business models yet to be impacted by both the risks and opportunities it presents. Stated differently, IT consultancy and services should continue to experience above-GDP growth going forward. According to Morningstar, market research firm Gartner expects the overall global IT services industry to grow at a CAGR of 4-5% over the next five years. For reasons stated in the next section, we believe that Cognizant can continue to outgrow its underlying market.Over the years, Cognizant has built a strong reputation in the marketplace, and is generally considered to be on equal footing with some of its long-established competitors. Perhaps the easiest way to illustrate the highly successful track record that Cognizant has built over its 20+ years of existence is how quickly it has outgrown its competition, albeit from a low base. Most of its growth has been organic in nature, although the company did make a sizable acquisition in 2014, purchasing TriZetto Corporation for USD 2.7 billion. In 2018, the company continued to broaden its range of capabilities, making a total of six smaller acquisitions for USD 1.1 billion.Why is Cognizant outperforming its peers in this competitive marketplace? If it were to be summed up in two main points, it would be its ""client-first attitude"" and long-term focus. It appears clear that Cognizant’s management understands that intangible assets such as customer relationships, reputation, and branding are the main source of long-term competitive advantages in this industry, and this is reflected in many aspects of the firm’s strategy and modus operandi. Not only is this evidenced in the firm’s superior organic growth track record, but it is also exemplified by the company’s high client retention rate (of approx. 90%, much higher than peers), as well as its market leader status in terms of client satisfaction, according to studies by third-parties.Profitability, capital efficiency, and returns on investment:Source: Thomson ReutersCognizant runs a consistently profitable business, which is fairly capital-light, and thus generates very healthy return levels on invested capital of approx. 20%. Note that ROA is burdened by the large amount of cash that is sitting on the balance sheet, representing nearly 30% of total assets as of the end of FY18. Likewise, it is important to note that ROIC has declined from 2014 onwards following the acquisition of TriZetto, which has added a sizable amount of goodwill on the balance sheet.GrowthAs shown below, Cognizant has grown at a very rapid pace over the past couple of decades. Over the last 10 years, it has grown sales, operating profits, net income, and EPS at a CAGR in excess of 15%, way faster than the growth of the underlying market.Source: Thomson ReutersPlease note that a number of extraordinary items blur the picture regarding growth in net income and EPS in the past three years. Specifically, the company paid a high level of income tax in 2016 following the one-time remittance of cash from India to the U.S. in order to fund its plan to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Moreover, in 2017, the company incurred a one-time incremental income tax expense of USD 617 million related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Under normal conditions, EPS is expected to grow slightly in excess of top-line growth.Cash FlowsSource: Thomson ReutersCognizant runs a fairly cash-generative business despite extending attractive payment terms to its clients, as shown by the average days receivable outstanding of nearly three months. As a service provider, it holds no inventory, which helps minimize the amount of cash that is tied up in the business.Earnings quality is high, with cash from operations (CFO) systematically higher than net income, averaging nearly 120% over the past decade. Overall, free cash flow (FCF) generation is very strong, with a cash conversion rate of nearly 100%.The company is in a stellar financial position. Both cash and shareholders’ equity (i.e., retained earnings) increase steadily over the years. Historically, cognizant had no debt until the acquisition of TriZetto in late 2014. Even as it raised over USD 1.5 billion in debt, the balance sheet was hardly levered, and it has steadily paid down its debt ever since. Overall, with a net position of nearly USD 4 billion (13.5% of current market capitalization), Cognizant is in a very strong financial state.Source: Thomson ReutersBy and large, Cognizant has had a solid historical track record regarding its managerial capabilities and capital allocation decisions. The only noteworthy hiccup was the unexpected resignation of Gordon Coburn in late 2016, who held the position of president at the time, which seemed to be related to an internal investigation into certain payments in India that may have been made improperly.For the past 12 years between 2007 and early 2019, Francisco D’Souza has been CEO of Cognizant, overseeing a continuous period of profitable growth, innovation and success. Throughout that time, Cognizant’s revenues increased more than 10x from USD 1.42 billion in 2006 to USD 16.1 billion in 2018.In February 2019, Cognizant announced that Brian Humphries would be the firm’s next CEO, while Mr. D’Souza would stay on as Vice Chairman of the Board. Mr. Humphries was formerly CEO of Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) Business, and also previously held leadership positions at global technology leaders Dell (NYSE:DELL) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPE).Despite being the first ""outsider"" to lead the firm, we don’t expect any meaningful changes in corporate strategy or capital allocation decisions. The firm is still expected to reinvest profits, both internally and via acquisitions, to grow its footprint and capabilities in order to better serve clients in a fast-evolving digital economy. The company will likely continue to focus increasingly on returning excess cash to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks, helping to alleviate the ""growth at any cost"" concerns that some investors might have had. This notion is also supported by the fact that the recent U.S. tax reform will make it less burdensome for companies to repatriate cash generated outside of the U.S. for such purposes.Cognizant only started paying out a quarterly dividend in the second quarter of 2017, and its track record is thus way too short to analyze. As of today, the quarterly dividend stands at USD 0.20 per share, or a dividend yield of 1.4%. The payout ratio was approx. 22% of net income and 18% of cash from operations.Unsurprisingly, the estimated intrinsic value of a high-ROIC company like Cognizant is highly dependent on its growth profile. While it likely won’t maintain its historical growth of 15%+, we believe that Cognizant will continue to outgrow the wider IT services market. We expect the company to grow sales at a CAGR of about 6% over the next 10 years, slightly in excess of the underlying market. We anticipate the company to make steady progress towards its goal of reaching a non-GAAP operating margin of about 22%, as it adjusts its fairly flexible cost base and moderates discretionary spending and investments according to business activity.Using a terminal growth rate of 2% p.a. and a WACC of 9.0%, our DCF model yields a fair value (FV) of approx. USD 75 per share. Our sensitivity analysis points to a FV range of USD 60-90.A FV of USD 75 per share represents a multiple of approx. 19x our GAAP EPS estimate of USD 3.80 per share in FY19, which is in line with long-term historical multiples and warranted by the company’s return and growth profile.Last, the consensus price target and Morningstar FV estimate are USD 69 and USD 79 respectively.Key risks include increasing competitive rivalry and pricing pressure, attrition rates and ability to attract and maintain IT professionals, unknowns related to cloud computing and the cannibalization of traditional IT outsourcing services, as well as FX risk (exposure to the Indian rupee-USD exchange rate).Investing in the technology sector is often a difficult endeavor for conservative, long-term investors due to its inherently fast-moving and ever-changing competitive environment. Having said that, we believe that IT consulting and services firms such as Cognizant deserve some attention, as they stand to benefit from the increasing digitalization of the business world, without bearing the risk of being tied to any specific technology platform.While the company might not appear as ""cheap"" at first glance, anyone who understands the drivers of value creation knows it must be looked at through the prism of return on capital and growth. Cognizant’s long-term track record clearly shows that the company consistently earns about twice its cost of capital, with unlevered ROEs of approx. 20%, and grows at a fast rate, in excess of 15% this past decade. We believe it can maintain a high-single-digit earnings growth over the next decade. While a PE multiple in the mid-teens certainly isn't ""cheap"" on an absolute basis, it is cheap relative to relative to the firm’s potential to compound earnings in the years to come.We have held a position in the company since 2016, and have recently accumulated more shares.Appendix:Source: Thomson Reuters"
4227322,38631,2018-12-09T19:39:48-05:00,"The market has punished CTSH to the extreme due to the uncertainty over the success of its ongoing transition.However, CTSH is still growing its earnings per share at a double-digit rate.It has grown its earnings per share at a double-digit rate for more than 10 consecutive years.CTSH recently provided guidance for 7%-11% annual revenue growth over the next five years.CTSH is poised to offer double-digit annual returns over the next five years.","I first recommended purchasing Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) about five years ago. Since then, the stock has rallied 117% and has thus outperformed the S&P by a wide margin, as the latter has advanced only 64% during this period. Nevertheless, Cognizant has lost 20% off its peak early this year and is now trading around its 52-week lows. As a result, the stock has become a great bargain.Growth recordCognizant has an exceptional growth record. During the last decade, the company has grown its earnings per share more than 6-fold, from $0.72 in 2008 to an expected $4.51 this year. Even better, it has grown its earnings per share at a double-digit rate for more than 10 consecutive years. This impressive consistency is a testament to the strength of its business model, its perfect execution and the quality of its management. The latter should be one of the primary criteria in stock selection so investors should not underestimate its importance.ValuationDue to its correction since the summer, Cognizant is now trading at a P/E ratio of 15.1. This is much lower than its 10-year average of 19.7 and surprisingly low for a company with such an impressive growth record. Nevertheless, as the market never offers great bargains without a good reason, investors should understand the reason behind the cheap valuation of the stock before purchasing it.The reason behind the cheap valuationThe cheap valuation of Cognizant has resulted from the fact that the company is going through a transitional phase. Until a few years ago, Cognizant was essentially an information technology provider. All its top 10 customers were either banking clients or healthcare clients. The company managed to grow at a relentless pace for several years thanks to those clients.However, it is impossible to keep growing at a fast pace forever in a given business. As a result, the company is trying to build up other services, namely consultant services and digital services. The process has been going on for some years, with very promising results. In fact, two of the top 10 customers are technology clients and management expects this number to rise further as the company tries to diversify from financial services and healthcare.When a company goes through a transformational phase, there is usually high uncertainty over the success of the project. As the market hates uncertainty, it tends to punish such stocks with a low P/E ratio. This is exactly the case with Cognizant. However, the company does not deserve its current cheap valuation. First of all, it is still growing its earnings per share at a double-digit pace (20% this year). In addition, thanks to the quality of its management and its exceptional execution record, Cognizant will almost certainly succeed in this transition. Therefore, the pessimism of the market over the growth prospects of Cognizant is overblown.GuidanceSome customers of Cognizant try to reduce their operating expenses and thus sometimes curtail the budgets of projects from which Cognizant would generate revenues. However, this cost-cutting effect does not last for long, as per the experience of Cognizant’s management. Companies eventually feel threatened when they remain stagnant in a fast-changing business environment, which may disrupt their business model at some point. As a result, Cognizant continues to enjoy rising revenues.Management has provided promising 5-year guidance. It expects to grow the organic revenues by 6%-9% per year over this period. It also expects to enhance growth thanks to the acquisition of small companies going forward. Cognizant has performed a long series of tuck-in acquisitions during the last decade and has successfully integrated them so it is reasonable to believe its management that such acquisitions will enhance its annual growth rate to 7%-11% over the next five years.Management has not issued guidance for next year yet. It will issue its guidance in February, when its customers complete their budgeting process. Moreover, management recently stated that the revenue growth in a single year may differ but the average annual revenue growth rate will be 7%-11% over the next five years. Given the quality of management, it is reasonable to rely on its guidance and expect Cognizant to remain in its solid growth trajectory in the upcoming years.Expected returnsCognizant has grown its earnings per share at a double-digit rate for more than 10 consecutive years. In addition, its management expects 7%-11% revenue growth so it essentially signals double-digit growth of earnings per share. Nevertheless, in order to be on the safe side, investors should expect 8%-10% annual earnings-per-share growth over the next five years.Moreover, as soon as the market realizes that the transitioning of Cognizant is successful, it is likely to reward the stock with a more reasonable valuation. As a result, the P/E ratio of the stock is likely to climb from 15.1 to at least 18.0. If the expansion of the valuation level of the stock occurs within the next five years, it will enhance its annual returns by approximately 3.6% per year. Therefore, given also its 1.2% dividend yield, the stock is likely to offer an approximate 13%-15% average annual return over the next five years. Investors should thus take advantage of the bargain valuation of the stock.Final thoughtsAs the market always hates uncertainty, it has punished Cognizant to the extreme due to its ongoing transition. However, the company has an unparalleled growth record and consistency, as well as exemplary management. Moreover, it is still growing its bottom line at double-digit rates. As a result, the stock is likely to offer double-digit annual returns in the upcoming years thanks to its sustained earnings growth and expansion of its P/E ratio."
4225356,104217,2018-11-29T08:38:15-05:00,Digital economy is growing at triple the pace of the economy.CTSH's 4 business segments will benefit from this booming industry.CTSH can expect growth of +10% for the next 5 years.,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (CTSH) is well-positioned to benefit from the growth of the digital economy. CTSH provides consulting and outsourcing services worldwide. The company offers its technology services to clients divided into four segments: Financial Services; Healthcare; Products and Resources; and Communications, Media and Technology.The company also develops, licenses, implements, and supports various software products for the healthcare industry. It provides maintenance services, information technology (IT) services such as data center, infrastructure security, mobility services, and networking.In the following sections, we will look at CTSH's past 5 annual reports, and we will discuss how the company will achieve +10% growth rate during the next 5 years.Sources: Yahoo Finance and CTSH 2013 Annual ReportCTSH managed to generate a steady growth in terms of revenue. However, its net margins have decreased from 18.9% (2013) to 10.1% (2017). A quick look at the company’s quarterly results for 2018 shows that the company is now operating in the range of 11‐12%. This has a direct impact on the growth of net income. However, net margins seem to be stabilizing, so growth of the net income should be on the menu in the following quarters. As of Q32018, we can predict the Fiscal 2018 to produce Revenues of $16-16.1B, which will represent a year-over-year growth of 8.7%The company has a sound balance sheet. The current ratio has stayed above 2 every year between 2014 and 2017. The company has seen its liabilities grow by 21.7%, which exceeds the growth of assets and of shareholders' equity. This can be explained by the fact CTSH made several acquisitions between 2013 and 2017. At this point, I am not too concerned about its debt level, as long as the company can keep a solid cash position. It will be interesting to see if the company can improve its Return on Equity, which has decreased from 27.3% (2013) to 14.1% (2017). It is certainly one of the reasons why net income growth was slower rate than revenues.Let's now look at CTSH current market valuation. Let's compare the company's PE and PEG ratio with its peers.Given the expected growth rate of CTSH, I conclude that its valuation is one of the most attractive of its peers.I also conducted a DCF analysis. The output of my model provides a price per share of $77.85/share. I conclude that, at its current market price of $68.79/share, CTSH stock could be undervalued.The main assumptions I used in my DCF analysis are:My 1-year price target for this stock is $84/share, which is 22% above current market price.The company recognizes its revenue under 4 business segments:1. Financial Services (Banking, Insurance) 2. Healthcare (Healthcare, Life Science) 3. Products and Resources (Retail, Manufacturing, Logistics, Travel, Energy & Utilities) 4. Communications, Media & TechnologyHere is the breakdown of the revenue generated in 2017 by business segment: Financial (38.1%), Healthcare (28.8%), Communication/Media (12.6%), Products and Resources (20.5%)The company generates its revenue around the globe. However, North America (77.3%) provides the bulk of CTSH revenue. The company is also active in Europe (16.2%). The company only generates 6.5% in the Rest of the World.As governments and companies are trying to increase their efficiency, let's discuss the growth potential for each business segment.Financial ServicesThe financial services segment is the most important and most profitable of the company. The growth has been steady but modest between 2015 and 2017 (6.1%). Insurance companies were the biggest factor contributing to this growth, because some banking clients are focusing on the optimization of their cost structure. Banking companies will continue spending on digital transformation and security of their platforms at some point in the following quarters or years. At this point, a 3% growth rate for this segment seems more reasonable, if we consider the company's latest earnings release.HealthcareRevenue from the Healthcare segment grew by 7.8% (per year) between 2015 and 2017. The company says (2017 annual report) that this segment has been negatively affected by the uncertainties regarding the regulatory environment. Healthcare is, however, expected to provide a solid growth opportunity has the regulatory environment is changing, and the industry is transforming itself.At this point, I would be fair to believe that the company can still grow its Healthcare revenue by 9-10% per year in the next 2‐3 years, if we take a look at the company's latest earnings release.Products & ResourcesThe Products & Resources segment had a growth rate of 13.8% between 2015 and 2017. The company acknowledges that most of the growth is coming from customers from the Energy/Utilities industry, from the Manufacturing industry and from Logistics.Demand from this segment of the company is driven by the increased adoption of digital technologies from its customers’ business, as well as growing demand for analytics and the digital transformation of the customers’ operating models.This segment should see some strong growth in the following quarters. I expect to see a 15% growth from this segment during the next 2‐3 years.Communications, Media & TechnologyThis segment revenue growth rate was 15.5% between 2015 and 2017, and grew 17.1% year over year between Q32017 and Q32018. Growth was driven mostly by the increased adoption of digital technologies and by the addition of digital content by its customers. Platform engineering for cloud solutions will help CTSH grow this segment by 15‐16% per year during the next 2‐3 years.AcquisitionsThe company made several acquisitions since 2013 in order to boost is manpower, revenues, and net income. Since CTSH has a solid cash position, I will not be surprised if this strategy (M&A) is kept alive to help fuel growth.Expansion outside of North America seems to be logical as the company must try to increase its revenues in Europe and abroad.At the moment, I would not consider any growth from Acquisitions, because it would only speculate about future events that may never take place. However, this is a growth opportunity for CTSH.Improving Net Margins The company must work hard to improve its net margins. I was pleased to read in a recent press release that upper management recognized that profit growth will require higher net margins. Time (and financial updates) will provide a better picture of whether the company can improve, or not, on this important financial ratio.One of the reasons that can justify eroding net margins are the acquisitions made by the company during the last 4‐5 years. Finding synergies between the various teams and business segments will be required in order to achieve higher net margins.Just like any other businesses, CTSH must face risk that could negatively impact its business operations. Here are the ones I judge the most important.RegulationsRegulations and uncertainties of the healthcare systems in the United States can have a major impact on the revenue growth of the Healthcare segment.Economic Slowdown in the USA and Europe As we have seen, most of the company’s revenue is generated in the USA and Europe. An economic slowdown in one or both continents will have a significant impact on the company’s ability to generate revenues.Intense CompetitionThe company faces intense competition from large companies. The list of competitors that will compete for their share of this growing market is long. Companies such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), CGI (NYSE:GIB), Infosys (NYSE:INFY), just to name a few, will compete with CTSH in years to come. The company remains competitive, notably by keeping its costs low and its net margins as high as possible.Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation should benefit from the growth of the digital economy. The company has a solid balance sheet along with a presence around the world, most notably in North America, Europe, and India. Growth should be driven by:Long-term investors aiming at seizing the benefits of the growth of the digital economy should consider investing on CTSH."

        Cost-cutting should drive margin expansion.
        CTSH remains generous around capital return: both buybacks and dividends.","We recommend CTSH shares, projecting approximately 25% upside from the current levels within the next nine-eighteen months. Cognizant focuses on three core verticals: Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, which collectively make up about 90% of its revenue base. The Financial Services vertical focuses on banking/transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services. The Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics group includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers. The Healthcare group includes largely healthcare providers and payers. In addition, the company also has clients in media, entertainment, high tech, and telecom groups, albeit its presence in those segments is much smaller than that of its core competitors, such as Accenture, Infosys, and IBM.Per our industry-wide analysis and Cognizant’s favorable fundamentals, and given the company’s strong capital return story, we believe that CTSH shares merit ~14.5x PE multiple. We note that this multiple comes at a ~2-2.5x discount relative to other players in the IT Services space, making our valuation fairly conservative. When we apply it to our EPS estimate of $5.51, we get the target price of $80.We see the following near-term catalysts for CTSH shares that justify our $80 target price:2. Meaningful Operating Margin Expansion Expected: We expect at least 130 bps in margin expansion this year, with our year-end estimate at 21%. The company remains very much focused on labor costs and wage inflation, as well as managing various R&D costs. Further, senior leadership cautiously proceeds with expansion into emerging (“growth”) markets, making sure that margins of these specific markets are in line with the company-wide target of 20-21%. While there have been some uneven months, when the operating margin modestly contracted, these were SG&A-driven one-off's.3. Generous Capital Return to Continue: Historically, Cognizant has been a generous buyer of its own stock, in addition to 2-3% dividend yield. With the recent tax reform implemented, Cognizant proceeded to accelerate its repurchase activity, planning as much as $1.5 billion in buybacks and dividends on an annual basis.4. Strong FCF Generation Implies Imminent Deals: With EBITDA to FCF generation around 60%, we believe that the company may seek some tuck-in deals or perhaps a more transformational acquisition with its FCF base of ~$350-400 MM in 2019.5. CTO Survey Looks Positive: Upon close examination of the annual CTO (Chief Technology Officers) survey, we see management of top companies remaining bullish about their own company prospects and respective investments in internal tech projects. At present, they expect 5-7% growth in such investments, which we believe is a strong read for top IT Services players in this field, such as Cognizant.We see the following four core risks to our thesis.While CTSH strives to make the pricing structure attractive to its core clients and, henceforth, attract greater business, we see a number of Indian players, such as Infosys, Tata Consultancy, and Wipro, potentially lowering prices in the foreseeable future2. Too Much US Exposure:Cognizant is one of the few major IT services companies with the bulk of the revenue coming from the US (approximately 85%). Such lack of diversification may ultimately lead to significant revenue pressures, should the US hit a recession.3. Legislative Uncertainty:The company heavily relies on H1-B and L-1 visas; over the last several years Congress attempted to heavily regulate the number of visa workers each company can hire.4. Industry-Specific Risks: Since CTSH is so dependent on Financial Services, Healthcare, and Manufacturing industries, a sudden downturn in any of those sectors (e.g., Financial Services in 2008) can lead to a meaningful negative impact to the company’s top-line."
4223873,104306,2018-11-21T10:40:31-05:00,"CTSH has retreated from its highs at the ~$80 range for about 20%.Positive signals from management during investor day reassures growth opportunities, while top-line will be the focus in the near term.Market sentiment towards revenue growth still outweighs margin improvement.12-month target price of $81 with Positive outlook; downside risks fairly limited to internal inability to execute growth strategy.","We are optimistic towards the future growth prospects of the Company, namely the acquisition-based expansion strategy and the further leverage of digital-driven growth. The acquisition-based strategy could remain sustainable in the upcoming few years due to the strong credit profile of the Company (see figure below).CTSH Debt To Capital (Quarterly) data by YChartsApart from the acquisition-driven expansion strategy, we see the digital growth strategy as an exciting opportunity with high upsides, notably maintaining the mid-teens top-line growth that is achieved over the past several years and building up productivity capabilities. Even though the Company is prioritising revenue growth over margins at the moment, we believe that the infrastructure behind generating revenue growth will be key to achieving better margins.Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (CTSH) is a professional services company, providing consulting, technology and outsourcing services through four segments:The following gives a snapshot of the business and geographic segments of the Company:Source: Company filings, extracted from CapIQThe Company is one of the market-leading firms within the technology consulting and services industry. Its main competitors include DXC Technology (DXC), Infosys (INFY), Tata Consultancy Services (OTCPK:TTNQY), Leidos Holdings (LDOS) and Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH).CTSH Market Cap data by YChartsNote: Tata Consultancy Services is not listed in the US and it has a current market cap of $98.5bn as of writing the article.During the most recent Investor Day, the Company has made it very clear about its digitally-focused growth strategy, highlighting six main capabilities across all of its segments. Within its Digital Business, the Company expects to devote more R&D resources to driving revenue growth through both Interactive and Analytics & AI. Through intelligent process automation and platform solutions, the Digital Operations will streamline business process restructuring for clients. Digital Systems & Technology will streamline and modernize legacy IT systems through modernization at its entirety and digital engineering.Furthermore, the Company views further acquisitions as a catalyst for further revenue growth. We are quite optimistic about such a strategy, given their track record of satisfactory deal executions, and their current market-leading scale should provide them with adequate leverage in executing lateral expansions.Another key takeaway from the Investor Day is the future management strategy of emphasizing revenue growth or margins. CFO Karen McLoughlin puts it this way: ""certainly first and foremost our objective is to drive growth, and we will adjust if we needed to on the margin side."" We expect further top-line upside vs. consensus estimates up until 2020, and this revenue-based growth strategy will complement well with the digital strategies as mentioned in previous paragraphs.Given the ongoing market sentiment of pricing revenue growth ahead of profitability growth, we expect that this strategy should play quite well into investors. However, looking into the Company's recent filings, there has been a sustained decline in the Company's revenue generation from its top banking clients (top 5 banking clients' share has dropped ~12% YoY), which might be a key headwind towards the expected double-digit revenue CAGR (see consensus estimates below).1. Consensus Revenue Estimates2. Consensus EPS (GAAP) EstimatesSource: CapIQAs detailed in the previous section, we strongly believe that the growth-based strategy being adopted by the Company should play well into investors' sentiment and unless there happens to be a market-wide preference shift away from top line growth, we do not see significant market-wide systemic risk in the next 12 months.Comparing to its peers, the Company did not perform as well over the past year, but we do see a very modest valuation based on various multiples, with its forward PEG ratio being particularly attractive to us. Therefore, combining with our anticipated growth, we expect a good bounce-back opportunity for the Company's share price to the minimum of its previous high of $85.CTSH data by YChartsCTSH PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsCTSH EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YChartsCTSH PEG Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsTherefore, our 12-month price target for CTSH is $81 with a POSITIVE outlook, based on the forward P/E ratio of 15.6x and our FY2019e EPS of $5.20. Our EPS estimates follow the path that the Company will be able to achieve strong growth outside of the Financial Services segment, a well-executed digital strategy which further accelerates growth and the management guidance that margins will slowly improve over time.We do not identify material industry-wide downside risks, but we do view the inability to properly execute the digital growth strategy and poorly screened acquisitions to be the main downside risks to our price target."

The company has a solid history of generating outstanding earnings growth, and the future growth ratios point to continued growth over the next twelve months. I lay out my bullish argument for the company below by reviewing some pertinent fundamental and technical aspects of the stock.My MGQ plays a critical part when it comes to determining if I am going to go long or short a stock. Generally, I only want to go long a stock with an MGQ higher than that of the S&P 100, and I want to go short a stock with an MGQ lower than that of the index (for a more detailed explanation of how I calculate the MGQ please see my BlogPost).As of the end of August 2018, the MGQ for the S&P 100 was 9.84.The current MGQ for CTSH stands at 12.20, which implies a 23.97% higher growth rate compared to the S&P 100. This tells us that CTSH has strong future growth potential and is a good candidate for a long position.Let's dig a little deeper into the financial data to get a better feel for how the company has performed on certain fundamental metrics and what these numbers imply for future growth.The PastDuring the past 12 months, the average EBITDA per Share Growth Rate of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp was 13.30% per year. During the past 3 years, the average EBITDA per Share Growth Rate was 14.60% per year. During the past 5 years, the average EBITDA per Share Growth Rate was 15.40% per year. During the past 10 years, the average EBITDA per Share Growth Rate was 21.90% per year (GuruFocus). Earnings growth has been consistent and strong over the last ten years.The operating margin % for CTSH came in at 16.72% as of June 2018. Each dollar of revenue the company generated brought in 16.72 cents of earnings. The company's operating margin showed relative strength against its competitors coming in higher than the average of 12.39% for its industry (specific group of companies engaged in similar business activities) (Reuters).The FutureKnowing how a company has performed in the past is important in order to evaluate management's past record in running the business. But more important to us is how profitable the company will be in the future because we are investing going forward, not backwards. And it's the forward-looking metrics that should really get you excited about CTSH.I like to use two measuring sticks to gauge the future growth potential for companies: forward P/E and forward rate of return.I prefer to use the forward P/E ratio (current stock's price over its ""expected"" earnings per share) rather than historical P/E to gauge a company's expected future earnings power. A high forward P/E ratio means that investors are anticipating higher growth in the future and are willing to pay more for future earnings - momentum investing is all about following the trend (perceived or real).CTSH has a forward P/E of 14.90 compared to a 18.51 forward P/E for the S&P 100. The Forward P/E for CTSH is lower than that of the index, indicating that investor growth prospects for the stock are lower than that of the broader market, but I view a Forward P/E above 10.00 as acceptable for a long position.The forward rate of return for a stock (created by Donald Yacktman) is one of my favorite quotients for gauging the market's expectation for future growth for a company. Yacktman defines forward rate of return as the normalized free cash flow yield plus real growth plus inflation. In simple terms, the forward rate of return can be thought of as the return that investors buying the stock today can expect from it in the future.The forward rate of return for CTSH stands at 17.41%. This implies that an investor buying the stock today should expect a 17.41% return over the next 12 months. The average forward rate of return for the S&P 100 as of the end of August was at 8.84%, so CTSH has an implied potential rate of return that is 2.64x greater than that of the index.The risk inherent in the forward rate of return is that the calculation is reliable only if the company can grow at the same rate in the future as it did in the past. If the growth rate falters, the projected returns will not materialize. But we are willing to accept this risk as part of the difficult process of forecasting earnings and growth momentum.As per my ChartMasterPro Daily Trade Model, the momentum trend for CTSH would turn bullish with a daily close above $78.50. This would signal a bullish break out of an ascending triangle pattern on the daily charts. From here, I see the shares climbing to the $83.00 level over the next three months.Today (article publication date) I will buy the CTSH 19OCT18 75 Call Options, which will provide approximately 19x leverage on my long trade. My stop-loss exit signal for the trade will be a daily close below $75.00. When trading options with leverage, a stop-loss is absolutely imperative in order to avoid oversized losses and wipe-outs. My target return for the trade is 133% (7% share appreciation x 19x leverage on the call options).For investors in the shares, I recommend that you hold for 3 months or $83.00, whichever comes first. For longer-term investors, I believe CTSH is a solid addition to any growth portfolio over the next 12 months.I like to invest in companies that have a proven record of better execution against the competition, especially in regards to sales growth and profitability ratios. I want to invest in companies that are run efficiently and that are more profitable than their competitors.Profitability RatiosSource: ReutersCognizant Technology is a company that is posting much higher sales growth than its peers with a management team that is very good at turning revenue into profits. The recent price drop in the shares presents a great opportunity to initiate a position in CTSH.For Q2 2018 the company reported a 9.2% YOY increase in revenue, and an impressive 20% growth in digital revenue. The company posted YOY revenue growth across all of its segments and geographies for the quarter: Source: Seekingalpha.comIn the earnings call, CEO Francisco D'Souza highlighted one of the company's competitive advantages: its AI solution.Being able to help its customers across its business segments identify and solve problems via the use of artificial intelligence data mining will allow the company to broaden client revenue and grow market share, as evidenced by the strong growth of its digital business in the quarter. When I go long a stock, I want to invest in a company that provides superior future growth potential, but I also want to time the entry into any position to try to maximize my return.So I use fundamental analysis to identify shares with a strong future growth rate, and then I apply technical analysis to identify ideal entry points.In my opinion, CTSH is an attractive buy at these levels from both a fundamental and technical perspective."

This resulted in its most important sector, financial services, growing 3% compared to 7% estimated by analysts.Although Cognizant still maintains its historical growth, it seems that the services of cloud computing and analytics are decreasing their profit margins as customers demand more work for less money.These difficulties seem to be transitory, and we believe that the recent price drop is somewhat exaggerated. Cognizant's exposure to fast-growing segments such as financial and health, which have boosted revenues in recent years, will most likely continue to provide long-term benefits to the company.We believe that Cognizant has several competitive advantages that position it as a leader in its sector. Although recent political changes have shaken results in recent quarters.One of the factors that has driven revenue growth in the last five years is the ability of executives to identify accretive acquisition.The company is constantly looking for new opportunities to benefit from the ongoing digital transition, especially when it comes to integrating the new digital framework as a replacement for legacy technology platforms.The acquisitions that have catalyzed Cognizant's growth in recent years have been:Cognizant has not only gained new customers thanks to these acquisitions, but has also expanded its digital delivery capabilities.While we expect revenue growth to moderate from the dizzying days of five or 10 years ago, we believe that the company can easily outperform the global IT services industry, for which analysts project 4% to 5% of CAGR.In recent years, Cognizant has outperformed its main competitors because it has greater exposure to fast-growing sectors, such as financial services and healthcare.The company has acquired a deep experience and mastery of these industries through partnerships with its main clients. This strategy has allowed Cognizant to offer more value to their clients and take advantage of new opportunities.In addition, the new list of national and international regulations, particularly in financial services and health industries, is driving the demand for IT services in these sectors. Cognizant has a dominant position in both industries, reflected in the growth of its historical income, and that will surely continue to drive it in the coming quarters.Source: Data extracted from filing from the SECIt is expected that Cognizant will continue to benefit from the strong demand for its technological services that are of high quality and low cost. Based on its global delivery model and capacity for expansion in low-cost areas such as India, China, the Philippines, and Latin America, it seems that the company remains well positioned in the outsourcing market.We believe that the growing demand for IT services from Cognizant will gain even more relevance in the long term, especially in markets such as Europe and Asia, where a positive growth trend has been seen in recent quarters.Source: Data extracted from filing from the SECThe attitude of Cognizant where the customer is first has been the main reason for its success. A differentiated balance between the traditional operating model focused on consulting and the industrial outsourcing model that is based on lower cost delivery allows the company to appear as an American or Indian firm as circumstances dictate.The company's commitment to customer satisfaction through its two-in-a-box operating model has led to the formation of long-lasting relationships and in-depth knowledge of the business processes of its customers.It is estimated that the strategic retention rate of Cognizant clients is between 95% and 98%.Compared to its competitors, Cognizant sacrifices a certain margin of profit to carry out important reinvestments in its customer-oriented competitions. This reinvestment is seen as a critical factor in building better relationships with customers. For that purpose, Cognizant has been recognized as a market leader in studies of customer satisfaction by third parties.We believe that Cognizant's commitment to its clients to create a deep understanding of their critical business systems has led them to be reluctant to change service providers.The number one risk for Cognizant is the highly-competitive market in which it operates. To maintain this position with its customers, the company must continue to develop innovative solutions that keep it one step ahead of its competitors.This competitive environment is transferred to the work environment, where the company makes great efforts to attract and retain suitable IT professionals.Employees are the main resource for a company like Cognizant; therefore, there is an important competition to attract highly-qualified and efficient personnel. The company is under constant pressure to increase salaries to control the retention rate of its workforce, which despite its efforts, remains higher than preferred.Another concern for the company is related to the nature of its business, which needs to bring employees to the United States from abroad.With continued pressure to the employment of foreign citizens, the US government under President Donald Trump is promoting a reduction in the number of H1-B visas granted each year. This immigration reform remains a concern to date, although the exact terms of this reform and its impacts on the company's finances are not yet reflected.An additional risk for Cognizant is in the concentration of its revenue in a geographical area. With approximately 77% of the total revenues generated in North America, Cognizant is well-exposed to the economic wellbeing of the region. The company also faces volatility in its revenues due to currency movements, such as the Indian rupee against the US dollar, among others.Source: Data extracted from filing from the SECWe believe that Cognizant will continue to actively seek more acquisitions that add value to its product portfolio.The company aims to reach a 22% operating margin by the end of this year, which we see as achievable despite the risks associated with immigration reform and the likelihood of the US dollar strengthening against currencies in emerging countries. In terms of growth, Cognizant seems well positioned to sustain a growth rate close to 10% in the medium and long term, despite recent difficulties in its financial services segment.In terms of price and valuations, we see that the appreciation of shares during the year 2017 have not raised Cognizant's main ratios that much. And despite a couple of quarterly results that have fallen below expectations, levels are now close to the 3 year average. Despite this, we do not find any catalyst in the short and medium term that can significantly lift the price, so we expect the shares to remain in the range of $75 to $80 by the end of 2018.CTSH EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YCharts"

(CTSH) stock has maintained its positive streak in the new year as well. The company started off the current year with positive H1B visa developments. Its efforts to diversify the business base are also expected to show results in the upcoming quarters. These long-term factors are complemented by its short-term catalyst of upcoming quarterly and full year results. While the stock is trading close to its all-time high, it has the potential to provide strong positive returns in the medium to long term.Cognizant is scheduled to announce its fourth quarter earnings in February, which is going to be the main catalyst for the company stock in the coming days. The company is expected to perform in line with its third quarter when it reported better-than-expected quarterly numbers. In the third quarter, the company reported encouraging 9.1 percent year-on-year increase in its revenue to $3.77 billion, while its non-GAAP diluted EPS registered 14 percent growth for the same time period to touch $0.98. The trend is likely to continue as the company provided an upbeat outlook for the full financial year.For the fourth quarter, the company expects its revenue to be in the range of $3.79 billion and $3.85 billion. At the lower end of the estimate, the revenue will show 9.5 percent year-over-year growth, while at the higher end of the spectrum, the revenue growth rate will touch 11.2 percent over Q4 2016 revenue of $3.46 billion. Similarly, it expected its non-GAAP diluted EPS to cross $0.95, thus showing at least 9 percent year-over-year growth. Overall, Cognizant is expected to keep up the trend of revenue and EPS growth in the fourth quarter as well.The upcoming earnings report is also important as the company will announce its full year results as well. The revenue for the full financial year is pegged to be in the range of $14.78 billion and $14.84 billion, again showing year-over-year increase to be between 9.5 percent and 10 percent. The full-year non-GAAP diluted EPS is estimated to be $3.70 or more, showing 9 percent increase over previous year's diluted EPS of $3.39. Despite regulatory issues and the murky political environment surrounding the company, Cognizant managed to register growth in its operational results as well as in its stock price.While Cognizant will probably announce positive results next month, the company is also in strong position from a long-term perspective. The company has been dealing with unpredictable political and regulatory scenarios in the recent past as the Trump administration decided to clamp down on outsourcing businesses. Despite all these negative circumstances, the company bolstered its position, which underlines its strong fundamentals. The stock is likely to perform well in the future as Cognizant reaps the benefits of its long-term strategy.Cognizant has taken a number of steps to diversify its business and reduce its reliance on outsourcing revenue. In the coming months, the company is expected to make some important announcement regarding its foray into blockchain and cryptocurrency segments. It is also expected to show results of its recent acquisitions as the company goes ahead with the integration process. In the past year, Cognizant acquired a number of companies with diversified interests. Some of the most notable acquisitions included Netcentric, TMG Health, and Brilliant Services. Netcentric is involved in digital marketing while TMG Health acquisition provides exposure to the healthcare management sector. The common theme of these acquisitions is digital solutions consulting opportunities, which is now the core focus area for the company. With Brilliant Services, Cognizant will be boosting its position in IoT segment.Cognizant stock showed consistent growth last year, despite working in an uncertain environment. The stock grew over 30 percent and is currently trading close to its 52-weeks high. The company operations showed resilience, and the results were apparent through its quarterly earnings announcements and its stock performance. In the meantime, the company also took steps to diversify its businesses.Despite the company stock trading close to its 52-weeks high, it still has good potential ahead. Its most immediate catalyst is in the form of upcoming quarterly and full-year earnings announcement due next month. The company is set to report positive results, and the impact will likely be positive on the stock price as well. In the mid-term, the company and its stock price will benefit from more transparent regulatory environment as the Trump administration makes its policies clear. The company is also expected to move ahead with the integration of its acquired businesses and show the impact on its bottom line, making its stock a good bet for a medium to long-term investment portfolio."

It estimates that 22% of IT spend with the ten largest consulting firms has gone to strategy-focused firms, with 21% to the Big Four and 16% to technology firms.Moreover, 70% of all organizations ‘say their focus in the future will be using digital technology to change their underlying business model.’While Netcentric has significant competition with the Big Four and numerous other digital marketing consultancies large and small, its focus on the Adobe Experience Cloud has enabled it to land major clients such as Mercedes-Benz (OTCPK:DDAIF), Allianz (AZSEY) and UBS (UBS)Acquisition Terms and RationaleNeither firm disclosed the acquisition price or terms and Cognizant didn’t file an 8-K or disclose a change in financial guidance, so the deal was likely for a non-material amount.Just following its deal with Netcentric, Cognizant agreed to acquire UK-based digital marketing agency Zone for an undisclosed amount, as I wrote about in my article, Cognizant Agrees To Acquire Zone Digital Agency.So, Cognizant is making some bold moves to build out its digital marketing consulting capabilities in Europe.As Cognizant stated in the deal announcement,Cognizant will be incorporating Netcentric’s 380 professionals into its operations, so the deal will be a sizeable addition to its European footprint. This is in conjunction with the Zone deal which will add another 220 professionals.Cognizant is among the few larger IT consulting to be making these moves into digital marketing.

4207417,104586,2018-09-20T14:07:49-04:00,"Cognizant used to be lenient with its margin profile until Elliot Management bought a $1.4 billion position in the stock.Mr Paul Singer’s reputation is likely to have helped convince the management of the merits of margin expansion.The stock price shot up by over 50% and before anyone knew Elliot had exited the stock.Post Elliot, the pent-up investment demand of the last few quarters could lead to short terms excesses.Thus, it would be important for Cognizant to stay the course on the margin front (albeit with less punishing rigor) to create overall value for the shareholders.","Elliot's November 2016 letter to Cognizant (CTSH) pulled the proverbial rug under the management's feet. Elliot wanted one of the world's largest IT services companies (F2018E revenue of $16.2 billion) to become more profitable, dumping CTSH's age-old policy of maintaining margins below 20%. The activist hedge fund's reputation preceded it and the CTSH management ceded. Elliot made money and left. CTSH is now at a point from where it can deliver 20%+ returns to shareholders, without compromising on its core philosophy.CTSH's defining feature was its long-standing philosophy of keeping operating margins low to invest in business growth. The company would invest anything in excess of 20% non-GAAP operating margin towards business growth. This was in stark contrast to the labor cost arbitrage-driven, margin crazed IT services industry.Elliot is a well know hedge fund, also referred to as a vulture fund by some. Elliot bought a 4% ($1.4 billion) stake in CTSH making it one of the largest shareholders of the company. The hedge fund then followed up in its signature style.Elliot shot off a letter to the CTSH management. The letter cited management's focus on keeping margins at sub-20% and lack of a dividend policy as key deterrents to shareholder return. The letter further laid out an aggressive roadmap to improve margins from the sub-20% levels to 23-24% over the next 3 years. Elliot's argument throughout the letter was that since CTSH was no more a growth company, the management must have margins and returns aligned with those of CTSH's peers.Whether it was the logic in the argument to remove the lid on margins or the fear of Elliot's ability to win at any cost, the CTSH management readily complied with the activist investor's whims.Source: 4Q16 Earnings CallSource: 4Q16 Earnings PresentationThe CTSH management signed a cooperation agreement with Elliot. This was followed by an 8-K filing, which was virtually a copy of Elliot's letter.

However, a habit cultivated over decades cannot be undone in three years. CTSH's realignment program led to job cuts, a slowdown in the pace of hiring and increase in attrition.

4070364,41741,2017-05-07T16:21:30-04:00,"CTSH is an activist investor target.The suggested fair value could lead to 25% upside.But it’s still cheap, but for an overrated reason.","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:CTSH) is a successful international outsourcing company headquartered in New Jersey. It is managed by 48 year old co-founder Francisco D'Souza, who has guided it through a period of explosive revenue growth - sometimes as much as 30% a year, quadrupling the company's top-line in less than a decade.While that level of growth is clearly unsustainable after a certain amount of time, a still-impressive 8-10% a year growth rate is not out of the question. The demand for Cognizant's IT and business outsourcing is insatiable - there are simply not enough software engineers and other personnel with relevant skills being trained in the U.S. and other developed countries.With that, Cognizant has consistently posted gross profit increases in recent years, generating $4.2 billion in 2014, $5 billion in 2015 and then $5.5 billion in 2016. Cognizant is keeping up with demand nicely, being able to hire employees as needed, which also helps keep expenditures lower (using a hire-as-needed model). The company has grown to the point where it has over a quarter of a million full-time employees.Unfortunately, this is where a potential problem lies.Recent DevelopmentsSince Cognizant is an outsourcing company, employees are at the very heart of its existence. However, as previously mentioned, the company is based in the U.S. - which continues to lack workers with advanced technology skills. Therefore, much like what Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and every other tech company does, Cognizant brings workers from other countries who have the necessary skills.These employees are able to work for employers in the U.S. under H-1B visas for up to six years. Unfortunately, there is currently a great deal of upheaval in the country due to President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration. Many workers who have been working under these visas, but happened to be out of the country at any time of Trump's recent policy changes, have been denied re-entry.Yet, most companies affected by the new policies seem to be remaining optimistic. While there is no question that these events have caused some disruption, it should be relatively minor. Apparently, a vast majority of the employees working under these visas are from countries considered to be non-threatening. So, despite the media headlines and market jargon, there is a slim chance that Cognizant's operations could be impacted, widespread disruption should not be expected.A New PerspectiveProbably the most important factor driving Cognizant in the short-term is the 4% stake that activist hedge fund Elliot Management has taken in the tech company. With that big of a stake, the fund wants to provide input into how things are run.In this particular case, Cognizant leadership doesn't seem to have any problem with that. That may have something to do with the fact that Elliot's main representative, Jesse Cohn, says he believes the share price could jump to $80 within the next couple of years - potentially 25% upside from where Cognizant currently trades.Elliot Management came in with many plans, some of which have already been implemented.No. 1 - Stock buyback - Cognizant will be using $1 billion of its cash on hand, plus another $1.5 billion in new debt financing, to buy back $2.5 billion of its own stock by the middle of this year - which is over 7% of its current market cap. It has already initiated a buyback of $1.4 billion.No. 2 - Profit margins - Elliot wants Cognizant to start focusing more on profit margins instead of gross revenue increases. The company's pretax profit margin was 18% when Elliot bought its stake, but the fund believes that Cognizant can up that to 23% with only minor organizational changes.No. 3 - Board changes - Three of the 13 board members were hired just last month. A refreshed board is expected to breathe new life into the company.Elliott Management has a very impressive history of success with the companies in which it buys substantial stakes. And Jesse Cohn manages the technology investments for the fund, so he has a great deal of experience in the sector.The fact that Elliot bought such a big stake in Cognizant - and is advocating for such major changes - is a very clear indication not only that they believe the company to be undervalued, but that they can significantly raise the share price with specific tweaks to operations. Considering the success that Cognizant has already achieved, Elliott has great potential to work with.All things considered, Cognizant's share price - with help from Elliot - looks poised to take off into heights greater than it has ever seen in the past. Plus, with Cognizant trading at 15 times next year's earnings, it's a relatively cheap stock. You won't find a better value in the business services and outsourcing space. CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) comes close but Cognizant's relative stock price underperformance, margin expansion potential and superior balance (i.e. ultra low debt and 13% of its market cap covered by cash on the balance sheet) make it the better bet. And even if it takes two years from now to get to the $80 fair value Elliott put on the stock, that's still a solid 11.8% annualized return - not bad considering the S&P 500 has returned an annualized 5% over the last decade."

Ltd. of Japan for an undisclosed amount.Brilliant will add mobility and Internet of Things [IoT] skills to Cognizant's digital solutions consulting group.The acquisition is part of a larger and consistent strategy to add both capabilities and geographic reach through smaller, tuck-in deals.I view the deal as primarily a team acquisition, and should be a net long-term positive for CTSH as it integrates the team and continues the build out of its mobility and IoT practice for a growing market.Target CompanyOsaka-based Brilliant Service was founded in 2004 to provide iOS and Android platform applications primarily to Japanese enterprises.It has capabilities in creating digital solutions for smartphones, wearable terminals and embedded devicesThe company has a customer segment focus on telecommunications, consumer goods and manufacturing & industrial companies.Brilliant was headed by CEO Yoshihiko Sugimoto and a total of '70 professionals with extensive digital solutions experience and insights in the Japanese market' will move to Cognizant with the transaction.Acquisition Terms, Rationale and CommentaryCognizant has acquired Brilliant to bolster its commitment to the Japanese market and expand its footprint across Osaka and Tokyo.Since Brilliant doesn't appear to own any significant IP and its revenues are likely non-material to Cognizant's annual revenues of $13.5 billion, I presume the deal valuation was primarily based on acquiring the 70-person team.By adding Brilliant's skills in 'planning, implementing and managing smart and connected device solutions, together with their strong understanding of the regulatory requirements for the Japanese market', Cognizant hopes to improve its penetration into that market.'Connect device solutions' is an important and expansive phrase, which for Cognizant means 'Internet of Things', or IoT.As 5G wireless begins to ramp up and the IoT applications continue their growth as well, Cognizant is essentially acquiring a beachhead in the important Japanese market, which could be considered an 'early adopter' market due to the high penetration of electronic devices in the country.Also, the acquisition will help Cognizant with its enterprise mobility initiatives, since Brilliant has expertise in the area of 'user experience design and online-to-offline services.'For Cognizant, the Brilliant deal represents a continuation of an apparent digital acquisition strategy.The company has acquired a number of companies as part of its 'Digital Works' program, a consulting-centric offering within its digital portfolio.As Cognizant CEO Francisco D'Souza said in a 2016 conference call, ""We look at traditionally smaller tuck-in acquisitions. That's been the primary focus. We will continue to do that. We would be more focused on digital and making digital acquisitions as we look to the next few quarters to bolster our digital capability.""So, the Brilliant Service deal is squarely within the scope of management's previously-announced intention to tuck-in smaller acquisitions that improve its offerings and expand its footprint.I write about IPOs, follow-ons, secondaries, and M&A.

4044899,98236,2017-02-10T12:31:00-05:00,"Cognizant reported the results of its fiscal Q4 and 2016 year.Results were more or less in line with revenues, about 1% below consensus and EPS at consensus levels.Guidance showed somewhat stronger revenue growth but no acceleration in EPS growth.The shares responded strongly to a plan for accelerated share repurchase, the institution of a modest dividend, and a strategy to increase operating margins.Even in the wake of the company's share price improvement, shares seem to me to be significantly below valuations that might reflect the company's return to growth status.","Cognizant and Middle Age - Will they go well togetherOn Wednesday morning, Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) announced the results of its fiscal Q4 and 2016 year. It also announced that it had reached a cooperation agreement with Elliott management that included the company's first-ever dividend payment, an expanded share buyback program and higher target margins. In addition, the board is to appoint three independent directors and Elliott has agreed to customary standstill provisions. The results of the quarter weren't terribly surprising and honestly the results of the agreement with Elliott shouldn't have been too surprising either.I wrote about Cognizant a bit less than a month ago and wouldn't usually choose to comment on it again in such a short time. But the combination of the company's agreement with Elliott and concomitant capital return program and the release of quarterly earnings and some new guidance induced me to try to update my positive thesis on the shares.In addition to the headlines regarding Cognizant's earnings and the Elliott standstill agreement, the apparent termination of two major mergers in the health insurance space, that of Anthem's (NYSE:ANTM) proposed transaction with Cigna (NYSE:CI) and the termination of Aetna's (NYSE:AET) agreement to buy Humana (NYSE:HUM), also are likely to impact the outlook for Cognizant.The healthcare vertical, 30% of Cognizant's revenues, has seen very slow growth last year. Much of the growth slowdown has been attributed by CTSH to the uncertainties amongst its customers as to what their IT needs might be in the wake of the previously proposed mergers.The standstill agreement with Elliot really does not imply huge changes for Cognizant's business. The 1% dividend is probably just a start and really is not a huge cash drain for a company like this. The overall share repurchase plan is a bit more aggressive in terms of cadence than prior plans. Still, a share buyback that is $3.4 billion in aggregate over the next two years can readily be funded by the company's operating cash flow.The program, at current share prices, would reduce outstanding shares by around 10%. The dividend payment of $365 million is an extremely modest payout ratio of less than 20%. Shareholders are not likely to get rich out of the new capital return program.Elliot when it announced its stake in Cognizant opined that the shares would be worth $80-$90 if certain proposed steps were taken. The steps have now been taken, at least from a qualitative perspective, and they are steps in the right direction. I have certainly been writing positive articles on Cognizant for some little while, but I don't think that the plans announced on Wednesday will, in and of themselves, achieve that objective.Financial engineering is a popular topic on Wall Street. But the fact is, that for CTSH shares to work over the next couple of years, the company is going to have to take steps to both strengthen its growth rate and to improve operating margins. Capital allocation by itself is not enough to support a continued improvement in valuations. I think the company has many opportunities to improve its operational performance and hence, I think that the shares are worth holdingCognizant does not have any special sauce when it comes to financial engineering. It has small capex requirements and its CFFO tracks closely with reported non-GAAP earnings over the course of a year. Cognizant articulated that part of its transformation strategy would include a series of smaller, so-called tuck-in acquisitions. Last year, the company made 10 acquisitions and it suggested that it would accelerate that tempo. These acquisitions were all small with most of the acquired business having a few hundred employees at most but overall provided Cognizant with significant domain expertise and some level of revenue increment.Some recent acquisitions include a company that specializes in IoT consulting, another in the energy consulting space and another in what is described as customer experience and design consulting. None of these acquisitions and the others the company has undertaken are household names but they are part of a strategy to expand the company's suite of capabilities into different components of consulting.While it is impossible to forecast how much acquisitions could add to growth, it seems likely that one avenue to improve the reported percentage revenue growth rate for Cognizant will be through acquisitions that could easily add 200-300 bps to growth and be funded out of the company's cash flow. Driving revenue growth higher will have as much impact on share valuation as any other strategy the company might pursue in my opinion.In addition to the capital return plan that was announced, management spoke about its intentions to embark on some specific cost actions that could bring operating margins to 22% up from the 19.5% forecast for this year, by 2019. At the end of the day, 22% operating margins are really nothing special for the second-largest company in this space. The company basically said that it would be willing to sacrifice some revenues in exchange for pricing discipline. And it talked about leveraging its scale, partially by segmenting its opportunities by size and by practice type. That too is not a particularly difficult undertaking.The company also talked about overcoming headwinds that it faces with regard to moving steadily to a more global delivery paradigm and dealing with pricing pressures in some business segments where there has been a trend toward commoditization. It is fortunate for the company that it can simply exit certain markets and utilize available technologies to overcome these kinds of headwinds.So long as Cognizant is growing at reasonable rates, it is relatively easy to make a trade-off between growing headcount at a slower cadence in some less profitable practices, improving the efficiency of selling, general and administrative expenses and paying for the offsets of a changing service delivery model and some level of pricing pressures. I think that this part of Cognizant's plan will probably be over-attained and the impacts are going to be more front-ended than have been forecast by the companyCognizant also reiterated its emphasis on what it describes as digital solutions and some of that emphasis appears to have resonated with conference call listeners. I will take a bit of space in the next section to try to define what digital transformations are all about for this company and its customers. Digital transformation revenues were 23% of total revenues and are said to be growing at faster rates than revenues as a whole. How much faster and what the outlook for these revenues might be was left unsaid.Cognizant shares were up almost 5% on Wednesday and another 3% today making up much of the ground they have lost in the past 10 days as concerns heighten with regard to the future of the H1-b visa program during the Trump tenure. Of all of the issues concerning investors, the visa program really should rank at the bottom of the concern list. Cognizant has made effective use of the H1-b visa program and is one of if not the top recipient of such visas. The company is supposedly 99.7% compliant in its use of the program and a lawsuit regarding its treatment of Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) programmers has recently been dismissed.Over the past several years, Cognizant has expanded its service delivery capabilities in the US significantly. The trend started as long ago as 2011 and continues unabated and there are now almost 25 service delivery locations in the US mainly staffed by Americans.The environment for delivering services, outside geopolitical factors, has changed such that a global delivery strategy is both feasible and desirable and with the amazing drop in communication costs and improving technology, collaboration between off-shore and on-shore consultants is far more feasible and economical than has heretofore been the case.I will close this segment by linking to an old article regarding the threat of H1-b visas to the business of CTSH. So far, there has been loads of smoke and no fire. I suggest that when the dust settles, the result will be the same this time around although at the end of the day, the percentage of CTSH employees located in North America will be significantly higher than was the case five years ago.Another very boring quarter, some possibilities for the rest of 2017There is the old adage of being careful of what you wish for. As a shareholder, I would love to see Cognizant start to show the kind of revenue growth that was its historic norm. The slide deck that the company released in conjunction with its earnings shows a picture of 10-year results with a 25% CAGR. Those days seem like distant memories and the transformation of the company has a long way to go before it can consistently achieve double-digit growth. Given the distance between where Cognizant currently is and where it needs to be, boring is fine for now. Excitement can come later.Overall, Cognizant revenues were up 7% for the quarter and by 8.6% for the year. Non-GAAP operating margins at 18.7%, down from 19.5% in Q4 of 2015. EPS was in line with guidance and revenues slightly less than prior expectations due to FX headwinds and continued weakness in the Financial Services vertical. The company spent $20 million on the bribery investigation, which encompassed a possible set of illegal payments that aggregated $6 million. Interesting that stockholders are thought to benefit by that trade.The company's guidance for the full year at the mid-point implies revenues of $14.7 billion, which is growth of about 9%. It is a step in the right direction, especially considering the headwinds from FX embodied in the guidance. The guidance is consistent with the published First Call consensus of 33 analysts.Within the guidance, Q1 revenues are expected to be $3.53 billion at the midpoint. That would bring revenue growth of close to 10% and is slightly greater than the current analyst consensus. The company is forecasting slightly compressed non-GAAP operating margins of 18.7% in Q1 rising to 19.5% for the full year as part of its cost remediation program. Based on the way CFO Karen McLoughlin laid out the cadence of the improvement, 2018 EPS would seem likely to reach $4.30-$4.40, considerably above the current consensus for that period.Cognizant is a company which historically has been very concentrated in a few verticals and that has been an impediment in terms of its transition, at least during 2016. It has been dealing with a financial services vertical that itself has suffered both because of low interest rates spreads and because of uncertainties with regard to regulatory issues. Financial services represent 39% of revenues and it grew but 3.5% last quarter. That is not a function of competitive losses, but is mainly a product of far tighter expense management in some verticals within the segment.Healthcare, another 29% of revenue, grew by 5.6% year over year in Q4. Its issues have been some significant hesitation from some large clients who had planned major mergers coupled with continued uncertainties regarding which initiatives would be important in the world of the Affordable Care Act.I think it is fair to suggest that conditions within both spaces have shown some early signs of recovery and are likely to help animate the company's slightly higher growth expectations for 2017. The CFO said that the company had seen a significantly stronger January relative to expectations than had been the case in 2016. In addition, Ms. McLoughlin commented that some of the healthcare deals being sold by Trizetto had an annuity component that has started to dampen the A4/Q1 progression and this is improving Q1 comparisons.The company as mentioned earlier has made some tiny acquisitions that in aggregate have the capacity to add 100-plus basis points to revenue growth in Q1 as well as providing the company with domain expertise in some attractive market niches.The Siren Song of Digital TransformationsCognizant has actually been talking about its strategy to build digital transformation practices for some years now. At 23% of revenues, the results of that strategy have become a real key to the future success of Cognizant as an investment, and will, I believe, dwarf a 1% dividend yield as important for investors to consider.For many years now, the Indian outsourcing space has been something of a quiet backwater in terms of what the competitors actually did for their money. The projects undertaken included a mix of implementing third-party software such as SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Business Process Outsourcing and the creation of custom applications for users. In some cases, competitors got to maintain legacy software created by clients and that, even today, remains an exceptionally lucrative business and is one of the reasons why a company such as Infosys (NASDAQ:INFY) has higher margins that CTSH.The business of implementation is being challenged by the growth of the cloud and the turn toward the cloud also has had an impact on growth in the BPO sector. Overall, it is probably the advent of the cloud that has cost CTSH 10-15 points of growth in the last few years and it is growth that isn't coming back.So far as an investor is concerned, digital is simply a different kind of consulting which is serving to augment growth and to replace opportunities that no longer exist. Digital transformation can be something such as building the software components to create an IoT network. It could include an assignment to create specific applications that make use of the torrent of data enterprises now collect about their customers and employees.Specific projects in which Cognizant has done the consulting work include a project to enhance a direct marketing strategy, a project to analyze big data in order to improve outcomes and improve nurse productivity and a project that helped a large beverage vendor improve interactions with customers. The use of the phrases ""deep insights"" and ""deep learning"" are usually associated with digital projects - basically many organizations need help in creating useable AI solutions.A digital project usually includes connections with existing legacy systems and it is usually designed to be used efficiently and with consideration of automating the process of maintaining and operating the new systems.Cognizant offers a variety of tools that are said to speed up the process of building new digital apps. How they work and how users evaluate the apps that have been created is not totally apparent at this point. In some ways, so far as I am concerned, digital simply means that Cognizant is focused on selling its capabilities outside the traditional projects it has undertaken to users who need help in implementing the latest trends that are available through IT. And as an investor, I think that is all you need to know.As mentioned earlier, Cognizant indicated during its earnings call that 23% of its revenues were coming from project classifications that it defines as digital. And it also indicated that digital was growing faster than the rest of its business. That is about all we know. The CEO, Francisco d'Souza, said that from time to time, the company would report on the proportion of revenues coming from digital sources. Given the lack of knowledge or guidance we have, it is hard for me to make intelligent, supportable comments.About all I can say at the moment is that from a qualitative perspective, the strategy being followed by Cognizant makes sense and ought to be successful. What I can't do with the information at hand is to try to construct a real model that looks at the various revenue streams and creates a growth rate. My guess is that over the next year or two, the company will resume double-digit growth and that it has a chance to do so this year depending on the cadence of its smaller acquisitions. But let's take a look at valuation in the context of the numbers that Cognizant forecast and see if the shares are a value on that basis.ValuationI have to start using some backward-looking metrics for shares and for cash. Cognizant shares are trading at around $58/share. The company had 609 million shares at the end of the year. Net cash on the balance sheet was $4.2 billion. So, that produces an enterprise value of $31.1 billion. The company has forecast that revenues this year will be $14.7 billion at the midpoint of its guidance. So, that is an EV/S of 2.1X, surely a reasonable metric for the company.The company is forecasting EPS for the full year, net of accelerated share repurchases of $3.53 compared to EPS of $3.39 just reported. Given the forecast provided by the CFO of the company, that average shares are going to decline by 2% and that revenues are going to grow by 8%-plus, I would find that result surprising but I will use it anyway. The P/E based on forward guidance is 16/4X, another very reasonable valuation metric.As mentioned earlier, free cash flow for this company is very close to non-GAAP net income. Free cash flow, which the company reports in arrears, is probably running at a rate of about $2.2 billion. That is creating a free cash flow yield of 7%; again, a very reasonable level for that metric.I think investors are getting a good deal on the shares using the current guidance. If the company can achieve even some return to past growth rates, the valuation moves from reasonable to remarkable. Cognizant shares in the wake of the recent spike are now up by a bit more than 7% from year earlier levels. The IGV index is up 41%. That alone might suggest that there is quite a lot of potential positive alpha lurking here and I think that is the case. (It also might suggest that the valuation of the IGV is likely to be a bit stretched but that is a different discussion.)The average price target for Cognizant shares from 32 analysts who report their expectations to First Call is less than $64. To me that suggests that a couple of quarters where revenue growth starts to show an improving cadence have the potential to cause a massive re-rating of this name. Plenty of positive alpha potential here."
4037970,98236,2017-01-19T12:29:52-05:00,"Cognizant will report results of its Q4 and 2016 year in a couple of weeks.While the company has had to deal with its share of headwinds over the past year, I think skies are beginning to brighten with regard to its outlook.I think CTSH has very easy compares to deal with going forward because of the muted results it experienced in its key financial services and healthcare verticals.The company's opportunity to sell its digital transformation expertise is little understood or appreciated.Cognizant's response to Elliott's position in the shares and its request for a more friendly allocation policy is likely to be discussed and to offer something positive for shareholders.","Cognizant - When can its stars align?Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) is just a few weeks away from releasing its results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016 and providing a detailed look at its expectations for 2017. I have written about this company several times over the past year - initially with some level of disdain and more lately with a level of hope and positive expectation. For a tech name, the shares have been dull and have gone nowhere over the last year or over the last few months. Indeed, the shares closed today at the same price they closed at two months ago, four months ago, and six months ago. That is a little bit worse than the averages, but it begs the question as to when the shares break out and in which direction. The company has a variety of headwinds and tailwinds to deal with. I think an article previewing the quarter, and previewing the guidance I expect to see, ought to be of some value to readers and investors at this point.About six weeks ago, activist fund Elliott Management took a position in the shares of the company and sent a letter to management detailing its ideas to promote shareholder value. The main thrust of the Elliot critique is that Cognizant ought to find uses for its free cash flow that involve returning money to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. The company has $4 billion of net cash and it continues to generate cash at modestly increasing rates although cash flow this calendar year has dropped so far because of the reversal of balance sheet changes. For the most part, CFFO for Cognizant is a function of net income plus depreciation.Last year CFFO reached $2 billion, and depending on the trajectory of other assets/liabilities, it may grow again. CapEx is modest for this company at around $300 million/year. So the fact is that the company has lots of capital it can allocate to shareholders and still fund acquisitions if they are available. The odds are that management will say something regarding its capital allocation strategy and that it may indeed attempt to return a greater proportion of its cash flow to shareholders than in the past. Running an IT services business is simply not a capital intensive undertaking, and prudent management suggests that some of the points that Elliott raised in its letter are valid. One component of a positive thesis on the shares is that Cognizant will elect to do exactly that.Can Cognizant grow againI do not mean that literally to be sure. Cognizant is growing a bit, and the consensus forecast has revenues increasing 9% this year after increasing 9% in 2016. But prior to this year, CTSH has a very long record of growing its revenues between 15% and 20%, mostly organically. The most basic question is what will be CTSH's growth looking out a couple of years and looking at 2017 to the extent I can.Cognizant's forecast for its quarter that will be reported in February is quite conservative. It calls for essentially flat sequential revenue and EPS growth compared to Q3 results in the quarter to be reported. Q4s are often difficult quarters for Cognizant and other Indian outsourcing companies, primarily because of the calendar. Last year, Cognizant had a sequential quarter with growth of just more than 1% in revenues, and at the time, those results were construed positively, and the shares increased by about 9% despite, a little faster than the IGV.December quarters for Cognizant suffer because of the Indian holiday of Diwali and our own holiday season that has a noticeable impact of several percent on potential billable days. So, modest sequential growth implies something quite a bit faster on an annual basis, and I believe that if the company simply achieves its forecast, it will suggest that growth is starting to tick up. While I certainly do not have global visibility, my own conversations with SIs and others suggest that the company was able to at least achieve the expectations it set for itself. Given that this is a professional services company, it is unlikely that it would see significant upside in a given quarter, but making expectations ought to be good enough.I am not going to address the issues that Cognizant is working through with regards to the departure of its erstwhile COO. I wrote about that event at the time and feel now, as I did then, that insofar as the company is concerned, and specifically regarding the outlook for its shares, the scandal will prove to be a non-event.Fortunately for investors, the shares are not priced at a level that requires a significant growth re-acceleration. There are currently 35 analysts rating the name on First Call. Of that number, two feel the shares are a sell, and nine rate it a hold. Seven feel the shares to be a strong buy and 17 rate it a buy. But none of the analysts, regardless of their rating, are looking to see more than 12% growth this year or so far as that goes more than 11% in the March quarter.The average price target also calls for just modest appreciation. At this point, the consensus target of $64 is just 12% above this morning's quotation. Not particularly exciting. Color me optimistic, but I think the growth expectations in the consensus are far below what can be reasonably be expected.There have been several factors weighing on Cognizant's share price performance or better said its lack of it. Elliott's letter highlights margins and capital allocation as the two chief culprits.I am inclined to think that other factors particularly those relating to the advent of the cloud and its expected negative correlation with Cognizant's growth trajectory are also keys.The cloud has changed the calculus for many things in the IT world and nowhere has that been more evident than in the demand for IT infrastructure. Instead of outsourcing software implementation and maintenance, users can outsource the entire package by buying their infrastructure in the cloud. And in addition, a traditional source of business, the implementation of third-party software, also is facing headwinds because of the advent of the cloud where many applications work out of the box or with minimal customization. The old concept of outsourced IT of ""solving your mess for less"" has gone out of fashion because most new applications are cloud applications, and by their nature, there's far less customization to be done in implementing them.A couple of months ago, in the wake of the election of Donald Trump, one analyst at William Blair, Anil Doradla, downgraded the shares of Cognizant from Buy to Hold. Some of that had to do with the issues regarding H-1B visas. And some of it had to do with the company's capital allocation strategy (The research note was published before Elliot announced the stake it had taken and sent its letter to management). I will deal with issues regarding H1-B visas later in this article in a separate section while acknowledging that my value add in projecting political events is no greater than anyone else, which is to say quite minimal.But the issue on which I want to focus is Mr. Doradla's projections for the growth of Cognizant. He believes that the company's revenues can be divided into digital and non-digital buckets. He feels, based on meetings he has with a variety of people in the industry, that structural changes are such that the growth in digital revenues will moderate from more than 25% currently to less than 20% by the end of his forecast period in 2022. He feels that pricing pressures and diminished workloads will keep non-digital revenue growth at levels of 5% or less.Overall, it is a little late in the day for some of these concerns to surface. The fact is that the concerns expressed by Mr. Doradla would have been new 2-3 years ago, but it was not news late in 2016. The IT outsourcing space is in transition, and has been for some time now, and the transition will continue into the future.On the face of it, there are some errors in Mr. Doradla's analysis. Simple math would suggest that digital revenue will become a substantially greater component of Cognizant's business if it grows at 25% the next few years and the balance of the business grows at 5% or less.Mr. Doradla's negative growth inflection point for Cognizant digital revenues comes in 2019. Why demand for digital transformation outsourcing will see a step-down in growth in 2019 specifically is not spelled out. My view is that demand for digital transformation work is just now gestating and will show stronger growth rates over the next few years as it becomes more of ""need to have"" rather than a ""nice to have"" for a variety of users.In any event, by 2019, using his own estimates, revenues coming from digital transformation projects will be 42% of the total, and if those revenues grow at 20% and the balance of Cognizant's revenues grow at 3%, that yields growth of 11% or so, with a rising trend. Many investors would stop right there and believe that if Cognizant could grow by 11%/year over the coming five years, it would warrant a higher valuation. I actually agree with that thesis, but I think growth will be faster than that, both this year and for the intermediate term.One of the growth impediments that CTSH has been facing is macro headwinds in two of its leading verticals. Cognizant is a large company, trailing only Tata Consultancy Services in the Indian outsourcing space, but it gets the preponderance of its revenue from two segments. Overall, 40% of its revenues come from the financial services vertical and 29% of its revenues come from the healthcare vertical. The company doubled down on health services a couple of years ago when it bought TriZetto, and at this point, CTSH has deep domain expertise in the healthcare vertical.Much of the business that Cognizant does in healthcare is done with health insurers, the organizations that will be mostly impacted by the replacement of Obamacare with something else. But what is that something going to be? Needless to say, initiating a project to enhance the efficiency of a processing and paying claims, or enforcing policy mandates in this environment is something that is unlikely to get funded, and the results of the uncertainty have shown and will show until there is a bit more certainty and definition.In addition, Cognizant has large relationships with some specific health insurers. Some of these insurers are contemplating or negotiating merger transactions and this has been another factor in curbing demand. It is reasonable to imagine that both of the above issues are one time in nature and will have less impact on percentage growth in 2017 although I have no idea how Cognizant might discuss these items on the conference call to come.Cognizant forecast it would have growth issues in these verticals at the start of 2016 although perhaps it was tardy in realizing the magnitude of the issues until later in the year. These have been difficult verticals for the company to deal with over the past year. There were some signs of life in the healthcare vertical last quarter although its year-on-year growth was less than 6%. At some point, there will be a new, agreed to framework in which payers (insurers) will operate. When that happens, there is a significant pipeline of deferred projects that are likely to reemerge as priorities.Healthcare was a difficult vertical for Cognizant in 2016. In that regard, healthcare software vendors such as Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) and athenahealth (NASDAQ:ATHN) have also struggled to achieve bookings numbers for the year.Financial Services has had its own set of headwinds with which to deal, and there is no need to reprise those. There are some signs I think that the headwinds specific to financial institutions are abating and will continue to abate in the environment of the new administration. At this point, the emergence of the cloud has had less of an impact on financial institutions in terms of their IT strategies than it has had on other areas of business. Financial institutions are going to need to revamp their systems, particularly to pursue the newer solutions that are part of what is called a digital transformation strategy, and there is not an abundance of packaged software to help them do it.Given the environment that Cognizant had to deal with in 2016, it is going to be far easier for CTSH to achieve significant top-line growth in its key verticals in 2017. Simply put, the comparisons are easier.But what are the real prospects for Cognizant to sell digital transformation service and how is the company positioned to compete in that space?I am not going to make excuses for industry buzzwords. If there is a business that takes more pleasure than IT in inventing buzzwords to describe relatively mundane things, I am not aware of it. I suppose this catch phrase makes executives feel that they are engaged in some kind of noble effort as opposed to just trying to sell consulting services that solve basic information technology problems.One can discern the difference between digital transformation deliverables and what went before. Digital solutions include social, mobile, analytics, agile methodology, predictive usage, connected products, pay-for-use consumption models and cloud-based stacks. Most of these so-called transformation projects relate to improving business to customer communications and experience. Cognizant has looked at the kind of projects that it describes as digital and has developed a cross-industry framework. Generally digital transformations are longer-term projects that are introduced in a staged fashion.But Cognizant does far simpler projects that it describes as digital transformation. During the November conference call, the new COO described two projects in which Cognizant was the enabler of migration to AWS environments for two significant clients. There is lots of scope in the world of digital transformation, or should I say the verbiage can be used to cover a multitude of undertakings.Despite the buzzword-heavy description of the undertaking, digital transformations are going to happen and will produce value for users who get the cadence of the transformation right. In general, these kinds of projects are far more complex and involve changing business processes to a far greater extent than the kind of assignments that have come before. By their very nature, they are significantly more difficult to sell. In the past, a company like Cognizant would bid on a project to develop either a very specific application or to assume responsibility for implementing a packaged third-party application.Digital transformations need to be sold to customers who may not be completely aware that they do not have a competitive strategy in the space. For example, users these days generate huge amounts of big data about their customers and almost all organizations have some kind of Big Data initiative underway.But they rarely have specific, customized applications to use the data they collect in a way that leads to better customer engagement and generates sales. The era of saying that using correlations and regression analysis to map potential customer behavior is dawning.Doing something like that is a digital transformation that is going to require a customer to use a variety of solutions woven together in a strategy mutually agreed between Cognizant and its client. That is very, very removed from what has come before, and I can guarantee that Cognizant and its competitors have lots of molting to do both in their sales forces and in terms of the training of their associates in order to properly sell and develop digital transformations.The financial rewards for Cognizant in selling these kinds of assignments is apparently substantial and probably represent a significantly larger market than traditional IT outsourcing. At this point, however, no one has developed a quantitative model for just how large the opportunity might be.Does some of the above sound fanciful or pie in the sky? Of course it does. Cognizant's customers aren't going to wake up one morning and decide that they need to collaborate with their IT outsourcing vendor to reconstruct their business processes. Cognizant has a significant business consulting practice (Cognizant Business Consulting). Some will argue, however, that it isn't substantial enough (5,300 professionals at this point) or that other well-known consultants such as Accenture (NYSE:ACN), Boston Consulting or McKinsey will be better able to service the market for enabling clients to achieve digital transformations.Many of Cognizant's sales people are far more transaction-focused, and I dare say the company's new COO is also transaction oriented - it is what he has done for most of his career. And Cognizant is going to have to sell lots of transactional work to its customers to pay the rent as this digital transformation offering becomes more accepted by users. It is a multi-year process during which CTSH is going to be faced with more sales challenges than has had to deal with in the past.A fly in the ointment?I don't propose to spend lots of time and space trying to speculate as to how, if at all, the H-1B visa system will be modified by the new administration. There is a general acknowledgement that the program has been plagued with different levels of fraud. Infosys (NASDAQ:INFY), in particular, has been cited as a violator of the H1-B rules on a significant scale, but certainly Cognizant has likely been involved in stretching the limits of the program. The president-elect has said he will direct the Department of Labor ""to investigate all abuses of visa programs that undercut the American worker."" On the other hand, as is well known, Mr. Trump's wife entered this country on an H1-B visa. He has also said that he understands the need for H1-B visas to ensure the supply of educated workers.Cognizant needs a reasonable supply of H1-B visa holders in order to grow at increasing rates. While Indian wages have increased to a certain extent, the appreciation of the dollar vs. the Indian rupee has mitigated the wage increases to a significant extent. There have been some extreme proposals by a few lawmakers including one to raise the minimum salary of an H1-B visa-holder to a minimum of $110,000 and another proposal to lower the annual cap of available visas.Opining about something like the future of the H1-B program would be representing that I have information I simply do not have and have no way to obtain. It is a risk for Cognizant and its competitors, although most likely not a huge risk, with potential workarounds. The risk and the headlines arising from a perspective policy change in this area is perhaps one reason why the shares are so modestly valued.Where does it all end upThe real question is can Cognizant restart its growth burners and outgrow the industry again? I have presented a case that suggests that both 2017 and beyond should see the company achieve a better growth trajectory than the results it will report in a couple of weeks. I think the idea that the preponderance of users are going to decide that they can do complex digital transformation projects better than specialists in the field is more or less risible. If users decided to outsource simpler projects because their staffs were neither qualified nor had the time for many projects, then I imagine they will double down on that decision with regards to digital transformations as time goes by.Cognizant will have to face currency perturbations, whatever they may be, going forward. That said, CTSH gets 78% of its revenues in North America, and while it is showing significantly faster growth in geos in which it has never been a major factor such as Asia/Pac and the non-UK part of Europe, currency will be less of a headwind for this company than for many other IT vendors.My guess, and that is all that it can be at this point, is that Cognizant will offer conservative guidance for 2017, but guidance that exceeds the growth rate that its rival Infosys offered when it reported a few days ago. Infosys is forecasting revenue growth of 8.5% in constant currency terms for Q4 of its 2017 fiscal year. I believe that Cognizant will want to forecast a higher number than that. I note that Cognizant's hiring last quarter of almost 12,000 associates is perhaps a signal that it is preparing to grow at somewhat faster rates in 2017 than this year.Regardless of the guidance it provides, I am inclined to believe that it will grow faster by several hundred basis points in 2017 than it will report in early February, although much growth will be back-end loaded as digital transformation projects ramp up. But as mentioned earlier, CTSH's shares are no longer expensive and should the company simply nudge expectations in the right direction and offer a more comprehensive and shareholder-friendly capital allocation plan, that should be enough, I think, to produce positive alpha. Elliot, with the prescience and arrogance of the successful, says the shares can reach $85-90 by the end of the year. As a shareholder, I will take that.The company, as of this writing, has a market capitalization of $34.8 billion. It had a net cash balance of a bit less than $4 billion when it last reported results in November. Depending on how active it was repurchasing shares, either the cash balance will be noticeably higher or the outstanding share count will be lower, but for now, it is reasonable to look at an enterprise value of just greater than $30 billion. The current consensus forecast for revenues in 2017 is $14.8 billion, so the EV/S is a very modest 2.1X. There are plenty of companies with higher EV/S ratios and much lower growth expectations. The current consensus EPS forecast for 2017 is $3.64. That results in a P/E of 15.7X. As mentioned earlier in this article, Cognizant continues to generate a significant level of cash, although that metric varies significantly on a quarterly basis because of the fluctuations in other assets/liabilities. But in any event, the company's free cash flow is likely to reach $2 billion in 2017 simply based on the growth in both earnings and depreciation. That produces a free cash flow yield of about 6.7%, again a very reasonable number especially if growth can accelerate from the levels of a depressed 2016.I think there is strong investment case that can be made for this name even if the digital transformation story is not totally realized. The shares are worth a look, I believe, heading into earnings, and the shares seem to have a very reasonable probability of achieving positive alpha in 2017."

Elliott owns over 4% of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:CTSH) (the ""Company"" or ""Cognizant""), making us one of the Company's top four shareholders. At approximately $1.4 billion in market value, this large investment demonstrates our significant level of conviction in the value opportunity present at Cognizant today.We are writing to you today to outline that opportunity in detail and share our thoughts on how to achieve it. Specifically, we believe that Cognizant can achieve a value of $80-90+ per share by the end of 2017, representing upside of 50% to 69% in just over a year. This level of value creation is unique in today's market for any company, much less one with a more than $30 billion market capitalization.Cognizant is one of the world's most successful IT services firms, and we have tremendous respect for what Frank and his team have accomplished. They deserve enormous credit for the achievements to date, and we recognize that the value opportunity described in this letter is only possible due to what they have built over the years.Our letter today is organized as follows:Elliott looks forward to working collaboratively with Frank, John and the entire Cognizant team, and we respectfully request a near-term meeting with the Board to further share our thoughts about this clear and compelling opportunity.About ElliottElliott is an investment firm founded in 1977 that today manages approximately $30 billion of capital for both institutional and individual investors. We are a multi-strategy firm, and investing in the technology sector is one of our most active efforts.Elliott's track record in technology investing is distinguished by our extensive due diligence, which includes experienced C-level executives, leading consulting firms and a proven team in public and private equity investing. This effort leaves us well positioned to evaluate operations, technologies and markets with respect to every investment. Our approach to Cognizant has followed the same discipline, and we believe this time- and resource-intensive exercise has given us a thorough understanding of the Company's strengths and challenges. We are convinced that the resulting recommendations will not only create substantial additional shareholder value, but also significantly improve the quality of Cognizant's business.The Cognizant OpportunityCognizant is one of the world's largest and most successful IT services firms. While the Company's core capability is its ADM business, it has been at the forefront of anticipating the broader shifts in the technology landscape. Cognizant has long been the most successful amongst its Indian-heritage peers in moving up the value chain and offering differentiated solutions. In fact, from our survey of more than 600 enterprise IT purchasers, Cognizant received leading Net Promoter Scores in its peer group for its core ADM and BPO/BPaaS franchises. Recently, Cognizant has developed a leading franchise in next-generation digital and SMAC capabilities (a term which Cognizant itself coined several years ago).Despite this leading position, however, Cognizant's stock price performance tells the story of deep underperformance across all relevant benchmarks, including its closest peers, over all time periods during the last five years. In fact, over the last five years, Cognizant has underperformed its core IT services peers by 83% despite growing revenue at a 22% CAGR vs. the peer average growth of a 16% CAGR over the most recent five fiscal years.(Follow this link for a graphic illustration of Cognizant's relative total shareholder return)In addition, Cognizant's relative valuation illustrates a profound loss of confidence amongst the shareholder base. Historically, Cognizant had been viewed as the premier franchise within the large-cap IT services space and had therefore traded at a meaningful premium to its peers and the broader market. However, Cognizant's valuation premium has now entirely eroded. Despite maintaining an industry-leading growth outlook, Cognizant now trades at near parity to its Indian heritage peers and at a significant discount to both Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and the S&P 500 for the first time.(Follow this link for a graphic illustration comparing Cognizant's NTM P/E to the S&P 500)(Follow this link for a graphic illustration comparing Cognizant's NTM P/E Multiple Premium/(Discount) compared to its peers)This profound share price and valuation underperformance is made even starker by the facts that Cognizant is an industry leader, an above-average grower and a high-quality franchise. The drivers of this deep and material underperformance are as follows:1) Profitability and Efficiency: Cognizant continues to practice and swear by a strategy that was developed nearly two decades ago, when revenues were over 200x smaller, to keep operating margins in the 19%-20% range.2) Capital Allocation: Despite growing into a scale market leader with stable and significant cash flows, Cognizant has remained unwilling to establish a capital return program.Cognizant's operations and capital allocation strategies are remnants of its history as a nascent industry ""challenger"" that invested at all costs to gain share. Today, however, Cognizant has evolved into a scale industry leader, and its business choices must also evolve to reflect this reality.Elliott is far from the first to identify these issues and propose actionable steps to rectify them. In fact, they have steadily become the primary concern among investors, precipitating the sharp loss of confidence illustrated in the charts above. The quotes below represent just a small sample of the commentary on this point:These quotes provide a highly representative picture of investor sentiment towards Cognizant and its operational strategy. The good news is that Cognizant can take clear, actionable steps to re-evaluate its dated operational and capital strategies for the good of the Company and its shareholders.Cognizant and Its Markets Have Changed, But Its Approach to Profitability Has Not(Follow this link for a graphic illustration of Cognizant's market capitalization, revenue and adjusted operating margin)The above chart indicates a truly astonishing lack of operating leverage given the change in the Company over the past 15 years. Furthermore, Cognizant currently operates at a meaningful profitability discount to its direct peers. This margin differential is incredibly unique, both in magnitude and in cause. First, the magnitude is meaningful: despite a similar business mix and gross margin profile to its two closest peers (TCS (OTCPK:TTNQY) and Infosys (NYSE:INFY)), Cognizant maintains operating margins that are at a ~750-850bps discount on a comparable basis. Second, the cause is not accidental, but intentional: Since its origins, Cognizant has deliberately maintained a strategy of targeting margins at a level established nearly 20 years ago under vastly different business considerations.Moreover, Cognizant's target margins are ~1,000bps lower than those of its direct peers. While all of Cognizant's peers are focused on achieving higher levels of profitability longer term, it remains wedded to the same 19-20% range it has maintained for 20 years. Consequently, as peers execute against their own profitability initiatives and increase margins, the profitability gap between Cognizant and its peers will only continue to widen.(Follow this link for a graphic illustration comparing the margins of large-cap Indian IT service providers)What is perhaps most striking is the level of consistency with which Cognizant has been able to purposefully inhibit any margin expansion beyond the 19%-20% band despite revenue growing exponentially. Following Cognizant's first full year as a public company in 1999, revenue has increased by a factor of 140x, from under $90 million to nearly $12.5 billion in 2015. Despite this increase, adjusted operating margins have never deviated outside of the targeted 19%-20% range. In fact, margins have actually decreased over the past several years, recently reaching their lowest levels since 2003, when Cognizant's sales were just 3% of what they are today. While the discipline of reinvestment may have made sense when the Company was emerging, the established dogma of ""managing to a number"" regardless of evolving business conditions no longer makes sense and is a prime contributor to the Company's underperformance.(Follow this link for a graphic illustration of Cognizant's adjusted operating margin and revenue)Beyond the clearly negative value implications, this lack of operating leverage is damaging from a business perspective because it masks inefficiency while impairing the Company's flexibility to make sound investments in R&D and M&A. For example, the Company's stated rationale for keeping margins artificially low is to ""reinvest."" However, based on our substantial diligence, these ""reinvestments"" are actually disguising a lower level of business efficiency. Cognizant's peers, for example, also make substantial investments, but they achieve higher operating margins by internally targeting a higher level of efficiency and profitability. The result is that Cognizant's inferior efficiency and lower margins have served to suppress cash flow and income statement flexibility that could have been used for prudent and growth-focused R&D and M&A investments.For years, Cognizant's lack of operating efficiency and general disregard for margins were less noticeable because the Company was a smaller player, growing in excess of the market and its peers. Today, Cognizant has grown into a scale player in the IT services market with $13.5 billion of revenue, while both the Company and the broader IT services market have matured and are growing more slowly. Not only has Cognizant stopped delivering outsized growth, but also it is actually expected to grow at a slower pace than the average of its closest Indian IT services peers this year and for the third time in the last five years. In fact, Cognizant has failed to meaningfully differentiate itself in terms of growth since 2011.(Follow this link for a graphic illustration comparing Cognizant's relative revenue growth rate to Indian IT services peers)Though we expect Cognizant to return to above-market growth in the near term, the overall market has matured, and revenue growth rates are lower than they have been in the past. In any scenario, there is no argument against operating with improved efficiency, cash flow and margins.Suboptimal Capital Allocation Hurts Both Valuation and OperationsRelative to both peers and optimal business practices, Cognizant's lack of an appropriate capital return policy has long made it a distant outlier. Cognizant possesses a $13.5 billion (and growing) revenue base, $2 billion of cash flow per year, $4 billion of net cash, a meaningful margin expansion opportunity and a strong franchise. Despite these attributes, Cognizant has no dividend, only repurchases shares to offset dilution and clings to the flawed belief that growth and capital allocation are somehow at odds.(Follow this link for a graphic illustration comparing the uses of cash flow by Cognizant and its peers)As the chart above illustrates, Cognizant has historically returned the lowest level of cash flow to shareholders while accumulating the highest level of cash flow on its balance sheet. Also, and perhaps most notably, Cognizant is the only large-cap IT service provider which does not maintain a dividend. This is a particularly unique fact given Cognizant's scale and positioning.(Follow this link for a graphic illustration of the dividend yield of large-cap IT service providers)As investors look across the peer group, they see peers that have generated considerable returns through a balanced combination of margin expansion, EPS growth through share repurchases and return of capital via dividends. For example, despite the lowest growth outlook of the group, Accenture has generated strong shareholder returns through a thoughtful balance of share repurchases and dividends as well as consistent margin improvement. It is worth noting that Accenture has also positioned itself astutely at the forefront of digital services through a continued emphasis on acquisitions. This focus demonstrates that not only can an appropriate capital return program allow for smart investments, but also that a more efficient and cash-flow-generative profile can provide greater acquisition capacity and income statement flexibility to make the investments necessary in today's changing environment.(Follow this link for a graphic illustration comparing Cognizant and Accenture on capital return priorities)The last point in the table is worth emphasizing - Cognizant is viewed as being shareholder-unfriendly. In contrast, Accenture is viewed as being a responsible steward of shareholder capital and is therefore awarded a multiple of more than 20x NTM P/E, a meaningful premium to the entire peer group, despite having the lowest revenue growth rate. Its robust capital return and margin expansion programs support a far higher multiple than its slower growth alone warrants, because it offers shareholders a balanced set of drivers to deliver investment returns.Cognizant, on the other hand, gets penalized with a significant discount. Because Cognizant has a limited capital return program and explicitly commits not to expand margins, shareholders must rely on the Company delivering above-average revenue growth for investment returns. When selecting companies in which to invest capital, shareholders will naturally gravitate toward management teams with proven capital allocation track records.This lack of balance negatively impacts both Cognizant shareholders and management:(Follow this link for a graphic illustration of Cognizant's evolution of consensus growth estimates)Fortunately, Cognizant is well positioned today to remedy this imbalance by enhancing its capital return policy and thereby signaling to the market that it is willing to take the steps necessary to deliver industry-leading returns. A more shareholder-friendly approach to capital allocation would be warmly received by the investment community, as the below sampling of quotes from research analysts indicates:The Cognizant Value-Enhancement PlanToday, Elliott is formally requesting a meeting with the Board to share the details of an operational plan that we believe will create significant value for stockholders. What we call the Cognizant Value-Enhancement Plan was developed through exhaustive research with the help of a full team of operating partners, all with proven experience creating value at technology companies:The Cognizant Value-Enhancement Plan is based upon three driving principles: the need for 1) fundamental operational improvements, 2) efficient allocation of capital and 3) effective oversight and incentive alignment. The key components for fundamental change are as follows:1) Implementation of Operational Best Practices: With the help of our operational consultants, we have developed a granular cost baseline which we have used to compare Cognizant against direct outsourcing peers and other industry benchmarks, helping us triangulate upon what an appropriate cost structure for CTSH should look like. We have identified numerous opportunities throughout the organization for significant improvement, which we believe will result in a more efficient use of resources without impacting Cognizant's ability to pursue industry-leading growth. In total, our Cognizant Value-Enhancement Plan calls for a 23.0% adjusted operating margin in FY18E as compared to a 19.7% operating margin in FY15.It is necessary to frame this target in the context of Cognizant's direct peers. As highlighted above, on a comparable basis including stock-based compensation, Cognizant today operates at an 18.0% operating margin, whereas its closest ADM-oriented peers TCS and Infosys operate at comparable margins of 26.6% and 25.4%, respectively. After adjusting for the ~1.5% of sales that Cognizant spends on stock-based compensation, the Cognizant Value-Enhancement Plan would leave the company with a comparable operating margin target of ~21.5% in FY18E - still a highly conservative ~400-500 basis-point discount to peers.Looked at another way, this plan represents such a highly targeted effort to cut costs that it does not assume a reduction in the aggregate cost base. Given Cognizant will continue to grow roughly 10% per year over the coming years, the Cognizant Value-Enhancement Plan does not assume a reduction in dollar costs but instead calls for more than $125 million of growth in operating expenses from FY2016 to FY2018. This provides an entirely achievable framework for Cognizant to prudently grow into a more appropriate cost structure without having to take out costs.Our team has identified the major areas for improvement as follows:Finally, the plan was designed to be deliberately conservative, affording Cognizant meaningful flexibility to adjust its cost structure as business conditions change. One such hypothetical change concerns speculated-about modifications to skilled labor visa regulation. First, Cognizant is unique in having much wider latitude than its peers to improve its cost structure and can easily accommodate any of the speculated changes to regulations while still achieving the margins laid out in the plan (e.g., the plan contemplates an increase in operating expenses, whereas Cognizant could easily accelerate cost removals to achieve the plan's margin targets). Second, we would anticipate any changes in this area, if there are any, to be instituted over time, further providing Cognizant with a clear ability to plan for any adjustments. Cognizant has for some time been reducing its reliance on visas both organically (e.g., increased local hiring, sourcing talent from near-shore centers and reduced need for visa labor on higher-value digital work) and inorganically (e.g., U.S. acquisitions such as Trizetto). Finally, Cognizant could also benefit considerably from favorable policy change (e.g., through any one of a number of permutations of tax/repatriation reforms) and with ~$5bn of cash and ~$2bn of annual cash flow has ample capacity to adapt to any further changes in the landscape. In all cases, the degree of conservatism built into the Cognizant Value-Enhancement Plan provides the Company with ample room to respond to a wide range of hypotheticals while still achieving plan targets.2) Capital Allocation: Cognizant today suffers from a highly inefficient capital structure with $4 billion of net cash, including $1.1 billion of onshore cash following the recent repatriation, and virtually no debt. Moreover, Cognizant is currently trading at its lowest valuation since the financial crisis and is now valued at under 15x NTM P/E. This subdued valuation, while unfortunate, does provide Cognizant with a uniquely opportune time to repurchase shares. Cognizant should immediately introduce a large share repurchase program. This would be highly accretive to earnings, particularly in light of the tremendous earnings generation potential (over 20% per annum) contemplated by the Cognizant Value-Enhancement Plan. We believe that the following measures should be introduced:In addition to the prudent financial rationale for implementing a more robust capital allocation program, the steps outlined above would provide a very meaningful signal to investors that Cognizant is, for the first time, willing to embrace a more shareholder-friendly stance towards allocating capital and generating leading shareholder returns. The Cognizant Value-Enhancement Plan would represent a much needed and highly beneficial inflection point in Cognizant's approach toward investors.3) Enhanced Oversight and Incentive Alignment: Despite our admiration and respect for the organization that John, Frank and the rest of the team have built over the past two decades, we believe the Board and management team would greatly benefit from new Board perspectives and improved compensation incentives.This high-level summary provides a brief overview of the details supporting the Cognizant Value-Enhancement Plan. We strongly believe that the steps outlined above are both prudent and achievable. With enhanced oversight from the Board, we have high confidence that this plan will be successful.The Cognizant Value-Enhancement Plan Will Create Significant ValueBy implementing the Cognizant Value-Enhancement Plan and providing the oversight necessary to ensure its execution, we believe using conservative assumptions that Cognizant can achieve a value of $80-90+ per share by the end of 2017. We would also mention that there is considerable upside to these targets given the conservative approach underlying many of our assumptions. To the extent Cognizant were to take a more aggressive approach towards closing the margin gap vs. peers, increasing capital return or successfully pursuing value-accretive M&A, there exists substantial potential upside to our targets. The table below details Elliott's model scenarios supporting our price targets.(Follow this link for a graphic illustration of the assumptions and results of the Cognizant Value Enhancement Plan)Our base case assumes what we believe to be a conservative NTM P/E multiple of 16.0x, which is well below Cognizant's one- and three-year averages of 16.8x and 18.6x, respectively, as well as a lower multiple than those assumed in almost all equity research price targets. This valuation is in line with Infosys at 15.3x and at a significant discount to TCS at 17.2x, Accenture at 20.3x and the broader S&P 500 at 17.4x.Moreover, we believe a major driver behind Cognizant's lower multiple is its antiquated policies around margin expansion and capital return. If the Company were to take the actions outlined in the Cognizant Value-Enhancement Plan, with revenue growth of nearly 10% per year, Cognizant would generate a peer-leading EPS growth well north of 20% per annum. In contrast to today's current return profile, whereby shareholder returns entirely mimic revenue growth, this more balanced approach to delivering consistent and outsized returns would be rewarded with a premium multiple, as was shown above to be the case with Accenture. The result could be value creation beyond our base or even our upside cases. In any case, as the valuation range below indicates, we believe that the Cognizant Value-Enhancement Plan will generate tremendous value creation across a broad range of assumed valuation multiples.(Follow this link for a graphic illustration of the FY 17E value target sensitivity at various NTM P/E Multiples)We look forward to a collaborative and positive dialogue with Cognizant's Board and management. To that end, we respectfully request a meeting in the next few weeks with the full Board during which we can share a detailed presentation of the Cognizant Value-Enhancement Plan and discuss the significant opportunity at Cognizant. Our desire to find a way to move forward expeditiously is motivated by our conviction that the initiatives outlined above should be evaluated by the Company immediately, so that Cognizant is in a position to announce and implement them at its next earnings call in February.We firmly believe that the Company is at a pivotal point, facing a more mature and evolving market as well as deeply diminished shareholder confidence. Navigating successfully will require a strategy of greater focus on operational excellence and shareholder value creation. As shareholders, we believe the solutions outlined in this letter offer the optimal path for Cognizant to maintain its market leadership and deliver sustainable shareholder returns.Thank you very much for your time and consideration. We look forward to our meeting.Disclosure: None"

4044427,25120,2017-02-09T13:53:27-05:00,"Cognizant Technology Solutions is implementing the suggestions of activist investor Elliott Management.While this is to be applauded, Cognizant is implementing the ""light"" version of the proposals.While I'm somewhat more conservative than Elliott, and notice concerns with regard to investigations and H-1B visas, I still see a compelling risk-reward on dips.","Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) gave in rather easily on the demands of Elliott, as ""proposed"" late November of last year. The company opened up seats on the board, is going to return capital to investors and aims to improve margins, thereby answering positively to all the demands of Elliott. That said, in general the demands of the activist investor were a bit larger than the extent to which Cognizant is now delivering.Despite this modest disappointment, investors reacted positively to the willingness of Cognizant to engage with Elliott. While I do not share the optimistic scenario of Elliott for next year, I see better days ahead from current levels, making me a buyer on dips.What Did Elliott Want?Elliott wrote Cognizant a letter late in November of last year, telling the company that it has become a major shareholder, owning 4% of the shares with a value of $1.4 billion at the time.Elliott believed that Cognizant is a great investment and company, yet it can be run even better. If Elliott's plans were implemented, the activist projected a valuation of $80-$90 per share by the end of this year. Elliot praised the long-term growth, but notes that shares have underperformed and lost their premium multiple versus other Indian-heritage players and Accenture.Elliott cited two reasons for the underperformance of the shares in recent years: profitability and capital allocation. Cognizant continues to target operating margins of 20% of sales, something which it started over two decades ago, despite the fact that revenues have increased by a factor of 200 times. This indicates that the company has not benefited from scale, and shows that there is room for improvement, certainly as other players are posting margins in the 25-30% region. Capital allocation has been poor as well as retained earnings are not returned to investors, either in the form of a dividend or share buyback program.Elliott is essentially demanding better operational results and increased returns of capital. By adopting best practices, Elliott believes that operating margins can improve 3 percentage points by 2018. Adjusted margins should improve to 23% of sales that year, or 21.5% on a GAAP basis. This still marks a 4-5% discount to some peers.Cognizant's net cash position could furthermore be used to start an accelerated $2.5 billion share buyback program in early 2017 as well as pay a 1.5% dividend yield. Elliott would like to see a bit more aggressive adoption of M&A as well. Another demand is a refreshed board as well as improved incentives for its members.Using a scenario of 9% revenue CAGR through 2018, adjusted operating margins of 23%, and cumulative buybacks of $4 billion, Elliott came up with a $5 adjusted earnings per share number for 2018, or potentially a bit higher. By applying reasonably conservative multiples to such an outcome, Elliott valued the shares at $80-$90 per share.Cognizant Is ListeningLittle over two months after Elliott's letter, Cognizant is making a move in response to the demand of the activist investor. The company announced that it has reached an agreement with Elliott as the board will be refreshed with three new board members.The company will furthermore engage on a $1.5 billion buyback program in Q1 of 2017, a billion less which Elliott demanded. Another $1.2 billion in buybacks will be executed from Q2 of this year onwards to 2018. The company furthermore announced a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share as the 1.1% yield is a bit less than the 1.5% suggested by Elliott. The capital return program is a bit lower than perhaps hoped for, but fortunately the company has committed to pay out 75% of US free cash flows from 2019 onwards, thereby reassuring investors.While Cognizant has quickly delivered on capital returns and improved board accountability, the hardest step still has to be made, that is achieving margin gains in the actual business.But What About The Operational Achievements?For the operations of Cognizant, Elliott guided for a 9% CAGR through 2018 in terms of sales and adjusted operating margins of 23%.That seems a bit stretched as fourth quarter sales were up by ""just"" 7.1% to $3.46 billion as full-year growth came in at 8.6% last year. GAAP operating margins for the final quarter came in at 16.2%, down 90 basis points from the year before. Full-year margins came in at 17.0%, down 20 basis points from the year before.Even if acquisition and stock based compensation expenses are added back, fourth quarter adjusted margins were down 90 basis points to 18.7% of sales, a long way from the 23% goal as suggested by Elliott.The guidance for 2017 is comforting in terms of sales as revenues are seen at $14.56-$14.84 billion, suggesting that sales are seen up by 8% to 10%. Non-GAAP earnings are seen at least $3.63 per share, which is kind of disappointing as this suggest growth of at least 7% per share. This actually suggests that margins are seen down in the coming year, especially as the earnings guidance takes into account the accretion from the announced share buybacks.The anticipated margin pressure is attributed to investments to build digital capabilities, which now make up nearly a quarter of total revenues. Cognizant is investing in re-skilling of staff and new technologies. These actions, which are support to ensure revenue growth beyond 2017 as well as a review of the cost structure, should result in non-GAAP margins of 22% by 2019. This target is a percentage point less and a year later as targeted by Elliott.Agreeing With Elliott, Delivering A Bit LessCognizant has in essence given in to all of Elliott's demands as outlined in November of last year, but it has under delivered a bit in relation to the demands of the activist investor. The share buyback program is a bit smaller than demanded, as is the dividend yield. Furthermore, the margin target outlined by Cognizant is achieved a year later and is lower than Elliott demanded for.Let's however construct the pro-forma picture for 2019 based on the plans, as outlined by Cognizant itself. Based on the midpoint of the guidance of $14.7 billion in sales for 2017 and applying a 7% growth rate through 2019, I see sales of $16.8 billion.Adjusted margins came in at 19.5% in 2016 as the gap with GAAP margins was 250 basis points, which seems fairly stable driven by amortization charges and stock-based compensation charges. That suggests GAAP margins might come in at 19.5% in 2019, if adjusted margins hit Cognizant's target of 22%. This should boost GAAP operating profits from $2.29 billion in 2016 to $3.28 billion in 2019.The current share base of 609 million shares can be shrunk given the $2.7 billion share repurchase program, to be executed in 2017 and 2018. That would be sufficient to buy back 48 million shares at current levels, reducing the share base to 561 million shares.The issuance of debt, as most of the net cash position is held overseas, will involve modest interest charges going forward, despite the fact that Cognizant is remaining net debt free going forward. Using a $3.2 billion earnings before tax number for 2019, and a 25% tax rate, earnings might come in at $2.4 billion on a GAAP basis. That would be equivalent to $4.25 per share in 2019.Elliott came up with a $4.95 per share number for 2018, but this was a non-GAAP number, as the difference between accounting methods inflates this number by $0.50-$0.60 per share. As such, Elliott is a bit more aggressive, a reason why a $70-$80 valuation seems very reasonable by 2018, instead of the $80-$90 suggested by Elliott.That being said, it will be challenging to add 2.5% points to margins in a period of little over a year, but Cognizant has reacted positively to Elliott and rather quickly. This is a comforting sign, even as it is not as aggressive as Elliott demands have been.Final ThoughtsThe $80-$90 fair value assumption of Elliott for the coming 12 months seems too optimistic, as recognized by the market in the sense that shares could rise some 40% in the period of just a year at the normal case outlined by Elliott.I see potential for $70-$80 valuation if Cognizant delivers on its plants which are a bit less aggressive than Elliott has called for. Even so, achieving a 250 basis point improvement in margins is hard to be achieved by 2019, certainly if the company actually guides for modest margin pressure in the coming year.That being said current earnings power runs at $3 per share which with a market multiple and net cash could provide a real support to the valuation at these levels. There are some risks however including a potential revoke of the H-1B visa, as Cognizant is the largest ""user"" of this program. The other concern results from the overhang from a potential violation of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, although Cognizant has voluntarily notified authorities. Given these two overhangs, I subtract $5 per share in the valuation.If incremental improvements become visible in the coming quarters, a $70 valuation seems fair at this point next year. This makes me a buyer on potential dips which could easily be triggered by political headlines."
4009752,98236,2016-10-03T11:35:40-04:00,"Cognizant announced on Friday that it had launched an internal investigation as to whether the company may have violated the foreign corrupt-practices statues.The company also announced the resignation of long-serving Cognizant president, Gordon Coburn.The issue apparently relates to questionable payments that have been made with regards to some small number of Cognizant facilities.It would not be surprising if the allegations are confirmed and if Mr. Coburn had something to do with authorizing improper payments.While Cognizant could have to pay a fine of some consequence, it has substantial cash resources. There is no evidence that these types of issues impact business of the offender.","Cognizant - It needs to find some morning sunThe title and the first headline for this article come from the song, ""I'll be seeing you"" which is one of the more well-known jazz standards. It dates to 1938 and was written for a show that closed after 15 performances. Neither the composer nor the lyricist are house-hold words - and weren't when they wrote this song. But it is a lasting legacy to their talents. Despite the failure of the show, the song has been popular ever since it was first performed. It was particularly popular in World War II for obvious reasons - servicemen (and women) pining for ""all the old familiar places."" The version performed by Billie Holiday is probably the best known but it has been sung by just about every famous performer from the '40s till now.And, of course, the question for Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) shareholders in the wake of press releases about violations of foreign corrupt practices laws and the resignation of the company's president, Gordon Coburn, is whether the company can return to old familiar places as the leader of the Indian outsourcing group. I think it can and I think investors ought to take advantage of Friday's unpleasantness to add to or to establish positions.A mystery on the GangesSounds like the title for an Agatha Christie mystery. And, of course, Cognizant doesn't have any facilities located directly on the Ganges. Sadly, the Ganges is highly polluted these days and it would not be practical to locate a major office facility on the banks of the river. Cognizant facilities are in traditional locations within India, including Bangalore, Gurgaon, Mumbai, Cochin, Coimbatore and Kolkata. But mystery there is and it did take place in various locations in India.Cognizant issued two significant press releases on Friday and the shares wound up closing down by more than 13% and closed at $47.63/share. Cognizant shares haven't closed at such a low price since October, 2014. Back then, the company recorded $2.581 billion in revenues and EPS was $.66 (non-GAAP). The estimates for the current quarter that closed on Friday are for revenues of $3.388 billion in revenues (31% growth) and for EPS of $.84 (non-GAAP), which is 27% growth.Given Cognizant's past growth rates, these are disappointing numbers, which is why the shares have declined about 8% YTD before Friday and are now down by 32% of their value since they made a high last November, a period in which the IGV software index has climbed by about 12%.In one press release, the company announced that it had initiated an internal probe related to whether payments made to facilities in India violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices act. The company said it had ""voluntarily notified the U.S. Dept. of Justice and the SEC of its investigation.""In another press release, the company announced the resignation of the company's president, and former CFO, Gordon Coburn. No reasons were cited, no thanks were given for Mr. Coburn's service (he had been with the company in various executive roles since the mid-'90s and had been the CFO when the company initially went public. Mr. Coburn was replaced by Rajeev Mehta who had been the head of IT services for Cognizant.According to the press release, despite the title Mr. Mehta had held, he has been responsible for leading market-facing teams in delivering industry-leading growth, i.e. he has been the equivalent of VP of Sales.Given the sparse commentary in the press releases, much of what follows is necessarily speculation and is doubtless subject to revision as more facts emerge. I do not think it is surprising to many readers that India has its share of corrupt practices. The Indian economy has been burdened with a host of regulations for decades and some of these regulations relate to the process of permitting new buildings. Over the past couple of decades, Cognizant has erected major delivery centers in 10 Indian locations and it has smaller offices in some other cities across the sub-continent.It can be a challenge for any concern in India to get building permits in a timely fashion or even to get approvals to have the water turned on, or for gasoline to be stored in cars underneath buildings (I mean in their gas tanks) or to be hooked up to the electricity grid. It is even possible that there had been zoning issues that needed to be overcome although just having seen the Cognizant facilities in a few locations, that seems less likely. It seems likely to this writer that issues regarding getting Cognizant facilities permitted in a timely fashion may be responsible for the issues the company now faces. I can offer no speculation as to how many facilities were involved (the company's press release says a few but then there are only 10 major service delivery centers at this time), how much money was involved and of course who was involved in making and authorizing the payments. That the payments may have run well into six figures would jibe with my own observations regarding other, far smaller facilities and their own costs in terms of doing business. That the payments may have come to light at this point, is perhaps a function of the ascension of anti-corruption drives that have been led by the government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi who took office at the end of May, 2014.The penalties that can be accrued for violations of the federal anti-foreign corruption act are not insubstantial but some of the penalties can be mitigated if a firm voluntarily discloses its offenses. The SEC website shows a rather extensive list of enforcement cases since the law was initially enacted in 1978. Since 2008 some select cases included a fine paid by Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) of $480 million, a fine imposed on Alcoa (NYSE:AA) that totaled $384 million. Other cases have involved Walmart de Mexico (NYSE:WMT) and News Corp. (NASDAQ:NWSA). Wal-Mart in India has been reported to have paid millions in bribes for facilities according to a story in the Wall Street Journal.Just to put the issue in perspective, CTSH had a gross cash balance of $5 billion on its balance sheet (net amount $3.8 billion) and it had repatriated some $2.8 billion from India to the US and to other geos in order to pursue an acquisition strategy.I suppose having tried, convicted and sentenced Cognizant, I may as well go on and suggest that the circumstances of Mr. Coburn's resignation suggest that he is more likely than not to have authorized the illegal payments. It is almost unheard of for companies to issue press releases that do not acknowledge the service of a president, especially one who has been with the company for more than 20 years. That would be true even if Mr. Coburn were forced out of his position for some reason relating to performance. The release doesn't even cite the traditional rubrics that Mr. Coburn had resigned to pursue other interests or to deal with family matters or anything that might be exculpatory within this set of facts.Mr. Coburn was appointed as president a bit more than four years ago, presumably as a reward for his service over the years and as a way of rewarding his performance. It is not immediately apparent, at least to this writer, that his performance, given the environment in which this company operates is likely to have been the cause for what appears to be a brutal termination of his tenure. The fact is that the company started to face macro headwinds that would have been difficult for any single man to overcome and would have required a level of prescience that few if any executives now living, actually possess.A tempest in a teacup, a teapot or something more systemic?I am inclined to the view that this is more likely to prove to be a tempest in a teacup and that investors will reconsider their initial reaction of panic over a short time span. I think I ought to state that ceteris paribus, bribery is a bad thing. And breaking other laws, which are likely to have been broken by Indian outsourcing companies, is not admirable conduct. But this is a story about the opportunities in Cognizant stock and not a morality tale. With perspective, what matters is how Cognizant's current and prospective clients are going to react to the alleged set of improprieties.There have been many offenders of the foreign anti-corruption laws that have paid their fines and moved on. The idea that some potential clients will be unwilling to do business with Cognizant because of this allegation or this violation if that proves to be the case is pretty farfetched. I would be very surprised if there are any large corporations who have done business in India who are not familiar with the level of bribery that has existed in that country for many, many years.Cognizant, because it is an enormous employer within India, (it had 244,000 employees at last count of whom more than 150,000 were located in India) is almost inevitably going to be a firm that encounters and has to deal with some of the unhappier aspects of doing business in that country. It is one of the costs of doing business that a company of the scale of Cognizant, which has built quite so many new facilities in such a short time scale would have been able to avoid. Most Cognizant clients understand that and are not likely to avoid doing business with the company based on what is almost inevitably a common practice in that country.Most of the company's clients are looking for the best quality of work that they can obtain at the lowest prices in the minimum time period. If Cognizant can fulfill those criteria, then its issues with regards to how it paid for the facilities it built are going to be relatively inconsequential.As those readers with longer memories may be aware, Cognizant was found guilty of violating H-1B visa rules in 2009. While the practices it followed were probably far more widespread, it admitted to underpaying 67 of its employees at that time. Infosys (NYSE:INFY) and Tata Consultancy Services have also been involved with similar problems of far greater magnitude. Indeed, there is a current investigation involving Infosys and Tata underway at the moment involving several hundred employees. One might have anticipated that given the sensitivity in this political season to Indian professionals taking jobs from Americans at marquee firms like Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Southern California Edison (SCE), there might have been some business fallout from these allegations. That has not been the case. I think by far the most likely outcome is that Cognizant will have to pay fines of some lesser or greater magnitude and it will be careful about where it sites its newer service delivery centers. It has already moved some of its service delivery capability to the US and to other countries as well, and it may well be that this issue will result in an acceleration of that trend.There some executives who are found to be irreplaceable. I do not try to offer commentary regarding Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) but I think there are few people who would try to deny that Steve Jobs was special. I think the new management is doing a great job at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) but is there anyone who will attempt to deny the genius of Bill Gates and how he literally developed a monopoly that persists to this day.Gordon Coburn as president of Cognizant has been smart, capable but he is not in the same league as other transformational executives. He has been well respected and trusted by many analysts to be sure, but he hasn't been the CFO for a few years at this point.His training is financial and not sales and perhaps what CTSH needs now is sales expertise. It is unfair and unfortunate if the man is taking the blame for a pattern that is institutional in nature, but his resignation is not likely to have a material impact on the results of the company. Is it possible that one or two deals weren't signed last week because of the turmoil surrounding these issues? Maybe, I certainly do not know. Will it mean anything in the context of an entire quarter? I really doubt that it will. For me, the net of this whole situation is that it provides investors with an extraordinary entry point into the name. If you liked the shares before, then they are on sale now. If you were waiting for the shares to reach value territory - well this is likely to be your chance.Can Cognizant the company and Cognizant the shares find those old familiar places?The places aren't going to be quite the same as they might have been five years ago, but I think the odds strongly favor Cognizant's transformational strategy that is focused on offering companies migration to more digital platforms as it has now emerged will indeed lead to a re-acceleration of growth in coming quarters. I tried to cover the subject in an earlier article on the name that I published in the wake of what was perceived as a disappointing earnings release in which guidance was reduced significantly for the balance of the year.While the shares only slipped a few percent immediately following the earnings release, they were further pressured in the wake of a Goldman downgrade. The Goldman downgrade essentially suggested that macro headwinds would be impossible to surmount in the intermediate term which it defined as through the middle of 2017. It also suggested that there might be some weakness in overall IT spend over the medium-term that would impact the company's revenue growth. I suppose my view, in contrast to the Goldman analysis, is to try to get in front of the curve and not to wait for explicit financial metrics before buying the shares. I think that will wind up being just too cute and especially so now that the shares have slipped another 13%.Cognizant shares are not quite deep value, but they are not all that far away from that category. With an enterprise value that has decreased to $25.4 billion, the EV/S based on the latest guidance is below 1.9X and based on the consensus forecast for the following year, the EV/S is below 1.7X. Again, based on company guidance and the consensus estimate, which are basically identical, the P/E for this year is down to 14X and based on expectations for 2017, the P/E is down to 12.9X. It is fair to point out that revenue growth expectations are now around 10% for both this year and next year. So, the share price certainly reflects the headwinds that Goldman talked about. But the estimates reflect no expectations of growth re-acceleration either. If Cognizant were just a 10% grower for the foreseeable future, it shares would be cheap enough to buy especially since growth at that level would be likely to see a capital allocation plan that involved the payment of a dividend.Like most professional services companies in the IT space, cash flow from operations is more or less consistent with net income and little of the net income comes from stock-based comp. The company, because of its massive investment in facilities does generate a fair amount of depreciation that has been having a positive impact on cash flow and that is not likely to change in the near future. Capex primarily relates to the facilities, and without growth, the need for new facilities will not be great. So, low-growth likely equals near-term dividend initiation which would be good for the shares.The primary issues for this company and indeed for many IT services groups have been the weakness in both health care and most particularly, financial services verticals. But it is fair to say that the financial services vertical includes opportunities outside the banking space which is clearly the most troubled at the moment. The other components of the financial services vertical present a far more mixed picture in terms of demand with some growth and some decline. And while there has been much consolidation in the healthcare space and turmoil related to that consolidation, ultimately the opportunities haven't gone away, they have merely been deferred. The pressure that many of Cognizant's clients have to complete projects is ultimately going to overcome some of the short-term headwinds buffeting the space and that is going to have visible impacts on growth most likely before the second half of 2017.For many years, Cognizant shares have been a favorite of institutions and almost 92% of the shares are held by institutions according to the latest reports. I expect that these institutions are likely to take advantage of the latest share price weakness to augment their holdings in what is still the 2nd largest and most rapidly growing name in its space despite some short-term issues. Cognizant presents long-term investors with a huge amount of positive alpha and a long absolute runway. The likelihood is that the shares will also prove to be a decent trading vehicle as well."
4007291,68695,2016-09-20T10:20:16-04:00,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH) is trading near historical lows relative to both adjusted asset and adjusted earnings value.
        Considering management’s concerns about the sustainability of revenue growth and demand for their solutions, current low valuations and expectations may be warranted in the near term.
        Valuations are similar to peer levels, however CTSH has historically shown substantially stronger growth, spelling potential for longer-term equity upside.","Performance and Valuation Prime™ ChartThe PVP chart below reflects the real, economic performance and valuation measures of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:CTSH) after making many major adjustments to the as-reported financials. This chart, along with all of the charts included in this article, as well as the detail behind the graphics, can be found here.The four panels explain the company's historical corporate performance and valuation levels plus consensus estimates for forecast years as well as what the market is currently pricing in, in terms of expectations for profitability and growth.The apostrophe after ROA', Asset', V/A', and V/E' is the symbol for ""prime"" which means ""adjusted."" These calculations have been modified with comprehensive adjustments to remove as-reported earnings, asset, liability, and cash flow statement inconsistencies and distortions. To better understand the PVP chart and the following discussion, please refer to our guide here.CTSH has seen historically robust, relatively stable profitability, with Adjusted ROA (ROA') levels ranging from 32%-42% since 2000. Meanwhile, Adjusted Asset (Asset') growth was fairly aggressive from 2000-2008, ranging from 39%-69%, but has tapered off to 2%-31% levels since 2009.Performance Drivers - Sales, Margins, and TurnsIt can be helpful to break down ROA' into its DuPont formula parts, Adjusted Earnings Margin (Earnings' Margin) and Adjusted Asset Turnover (Asset' Turns), which are the cleaned up margins and turns metrics used to calculate ROA'. The chart below details both Earnings' Margin and Asset' Turns historically, to help us better understand the drivers of the firm's profitability and performance. The detail behind the chart can be found here.The firm's relatively stable ROA' levels has been driven by trends in both Earnings' Margins and Asset' Turns. Earnings' Margins improved from 12% in 2000 to 14% in 2002, before stabilizing at 14%-15% levels through 2008. While Earnings' Margins subsequently improved to 17% in 2010, they fell back to 15% in 2015. Meanwhile, Asset' Turns declined from a peak of 3.6x in 2000 to a lower 2.1x in 2008, before ranging from 2.4x-2.7x since.Embedded Expectations AnalysisAs investors, understanding what the market is embedding in the stock price in terms of expectations is paramount to making good decisions. Without understanding what the market is pricing in, it is impossible to claim that the market is wrong. We derive market expectations for the firm from valuations and historical performance trends, to give a clearer picture into what the market is projecting for the firm.CTSH is trading at a 14.9x Adjusted Value-to-Earnings (V/E') ratio, at the lower end of historical levels. At these levels, the market is pricing in expectations for a declining ROA', from 41% in 2015 to 25% in 2020, accompanied by 10%-15% Asset' growth.Analyst and Management Expectations and AlignmentAnalysts have bullish expectations relative to the market, expecting ROA' to remain relatively level, ranging from 39% this year to 43% in 2017, accompanied by 4% Asset' growth before potentially rising.Our qualitative analysis of the firm's Q2 2016 earnings call highlights that management appears concerned about the sustainability of revenue growth and reduced attrition rates. Additionally, they appear concerned about the sustainability of demand for their solutions and the potential of their life sciences segment. Based on these concerns, the market may have reasons for low expectations currently even as analysts are expecting better profitability.Peer AnalysisA major benefit of adjusting as-reported financial statements is to clear away accounting distortions, to allow for more accurate peer-to-peer comparisons. To this end we have included a scatter chart below, that plots CTSH against its peers based on their Adjusted Value-to-Assets ratio (V/A') and ROA'.Looking across industries, across markets and across time, there is a very strong relationship between a company's ROA' relative to the corporate average (6%) ROA', and the multiple the market will pay above the company's book adjusted Asset' base, in terms of Adjusted Enterprise Value relative to Assets (V/A' or Value to Assets'). A company that generates a 6% ROA' will tend to trade at a 1.0x V/A'. A company that generates a 18% ROA' will trade at a 3.0x V/A'.As we can see above, the market appears to be pricing CTSH appropriately based on its ROA'. There appears to be a trend of higher ROA' warranting higher V/A' among peers. While Accenture (NYSE:ACN) has a slightly higher ROA', it also trades at a slightly richer valuation. Meanwhile, for the same valuation level, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) delivers slightly less robust ROA' levels. Based on this view alone, it would appear that Infosys (NYSE:INFY) is undervalued, as it trades a slightly less expensive valuation for more robust ROA' levels.However, the market is not taking into account CTSH's much more aggressive growth rate. In the above chart, we've added each company's 5-year projected Asset' growth rate going forward, in table form at the side of the chart. At 13.4%, CTSH is growing at more than 2x the rate of its strongest growing competitors. While both ACN and INFY have higher ROA's, they have less than half the future growth rate. Moreover, another competitor, IBM, which trades at similar valuation levels for weaker ROA's, is expected to see material Asset' shrinkage in the coming years.Considering CTSH's ability to have peer-average ROA', but also have substantially stronger growth than peers, likely potentially even taking market share, trading at peer-average V/E' and V/A' in line with other peers levels (adjusted for ROA'), market expectations may be too pessimistic for the company.Valuation Matrix - ROA' and Asset' Growth as Drivers of ValuationWhen valuing a company, it is important to consider more than a singular target price, and instead the potential value of a firm at various levels of performance. The below matrix highlights potential prices for CTSH at various levels of profitability (in terms of ROA') and growth (Asset' growth). Prices that are in excess of 10% equity upside are highlighted in black, and prices representing an excess of 10% equity downside are highlighted in red. To see more about the below chart, and also to be able to input your own scenarios to understand how it impacts valuations, please click here.To justify current prices, CTSH would need to see ROA' fall to record lows at just 25%, well below their historical low of 32%, accompanied by 13% Asset' growth, which would be near historical lows for the firm. If the firm were to see ROA' fall to historical lows of 32%, accompanied by the aforementioned historically low Asset' growth levels, equity upside would be material.However, considering management's concerns about the sustainability of revenue growth and demand for their solutions, near-term equity upside may be limited. That said, considering low market expectations for the company relative to peers or relative to the company's historical execution, there may be longer-term equity upside.To find out more about Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. and how their performance and market expectations compare to peers, click here to access the open beta of the Valens Research database.Our Chief Investment Strategist, Joel Litman, chairs the Valens Equities and Credit Research Committees, which are responsible for this article along with the lead analyst, Caroline Cervillon.

4006947,21652,2016-09-19T03:23:46-04:00,Fabulous Value in a True Blue Chip: Cognizant Technologies (CTSH).Cognizant Technology has outperformed long-term.Fundamentals have never been better.,"By Paul Price[To receive timely trade ideas from us, take a free trial to our newsletter, click here to get started.]Not all highly regarded, proven winners are household names. A prime example of this is software solution firm Cognizant Technologies (NASDAQ:CTSH).The numbers for the decade ended last year are indicative of the company's spectacular run since coming public.Unsurprisingly CTSH shares have done exceptionally well over the long run, too, outperforming 85% of all stocks within Value Line's 1700 company main research universe.That fabulous growth was internally financed. The company's balance sheet is a thing of beauty. CTSH is cash-rich with no pension liability and no preferred shares. As of Mar. 31, 2016, the firm held more than $4.4 billion in cash versus total debt of just $1.02 billion.Cognizant is on pace for an all-time record year. 2016 estimates center on EPS of $3.35 - $3.37 per share, up from $3.06. Consensus views project further growth, to $3.70 in 2017. You'd think CTSH would be flying high and very expensive.In fact, as of Thursday Sep. 15, 2016, the shares were down by almost $16 from where they peaked last October.The Sep. 15 valuation is similar to the six previous best entry points (green-starred below) since the end of 2009. The stock is cheaper to buy today than it was at 2014's peak even though sales, cash flow, book value and EPS have all advanced substantially since then.At $53.10 per share, Cognizant's multiple is just 14.4x the current consensus 2017 estimate.Cognizant's average P/E since 2010 has been 21.1x. Its lowest average annual multiple since then was 18.8x. A rebound to even that low-end of the range on next year's projection supports a 12 - 18 month goal of about $70. That target is far from an upper limit.Don't just take my word for this. Independent research outfit Morningstar sees CTSH pretty much the same way. They assign it a 4-star (out of 5) buy rating while calling present-day fair value as $69 -- that's 30% above CTSH's Thursday morning's low of $52.91.Option writers (sellers) can collect terrific premiums for the Jan. 2018 expiration series puts at $55 or $60 strikes. I got filled at $10.40 on the more aggressive $60 choice, bringing my ""if exercised"" commitment price down to $49.60.Maximum profit would be keeping 100% of the $1,040 per contract received up front. The worst case scenario would force me to own CTSH at a net price that hasn't been available for even one day since 2014.Sale of the long-term $55 puts would reduce the break-even point to under $48.Cognizant has a history of sharp sell-offs followed by quick recoveries. It has rarely been available as reasonably valued as it is today.Buy the shares, sell some puts or consider some combination of the two techniques.Disclosure: Long CTSH shares, short CTSH Jan. 2018 puts."
4022289,98236,2016-11-10T20:16:43-05:00,Cognizant reported an in-line quarter and provided in-line guidance when it reported the results of its September ending quarter earlier this week.Shares fell a bit on Wednesday in reaction to the election of Donald Trump as president.I think the concern regarding the availability of H1-B visas under the new administration is likely overdone.The results and the guide provided a glimpse of a couple of pale green shoots that may see further evolution during the next call.The recent termination of Gordon Coburn and the issues regarding potentially illegal payments have not impeded the company's business and seem to be a total non-event.,"A man and his speechesOur president elect is not a quiet person and has given more than enough speeches and tweets and interviews during the course of what was an interminable campaign season to this writer. And some of the speeches had to do with trade and Mr. Trump's conception of trade as a zero-sum game.Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) does import a fair volume of services into this country although alternatives to what it and its brethren do are not readily determinable. During the course of the day after the election, many articles have been written about the impact of the president-elect on the economy, the stock market and various segments of the business world. I didn't want to get left out of the fun and in any event wanted to review the results of the Cognizant quarter that were announced earlier this week.I think that many readers have heard the president-elect talk about American jobs being shipped offshore. I won't get involved in that bit of over-simplification - I had thought that comparative advantage was a concept that might have been taught at Wharton where the president-elect matriculated -as it happens my own degree in economics is from the University of Pennsylvania and we had the same professors. But no matter.Cognizant has had more than its share of challenges thus far in 2016. Issues with demand and growth, a scandal, the mysterious disappearance of the company's long-serving COO have all been part of a year that could fairly be described as an annus horribilis. And now along has come Mr. Trump and his rhetoric about the loss of American jobs to overseas enterprises.Cognizant's shares reacted to Mr. Trump's electoral triumph by falling 3.4%. Shares of its rival Infosys (NYSE:INFY) lost 4.1%. While I have seen nothing specific that has been written about the threat the new administration might pose to the financial outlook for these companies, I assume that there must have been some commentary from some particular source that identified Cognizant and its competitors as vulnerable to the challenges of the incoming Trump administration.I would be surprised if Indian outsourcers are a major concern of Mr. Trump and his closest advisors. While in aggregate, Indian outsourcers employ millions of software professionals, who are Indians working in India. The sector includes hundreds of thousands of individuals who work for American firms. Many large financial services companies and others have extensive application development staff in India; almost all high-tech firms have development centers of one kind or the other in India, and so do IBM (NYSE:IBM), Accenture (NYSE:ACN), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE)/CSC. These days, Cognizant has US-based global delivery centers in Phoenix, St. Louis, New Jersey - its corporate headquarters - North Carolina, etc. It employs many thousands of Americans in these centers. The older concept of teams of Indian developers parachuting into a site, performing their assignment and leaving, while still existing in part, has been modified. I am not altogether certain that Cognizant as an overall entity subtracts from the number of US jobs - especially since many of its assignments would simply not get done if the costs were based on US labor rates.Overall, I do not see a Trump presidency as one that will attempt to place further limitations on the operations of a company like Cognizant through the restriction of H-1B visas. Indeed, a Trump administration may choose to address the deeply flawed and often avoided H-1B visa system. Mr. Trump's current wife, Melania, used an H-1B visa to gain entrance into this country.Further, there is the issue of what a Trump presidency is going to actually mean to the health insurance system. I think the odds on the Trump administration attempting to replace the ACA structure are very high as it is a signature issue of most Republicans. The question of what it will be replaced with is really not known and will not be known for months. Many owners of Cognizant shares and potential investors are aware that one major business issue faced by the company has been mergers amongst its client base in the health insurance industry. I think that the proposal by the president-elect that will allow insurance firms to offer their plans beyond state lines is likely to slow down merger incentives. It is something to think about - and not much more than that at this point. I do not think it will be a negative for Cognizant particularly, although who can really tell what it will mean for any vendor who sells IT solutions in a highly regulated industry that is going to be restructured - again.Finally, a Trump presidency is likely to see some relaxation from the draconian and really unbalanced policies of the current administration in terms of financial regulation. Cognizant has faced serious demand issues because of the issues of its financial services clients. An administration that decides to take a more balanced view toward financial regulations is going to help Cognizant's mainstream customers within the banking and insurance industries and will probably help demand for the company's services over the longer term.I obviously am not aware of all the issues that were preying on the minds of Cognizant's investors yesterday. What I do believe is that Cognizant as a business will not see much, if any negative impact from a Trump administration. Writing this Thursday morning, the shares are, in fact, rebounding, and I think investors ought to take advantage of a momentary lapse in judgment that precipitated noticeable under-performance in Cognizant's shares yesterday.Of all of the issues of a Trump presidency that do come to mind, the one that seems most likely to have an impact is the potential appreciation of the US dollar. The impact of stimulus that Mr. Trump has proposed in terms of both infrastructure and defense spending is not likely to be small. Faster GDP growth in the US is likely to put further pressure on the INR/USD exchange rate.Cognizant has far more service delivery capacity in India than is the case in the US - the effect of a strong dollar is to depreciate the INR allowing CTSH's margins to rise. While the initial spike in the dollar vs. the INR seems to have faded, the long-term prospect for rates would seem to be that some greater value for the dollar. I don't do exchange rates - there are many services that provide those forecasts - but that is what I see. And that is part of the story of Q3 results that were released on Monday.It's November - but perhaps CTSH saw some green shoots in its business!As some readers may recollect, it is not more than a few weeks (September 30th actually) since Cognizant replaced long-serving COO Gordon Coburn and announced an internal investigation regarding potentially improper payments made to facilities in India. I wrote an article back at that time to the effect that I felt that the overall impact of the executive change would not be great (Mr. Coburn was replaced by Rajeev Mehta who has run sales in the US for many years now and the kind of practices alluded to in the press release are very prevalent in India).Based on the commentary during the course of the earnings conference call, there is no real reason to expand on what I wrote at that point. The amount of money involved is relatively small, and the responsible executive was the company's long-serving CFO and then COO. It is probably unfair to saddle a single individual with all of the blame in a matter like that, but that is typical corporate practice. I just think, as I have written before, it will have no real impact on share valuation. For the record, Cognizant's performance in Q3 was probably a bit better than might have been feared, with revenue rising by 8% (2.5% sequentially), and EPS increased 13% year on year to a slightly better than forecast $.86. Headcount additions were substantial at 11,500, the same as the prior quarter.The company's forecast for the current quarter is for both top-line and EPS performance consistent with prior expectations although the top end of the revenue forecast was trimmed by $18 million to take account of the depreciation in the GBP. This quarter is often one that shows lower growth for Cognizant than other quarters during the year because of the Indian holiday of Diwali as well as our American holiday season which both impact billable hours. That factor is often forgotten by US-based analysts. At the least, the company didn't see any further deterioration in its business in the quarter.At the moment, Cognizant has been categorized as a 10% top-line growth company with no major expectation for material margin expansion. The valuation metrics for that scenario are very reasonable - certainly more so than at any other time in the company's history. There is, I believe, a reasonable case to be made that even at 10% growth, the shares are undervalued.How does Cognizant get back to a mid-teen growth rate performance?The question is far simpler to write than the answer. The first time I wrote about Cognizant in early January for this site I was asking if its 20% pullback at that time presented investors with a reasonable entry point. I had my doubts then.Both the passage of time and the continued underperformance of the shares have shaded those views. Cognizant's shares are down by 13% YTD, far underperforming the IGV software tech index which has risen by more than 9% over the period. The negative alpha that I wrote about then has taken place. I do not think there is more of it to come and it is time to focus on the ability of the company to overcome the headwinds in certain of its key business segments.The company's operational under-performance this year primarily relates to the lack of revenue growth in both its banking/financial services revenue, its largest vertical, which was up by 1.8% sequentially and 7% year on year, as well as its healthcare vertical, the second largest revenue segment, which rose 3.5% sequentially and 5.7% year on year. That 3.5% sequential growth is about the greenest shoot one can find in an analysis of the company's verticals. Those kinds of numbers in CTSH's key verticals are basically impossible headwinds for the company to overcome. Financial services represent 40% of revenue, and healthcare represents almost 30% of revenues. As they go, so goes Cognizant.At this point, the most positive thing that can be said is that the company will soon reach the anniversary of the start of the growth declines in these segments, which will result in far easier comparisons. But just having easier comparisons will not take the company's growth rate to the mid-teens. The fastest growing major segments of the Cognizant business are retail/manufacturing, up by 12% year on year and high tech up by 14%. Those are decent enough growth rates, but those are far smaller verticals than either financial services or healthcare.While the company has not been able to put together quarters of market share growth, it has never really suffered market share losses either and seems to be passing through the valley in terms of operating performance that it forecast for itself many months ago. The question is does the valley have a visible side, and if so, just how steep is that side and when do investors start seeing the side.It may be worth noting that the company's largest competitor, Tata Consultancy Services (OTCPK:TTNQY) is going through a nasty boardroom battle yesterday. In essence, the Tata family, which controls TCS, fired long-time chair Cyrus Mistry. Mr. Mistry has been replaced by Ishaat Hussain who has a background in finance and has been described as a Tata family loyalist. It is hard to know what, if any effect, the turmoil at TCS may have with regards to its competitive position in the market. It is certainly not bad news for CTSH.I would like to supply readers with some hard evidence regarding possible growth acceleration for this company. That really isn't possible based on the specifics of the earnings release or the conference call. For those who listened to call, I think it is fair to say that the lack of commentary wasn't because of any lack of attempt on the part of analysts. Management simply refused to forecast when the business dry spell would be over in financial services or in healthcare.Management on this conference call, as it has for some conference calls and conferences, wanted to focus attention on its ability to offer customers digital transformation capabilities. That is fine, but one needs to recognize that all of its competitors and most everyone who is responsible for selling solutions in the IT space are also focused on providing digital transformation. I believe that Cognizant has domain expertise in the field. But the problem for us as investors is, what are the specific deliverables implied by digital transformation and does Cognizant have a lead on its peers in developing specific domain expertise? As the saying goes, ""you can't take rhetoric to your butcher and trade it for a T-Bone."" Or a filet either come to that. For me, I think I would rather go to my wind merchant and fine a bottle of Krug to trade, but he is mean or my rhetoric is inadequate.Does Cognizant have differentiated capabilities with regards to digital solutions? That isn't an easy answer because the rhetoric about all things digital is so deafening in the trade press and amongst observers. I would be inclined to believe that all of the large competitors in the space read the same literature and basically follow the same playbook. Cognizant's digital capabilities are necessary, but not sufficient by themselves to lead to a growth recrudescence.One of the other examples of a Cognizant project during the conference call basically revolved around what many people might call the Internet of Things. Again, the problem isn't the concept. The IoT is a big category and use cases are multiplying almost daily it seems, but so too are the number of companies who want a piece of the space and are offering solutions. Cognizant can do IoT projects as was the case for this auto maker; so can its competitors and so can the clients themselves. What investors would like to hear is how Cognizant offers differentiated capabilities and how that is winning deals for the company. The conference call just held will get you nowhere nearer to that kind of data than you had before you listened.Cognizant, net of currency impacts, is making good progress to gain market share in Europe where its growth was well into double digits centered in Germany, the Nordics and the UK. That is a piece of returning to mid-teens growth. But again, Cognizant gets almost 80% of its revenues in North America. It will take a long while for growth outside of North America to really move the needle, and at the moment, reported growth is being depressed by currency movements.Can Cognizant enjoy market share gains going forward? I think it probably can, although the opportunity to gain market share against its Indian competitors has slackened. But Cognizant competes against IBM, Accenture, HPE/CSC and other companies for the same kind of work, and as it has evolved into an organization with more service delivery capabilities in the US, it has been able to secure more business against what used to be the home team. And while Indian wages have certainly escalated, so has the productivity of typical Indian outsourcing consultants, and the overall impact has produced favorable trends for Cognizant that have allowed it to maintain planned margins even with lower growth rates.As is typical on these calls, management did not really comment about changes in terms of the competitive landscape. Analysts can draw their own conclusions based on anecdotal checks and commentary of the other competitors in this space. My own checks suggest that at the margin, the company has perhaps seen a marginal uptick in its win ratios, and the closing of six strategic transactions in the quarter was considered strong performance relative to expectations. But I think that market share gains in the overall consulting/outsourcing space will add only marginally to growth rate and that gaining 100-200 bps of share per year is simply not enough to move the needle, overall.Do I have something clever and dispositive to say about the verticals that remain troublesome from a growth perspective for Cognizant? About all that I can offer is that these days, most large financial institutions and healthcare providers really have to compete in terms of their IT capabilities as much else is regulated and offers little real differentiation. Most of these organizations will need consulting help in migrating workloads to the web and in developing products that incorporate some kind of IT capability which will be the way they are able to compete.The amount of actual information on the conference call was remarkable by its sparseness. Will guidance and performance wind up being stronger in 2017 than this year? I think the odds favor that as the velocity of the headwinds - even based on the movement of workloads to the web - starts to abate.The most certain way that I know for growth to accelerate for Cognizant would be the use of its cash balances to acquire related consulting businesses that would materially benefit from the company's client relationships. The company has almost $5 billion in gross cash on its balance sheet with debt of $900 million. In May of this year, the company repatriated almost $3 billion of cash, about 40% coming to the US and the balance remaining offshore, but not in India.Cash flow continues to basically track net income and CFFO was $594 in the quarter compared to non-GAAP net income of $667 million. The company is using some of its cash flow to repurchase shares and outstanding shares dropped 4 million - less than 1% - year over year.The company has made six acquisitions thus far this year, but none of them have been particularly significant. The largest acquisition that Cognizant has made was that of TriZetto, which significantly increased the company's healthcare exposure. The acquisition of TriZetto significantly ramped the company's growth rate and investors seemed to be willing to pay for growth through acquisition. The ability to add application software to a consulting practice seemed to produce significant synergistic benefits for Cognizant.It is possible that the issues the company has dealt with in terms of its suspicious payments and the need to make an executive change have diverted management from focusing on more significant transactions. If that is the case, then it might be reasonable to anticipate that Cognizant will step up its acquisition activities and that it will be able to build up its growth rate during the course of 2017. I think that it is reasonable to believe that Cognizant will use its cash hoard for something significant - why else pay the horrible repatriation tax - and something significant would be an acquisition.Valuation and a bit moreCognizant's shares fell as low as $48 at the nadir when it initially announced the termination of Gordon Coburn and the investigation of a questionable payment. The shares have recovered somewhat and stand about 10% higher than they were at the end of September. At this point, the company has a market capitalization of $32.6 billion and an enterprise value of just less than $30 billion. That is an EV/S of 2.2X this year's expected revenues and 2X the sales projected for 2017. The P/E is 16X the results forecast this year. 14.4X the consensus EPS estimate for next year. The company should generate free cash flow for the year of about $2.2 billion, which would produce a free cash flow yield of more than 7% on enterprise value, which will probably rise to 8% next year.These metrics may not be the absolute most attractive valuation metrics in the world, but for a company that is the category leader and which should be able to resume double-digit growth next year, they represent a very attractive set of valuation metrics that compare favorably to those of most other enterprise IT enterprises. And the fact is that this company is a category leader although marginally smaller than Tata Consultancy Services. There should be plenty of positive alpha going forward."
3878646,98236,2016-02-09T12:09:09-05:00,Cognizant's earnings release embeds the slowest growth the company has seen in 14 years.Cognizant lost share based on sequential quarterly growth for the first time in more than a decade.Cognizant has forecast negative growth in Q1 because of uncertainty within the financial services vertical and merger related uncertainties in its healthcare vertical.The company will need to grow at 20% or more after Q1 in verticals outside of financial services to meet its targets for the full year.The company no longer seems to be able to count on market share gains to achieve growth in a market that may be subject to macro pressures.,"Introduction/Q4 ResultsCognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) released results for its fiscal Q4 on February 8th, 2016. As I expected in a report I published on the Seeking Alpha site, the company reported decent numbers for the quarter but was forced to guide down significantly, particularly for Q1 2016. The results themselves were pretty typical of Cognizant quarters. EPS was a couple of pennies above investor expectations, with revenue being just a bit below the consensus forecast. Operating margins at 19.6% were in the middle of the company's long-time range of 19%-20%. The company had a significantly stronger quarter in both Europe and particularly Asia/Pac than was the case in the US. Although revenue growth came in at planned levels, sequential growth at just 1.4% was not particularly ebullient even in the wake of the Diwali holidays in India, the Christmas/New Year's holidays in the US and Europe and whatever impact there may have been from the floods in Chennai. For the first time in many years - and perhaps longer than that - sequential growth for Cognizant was below that of its core competitors including IBM (NYSE:IBM), Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and of course Infosys (NYSE:INFY) and Wipro (NYSE:WIT). I think that this is a remarkable turn of events and one that bears some further consideration on the part of investors. For as long as this writer can remember CTSH has enjoyed a premium valuation in its space because it was taking market share from its competitors at a steady pace. Over the years it grew to become the second largest company in the space after TCS. There has been an aura and mystique surrounding CTSH that remained un-dented even during the hard times of the financial crisis and its impact on both CTSH and the industry as a whole. And now, to some extent unheralded, CTSH finds itself growing at average rates. Indeed, in this past quarter, sequential revenue growth was the lowest - although not by that much - of the large names in the space.The share price action in the wake of the earnings release was relatively muted - certainly by the standards of Tableau (NYSE:DATA) or LinikedIn (NYSE:LNKD). The shares fell by less than 8% which has to be considered a muted move in the recent environment. Cognizant is comfortably profitable, it has a pristine balance sheet and its valuation wasn't particularly crazy before the disappointing guidance - the stock market is still able to discriminate to a degree between risky and less risky bets.Guidance for both the company's Q1 and for the full year is somewhat below prior expectations but perhaps of equal significance the kind of growth being forecasted would be a material slowdown in terms of revenue performance vis-a-vis the company's principal competitors. Cognizant introduced a new style of giving guidance on its call on February 8th - it will now use ranges when providing guidance whereas heretofore it had used a single point minimum. Because we haven't any experience with Cognizant and the ranges it is now providing for guidance, it seems prudent to use the midpoint of those ranges although based on how Cognizant guided heretofore one might be justified in saying the low point of guidance is equivalent to the ""at least"" caption of prior earnings releases.But the fact is that Cognizant is now guiding to negative revenue growth in Q1 vs. a prior expectation that was 7% greater. Earnings, too, are below prior expectations. They are now forecasted to be $.78-$.80 for the period compared to a prior consensus of $.81. Full-year guidance represents 10%-14% growth. Prior expectations were about 280 basis points greater. The EPS mid-point also is a couple of percent below prior expectations.Explanations, Thoughts and MusingsThe company called out macro weakness and uncertainty as hobbling its forecast in the company's financial sector which is the company's second largest vertical after healthcare. Interestingly, financial services were not particularly slow for CTSH in Q4 and its competitors mainly cited financial services as a demand driver. Given the turmoil in the financial services world, my guess is that CTSH is far more likely to have been both correct and prudent in opining that its growth will be hobbled because of a slowdown in financial services.It also suggested that the uncertainties surrounding potential mergers in the healthcare space had lead and would continue to lead to some weakness in the outlook for the healthcare vertical at least during this quarter and perhaps Q2. Healthcare is now the company's largest vertical by a significant amount in the wake of the Trizetto acquisition. Management felt that the recovery of the healthcare vertical was quite likely as industry consolidation came to pass and transactions in which Cognizant has already been selected as the vendor of choice came to be executed. On the other hand, it suggested that it did not really see a material recovery in its financial services vertical for the balance of the year.Cognizant has always been a company that has forecast conservatively and I have no reason to believe that it has shed that conservatism in the new year. That being said, however, the math suggests that management is looking to see a quite extraordinary pickup in growth in the healthcare vertical, even just to achieve the mid-point of the revenue growth guidance. Without going through the math at a detailed level, if Cognizant starts the year off with no growth in Q1 but expects to end the year with 12% growth overall, while 25%-plus of the company's revenues remain flat at best, then the other 75% of revenues of which healthcare is more than half would have to grow by something like 20% or more in the last three quarters of 2016. The growth would actually have to be closer to 25% in healthcare depending on the exact results that are likely for Q2.Excluding the Trizetto merger, that is a level of growth that the company hasn't seen for at least the last 5-6 quarters and it certainly is a more aggressive forecast than that which Cognizant typically chooses to make.Cognizant is still having a difficult time in managing turnover which came to an annualized rate of 19% last quarter, down marginally from Q3 but still quite elevated. Again, if turnover remains elevated, it is going to be very hard for Cognizant to staff those whale size consulting jobs that it is forecasting if it's going to be able to close in the health are vertical later this year. Cognizant has made a point for many years of staffing its jobs with consultants with deep industry domain expertise. That expertise is typically a product of spending some time at the company's ""universities."" Hiring is expected to be muted in Q1 after hiring was barely positive rates in Q4. I just have to wonder how the company is going to staff what it describes as complex jobs in its healthcare vertical without more rapid hiring and training that will apparently take place over the next 120-plus days.Further it is going to be interesting for me to see if Cognizant manages to maintain its market share against newly revivified Infosys and a host of other competitors. The aura of invincibility that Cognizant once enjoyed seems to be tarnished these days and its competitive positioning no longer seems quite as invincible as had heretofore been the case. There is a certain disconnect, I believe, between the CEO's commentary at how new Cognizant hires marvel at their sense of freedom and autonomy, and the company's attrition rate, which continues to hold at close to 20%. It is hard for me to attempt to figure out why Cognizant's aura, or its mojo if you prefer, seems to be tattering at the edges, although it does seem likely that there has been a convergence between Cognizant and its competitors in terms of how industry participants price their jobs and manage their projects. Management made its characteristic comment that Cognizant competitors are being very aggressive in terms of pricing - there really are no signs of gross margin attrition among any of the major industry competitors that suggest any undue aggressive pricing.Cognizant has made a habit of attempting to guide conservatively and then raising its expectations as the quarters unfolded. There are doubtless going to be many observers who feel that this is exactly what is happening this time around. At this point, none of the analysts who cover the name have chosen to change their rating for the shares which remain at a highly bullish 1.7 with a mean price target of just below $75, or almost 40% above current prices. At the least, I think, it is inevitable that with the current guidance, there will be loads of price target changes, and it is possible that some analysts may temper their long standing love affair with this company in the wake of what is the slowest revenue growth guidance in 14 years which came during the trough of the dot com implosion.Cognizant shares are notionally not particularly expensive. They are just around 16X expected earnings for 2016 and the company. But for the first time in many years I think that the construction of the company's forecast is significantly riskier than has heretofore been the case and I think it is a leap of faith to believe that the non-financial services components of the company's business can achieve the 20%-plus growth targets that have animated the company's current forecast and will shortly be integral to the published earnings consensus. I think that the company's shares are more likely than not to be in the ""show me"" category until at least the end of Q2 when there might be some visibility as to the snap back the company is forecasting in its healthcare vertical.This company continues to generate lots of cash, almost $700 million last quarter which compares to about $500 million of non-GAAP net income. Running a profitable professional services business of some maturity is simply not very capital intensive. Capital expenditures for the quarter were only $74 million which will allow the company to repurchase shares at a good clip or consider paying a dividend. Overall, the company grew its cash balances by $1.5 billion last year and the company now has more than $4.5 billion in cash and equivalents, net of its revolving line of credit, far more than is necessary to operate the business from a day-to-day standpoint. That being said, however, in the short term, I expect that the company is going to try to use its surplus cash to make an acquisition such as Trizetto which was self-described by management as being ""more than expected."" If the company hopes to resume a strong growth pattern and to start to grow at above industry average growth rates, it is almost certainly most likely to achieve such a goal by buying specialized vendors that either expand the company's geographic footprint or more importantly allow the company to deepen its domain expertise in its leading verticals. I think one of the keys to potential stock performance going forward will be the company's ability to start to acquire significant pieces of technology that will enhance the competitive position of its intellectual property.ConclusionCognizant reported its earnings and while not a huge disappointment, certainly represented some disturbing trends in terms of the guidance it gave and the outlook for some of the company's verticals. Whatever else seems true, it does seem quite evident to this observer that the years stretching back a decade and more during which company regularly gained market share against its leading competitor have drawn to a close and may not return any time in the near future. That alone would be alarming to me as it suggests that over time there is likely to be a change in perception regarding the company that will lead to multiple compression.I think that for the first time in years the company has a forecast that is riskier than is likely to be perceived by many investors. I'm quite dubious that some of the whale size deals in the company's healthcare pipeline will get closed in time or staffed soon enough to produce the revenue growth snapback that the company is forecasting for the second half of 2016. This may be a year in which Cognizant simply struggles to achieve its mid-point goals and is unable to raise guidance. I think current analyst price targets are going to have to be substantially revised which is not going to set a favorable backdrop for share price appreciation. Given the company's relatively modest valuation and its pristine financial condition that is not likely to change any time soon, I think the shares have limited downside at this point. But I think investors might do better than to complacently buy this dip. There are names within the IT space with far greater snap back capability than CTSH - that is whenever we finally actually see a snapback that lasts more than a few hours."
3978573,74695,2016-05-30T11:46:54-04:00,Cognizant continues to impress in a rapidly evolving digital world.Cognizant will likely face some near-term growth issues as a result of macroeconomic headwinds.Cognizant's increasingly comprehensive approach should be a big differentiating factor for the company.,"Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) is set to capitalize on the growing trend of digitization in the business world. While competition in the IT/software sector is starting to ramp up dramatically, Cognizant is well prepared to take on competitive challenges. Cognizant's continual innovations and strong brand name should help the company maintain its momentum in an increasingly crowded industry.Businesses are in an unprecedented age of technological transformation. Cognizant is positioning itself as a premier provider of IT/software solutions for customers looking to gain an edge in the marketplace. Cognizant's increasingly integrated approach of bringing together ""strategy, technology, data science, experience design and industry expertise"" should help the company increase its presence moving forward.Growing Importance of IntegrationProficiency in the digital realm is becoming increasingly important for businesses and organizations. Given the growing complexity of the digital space, piecemeal digital solutions will likely become less and less effective for customers. Cognizant has clearly recognized this and is offering ""true enterprise-wide digital transformation"" through an interdisciplinary approach. Integrated IT and software solutions should become increasingly vital in the rapidly evolving digital world.Cognizant has already built a highly integrated platform called Digital Works, which aims to help customers undergo digital transformations. Just recently, Cognizant acquired a 49% stake in ReD Associates to further expand Digital Works. Cognizant's involvement in ReD Associates, which is a highly advanced human science consultancy, will help bolster Cognizant's already-integrated platform and give it even more customer appeal.Technology is only becoming more ubiquitous in the modern world, which means that businesses will have to continually adapt in order to survive. Cognizant's ongoing efforts at solutions integration should give the company a large advantage in the long run. While some of Cognizant's competitors are starting to imitate aspects of the company's approach, Cognizant is still ahead of the curve in many respects.Cognizant is combining many different aspects of IT to form a highly integrated platform.Source: CognizantForward Thinking ApproachCognizant is becoming a highly comprehensive solutions provider for its clients. The company aims to provide vital services for businesses' front, middle, and back offices, thereby making it an incredibly convenient IT/software solutions provider. By offering the entire package to customers, Cognizant is differentiating itself from the rest of the industry. Given the increasing sophistication of the technology realm, Cognizant's solutions should only grow more popular over the long term.The company is also leveraging new technology trends like IoT to further differentiate itself in arenas like life sciences. Moreover, Cognizant is continually looking to improve the efficiency and general infrastructures of its clients through new and innovative means. Despite the intense competition in IT, Cognizant is still clearly at the cutting edge of the industry. Cognizant will likely continue to outperform the general industry given the company's strong management team and forward thinking mindset.Growth ConcernsCognizant has long been one of the fastest growing companies in the IT services industry. Over the past few quarters, however, there has been a growing pessimism surrounding Cognizant's near-term future growth rate. In fact, the company appears to be preparing for a slowdown in the near term. Cognizant's latest earnings report reflects some of the company's growth issues. While the company's total revenue grew 10% YoY, it decreased .9% sequentially. Moreover, the company's Q2 revenue guidance of $3.34 billion-$3.4 billion and full-year guidance of $13.65 million-$14 billion is far lighter than expected.Many of Cognizant's major competitors like Infosys (NYSE:INFY) and Accenture (NYSE:ACN) will likely use Cognizant's current slowdown as an opportunity to reclaim some market share. Given the quality of Cognizant's competitors, the company will need to work hard to rebound on the growth front. Given the current troubles in healthcare and financial services, which are some of Cognizant's largest markets, Cognizant may have some near-term difficulties. In the long term, however, the company should still hold a growth advantage given its highly innovative approach.ConclusionDespite Cognizant's current growth issues, the company is still undervalued at its market capitalization of $38 billion. The company's cutting-edge approach should continue to drive demand in the long run. Given Cognizant's strong competitive position and the general growth potential of the IT/software solutions industry, the company has much more growth ahead. Cognizant is at the forefront of an increasingly technology-driven world and is doing a great job of capitalizing on emerging growth opportunities."
3805296,98236,2016-01-12T12:39:00-05:00,"Cognizant shares have declined 20% over the past two-plus months.The issue is one of long-term growth as the tide of cloud computing casts its shadow.CTSH will remain the class of its space due to the strategic advantages that its management has delivered.On the other hand, the company will have to adopt a far more aggressive acquisition strategy to bolster its growth.Cognizant has the financial resources to execute a reasonable acquisition strategy - the question has to do with management preferences.","Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) is one of the largest Indian IT service providers, ranking just below industry leader Tata Consultancy Services (OTCPK:TTNQY). The company is hardly unknown, and indeed, it has been the subject of no less than three articles that have been published by Seeking Alpha in the last six months. So what is the point in me trying to write about the name given that it's well known both potentially to Seeking Alpha subscribers and to the investment community as a whole? It's covered by no fewer than 24 analysts who have posted estimates for the current quarter.By far, the real question for investors to consider is for how long this company is going to be able to maintain growth at rates twice or more those if its principal competitors. Cognizant's growth has slowed in recent years. This year its growth, bolstered by the inclusion of acquisition TriZetto for a full year, is expected to be 21%. Next year's growth is expected to be in the range of 14% - very respectable for a services company of its size - over $12 billion in revenues this year and $14 billion next year.Cognizant shares are well loved by analysts these days. On the Thomson/First Call scale where 1.0 is the highest possible ranking and 5.0 the lowest, CTSH shares are rated 1.7. Analysts are looking for an average share price appreciation of about 36% over the next 12 months, which would take the shares to $75. Again, just looking at the consensus estimates, that would value the company at a P/E of a bit greater than 21X with an EV/S of just a hair over 3X. Those kinds of valuations probably make sense if the company can really grow at 14% on both the top and the bottom line for several years. I have strong doubts if that can be accomplished organically as I detail below. It could be accomplished through acquisition, but that is hardly a given. I don't think that Cognizant is a troubled company or dramatically overvalued. I do think it will be difficult for the company to sustain 14% organic growth going forward and that this will make the consensus analyst price targets very hard to achieve.Cognizant is and will remain primarily a services company for the foreseeable future. Its growth is almost entirely a function of billable hours and its base of employees who can generate those billable hours. At the end of last year (2014), Cognizant had something like 211,000 employees, up by 40,000 in the wake of the acquisition of TriZetto and an Australian-based outsourcing firm. In order to have grown 21% this past year, the company still will have had to hire another 30,000 net employees and it will have to hire another 30,000-plus employees to keep up the growth in 2016. It's simply very daunting to be able to find and hire 30,000 net new consultants each year. It probably means that the company has to find something like 50,000-60,000 gross new consultants given the company's industry average turnover. All the new hires, regardless of where they are from, have to be taught the Cognizant culture and methodology. If the company simply wanted to continue to sustain a 14% growth rate, it would obviously have to hire an increasing number of people every year and just the physical logistics of trying to do that are daunting to say the least.This writer visited the campus of one of Cognizant's ""Academies"" in the Indian city of Pune not so long ago. The campus is ultra-modern, high tech and almost impossible to navigate on foot - it is that large. And the dormitories in which the students are housed, three and four to a room because of space constraints, seemingly go on for the length of several football fields. And Pune is just one of Cognizant's significant facilities in India - it has major delivery centers in Gurgaon near Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Chennai - all of which have their own academies.In all, Cognizant has no fewer than 10 major service delivery centers in India and with the exception of the one in Mumbai (Bombay) they are vast, to say the least. Even with modern work sharing technology, it is desirable to move consultants and managers from one location to the other from time to time. India is a country that is still developing its infrastructure. Air transport is far more difficult than it is in this country, and as for road and rail facilities, they need work. Just attempting to manage the logistics of moving a significant cohort of a work force that is now almost a quarter of a million people and still has to grow at double-digit rates around a country as India is today is going to tax any management severely. It's simply not enough to say that because Cognizant has pulled it off up to now it will be to continue to do so.A corollary question that many investors might be concerned with is the impact of the cloud. Notionally cloud solutions, if they are real cloud as opposed to hosted or subscription models, include a services layer to go along with the packaged software. Not to be too simplistic but that is the reason the offering is called Software as a Service. If say, SAP (NYSE:SAP) sells a user an integrated suite of solutions based on its SaaS cloud offering, where is the space for Cognizant, or for that matter any of its other competitors, to sell additional services?Of course, there are arguments that Cognizant could expand the number of verticals it addresses. It's indeed trying to do just that at the moment by its focus on such verticals as manufacturing, transportation and logistics. I think that CTSH is likely to enjoy reasonable success in its push into new verticals. But I wonder if the new verticals offer the huge opportunities that Cognizant has enjoyed in healthcare, banking and insurance which typically are exceptionally IT dependent.The other significant question to address is the ability the company has to continue to achieve almost 40% non-GAAP gross margins and very close to 19% non-GAAP operating margins. IT services are notionally a highly competitive, price sensitive market, and yet, Cognizant delivers stable margins year after year almost in spite of the environment or exogenous factors such as exchange rate volatility. Indeed, I believe that one of the major factors that has underpinned margin stability for this company and its other Indian-based competitors is the more or less continuous depreciation of the Indian Rupee (NYSEARCA:INR) as long ago as 2008.As I indicated above, most of the analysts who cover the company already like it. The virtues of this company are not under-recognized by the coverage universe and by investors. It is difficult to make money, I believe, when something such as the virtuosity of a company is already recognized and almost taken for a given while its risks and warts are not well understood or recognized.All of that being said, I do think that there is a kind of case that can be made for the company's shares. I certainly wouldn't think that it is one of the most likely scenarios in the investment universe. On the other hand, this is one of the more resourceful and skilled management groups in the tech space. And if anyone can actually snatch victory from the jaws of slowing growth in this group, this would be the team on whom to bet, I believe.Summarizing Cognizant's advantage in just a phrase I would say that unique amongst its competitors, this management is willing to think long term and is not addicted to short-term profit maximization. Now, of course, every single competitor in this space including Accenture (NYSE:ACN), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Infosys (NYSE:INFY), Tata and many other industry participants say that they take a long-term view of operations, but most users would disagree.I think one of the things that distinguishes what Cognizant does from its peers is its deep domain expertise. Potential customers obviously want to know what kinds of consultants are going to staff the project team that will develop the solution that they want built. What CTSH offers that competitors do not is that its project teams are typically staffed with consultants who have deep knowledge of the industry in which prospective clients operate. To pick a typical example, it's really difficult to build a teller system for a US retail bank if one does not have significant knowledge of how US retail banks interface with their customers. When I wrote about Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN), I briefly mentioned the ability of the company to implement complex voice interface systems better than most other industry participants because it understands the technology better than anyone else.In the sectors in which Cognizant competes, i.e. financial services, healthcare, and manufacturing/retail/logistics, CTSH is able to staff client teams with deep domain expertise to an extent unmatched by its competitors. It might seem a simple strategy to replicate, but Cognizant's competitors seem unwilling to pay the costs in terms of margin that CTSH has been willing to accept. Developing deep domain expertise is far more complicated than it sounds; not only does an organization have to train its consultants as experts in a single practice, but also doing so forces the organization to forego the benefits of flexibly staffing project teams and forces Cognizant to keep a deeper bench and to have lower utilization rates than would otherwise be the case. Users understand this and are willing, to a degree, to pay a premium to get a client team that actually has a realistic chance of being able to complete what it has committed to do.Another thing, the basic policy that Cognizant espouses is to allow its onsite management staff to make on-site decisions. I'm sure there are exceptions that prove the rule, but in general, the company's managing partners, which essentially are on-site at their clients, apparently have the authority to get more consultants to maintain a job schedule or to negotiate changes in project specifications and deadlines. From what I can tell, it means an enormous amount to a CIO to understand that the man or woman looking from the other side of the table has both the responsibility and the authority to make things happen.Typically, in the kind of tense negotiations that inevitably plague large IT projects, decisions have to go back to India for ratification. But because CTSH's management thinks long term, and is willing to pay the price for that thinking, users know that their issues are going to get resolved on the spot in a few hours and not in weeks. As a corollary to on-site empowerment, it appears to be the case that Cognizant is far less likely than its competitors to use inevitable project modifications to wring substantial extra charges from its clients. On site, empowered client managers simply are less likely than their peers are at companies such Infosys, Tata and Wipro (NYSE:WIT) to let projects spin out of control and wind up looking as though the client made the wrong decision to outsource to India.So, it is my belief that Cognizant will continue to enjoy the best reputation in the industry and it will continue to win an outsized proportion of available opportunities. That being said, nonetheless, the issues of the cloud and the sheer size of this company are not easy problems to solve. To me, the obvious answer is that this company is simply going to have to expand further into packaged software and become a one-stop shop from which its clients can purchase fully implemented cloud solutions, hosted solutions and on-premise solutions as well as the traditional consultant-based services that it has sold. And most of that transformation is going to have to come from acquisitions.2014 represented a significant break with the company's past; it bought a packaged software vendor in the healthcare space called TriZetto. As a result, its net employee count was able to expand by 40,000 last year. It still had to hire another 20,000-plus net new heads while absorbing another 15,000-20,000 new heads from TriZetto as well as the new heads that came with its acquisition of Odecee in Australia.The company has about $4 billion of cash, debt of just below $1 billion, and operating cash flow of about $2 billion this year. Capex, primarily for facilities and computer equipment, is running at around $300 million/year or thereabouts. The company has been repurchasing shares and paying down its debt at a significant pace - at least in the past two quarters - but it is certainly able to afford the purchase of smaller non-public cloud software companies within its target verticals. The company has apparently lost out on the race to acquire Perot Systems which is to be sold by Dell in order to partially finance its acquisition of EMC (NYSE:EMC) although the source for that indicates that the situation is still ""fluid."" From my perspective, while buying Perot would surely be accretive for a company structured like Cognizant, I would like to see it use its resources to buy smaller private cloud providers that exist in great numbers and will apparently have a much harder time than heretofore in achieving outstanding valuations through the IPO window.It is important for investors to realize that Cognizant's growth has already slowed sharply and that the slowed pace of growth has continued on through to the present if one looks at quarterly as opposed to annual growth patterns. While the September quarter was one that beat expectations, sequential growth in the period was 3.3%, which is consistent with about 14% annual growth. Sequential growth in Q4, hobbled as it was by Diwali (The Indian Festival of Lights) and Christmas which significantly impacted billable hours is expected to be just 1.2%.It is hard to remember now, but in August 2014, the company revised its growth expectations down to 14% compared to its prior forecast of 16.5%. The downshifted forecast was a very rare misstep for this company, but one which probably suggested that it was reaching some kind of growth limits in its current form. Cognizant's management has been incredibly diligent in insuring that it met quarterly targets and it has been willing to cut guidance proactively in order to avoid a quarterly miss. I have little doubt that Cognizant will meet or exceed current consensus estimates for this quarter when it reports in a couple of weeks. I have to wonder, however, if it will be able to continue to support a 14% growth target throughout the course of 2016. I think it is going to be a very close run effort if it does happen, and I would find it more difficult to believe that growth expectations won't have to come down, absent acquisitions, for 2017.Over the years, the company has made more than 20 acquisitions of various sizes, but most of these have essentially added to the company's portfolio of IT services in different verticals. By far, the most financially significant acquisition was that of TriZetto in September 2014 for $2.7 billion. While the acquisition must have been at a very healthy multiple of revenues and apparently something like 14X EBITDA (TriZetto was private and so the exact numbers are not really known), the key to understanding what was going on is the expectation that there are $1.5 billion of revenue synergies to be had over five years. Frankly, it is that kind of thinking that is going to have to animate much of Cognizant's strategy going forward. TriZetto was a company that had a portfolio of packaged software in the healthcare area where it primarily served Blue Cross plans, a space that has been a particular focus for Cognizant for many years. Healthcare as a vertical had been running at over 25% of revenues before the acquisition and that has now increased by more than 300-plus basis points to almost 30% of revenues. If CTSH expects to grow at rates near to 20% or even to sustain 14% growth rates for both top line and EPS for a few more years, there are clearly going to be more than a few TriZetto-style acquisitions in its future.One reason why analysts love CTSH is that over the years it has proved to be one of the most reliably predictable companies in the IT space; when it misses, it tends to miss by revising guidance and not blowing up in the face of analyst expectations. While I would be shocked to see the company miss current quarterly expectations, I would be far less shocked to see it lower guidance at some point during the course of 2016 absent some significant acquisition, something that is really impossible to forecast. The shares are quite reasonably valued based on consensus expectations for 2016. Indeed, with a forward P/E of about 16X and an EV/S of just a bit over 2.2, the shares seem cheap if 14% growth can be sustained. But I think the risks are weighted to the downside of that bet absent an acquisition. And while the share price downside in the wake of the recent 20% share price contraction is probably not overwhelming, the heady price targets embedded in analyst forecasts seem to me to be based on a set of highly optimistic assumptions. Cognizant remains the class of the Indian IT outsourcing space. But I think investors would do well to consider other spaces at least during 2016."
3784566,74695,2015-12-31T05:22:34-05:00,"Cognizant is strengthening its foothold in the hugely promising IT/software service industry.
        Cognizant should be able to take advantage of emerging market opportunities given its diversified model and heavy involvement in promising new technologies.
        The massive opportunity in the IT/software service sector will likely attract tougher competition for Cognizant moving forward.","Proficiency in the digital space is becoming a greater necessity for enterprises of all types. Given the continual advancements being made in computing technologies and the growing interconnectivity on the digital front, the IT service industry will likely continue to grow at a rapid rate. Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) has been one of the best performing IT and general software service companies over the past decade, growing approximately fivefold in market value during this time.The trend towards digitization in the business world will likely continue to drive Cognizant. With demand for IT and software technology services continuing to grow in nearly all the major markets, Cognizant is extremely well-positioned. Given the productivity and efficiency gains to be had by utilizing IT/software services, Cognizant will likely become increasingly vital among enterprises of all types. Cognizant's scope of offerings, innovative approach, and dominance in emerging industries should continue to propel the company's growth moving forward.Large Scope of OfferingsCognizant is a giant in the IT/software services sector and has a large presence in many major markets. The company offers services such as analytics, consulting, supply chain management, human capital management, and the list goes on. In addition, Cognizant also sells a diversified selection of products and platforms like ModelEye, Cloud360, LifeEngage, etc. Not surprisingly, Cognizant's IT/software business extends across a wide spectrum of industries, from banking all the way to retail.As nearly all major industries are starting to require a larger and more effective presence on the digital front, Cognizant is smart to continue innovating on a wide array IT services/products. Despite Cognizant's large size, the company is still growing at a fairly rapid rate. In fact, the company grew 23.5% YOY in Q3 with a revenue of $3.19 billion, of which was somewhat evenly split among technology services and consulting.Cognizant's consulting business is particularly promising as a growing number of customers are making large transitions from an IT/technology standpoint. Such business transformations usually require a great deal of assistance on the consulting end, putting Cognizant at a competitive advantage given its highly developed consulting sector. With massive industries like finance and healthcare integrating IT/software technologies and a record pace, demand for Cognizant's services/products will likely remain strong moving forward.Strong Presence in Emerging IndustriesCognizant's high exposure to the emerging markets has played and will continue to play a big role in the company's robust growth. With the emergence of the Internet of Things phenomenon, Cognizant has been able to take advantage of an entirely new growth opportunity. In fact, Cognizant is currently helping a packaging equipment manufacturer integrate Internet of Things technologies like sensors in order to increase connectivity, optimize efficiency and increase productivity. Cognizant is also gaining traction in other emerging industries such as robotic process automation and will likely continue to maintain a strong presence in such promising arenas.As emerging technologies continue to help push enterprises towards increased digitization/connectivity, Cognizant's momentum should remain strong for the foreseeable future. Given that such technologies are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, Cognizant's geographical footprint should also grow. Much of Cognizant's Q3 growth occurred outside the company's traditional markets, i.e. North America and Europe. In fact, Cognizant experienced 31% YOY growth in the ROW (rest of world), with Asia in particular showing massive promise.ChallengesCompetition is more fierce than ever in the IT/software service industry. With technology giants like IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) getting more involved in this space, Cognizant is clearly in one of the more competitive industries. Given the enormous opportunities in this industry, competition will likely only intensify moving forward. Fortunately for Cognizant, the company already has an incredibly strong foothold in the most promising markets, putting it in a good competitive position even against technology giants like IBM. What's more, the company's strategy of sourcing talent from countries like India should continue to give it a cost advantage moving forward.Much of Cognizant's operations are located in India, which gives the company many advantages on the cost front.Source: BloombergCognizant is also facing an issue of high attrition rates among its employees, which the company itself admitted was a problem given its ""unparalleled career opportunities"" and ""overall growth rate."" While Cognizant's employee growth rate could certainly improve, the company's attrition rate is still on par with that of the general industry. Cognizant is also starting to put more emphasis on bringing down its attrition rate in order to maintain its competitive position.ConclusionAt a market capitalization of $37 billion and a forward P/E ratio of 17, Cognizant still has more upside given its robust demand and large market share. Since 2010, the company has more than doubled its annual revenue and looks to continue this upward growth trajectory. Given Cognizant's leading position within the IT/software service sector, the company should also be able to capitalize on emerging market opportunities in this industry."
4000089,98236,2016-08-16T23:40:07-04:00,"Cognizant's results for Q2, received a few days ago were in line with reduced expectations.The company reduced its full-year expectations for revenue once again partially because of the depreciation of the pound, but more tellingly because of weakness in demand across most categories.The company is developing a significantly new growth paradigm based on its becoming a serial acquirer.The company repatriated a large cash balance from India to both the US and elsewhere to fund additional acquisitions.Most of these smaller acquisitions that have financial justification based on significant revenue synergies and on the ability Cognizant has to bring new revenues within its historic operating model.","Cognizant - Sowing the seeds for a new model of the IT outsourcing leaderI do believe that the recent share price pullback that Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) experienced in the wake of another revenue guidedown affords investors an opportunity to acquire shares in a company in the midst of an under-recognized transition. For reasons that I express below, I have my doubts that Cognizant can either grow its market share organically, that the market itself is simply in a transitory rough patch or that user budgets will soon return to traditional patterns. But none of that means that CTSH cannot be a worthwhile investment that generates positive alpha or that the company cannot increase its growth rate.There is a concept used by many researchers into the fields of brain and organism efficiency that is called plasticity. I do not purport to be an expert on the subject which is one that is attracting much attention these days, but companies as well as people almost by definition, must do what they need to do to maximize their plasticity. Companies that are successful at doing so will be winners and belong in the portfolio of investors. Companies that for a variety of reasons simply lack DNA that embodies plasticity will be lucky to survive and will do so in truncated form.Remember the Ford (NYSE:F) Model T. Neither do I - but I have read about it as both an icon and as many types of business case study. In some ways, the Model T, available only in black after 1913 was the most popular iconic American consumer product ever built. It dominated the American market for automobiles, just as and some would say because of the model T, the market for automobiles opened to become the iconic consumer product of the last century. I wrote an article recently about how Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) rising sales were noticeable as a driver of overall retail sales in the past couple of quarters. Ford's Model T, with 16.5 million sold between 1908 and 1927, had an even greater impact on the course of American economic growth in its era. And its spin-off impacts including the $5/day wage, the popularization of the assembly line and its diverse application, were even more numerous than the spin-offs of Law & Order. Overall, Ford built more than 15 million of its cars in this country, the equivalent, adjusted for the population of that era, of more than 50 million vehicles.But eventually, the car that built Ford was scrapped for the Model A. There was lot of plasticity in that decision as the Model T was still selling in significant quantities in the spring of 1927 and the costs of shutting down Ford and then total retooling and launching an entirely new vehicle were extraordinary by the standards of the day. The Model T remains as the only consumer product whose withdrawal actually depressed GDP noticeably and led to a minor recession. About the closest analog we have these days is the biennial Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone upgrades. Apple and its phones are written about as the iconic company and the iconic products of this age, and perhaps they are to some, but the impact of new models is almost imperceptible in overall GDP statistics. To appropriate and mangle a phrase, ""as the model T went, so went the nation"" during its heyday just prior to and after World War I.Hopefully, readers have had a bit of patience till now in my hangnail description of the Model T and its impacts, which were far greater than I can describe in such a limited space. But this is an article about Cognizant and its transformation and its plasticity, which is every bit as far reaching, while far more complex to describe and to see than the transformation of Ford at the end of the 1920s.For many years, Cognizant had a business model that was as successful as that of the Model T. Without entering buzzword heaven where the special promotional phrases for the CTSH are still stored, the fact is that the company was a financial machine producing quarter after quarter of upside results, some larger than others but inevitably outgrowing the major competition on an almost continuous basis. Tour India today and in the many of the major cities the impact of the CTSH phenomenon is visible upon the landscape. But just as the model T eventually reached obsolescence so has the CTSH business model. And just like the Ford Motor transformation eventually laid the blueprint for a new and successful company that emerged in the wake of the Great Depression, I am inclined to believe that CTSH has planted the initial seeds of its own equally far reaching transformation whose final result is but dimly perceived at the current time.For those wanting this writer to cut to the chase - I recommend buying CTSH at these levels with some suggestion that like most transitions, this one will not take place overnight and there are likely to be bumps in the road. I do not think the shares are going to immediately turn around and outperform. There are some who might suggest that the Cognizant's chart over the past several months is not a thing of beauty although so far this last low is higher than the previous low set during the Brexit set back. (The company has a significant revenue stream from the UK and part of its guidance reduction with this latest revenue forecast is tied to both declines in the value of the GBP as well as demand pullbacks from UK financial institutions.). But the valuation has gotten to a point that the shares have taken on some of the characteristics of a value name. I believe that the shares are at levels where they can start to produce significant positive alpha and are thus worth buying now with some expectation that some patience may be required.What's the matter with the old CTSH?More or less the same kinds of things that were ailing the Model T at the end of its run in the mid-1920s. Of course, Cognizant is not trying to compete against alternative vehicles with multiple paint colors, smoother transmission, stronger engines and a few other creature comforts of the era. It does have to compete against several factors that are new to the IT world and have upset the growth calculus. It would be a mistake, I believe, to try to hold a debate, in absentia so to speak, with the management that runs Cognizant. And so far as it goes, I will simply copy the assertions of company management and my riposte and let readers draw their own conclusions. If it sounds as though I am setting up a straw man, that is exactly what I am trying to do. The Cognizant that has been needs to be understood a bit in order to identify the changes and the prospects of the new company that is emerging, I believe.Gordon Coburn is the President of Cognizant and has held executive positions at the company for many years. He is bright, articulate, but I think he has blinders on. Here is a bit of what he talked about on the recent conference call:All of that is really the old Cognizant on steroids with some menu of performance enhancing drugs offered as lagniappe. I do not mean to be harsh, but those kinds of prepared remarks do little to acquaint investors with the changes the company needs to make and is starting to make in order to overcome the current set of headwinds. The comments are all platitudes, buzzword compliant and feel good stuff and it no longer works in the real market. Why doesn't it work? Well if you say the same thing over and over again, and it surrounds your company with a successful aura, the platitudes get copied and rewritten and get spun out by all of your competitors. The key here is that the old Cognizant could count on consistent and palpable market share gains just the way the Model T took share from almost everything else that drove on 4 wheels.The new Cognizant, for a variety of reasons, is finding that part of its old mantra impossible to maintain. Why do I say that? Pretty simple this last quarter, while consistent with prior guidance was consistent with guidance that had previously been marked down substantially the quarter before and it featured guidance that was marked down some more for Q3, the balance of 2016 and perhaps for 2017 as well although there were no specifics provided. But the guidedowns leave the company in the invidious position as guiding revenue growth to levels comparable with the percentages of revenue growth currently expected for Infosys (NYSE:INFY) (11%) and Wipro (NYSE:WIT) (8%).It would be tedious to go through the numbers, and the guidedowns are not staggering and relate more to revenue than to earnings. The revenue guidedown specifically calls for a new expectation of $13.55 billion compared to a prior expectation of about $13.8 billion.Why is this happening? Mr. Coburn says that:I don't doubt that some of this is true in whole or in part, but Cognizant is suggesting that the entire demand outlook for what it does has seen massively slowing percentage growth which has fallen from about 20% to about 10% when compared to results of the past several years.Have banks really given up trying to distinguish their offerings by giving up on digital transformations? I doubt it. Can a couple of health care mergers really upset the likely growth of the entire market for healthcare IT. Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN), as I pointed out yesterday, is not seeing that trend at all. (Yes, I know Cerner sells to hospitals rather than health insurance providers for the most part, but surely given its size in the space, it would likely have noticed something?) And what about other companies outside of health care and banking moderating their spending? It seems an eon ago at this point, that IBM (NYSE:IBM) actually reported its first quarter of flat bookings in IT services compared to many quarters of negative growth. Of course, Infosys had a mixed quarter, in which results grew less than anticipated and part of the short fall was in its life sciences package. WIT, on the other hand, had a relatively strong quarter in terms of its growth. I think that the point is that the June ending quarter saw no real slowdown that was consistent across companies. It simply appears as though the space is growing in mid to high single digits overall, and CTSH is growing slightly faster than that.What do I think is happening? I wrote about Cognizant in an article published by SA on February 9th of this year. My thesis then was that the company was being pressured by the massive trend of its customers to cloud-based applications coupled with its inability to maintain competitive differentiation. I think those trends are still true regardless of the efforts of company management to talk around them. For many years, the company had a service delivery strategy that gave its users better results than they were able to get from the other larger non-specialized Indian resources such as Infosys and Wipro. I do not feel the need to reprise the discussion other than to comment that there has been a fair amount of convergence in recent years, and I think it would be far harder to make the case prospectively that users believe they will get a better business result using CTSH as compared to its large Indian competitors.The other trend that I see happening is the diversion of resources by CTSH customers and prospects away from in-house projects and toward provisioning of cloud infrastructure. Banks have been relatively slow to embrace the cloud because of issues regarding security and specific compliance mandates. But with the emergence of the hybrid cloud as a popular way to achieve some of the benefits of cloud architecture while retaining some control, banks are now starting to migrate their workloads to the cloud. They have to remain cost competitive in IT. But their hesitancy simply means that there is lots of stored-up demand to move many workloads to different cloud formats and typically CTSH doesn't play a major role in that kind of effort.It isn't particularly surprising that with lots of competitive convergence in IT outsourcing, and with the start of major transfers of funding from using Indian outsourcing resources to build new application to spending resources, to funding to acquire cloud infrastructure coupled with acquiring new services based on the SaaS delivery models, that what is left over to spend on services from companies like CTSH is showing slowing growth. That seems to be the case in banking, the case in health services and the case in many other verticals. I really do not see many changes in these trends coming in the near future. The current CTSH is enjoying a less than stellar middle age in which its growth is hedged competitively as its service delivery model and its unique capabilities are copied and in which its ability to capture from revenues from the newest trends in IT is also quite circumscribed.What is the new Cognizant?We don't exactly know the parameters of the new Cognizant because it is still being born. Part of the Q2 earnings release was the news that Cognizant had decided to repatriate a total of $2.8 billion from India to entities located in the US and in the rest of the world. The company elected to pay an extra $238 million of income taxes in the US to make the transfer.The purpose of the transfer is to fund potential acquisitions of related businesses that can either be developed as major entities or can be tucked into the mainline Cognizant service offerings.Cognizant had cash balances of approximately $4.5 billion at the end of June and long-term debt of $840 million. The requirements for operating cash flow for a company like this are small and most of those requirements will be met by depreciation. The IT Services business is not very capital intensive. So, operating cash flow is going to be more or less consistent with net income, and free cash flow ought to be very close in aggregate to operating cash flow. Overall net income is running at a rate of $2 billion/year which is more or less consistent with my expectation for free cash flow.The other prong of the new Cognizant is its strategy of limiting internal growth to about $1.5 billion/year. $1.5 billion/year is probably more aggressive a level than can be long sustained. It would represent organic growth of around 10% at currently expected revenue levels and that will likely soon be the top of a broad range of organic growth.The new Cognizant is going to be built on a strategy of becoming an industry consolidator of a significant order and at a level far stepped-up beyond what has been done in the recent past. About 2 years ago, Cognizant acquired a company called Trizetto for $2.7 billion. Trizetto was bought for 4X revenues, notionally, but was expected to generate another $1.5 billion in revenue synergies after it was acquired, so the EV/S ratio probably has turned out to be lower than that of Cognizant as it was before the acquisition. Earlier this year, Cognizant bought KBACE which had been a tiny player (400 consultants out of more than 230,000 employed by Cognizant these days). KBACE does implementation work for Oracle Cloud applications. It has also recently bought Idea Couture, Heliocentric, Quick Left, ReD Associates and Storebrand Baltic. None of these is a giant company and most of them are probably adding $50 million or less to annual CTSH revenues. The acquisitions put Cognizant into new fields such as building capabilities that encompass behavioral insight, strategy and design. Most of these acquisitions can be seen as the creation of new classes of solutions that have the potential to create significant revenue synergies for the company.The growth recipe for the new Cognizant is to become a disciplined competitor in terms of its traditional practices that doesn't expect to achieve the kind of rapid growth that was a hallmark of the recent past. The new Cognizant will be more like a company that provides seed money to a large stable of small start-ups, many of whom have existing relationships with each other and with CTSH and who need access to the distribution and deep pockets that will be necessary for them to achieve rapid growth. In the last 10 months, Cognizant has acquired 6 small firms of various sizes and shapes and in the wake of the repatriation announcement, it seems sure to maintain or even increase the pace. It is a very different growth model than heretofore but one that has the opportunity of not trying to fight all of the strong headwinds that are blowing in the traditional IT outsourcing space.ValuationA few years ago, Cognizant had valuation metrics consistent with those that investors now pay for cloud companies. How the world changes. In the wake of the estimate revisions the company has just provided, and the fall in the share price, the company now has an enterprise value of $31.6 billion. So far this year, the shares have contracted by 5% compared to the IGV that has appreciated 7% over the same period. Since the time that I published my initial article, Cognizant shares are up 9.5% while the IGV gas appreciated by 33% over that same time. CTSH shares have contracted by 16% since making an all-time high last October.With those kinds of share price metrics, there is probably some reasonable runway if the company can start to show how its new strategy can deliver growth along with consistent operating margins. Overall, EV/S for Cognizant is calculated to be less than 2.3X on consensus revenue estimates for this year and to be at 2.1X based on consensus revenue growth of 10.7% forecast in 2017.The P/E of 17X is perhaps at the lowest levels this decade or even since Cognizant was a Y2K remediation vendor. The P/E on next year's earnings consensus is down to 15.4X. Not quite deep value the way many analysts look at those things, but pretty darn close.Cognizant's press releases do not even carry cash flow data as that is not a significant consideration in evaluating this company. As mentioned earlier, CTSH cash flow is going to be broadly consistent with net income and that was the case in 2013-14. It was considerably greater than net income last year because of significant increases in liabilities.So far this year, operating cash flow is trailing reported earnings because of a major pay down in liabilities during Q1. Based on guidance and current relationships, the EPS for the back half of the year is going to be around $1.78. Presumably, after trending out the values for the first two quarters of the year, $1.78 is going to yield cash flow of $1,100 million for the period and free cash flow of $960 million, or free cash flow for the year of $1.35 billion and would represent a free cash flow yield of 4.3%. Based on 2017 estimates, and assuming no major changes to assets or liabilities in terms of relationships, free cash flow would be close to $2 billion which would produce a free cash flow yield of 6.3%. These are very reasonable valuation metrics it seems to me for a company producing double-digit revenue growth that is slightly exceeded by EPS as outstanding shares decline.Summing up the news and the investment thesis!Cognizant is cheap and that is a surprise to many, I think. It has run out of growth steam doing what it has been doing. It is now embarked on a strategy of identifying and acquiring cool new technology to accelerate its growth. I think the strategy will work and that the shares are well worth a look by at least GARP investors."
3751296,39791,2015-12-11T18:21:00-05:00,Cognizant continues to outpace its peers in growth rates while maintaining a stable margin.The stock has provided strong returns over the last decade and continues to be a good bet.The company is generating strong cash flows and returning cash to shareholders through buybacks.,"I have been a long-term bull on Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH), given the company's stupendous performance over the last decade providing strong returns to investors with low volatility and steady growth. CTSH remains my top pick in the software services area, as the company has effectively managed to fuse the best of both the Indian outsourcing companies as well as the consulting prowess of the Western software service majors such as IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Accenture (NYSE:ACN). The result has been a company which has grown its revenues by more than 20 times in the last 10 years, even as it maintained its operating margins in a steady 18-20% range. Even as the top US-based software service companies such as IBM face growth stagnation, CTSH is all set to clock a 20% revenue growth in 2015, outpacing all its peers. This has not been a one-off phenomenon, as CTSH has consistently outgrown the rest of the industry. The key to its success has been its extremely strong management, which has been leading the company since its inception in the 1990s. The stock is up by more than 50% since I had recommended it, and I continue to think that it is a great long pick for your portfolio. CTSH is as much a star in the technology industry as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), but it hardly gets any recognition given that most of its products and services are in the B2B area rather than B2C. I would advise investors to continue to buy the stock on dips as its long-term story remains intact.Cognizant's Positives1) Strong revenue growth is the real differentiator - Cognizant differentiates itself from the competition due to its strong growth trajectory compared to the rest of the industry. Even as IBM languishes at near-zero growth and the likes of Wipro (NYSE:WIT), Infosys (NYSE:INFY) and other Indian outsourcers manage 10-12% growth rates, Cognizant is chugging along at a growth rate of 20% plus. The company beat expectations with a growth rate of 23.5% in the most recent quarter. This has been the real USP of the stock, which has allowed its stock price to radically outperform the competition for a long period of time. Given that the management and business model remain intact, I think that CTSH will continue to show similar growth rates in the future. The company showed strong growth rates in its core US market (25% plus growth) and ROW. The UK and European markets were weak, but that was to be expected, given the weakened economic conditions in those areas.2) Consulting integration with technology and process teams - Cognizant's other major differentiation comes from the strength of its consulting division. Unlike other Indian companies which focus mostly on the run-of-the-mill low-value-added work, CTSH has built its consulting organization as a core competitive advantage. Its consulting services delve deeply with its technology and process teams to deliver domain knowledge to the client projects. It is similar to Accenture, but at a much lower cost. Other Indian organizations have tried to copy this business model, but have failed to replicate this. As today's business environment becomes increasingly complex, a comprehensive business and technological solution under one roof is required. CTSH has managed to provide this solution, leading to greater wins in the software services area. The company has over 5,500 consultants on its rolls.3) Strong quarterly results once again - The company manages to outperform quarter after quarter. This time was no different with revenues coming $45 million ahead of guidance, at $3.19 billion (up 23.5% year on year). Consulting and technology services outgrew traditional outsourcing services. This is a good sign as the company focuses more on digital services when compared to the traditional maintenance-based work which is getting outdated.4) Strong balance sheet and cash flows - CTSH has become a cash-generating machine, generating more than $800 million in cash flows. On an annualized basis, its operating cash flow to market cap is now at ~8%. This is not a bad yield, given that the company is growing at 20% and has a very small capital expenditure. The balance sheet is also quite strong with more than $3 billion in net cash. The company is also rewarding its shareholders with regular stock buybacks ($156 million in Q315). The company still has $2 billion in stock purchases left.RisksA) High attrition rates - Cognizant's quarterly attrition rate at 20% is quite high, as compared to its peers like Infosys and TCS (OTCPK:TTNQY). Being a service company, people are the biggest asset for CTSH, and losing people at such a rapid pace might impact client delivery. The company needs to focus on its HR practices and probably increase pay to retain people. This might impact its margins in the short term.b) Cloud threat - Software is being increasingly delivered from the cloud rather than being installed on the company systems. This implies that maintenance and upgradation revenues for software will get reduced over the long term. This is bad news for companies in this domain. CTSH still gets around 50% of its revenues from traditional outsourcing revenues. If the trend accelerates (which seems to be happening) and CTSH does not adapt accordingly, then its high growth rates may face a threat.Stock valuation remains cheap considering its pedigreeCTSH is not expensive with a forward P/E of ~17.1x, given its high ROE (19%) and high growth rates. The earnings are also much less volatile, which makes it much less riskier than other technology stocks. Most of its revenues come from long-term contracts which reduce fluctuations. The stock remains an unappreciated gem and should sport much higher valuation. A stock with this past record generally has a much higher valuation.ConclusionCognizant probably is the best software services stock because of its history, management, and business model. It has continuously rewarded investors as the management has a laser-sharp focus on its core competencies. The company is also adapting itself to the changed realities, where digital technologies become more important to its clients. It is already winning a large portion of its contracts in this segment. While future growth might not be 20%-plus given the company is already clocking $12 billion in revenues, it should be still higher than the average industry growth rate. I think that investors should look to buy CTSH on dips."

Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:CTSH) is the best among the group of IT service providers that have outperformed in the last decade. CTSH's competitive advantage and managerial ability, which has helped it outperform its competitors, are strong enough to drive growth for the company in the long term. Recent pessimism that has caused a 12% decline in Cognizant's share price is a clear buying opportunity.Everyday technology is getting closer to humans through many new ways - many organizations are behind the initiatives to make them possible. However, the ones that shine are the ones that innovate and show exceptional managerial ability, which will help them perform better and lead the pack.Comparing CTSH's earnings and revenue growth performance with its peers Accenture (NYSE:ACN), Wipro (NYSE:WIT) and Infosys (NYSE:INFY) gives us clear picture of outperformance by Cognizant almost every year in the past ten years. What is CTSH's edge that allowed it to outperform the pack consistently?It is impossible for us to identify the techniques and capabilities (without management input - that is not at all possible) that has allowed it to outperform. However, we can assign this outperformance to Cognizant's innovative products and services and managerial ability.In a highly competitive environment, where the need for constant innovation and change is intensive, the fear of falling exists more. High optimism of the top management regarding the long-term growth prospects of information technology and the opportunities for Cognizant is a confidence booster to investors. It is not about taking everything from management in the way they present, rather the observations that management has expressed and their confidence in the capabilities they have built in are strongly visible in the numbers. Providing valid proof to the strong conviction that the management has expressed (when their peers mentioned in this article struggled to post single digit earnings growth).Source: Google FinanceCaused by short-term growth concerns, Cognizant is trading 12% lower from its high price point in 2015. An excellent growth stock like CTSH is not likely to trade at a lower price point too long. Lack of cash dividend is definitely a drawback to investors seeking consistent income.While Cognizant's excellent managerial capabilities are helping it to consistently lead the pack mentioned in this article in earnings and revenue performance (see first chart), it is not able to maintain that position in generating return on its assets and equity. This is because of its heavy investing for future growth, in my view. Below chart strengthens my view.While Accenture, Wipro and Infosys are struggling to maintain their pace of book value growth Cognizant is thriving with great consistency. This is a great reflection of its excellent earnings and revenue growth. However, the return on its equity and assets are low compared to peers in spite of its excellent growth figures because Cognizant is investing heavily for future growth. This is helping it outperform its peers and grow at a strong growth rate with great consistency in my view.Cognizant is trading at an undervaluation compared to its peers mentioned in this article due to short-term growth concerns discussed above. Overall, it is good time to buy CTSH while others are pressing the sell button - its excellent management has a clear vision of the future of the technology that has allowed it to outperform in the past and it will continue to help it grow in the future as well."
3400945,24276,2015-08-06T09:44:59-04:00,"Cognizant had a solid beat on earnings and revenue for its latest quarter.Other Indian outsourcers, like Wipro and Infosys, are on the rise as well.The switch from owning contracts to owning technology continues.","During the first half of the current recovery outsourcing had a very bad odor.The idea that companies like Wipro (NYSEARCA:WIP), Infosys (NYSE:INFY) and Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) were simply shipping American jobs off to India rankled, spurred on by anecdotes of long-time employees teaching their jobs to H-1B residents, who then passed them on to Bangalore.In response the outsourcers, led by Cognizant, went through an image change, emphasizing their American headquarters, and comparing themselves to U.S. and European-based outsourcing firms like Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and Cap Gemini (OTCPK:CGEMY).Now, with skilled labor markets tight, they're getting the respect they think they deserve. Cognizant, in particular, is starting to shine, up 20% so far this year and headed higher after a solid beat on earnings, with GAAP earnings of $420 million, 68 cents per share, and revenue of $3.09 billion. Revenues were up 22.6% from a year ago.What has taken Cognizant ahead of its peers is buying operating companies like TriZetto, a $2.7 billion deal last year that brought a host of hospitals and clinics into its growing niche of health IT. There are risks in this strategy, as when customers like HealthNet (NYSE:HNT) are acquired, but owning actual technology in fast-growth markets, rather than simply looking for corporate work that saves money, seems to be the best path forward.The other two big outsourcers traded on U.S. exchanges, Wipro and Infosys, have also been on the rise over the last month, but both are in catch-up mode with Cognizant, which now sports a Price/Earnings multiple of 26, about twice that of U.S. pacesetter Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).Infosys bragged on its ""utilization rate"" in reporting earnings, and this is one reason outsourcing doesn't get the respect it feels it deserves. Treating people as a factory, who might be idled if business doesn't come through the door, as opposed to resources working on specific software projects, should probably not be discussed, even if management sees it as an important metric.What's next? Cognizant took on debt in buying TriZetto, which it is now working hard to pay down. That debt, as a share of total assets, is falling as the company's underlying asset base grows. At some point over the next six months, the balance sheet should be healthy enough to consider another acquisition, probably in the health space. At its present market cap of $26.3 billion, Cognizant is in good shape to participate in the continuing consolidation of the health IT space, now that the 2009 HiTech stimulus cash has been spent, leaving players like AthenaHealth (NASDAQ:ATHN), Allscripts (NASDAQ:MDRX), and Quality Systems (QSII) looking for partnerships.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."
3266015,77985,2015-06-17T16:54:50-04:00,"Cognizant faces competition from companies such as Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services.Tata and Infosys are under investigation regarding H-1B visas, which are used to perform work in the U.S.Anything that can disrupt the ability of the competition to perform works in favor of Cognizant.","Like all other companies, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:CTSH) has its share of competitors with whom it has to compete in the U.S. Two of the more prominent ones are Infosys (NYSE:INFY) and Tata Consultancy Services (OTC:TTNQY). It's not unusual to see one of these three companies win a new contract at the expense of the other two companies.Recent reports indicate that the U.S. Department of Labor has decided to investigate Infosys and Tata concerning company conduct that allegedly is not in compliance with visa rules and regulations, specifically a type of work visa known as the H-1B. Cognizant has not been named in this investigation.What the H-1B visa is and why it's neededThe H-1B visa basically gives foreign nationals the right to work legally in the U.S. for a fixed number of years, three which can be extended to six years. This allows the possibility of bringing in someone from another country with a special set of skills. Under normal circumstances, such a person would not be able to work in the U.S., but the H-1B is one way of bringing someone in to perform a job.Demand for work visas far exceeds supply because of the limited number of about 65,000 H-1B visas available every year. There also are some exemptions that can increase the actual number of visas issued, but these are not available to most. These characteristics ensure that competition for available H-1B visas is huge with the cap often maxed out in just a few days.Many companies and individuals are therefore unable to get the visas they need. This can in turn affect how companies can do business. Not being able to bring in necessary people and having the required manpower can result in not being able to perform the work that a company is contracted to do. This includes Infosys and Tata because both are reportedly among the top users of this particular type of work visa.In the technology sector, it can be difficult to find qualified personnel. Without qualified people, it can be hard to do certain types of work. If a company can't do the work due to not having the right people, then some other company will have to be brought in that can do the job.Cognizant could receive a windfall when the competition strugglesIt's important to know that the U.S. is by far the most important market for Infosys, Tata and Cognizant, despite the fact that all three companies do business globally. The table below shows how the three companies compare in the most recent quarter and how important the U.S. is for each company.Source: Cognizant, Infosys and TataThe U.S. market contributes the most out of all geographic areas in the case of all three competitors. This is especially true for Cognizant which gets over three quarters of revenue from the U.S. Therefore, anything that could somehow throw off the competition in the U.S. market would benefit Cognizant.If the local operations of Infosys and Tata in the U.S. were disrupted due to visa issues, a gap could open in the market that a company like Cognizant would be able to fill. Business could shift away from Infosys and Tata and toward Cognizant due to problems the former has with their workforce and not being able to perform or execute as desired.Clients in the U.S. could decide to turn to Cognizant as an alternative to Infosys and Tata and this would mean more business for Cognizant. As a result, revenue and income for Cognizant could come in higher than previously anticipated due to this unexpected windfall.ConclusionIt's important to keep in mind that the Department of Labor is in the early stages of their investigation. Both Infosys and Tata maintain that they're in compliance with the law. At this point, all allegations remain unproven and the companies must be presumed to be innocent.At the same time, it's not the first time that Infosys and Tata are under investigation for similar conduct regarding work visas. Both companies have pending litigation against them in court concerning issues related to work visas. Infosys already had to pay a fine as settlement in a previous case to the Department of Justice.It's quite possible that one or both of Cognizant's competitors will be subject to some sort of penalty. Infosys and Tata could in a worse case scenario have their ability to access H-1B visas curtailed because they could be seen as repeat offenders and therefore deserve a stiffer penalty. This would work in favor of Cognizant with the competition struggling.The fact is that companies are in a race in the market. They have to compete against each other for business. If one or more stumble for whatever reason, another can race ahead. If the former happens to Infosys and Tata, Cognizant should benefit with more revenue and higher profits due to less competition."
3174616,25562,2015-05-12T12:24:17-04:00,Cognizant is well positioned for future growth.The company's two largest divisions are in the financial and healthcare industries both of which face increasing regulatory hurdles.The regulatory burden makes outsourcing some or all of the infrastructure a necessity.I have updated my model to more accurately reflect the growth prospects post the recent earnings release.,"I view earnings season as a report card on the health of the underlying business I have invested in. I often find it quite useful to delve into the conference call transcripts for clues on how well the business is performing. In the case of Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH), its newly acquired company TriZetto is helping to drive revenue and profit growth.OverviewCTSH in my view can best be summed up as a consulting firm that manages an enterprise's various software systems. The trend toward e-business coupled with a migration to the cloud is a reliable, long-term driver of future IT spending. Most companies simply do not have the in-house staff to support such a move, hence the need for outside firms to provide solutions. CTSH's two largest areas are concentrated in financial service regulation (42%) and healthcare services (26%), both of which have become even more complicated due to recent government regulations (Dodd-Frank and Obamacare). I do not see the regulatory burden easing in the near future, allowing CTSH an excellent opportunity for additional revenue growth.ThesisMy original thesis revolved around continued revenue growth coupled with targeted acquisitions using the debt free balance sheet to fill in gaps in the business. CTSH purchased TriZetto, a private IT consulting firm specializing in the healthcare field in late September. The preliminary results are quite impressive with 43% revenue growth in the Healthcare IT division. I applauded the move as I view the complexity of regulations will force greater usage of outside firms to manage the IT infrastructure. I do not foresee this trend abating any time soon, which augurs well for further expansion of revenue and profits in this division.The following quote is attributed to Gordon Coburn - President of Cognizant. I have included the quoted material to neatly sum up the ongoing integration of the acquisition.Levered Returns ModelTo account for the increase in business due to the TriZetto acquisition, I have revised my model. I am modeling a higher growth rate with a lower margin to account for the healthcare IT business coupled with some costs associated with the acquisition. The beauty of CTSH is the highly predictable revenue stream combined with a very underleveraged balance sheet. I expect management to acquire additional smaller firms to augment their lineup further. The model shown above does not account for acquisitions. However, a well-timed one will boost the share price further.My model currently indicates CTSH is undervalued by 15% in an otherwise fully valued market. The shares are not currently an outright steal as they were when I first published my thesis yet offered an excellent value for an investor who wishes for exposure in the IT consulting space. I view CTSH as a long-term hold. To say the least, I'm pleased with the results so far.RisksToo often, most prefer to accentuate the positives while glossing over the potential negatives. CTSH operates in an extremely competitive field that may lead to loss of customers. CTSH's revenue base is not exclusively tied to one customer mitigating some of the risks of a sudden drop in revenues. To illustrate an example of a well-known company that recently lost a large contract, look no further than American Express (NYSE:AXP). The loss of the exclusive Costco (NASDAQ:COST) credit card account has severely wounded the company. Amex will have a hard time recouping the volume loss in upcoming years.CTSH will need to acquire additional smaller companies to aggressively grow its revenue stream. CTSH will naturally face integration risks along with the potential of overpaying to make an acquisition. So far, the Trizetto acquisition has been seamlessly integrated which is a plus.ConclusionCTSH continues to perform quite well bolstering my bullish thesis. The shares in my view should be seen as a growth play offering a patient long-term investor the potential for outsized gains in comparison to the overall market average."
3135436,24400,2015-05-04T10:34:15-04:00,"Cognizant has raised full-year revenue guidance for the second consecutive quarter, closing the gap between itself and IBM and Accenture.Accordingly, $70 per share seems the next target for Cognizant, based on 2016 estimates of $3.41 per share, which puts the forward P/E at 14.Applying a multiple of 21 to those estimates and the stock is around $20, trading on par with the S&P 500.","The enterprise IT consulting space has gotten fierce. But it's tough to see how Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) will be left out.While rivals like Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) continue to garner the majority of the press coverage, Cognizant continues to capitalize on higher-than-expected demand for its technology services, which competes well in terms on quality and Cognizant can also deliver these services at lower cost without sacrificing its margins. And these advantages proved true again Monday.Buoyed by strong gains in its North American healthcare and financial services business, Cognizant delivered a 20% year-over-year jump in first-quarter revenue Monday. For the quarter ended March 31, the Teaneck, New Jersey-based IT services giant reported a 43% revenue surge in its healthcare business, reaching $879.1 million.The strong jump in the healthcare segment is important because that business accounts for roughly a third of Cognizant's overall sales. What's more, this should quiet prior concerns about weak spending from insurers and Cognizant's perceived inability to capitalize from the U.S. Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).Likewise, revenue from the financial services business, which accounts for 40% of sales, was equally robust, climbing more than 13% year over year to $1.16 billion. That Cognizant is also growing sales in its largest segment by double digits underscores how quickly the company is growing its presence in areas dominated by both IBM and Accenture.All told, Cognizant's revenue first-quarter revenue of $2.91 billion climbed 20% year over year from $2.42 billion a year earlier. Net profit climbed almost 9% to $382.9 million, or 62 cents per share, up from $348.9 million, or 57 cents per share last year. And Cognizant, which raised its revenue and profit forecasts for the full year, doesn't see any signs of slowing down.Cognizant now expects adjusted earnings for the full year to be about $2.93, up 2 cents from prior guidance of $2.91 per share. The company also upped its revenue outlook, now forecasting at least $12.24 billion, up from $12.21 billion.From my vantage point, the company's guidance serve as indication that Cognizant plans to take market share in the quarters ahead from both IBM and Accenture. And this makes Cognizant stock very interesting, especially since its sales and general and administrative expenses climbed 26% during the quarter. It suggests the company will spare no expense to seize win large deals.So a bet on Cognizant stock today is more about 2016 and how well-positioned Cognizant will be relative to both IBM and Accenture. While Cognizant stock may not scream value, trading at a premium multiple of 25, compared to P/E of 14 and 19 for IBM and Accenture, respectively, neither IBM (revenue down 13% YoY) or Accenture (5% YoY revenue growth) is growing revenue at the rate of Cognizant.Bottom LineWhat's more, given that Cognizant has raised full-year revenue guidance for the second consecutive quarter, the gap between the three companies is closing. Accordingly, $70 per share seems the next target for Cognizant, based on 2016 estimates of $3.41 per share, which puts the forward P/E at 14. Applying a multiple of 21 to those estimates and the stock is around $20, trading on par with the S&P 500."
3204226,77985,2015-05-21T17:53:38-04:00,Cognizant's bigger ties to the U.S. had provided benefits against some of the competition.Recent signs indicate that advantage may be beginning to wane as the U.S. and the dollar weakens.Cognizant's lead over Infosys and Wipro will grow if the current trend persists.,"There's no question that Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:CTSH) has been on a tear recently. The stock is up by more than 23 percent so far in 2015. Meanwhile, two of its biggest competitors that are listed in the U.S. such as Infosys (NYSE:INFY) and Wipro (NYSE:WIT) are up by 0.7 and 4.5 percent, respectively. Another competitor is Tata Consultancy Services (OTC:TTNQY).Such a disparity in performance between CTSH, INFY and WIT is very noteworthy. All three companies share many similarities such as a business model that's revolved around outsourcing and having the majority of their workers in India. Yet despite all of this, Cognizant has managed to separate itself from the other two.Cognizant has benefited from mostly doing business in the United StatesThere are a number of reasons why Cognizant has managed to outperform its competitors Infosys and Wipro. One advantage is the fact that Cognizant has less exposure compared to its peers to regions such as Europe that have seen lots of economic problems. The table below shows how much revenue each company derives from the various geographic regions.Source: CTSH, INFY and WITCompared to Wipro and Infosys, Cognizant is not as exposed to regions where currencies have depreciated in value versus the dollar by virtue of being mostly confined to the U.S. This has helped Cognizant because earnings have suffered less impact from forex after converting into dollars. The table below shows how Cognizant has managed to perform in comparison to Wipro and Infosys in Q1 2015.Source: CTSH, INFY and WITCognizant's results are clearly much better than the competition here in the form of Wipro and Infosys. However, the picture would look somewhat different for these companies if it wasn't for forex. In the case of Cognizant, forex impact was negligible at less than one percent.On the other hand, YoY revenue growth for Infosys was actually 7.8 percent in constant currency, but only 3.2 percent after adjusting for forex. Wipro also experienced much greater impact from forex than Cognizant. Cognizant's performance would still be better without forex, but they would not be as good relative to Infosys and Wipro.Things may be beginning to changeHowever, there are signs that Q2 2015 may be different from Q1 as the graph below shows. While the value of the dollar rose rapidly in Q1 2015, it has not done as well so far in Q2 with the quarter half way through. It's possible that the situation could turn around in the second half of Q2 and the dollar could rise in value.However, if the dollar continues to fall as it has so far, it will work not in favor of Cognizant, but the competition. That's because Infosys and Wipro have suffered far more from a rising dollar than Cognizant. Therefore, if the dollar falls and other currencies such as the euro rise, it will be the former that will benefit the most.There are reasons to believe that the dollar will continue to fall versus other currencies. A strong economy should help secure more contracts, but a weak economy could delay them. While the economy in Europe seems to be on the upswing, the economy in the U.S. seems to be on the downswing.For instance, the growth rate of Gross Domestic Product (""GDP"") in Europe came in at 0.4 percent recently, which is more than the 0.2 percent for the U.S. That's the opposite of what has been the norm recently, a significant development if it continues.Many other indicators suggest that the economy in the U.S. is weakening, which will hurt Cognizant more than infosys and Wipro. A weaker economy in the U.S. and a stronger economy in Europe will help Infosys and Wipro more considering the fact that these two have more exposure to Europe and less to the U.S. in comparison to Cognizant.That could have an impact on earnings in the future. It would essentially be the opposite of what happened in Q1. Better than expected performance from Infosys and Wipro could make them more attractive to investors relative to Cognizant and that could play a role in determining how the stock of all three companies move as the year goes by.Cognizant did raise guidance after Q1. However, it's possible that future earnings may be affected in the coming quarters and may not be as good as initially thought after Q1 depending on how bad things get in the U.S. and how the dollar moves as a result. It's something to keep an eye on as it could become a bigger issue down the road.ConclusionCognizant's greater exposure to the dollar and the U.S. has helped it recently against competitors such as Infosys and Wipro. However, with the second quarter half way done, it looks like the situation may be starting to reverse.It's possible that Cognizant will not have as great of an advantage as the dollar goes down with the U.S weakening and Europe going up. Infosys and Wipro could then report better earnings, at least in comparison to what was previously expected out of these companies.Having said this, Cognizant continues to be more attractive than Infosys and Wipro. Even without the assistance of forex Cognizant's growth in both the top and bottom line is superior. Cognizant has made much progress in moving upscale to higher value business that should help the company going forward. If the current trend persists, the gap between Cognizant and the other two will only get bigger.Cognizant's margins also are getting better, which is good because it's an area where it has lagged against some of the competition. Therefore, while Cognizant may not get as much of an additional boost from the dollar and the U.S. as in recent quarters, an argument can be made that Cognizant is the better of the three companies at this point in time."
3411386,41531,2015-08-07T17:48:58-04:00,Information technology services industry up 10% compared to S&P 500.Cognizant trades at a significant discount on a valuation basis compared to its competitors while offering high-growth opportunities.CAGR of 26% on revenues with an estimated 20% increase in revenues for 2015 compared to 16% increase for 2014.,"For any investor who even periodically watches financial news channels on television they've invariably seen a commercial about a certain technology company that proudly boasts how it's innovating for the future and optimizing the technologically accommodative world all around us. That company, Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH), is a provider of information technology, consulting and business processing services. The company's objective is to be a leading provider of entire life-cycle e-business and application development projects. Ultimately, the company exists to provide ""technologically-driven"" solutions to its clients and to accept full accountability for the perpetual management of those clients' software systems through application development and integration, application management and re-engineering services.Throughout this article, I want to delve a little deeper in to Cognizant's market and discover what exactly are the key drivers of this business' revenue stream. Over the past few years, the company has experienced exceptional growth throughout many facets of its business segments, and I want to determine if the growth in those drivers are sustainable enough to maintain the optimistic investor sentiment currently revolving around this stock.Industry Overview:(Source: TradeKing)As a general necessity for any company, the capacity for it to create a product or to provide a service should essentially match the demand being created by the potential end markets. Therefore, a company can only be as efficient and profitable as the sector that it operates in, to a large degree. In this case, Cognizant operates in the Information Technology Services industry and under the Technology Services sector. As shown above, over the past year, the ITS sector has been positively correlated with overall market conditions and has outpaced the market approximately 10% in the recent months. Past performance is not indicative of future growth, but with a beta of approximately 1.40 and current indications of a steadily healing economy, Cognizant is poised advantageously in the event of an increase in economic output due to the industry in which it operates.Unfortunate for Cognizant, there are approximately 35,000 U.S. companies that occupy the same industry, proving the barriers of entry are extremely low. With the majority of the firms being small and ostensibly irrelevant, big players in this space include Accenture (NYSE:ACN), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Infosys LTD (NYSE:INFY) and Wipro LTD (NYSE:WIT), etc. Fortunate for Cognizant, the 50 largest companies in this industry hold more than 80% of this market, and it's 1 of those 50. Demand for all of these companies are solely driven by the IT spending budget of their clients, which unequivocally is predicated on how the overall health of the economy affects these company's profitability. With such a competitive landscape within this industry, the high-quality services that are offered by these companies often come at reduced costs. While this is great from a consumer's perspective, it's not always great for the companies as it shrinks margins while adding additional pressure toward cost-cutting measures.On a comparative basis, Cognizant fares well against its competitors. Provided are a few sample ratios to substantiate this statement:In North America, Cognizant grew revenues at 5.8%, which is higher than some of its close competitors TCS (4.4%) and Infosys (5.1%). European revenues provided an even wider disparity between these companies. Cognizant posted a sequential 5.5% increase, while TCS and Infosys posted a 2.2% and 0.7% increase, respectively.Overall, this company compared to the S&P 500 is trading at a premium, but if you are looking to gain some exposure in the ITS industry within your portfolio, Cognizant trades at a discount relative to other alternatives within its industry, all while providing better growth opportunities in the future. IDC estimated that the total market for IT services was over $873 billion in 2012 and is expected to grow at a 4.7% CAGR through 2017. So, the overall outlook for the ITS industry is positive due to the expected increased spending on technological products and services, but market share and customer retention will be a pivotal focal point for Cognizant moving ahead amidst such venerable competition.Business Overview:Over the past five years, Cognizant has generated a CAGR of approximately 26% on revenues, 22% on operating income and 20% on net income. While this growth is anticipated to slow to around 15% by consensus, I believe through global expansion and acquisitions this company can maintain these high growth levels. Also, both cash flow per share and EPS have increased almost 100% over the past five years. Cognizant's domestic revenue currently accounts for 77%, indicating that through the development of current global relationships the company has significant growth opportunities into these foreign markets. The company's client retention ratio is estimated to be in the 90s, so the estimates that growth will slow due to increased competition leading to lower domestic demand seem irrelevant and illogical to me given the expansionary opportunities that Cognizant possesses.One of the key intangible assets that Cognizant has is its dedication to building strong client relationships. As a testament to its dedication to its clients, 30% of a project's team will actually reside at the client's site to integrate themselves into the company's operations and to be accessible to company management. The company has a mandate dictating that any returns in operating margins over 20% will be reinvested into building the best services for its clients. In 2014, 97.1% of total revenues were derived from clients that had been using the services from the prior year. The number of strategic clients at the end of 2014 was 271 (which has increased to 285 as of Q2). A strategic client is one that provides $5-50 million in revenues. Ultimately, this justifies the high customer retention rate and will be a pivotal selling point as this company begins to expand into untouched markets.Let's take a step back and discern the key drivers of revenue for this company. For the year ended 2014, the majority of the revenue base was generated through three primary business segments: Financial Services at 41.8%, Healthcare at 26.2% and Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics at 20.4% (11.6% is listed as Other). In the last two years, the Financial Services segment of Cognizant's revenue source has increased over 41%, Healthcare has increased over 39% and M/R/L has increased over 40% as well.For the most recent Q2 results - more of the same in terms of growth. The Financial Services segment grew 7.7% sequentially and 18% y-o-y mainly driven by increased demand in both the banking and insurance space. Cognizant focuses on helping its clients with cost optimization, vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance and cyber security. Fancy corporate words that intuitively mean what I already mentioned as Cognizant's core objective: provide technologically-driven solutions to its clients and accept responsibility for the perpetual management of those clients' software systems. Healthcare grew 2% sequentially and 39% y-o-y driven substantially by its acquisition of TriZetto. M/R/L segment increased 5.4% sequentially and 12.4% y-o-y driven around modernizing supply chains and digital and multi-channel commerce solutions. Finally, the ""other"" segment was up 11.5% sequentially and 20.3% y-o-y. In Q2, the company repurchased over 2.4 million shares for a cost of $153 million. To date, that represents a total of 38 million shares repurchased at a cost of $1.4 billion with $600 million remaining that has been approved for further stock purchases.Taking a look forward, company management has actually increased full-year revenue and EPS guidance figures to reflect future demand. Full-year revenue guidance has increased by $100 million to $12.33 billion, which would represent an increase of over 20% in comparison to 2014, a year that, in comparison, increased y-o-y revenues by 16%. This comes in light of the anticipated $100 million of revenues from the Health Net acquisition that the company will not generate. Aside from this, the company's $2.7 billion TriZetto acquisition is estimated to add an additional $1.5 billion in synergy revenue in the future. Through TriZetto, Cognizant now develops, licenses, implements and supports proprietary and third-party software products for the healthcare industry, effectively increasing exposure in one of its key business segments. Cognizant has acquired numerous companies in the past few years, TriZetto being the largest in its history and through these acquisitions, more opportunities for deeper expansions into its key markets will materialize. In its most recent earnings call, CEO Francisco D'Souza states:Cognizant also has exposure in the Australian market through the acquisition of Odecee. While I don't believe that acquisition will be the sole driver for growth in this company looking forward, I think it will plant the foundational seed that will eventually sprout additional global revenue growth. The key here for Cognizant will be doing what it does best: building solid client relationships. As this company grows bigger through acquisitions and additional domestic and foreign clients, maintaining these relationships will be what both sustains the growth and maintains margins as competition increases in the ITS space. As noted, 97.1% of 2014 revenues were derived from customers that had been with the company for over a year. It's also worth noting that 21.3% of 2014 revenues were generated by the company's top 10 customers (down from 25% two years prior). This makes it imperative that Cognizant continue to hash out excess operating margins to its customers to ensure there's no temptation to adopt a different service company. Bottom line, companies will always look to discover ways to develop better operating efficiency strategies to fuel higher profitability and productivity. Cognizant has made a living by doing this since 1994, and based on current operating performance and future growth outlook, I believe this is the best ITS company in the sector and it deserves the optimistic sentiment currently revolving around it."

Several companies have taken advantage of this need by offering an array of related services, especially those related to Information Technology. Examples include Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:CTSH), Infosys (NYSE:INFY), Wipro (NYSE:WIT) and Tata Consultancy Services (OTC:TTNQY).While Cognizant is technically an American company with headquarters in the United States, the other three companies are from India. All four companies are similar in the sense that they facilitate outsourcing and offshoring with the majority of the workforce based in India.It also makes them competitors because they frequently cater to the same set of clients, which for the most part are located in developed countries. While these companies do business all over the world, the United States and Western Europe to a lesser extent are the most important regions from a revenue standpoint.This allows them to bill their customers in hard currencies with most of the revenue in dollars, euros and so on. At the same time, a large part of their costs are in Indian rupees. Currency fluctuations therefore play an important role. When one currency weakens or strengthens relative to the other, it can have a significant impact on the top and bottom line.Currencies are on the moveThe currency market has certainly not been boring as of late. The overriding theme has been the strengthening dollar, which has run up against most currencies. The table below shows how much other currencies have fallen relative to the dollar over the last six months.Source: YahooThe statistics show that the European currencies have lost the most value against the dollar. The rupee not as much. That's a significant development if you're looking at a company that derives a major portion of its revenue from a place where the currency has depreciated by a lot. It's important to know if a company has exposure to such a region where currency effects are at play and, if so, by how much.Where Cognizant, Tata, Wipro and Infosys get most of their revenueWhile Cognizant, Tata Consultancy, Wipro and Infosys all have a global footprint, certain areas are more important than others. The table below shows how much revenue is derived from each geographic region for each of the four companies. All figures listed are for the fourth quarter of 2014.Source: Infosys, Cognizant, Tata and WiproAn analysis of where companies get their revenue from reveals that Cognizant is the one that is the least exposed to negative headwinds from forex. Most of its revenue comes from a relatively healthy United States. It also gets relatively less from a weak Europe in comparison to the other companies. One could argue that this fact gives Cognizant a major advantage over its three competitors.When companies need to convert their foreign currencies into dollars or rupees, they will get less for their euros and other European currencies than before. That will inevitably have a negative impact on earnings. Cognizant with most of its revenue in dollars will not suffer to the same extent as other companies.Comparison of Cognizant, Infosys, Tata Consultancy and WiproUnlike the other three, Tata Consultancy is listed abroad and it's not as easily accessible. Of the remaining three, Cognizant has faster growth than the other two. It also has lower margins. On the other hand, Infosys and Wipro have better margins, but they're not growing as fast as Cognizant. They also pay a dividend, which is something that Cognizant does not do.ConclusionWhile Cognizant is growing faster than its three counterparts in India, its margins are also significantly lower and profits are not as good. This is arguably Cognizant's weakest point in comparison to the other three companies from India.However, currency fluctuations due to the strengthening dollar should work in Cognizant's favor. With the quarter almost over, it's pretty certain that it will not have to suffer from forex headwinds to the same degree as is the case with the other three. This should help mitigate Cognizant's disadvantage of lower margins when it comes to earnings.This will remain the case for as long as the euro and the other European currencies stay weak relative to the dollar. Should the dollar weaken relative to other currencies in the future, Tata, Wipro and Infosys will benefit from a bigger tailwind than Cognizant. In the meantime, Cognizant will have the advantage of suffering less from headwinds due to foreign currencies."

Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that looking at the price cannot be the sole factor in investment decisions, as the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here is a look at how Cognizant Technology Solutions fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.CTSH data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 4/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - September 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryCTSH does not pay a dividend.Conclusion:Cognizant Technology Solutions fares quite well in the ModernGraham model, and is suitable for Enterprising Investors. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the lack of dividends along with the high PEmg and PB ratios, while the Enterprising Investor is only initially concerned by the lack of dividends. As a result, Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to that valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $0.88 in 2010 to an estimated $2.01 for 2014. This is a fairly strong level of demonstrated growth which is well above the market's implied estimate for 9.24% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years. Here, the historical growth in EPSmg over the last five years is around 25.6% per year, so the market is expecting a very significant drop in earnings growth. The ModernGraham valuation model reduces the historical growth to a more conservative figure, assuming that some slowdown will occur, but it may be unrealistic that the company would see such a significant slowdown in growth over the long term. Therefore, the model returns an estimate of intrinsic value above the current price, indicating the company is significantly undervalued at the present time."
2741635,72015,2014-12-10T06:54:54-05:00,"Cognizant Technology Solutions has achieved impressively consistent growth during the last decade, even growing its earnings per share by more than 20% in both 2008 and 2009.
        The company has a debt free balance sheet loaded with cash and generates a return on invested capital above 20%.
        Analysts believe that Cognizant will continue to grow its earnings by nearly 20% per year moving forward, making the company's shares a compelling opportunity for growth investors.","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:CTSH) has been a relatively quiet success story over the last decade in the technology sector. During this period, its sales have increased by more than 1,500% and long term investors have enjoyed spectacular gains. Now with a market capitalization of more than $30 billion, Cognizant's growth is expected to remain strong over the coming years. Trading at only 18 times forward earnings, it appears to be a reasonably priced growth stock. This article investigates the software and consulting company using the DRAG framework to determine whether its investors should expect continued outperformance over the next 12 months.Please click here to read my article which outlines the DRAG analysis framework in more detail.To summarize, the four variables used in a DRAG (dividend and risk adjusted growth) analysis are as follows (each company is ranked from 0 to 3 in each category): 1) How cyclical is the industry in which Cognizant operates? 2) How strong is Cognizant's competitive position within this industry? 3) How risky is Cognizant's balance sheet? 4) What is Cognizant's dividend yield and dividend growth history?The premise is that a company that operates in a non-cyclical industry, with a strong competitive position and a clean balance sheet that pays an attractive dividend should trade at a higher earnings multiple than a company without these attributes, even if the lower quality company has higher projected future earnings growth. After adjusting for these variables, it becomes easier to compare companies in different sectors with different levels of future growth potential.Cognizant DRAG Analysis:While this academic research website shows that the average computer services stock in the United States has a beta of 0.92, Cognizant's shares have possessed an elevated level of volatility for much of the last decade. As the below chart illustrates, the shares have consistently been more volatile than the broader market during the previous five years:However, the company's results have been incredibly consistent. Cognizant's earnings per share have increased each year during the past decade, including growth of more than 20% in both 2008 and 2009. Although the company's stock price has exhibited above average volatility, this impressive track record is deserving of an average score for its apparently moderate level of industry cyclicality.One of the most noticeable attributes of Cognizant Technology Solutions is its remarkable history of generating above average returns on its invested capital. In fact, the company has achieved an ROIC of greater than 20% during each year of the past decade and its return on assets remains strong as well. As you can see from the graphs below, while the firm's gross margin has fallen consistently since 2005, its operating margin has remained fairly stable:Although this trend of a decline in gross margin is somewhat concerning, Cognizant's ability to generate consistently impressive returns on its invested capital is evidence of its competitive strengths, which have persisted over time and allow the firm to earn an above average score in this portion of the analysis.Cognizant's balance sheet is pristine and represents a significant benefit for the firm's shareholders. The company possesses no debt and currently has more than $4.5 billion in cash and short term investments, representing approximately $7.50 in net cash per share. Furthermore, Cognizant has just $500 million in goodwill and other intangible assets despite a long history of making accretive acquisitions. This flawless balance sheet gives management the flexibility to continue this trend in the future and deserves a perfect score.However, despite this large cash position and consistent free cash flow generation, Cognizant has never paid a dividend to shareholders. Instead, the company spends its cash on acquisitions; while in most cases I would prefer to see these funds distributed to shareholders, it is nearly impossible to argue with the firm's track record of completing accretive transactions. Nevertheless, until Cognizant introduces a dividend, the DRAG framework will punish it accordingly as it is not an appropriate investment for individuals seeking income from their portfolios.With Cognizant shares currently trading at around $52, this analysis demonstrates that they are likely significantly undervalued. Although the company does not pay a dividend, its balance sheet is cash rich and debt free. In addition, it generates an exciting return on its invested capital and has achieved earnings per share growth each year during the last decade. Although analysts anticipate its annual earnings growth rate will decline slightly (from 21% over the last five years to 18% over the next five), the stock's current valuation is compelling given this growth forecast. With potential upside of approximately 60% over the next 12 months according to this DRAG analysis, growth investors should seriously consider adding Cognizant Technology Solutions to their portfolios."
2499635,25120,2014-09-16T15:25:30-04:00,"Cognizant is acquiring TriZetto to boost its healthcare offerings.The deal looks okay from a strategic point of view, yet the company is paying a steep price.Long-term growth, fair valuation, and a strong balance sheet remain attractive. I am a buyer on dips.","On Monday, Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) announced the acquisition of privately held TriZetto, in order to expand its healthcare offerings. Initially, the deal spurred enthusiasm from investors liking the exposure to higher-growth markets and potential for revenue synergies.That being said, Cognizant is paying a premium of close to $1 billion, if one compares the deal's price tag to its own valuation. This resulted in a sell-off throughout the day as investors processed the implications of the deal, with shares ending the day in the red.Deal HighlightsCognizant has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held TriZetto for $2.7 billion in cash. TriZetto provides healthcare IT software and solutions, and Cognizant hopes to benefit from the higher growth which is anticipated in those markets.Strategic Nature Of The DealCEO Francisco D'Souza notes that the healthcare industry is witnessing structural reform shifts, cost pressure and a shift of responsibilities between payers and providers, all trends which create an appealing growth opportunity.The acquisition of TriZetto should provide a better-integrated portfolio of capabilities to boost operational efficiency to healthcare clients. With the deal and the increased operational capacities, Cognizant anticipates improving its solutions, which should allow the firm to accelerate its market position and market share going forward.TriZetto current employs about 3,700 people, and will become part of Cognizant's current healthcare business, which serves over 200 clients and contributes roughly a quarter of Cognizant's total revenues. The introduction of the Affordable Care Act and the growth in Medicare and Medicaid programs provide real opportunities in an industry as large as $2.7 trillion.Financial ImplicationsThe $2.7 billion deal is significant, although it is not a game changer. Over the trailing twelve months, TriZetto has posted sales of $711 million, valuing the business at 3.8 times annual revenues.Non-GAAP operating margins totaled 18.4% of sales, or about $131 million, which values the business at a rather steep nearly 21 times operating earnings. It should be noted that the profile of the business is appealing to investors, with roughly two-thirds of sales recurring, driven by software, consulting, and SaaS services.While these metrics appear somewhat expensive, there is some real potential upside to the deal, as it is expected to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP earnings. The deal, furthermore, has the potential to improve both the margin and growth profile of the overall firm, as cumulative potential revenue synergies of $1.5 billion have been identified for the upcoming five years.Fair Valuation, Strong Balance SheetBack in August, Cognizant reported its second-quarter earnings results. The company ended the quarter with a very sizable $4.1 billion in cash and equivalents. The company has no debt outstanding, which results in a very solid net cash position, from which it can easily finance the $2.7 billion deal. Despite this luxurious cash holding, Cognizant has arranged a $1 billion committed financing, in order to maintain financial flexibility and continue to execute on its $2 billion share repurchase program, to be completed by the end of next year.That being said, management does not foresee much large-scale M&A activity in the foreseeable future.On a trailing basis, Cognizant has now posted sales of $9.6 billion, on which it posted operating margins of about 19% and net earnings of nearly $1.4 billion.With some 610 million shares outstanding at the moment, and shares trading at $45 per share, equity is being valued at $27.5 billion, which in turn, values operating assets at some $23.5 billion before the deal was announced. In that light, Cognizant's own assets are valued at nearly 2.5 times annual revenues and 12 to 13 times operating earnings.Based on these revenues and earnings metrics, Cognizant is paying at least 50% more for TriZetto, or close to $1 billion. This might be a reason why investors are disappointed by the deal.On a pro forma basis, the business posts sales of $10.3 billion and earnings most likely close to $1.5 billion. Adjusting for the lower net cash holdings, which drop to about $1.5 billion following the deal, operating assets are valued at $26 billion, the equivalent of 2.5 times revenues and 17 times earnings.History Of Impressive GrowthCognizant has reported impressive growth over the past decade, growing from a nearly $600 million revenue business in 2004 to breach the $10 billion sales mark currently. Strong organic growth and acquisitions resulted in this impressive growth, with sales growing at an average of 30% per annum, as the total dilution was limited to just 5%-10% over this time period. This is as Cognizant continues to operate with a very strong balance sheet.Earnings have grown at a pace approaching the sales growth; although net margins have been under a little bit of pressure, they are still coming in at very comfortable levels.This growth has paid off big-time for investors. Adjusted for numerous past splits, shares traded at levels around the equivalent of $1 per share in 2000 to gradually increase towards $20 by 2007. While shares fell to levels around $10 during the financial crisis, they did show a meaningful rebound, rising all the way to highs of $55 earlier this year. Currently, shares are trading about $10 lower in what has been a disappointing year, with shares down some 12% year-to-date.Final ThoughtsIt has been two years since I last had a look at the prospects for the company. At the time, shares traded in the low $30s, what I considered a fair valuation, providing an opportunity for long-term investors to pick up a solid technology play at a fair price, especially considering the rock-solid balance sheet.So shares have risen some 30-40% since, but so has the market as a whole. The valuation remains fair - somewhat in line with the general market - while the business has a strong trajectory in growing, making and creating value through acquisitions, plus delivering capital gains.While the valuation is still fair, despite the disappointing trends so far this year, I will hold off making an investment at current levels, only pulling the trigger if shares correct a little further. A 15 times earnings multiple translates into a targeted $40 entry point, the levels at which I will be a buyer."
2858376,24112,2015-01-28T10:32:08-05:00,Management recently revised guidance for FY15 upward on the expectation of strong revenue growth.Recent company acquisitions have totaled $3.5B in contractual value.Key acquisitions include Health Net and TriZetto.,"Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH)Cognizant, based in Teaneck, New Jersey, provides a broad range of IT services to Global 1000 companies. The company leverages its onsite/offshore model to provide clients with faster, cheaper and better development and deployment of applications across multiple technology platforms and vertical areas. Cognizant employs 145,000 professionals at its facilities in India, Europe and the United States.The company's recent five-year volume to performance can be seen below. The sharp drop in March of 2014 represents a 2:1 stock split.Recent Fundamental HighlightsThe company raised its FY14 revenue guidance from 14% growth y/y (implies at least $10.08B) to 14.5-14.9% y/y ($10.13B-$10.16B) and EPS guidance from $2.54 to $2.57.Furthermore, the company has announced that the recent acquisition of TriZetto is now complete. This acquisition is well positioned to succeed in the healthcare industry as it is a leading provider of software and solutions to healthcare payers. The acquisition cost the company $2.8B or 3.8x revenue and will likely continue to pay off in the years to come.The positive company outlook could be further revised upward in the coming months as company acquisitions begin to come online and with changes in expected cash flows.OutlookCognizant has the potential to return better-than-industry growth rates in 2015 as it has historically grown on average 9% faster than the upper end of the industry in recent years. The discrepancy between CTSH total annual revenue growth and the industry has slowed in recent years due to a higher base effect and the push out of large deals in 2014. Analyst estimates show that CTSH could outpace the market with a growth rate of 15%.Additionally, the recent acquisition of TriZetto (healthcare software and solutions) closed on the 20th of November 2014. This acquisition is expected to contribute positively to the long-term growth and margin profile of the company. But aside from this, the company also has closed three transformational deals in 2014 totaling $3.5B in contractual value. These deals are expected to add $200M in incremental revenues in 2015, including the acquisition of Health Net, which is expected to provide $2.7B in incremental cash flows in the next 7 years. Shown below is the company's ability to create returns on invested capital. Management's ability to create strong returns in recent years should be an indicator of the potential of its recent acquisitions.Outsourcing revenues have slowed from 16.1% y/y growth in 1Q14 to 5.8% growth in 3Q14. However, with the acquisition of Health Net, a large financial services contract, and another contract beginning to ramp up in FY15, outsourcing revenues are expected to benefit.Economic Moat TrendCTSH has a competitive advantage in healthcare (25% of revenue). The company's model is unique - investing everything over a margin level to drive growth. This advantage is only likely to grow with recent acquisitions and contribute positively to margins.The addition of TriZetto should help open new relationships at 80-90 clients with the ability for CTSH to cross-sell IT services into TriZetto's client base as well as selling TriZetto software to existing clientele. It should also help expand its service offerings while capturing the shift in health insurance toward exchanges and consumer-driven healthcare.Employee headcount grew 6.6% q/q and 20% y/y in 3Q14 and this positive movement could indicate future growth as the company hires talent in an effort to gear up for future projects, especially in the short term given majority of 3Q hiring was lateral.The company's ten-year net profit margins can be seen below. The number has ranged from 18% to 13% in the past few years. However, recent acquisitions are poised to continue to increase these margins.Major RisksInvestment RationaleCTSH should be on investors' watch lists as revenue growth drives multiple expansions and the company has an excellent record of execution. There are catalysts in place to drive results over the long term, including customer cost savings and regulatory work in healthcare and financial services.Cognizant currently trades at $56.10 (closing price as of Jan. 26th) and looks attractive with strong upside potential in the near to medium term."

Cognizant is headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey, was founded in 1994 and had its IPO in 1998. Cognizant was named the world's third most admired IT services company by Fortune magazine (behind Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and IBM (NYSE:IBM)). Cognizant has a market capitalization of $32.7 billion.Latest resultsOn November 5, 2014, Cognizant released third quarter 2014 results: Revenue was $2.6 billion (up 12% yoy), non-GAAP EPS were $0.66 (up 12% yoy), GAAP EPS were $0.58 (up 9% yoy).Cognizant also raised the FY 2014 outlook: Fourth quarter revenue is expected to be between $2.61 billion and $2.64 billion, fourth quarter (non-GAAP) EPS are estimated to be at least $0.63. FY 2014 revenue is estimated between $10.13 billion and $10.16 billion, and non-GAAP EPS are expected to be $2.57 minimum.The market reacted very positive to this raised outlook for FY 2014. Cognizant is up 20% over its October low.FundamentalsCognizant's operational results were excellent overCognizant's operational results were excellent over the last few years: Revenues reached $9.9 billion in the last twelve months (up 201% over the last five years), representing annual growth of 25%. Net income and earnings per share grew by 160% (to $1.4 billion and $2.29, respectively), representing annual growth of 21%.Cognizant's other fundamentals look good as well: The company has a very healthy profit margin of 14.2%, Cognizant's returns on capital are high, too. Cognizant's ROI is 19.9%, its ROE is 20.7%. A high return on equity matters because high ROE businesses tend to outperform low ROE businesses over the long haul.Cognizant's financials also are very satisfying: The company has a debt/equity ratio of 0.00 and very high liquidity (current ratio of 4.20, quick ratio of 4.20), making Cognizant a safe investment with very low insolvency risk.ValuationCognizant's P/E ratio is 23.4, its EV/EBITDA ratio is 13.7. Those are not low valuations per se, but they are rather low for a high growth company like Cognizant.Cognizant's current multiples are also where they were twelve months ago - the company did not get more expensive despite is positive performance over the last twelve months. Based on the FY 2014 EPS estimate of $2.57, Cognizant's FY 2014 earnings multiple is just 20.8. Cognizant's PEG ratio is 1.39, a rather low valuation. Despite Cognizant's above market P/E multiple, Cognizant is inexpensively priced based on the company's earnings growth outlook.If we use the Graham formula to determine Cognizant's fair value, we are led to a similar conclusion:V= EPS*(8.5+2*G)*4.4/YwhereinEPS = earnings per share in the last twelve monthsG = estimated EPS growth rate over the next 5 yearsY = yield on AAA corporate bondsIf we apply Cognizant's numbers, we receive the following intrinsic value:$2.30*(8.5+2*16.8)*4.4/4.1 = $103.91.The Graham formula suggests Cognizant has upside of 90% to its intrinsic value.Bottom lineCognizant's business offers high growth, is predictable and non-cyclical. The company's fundamentals (including high returns on capital, high margins, no debt) are very compelling.Cognizant's multiples are at a similar level to where they were twelve months ago. Based on the good growth outlook Cognizant is inexpensively priced today (with a FY 2014 P/E ratio of 20.0 and a PEG of 1.39) and, based on the Graham formula, Cognizant is trading below its intrinsic value.Cognizant is an attractive investment at this price for everyone looking for capital appreciation."

I have estimated the company's fair intrinsic value to be around $36 billion in market cap or $58 per share.,"The Information Technology industry is one of the most important industries in the U.S. and is expected to grow further throughout 2014 as companies increase their spending on IT systems, infrastructure, software and services. According to Gartner IT Spending Forecast, the worldwide IT spending is projected to grow 2.1% in 2014 and about 3% each year for the next four years (see image below).Source: GartnerAs an investor who likes to look for multi-bagger (e.g. 100% or more gains) investments, I like to find great companies that have good long-term growth prospects that operate in favorable and growing industries. In the IT service industry, I believe that Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) will perform well over the next five years because of the increasing demand in the company's IT and consulting services.Here is a historical look at Cognizant's share price and diluted EPS growth over the past ten years:About Cognizant TechnologyCognizant Technology Solutions is a leading provider of information technology, consulting and business process services that helps large organizations become more efficient in their operations. The company's core services include: Operations and IT Consulting, Application Development and Systems Integration, Enterprise Information Management, Application Testing, Application Maintenance, IT Infrastructure Services and Business Process Services (source: 2013 Annual Report).The company's IT and consulting services focus on and generate the most revenues from these three industries: 1) Financial Services, 2) Healthcare, and 3) Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics.Source: Q1 2014 10-Q ReportIn terms of revenue by geography, the company earns most of its revenues from the North America market (e.g. 76% of the company's total revenue in Q1 2014). It also operates in Europe, Asia Pacific, The Middle East and Latin America, which are largely under-penetrated with a lot of growth potential (see image below).Source: Q1 2014 10-Q ReportAlthough Cognizant earns most of its revenues in North America, most of its long-term assets are in India (see image below), which I will explain later to discuss the company's long-term growth prospects.Source: Q1 2014 10-Q ReportLong-Term Prospects and Growth PotentialThe most important factors that I believe will drive Cognizant's revenue and net earnings growth over the next five years are 1) the company's growing number of active clients-especially the strategic clients who contribute the most revenues for Cognizant, and 2) the clients' increasing spending on IT services.Growing Customer BaseAccording to the management, the company added seven strategic clients in Q1 2014 and ended the quarter with 150 strategic clients and 1,223 active clients in total. As a reference, the company had approximately 1,197 clients in 2013, 821 clients in 2012 and 785 clients in 2011 (sources: Q1 2014 Conference Call and 2013 Annual Report).Cognizant's client base will likely continue to grow over the next five years because there is a strong demand in Cognizant's core IT, infrastructure, business consulting and outsourcing services; Cognizant has a large number of service delivery employees in India who can provide IT services for large organizations at a lower cost; and the company has a strict mandate to invest profits above the 19% to 20% non-GAAP operating margin back into the business to improve its services.As mentioned earlier, what surprised me the most about Cognizant is that 93% of its long-term assets (properties, plants and equipment) are related to its operations in India. The management stated that the company ended the first quarter with 178,600 employees globally, of which 167,300 were service delivery staff. The majority of the 167,300 service delivery staff likely reside in India because 93% of the company's long-term assets are related to operations in India and because the IT labor costs are much cheaper there. This means that Cognizant can utilize its large pool of IT professionals in India to deliver IT services to its clients at a lower cost. And clients are attracted to Cognizant's global delivery services to help them improve business operations and lower IT costs.Increasing IT SpendingGartner forecasted that the Worldwide IT spending will grow 2.1% in 2014 and around 3% each year between 2015 and 2018. Among IT services, the spending in this sector is expected to grow 3.8% in 2014 and 4.1% in 2015 (source: Gartner Press Release).As long as the U.S. economy is growing (and not in a recession), the largest U.S. companies will continue to increase their IT spending in areas such as social networks, mobile devices, Big Data, IT systems, infrastructure and services, advanced analytics and cloud computing, in order to stay competitive in their industries. As a result, the increasing IT spending by large corporations should benefit Cognizant over the next several years, provided that the U.S. economy is expanding.Net Earnings and Free Cash Flow Growth PotentialAccording to the latest Q1 Conference Call, management increased the company's full year non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) guidance by $0.03. Moreover, they expect that the company will deliver a revenue growth of at least 16.5% and generate revenues of at least $10.3 billion for the full year in 2014. Note that the company's Q2 earnings will be released on Wednesday, August 6.Over the past five years, the company's net earnings and diluted EPS grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23% each year and its free cash flow grew at a CAGR of 18% each year.For the next five to ten years, I believe that Cognizant's net earnings and free cash flow growth rates will decelerate to a CAGR of 12% to 16% each year. I will this range to estimate the company's fair intrinsic value at the end of the article.Here is a historical look at Cognizant's revenue net income, diluted EPS and free cash flow growth over the past ten years:Competition and RisksCompetition is Cognizant's biggest risk factor because the IT service industry is intensively competitive with thousands of small-to-medium size firms and many large multinational firms-such as Accenture (NYSE:ACN), HP (NYSE:HP), IBM (NYSE:IBM), SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) that are more well-known than Cognizant. Here is a list of the largest IT service providers by revenues in 2013:Source: HfS ResearchI believe that Cognizant's biggest competitive advantage is its global delivery model which consists of 1) client service teams at client locations (in order to facilitate client services) and 2) delivery teams at near-shore and offshore delivery centers in India and other countries (in order to provide cost-effective IT and consulting services). Cognizant has a large number of IT service delivery employees in India and is continually hiring more employees there.Cognizant has a strong industry focus in two of the largest industry verticals: financial services and healthcare. These industries tend to hire consulting companies that are dedicated to those industries. As mentioned earlier, Cognizant also has people on site, which helps them build better client relationships and have a deeper understanding of their clients. This also leads to more opportunities and work, which in turn leads to even better industry knowledge.The second risk factor is IT spending, which is largely dependent on the country's economic growth and individual companies' IT budgets. Cognizant earns approximately 76% of its revenues in North America. If a recession occurs in the next several years, U.S. companies will likely decrease their IT budgets, which will impact Cognizant and other IT service providers. Moreover, if the IT spending growth in North America slows for any other reasons (e.g. market maturity), then it will impact Cognizant's revenue growth unless the company expands further in its international markets (Europe, Asia Pacific, The Middle East and Latin America) in the upcoming years.In terms of liquidity and credit risks, Cognizant has a very healthy balance sheet with minimum debt. For Q1 2014, the company had a large amount of cash and short-term investments ($3.86 billion), which alone were more than enough to pay off the company's entire short-term and long-term liabilities ($1.66 billion).Intrinsic Value EstimatesTo estimate Cognizant's fair intrinsic value, I used three free cash flow (FCF) growth scenarios with a discount rate of 11% (see image below).Based on my estimate, I believe that Cognizant Technology's fair intrinsic value is around $36 billion in market cap or $58 per share, assuming that its free cash flow will grow at a CAGR of 14% over the next decade. At the time of writing (July 31, 2014), the stock is traded at $49.05 per share. If the company's free cash flow grows at a CAGR of 12% over the next decade, its current intrinsic value should be around $32 billion in market cap or $52 per share. If my fair intrinsic value estimate at $58 per share is correct, the stock is undervalued by around 16%.Note that a company's intrinsic value (along with its share price) tends to increase over time when the company has increasing earnings, EPS and free cash flows. Cognizant's stock's long-term growth should correspond to its EPS growth over the long run.The Bottom LineI believe that Cognizant Technology should perform well over the next five years as the company continues to attract more clients and to benefit from the IT spending growth in the U.S. The company is not as large and well-known as other IT service providers such as IBM and Accenture. However, the IT industry in the U.S. is fragmented and the market is large enough for Cognizant to gain more revenue share.One thing investors should look out for is Cognizant's client base growth, especially its strategic client base. As long as Cognizant is growing its client base each quarter, the company's revenue and earnings should continue to grow over the long run.Sources: Cognizant's 2013 Annual Report, Q1 2014 10-Q and Conference Call, Morningstar, Yahoo Finance, Gartner, HfS Research, Y Charts and Intelligent Stocks.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2497985,25562,2014-09-16T07:14:27-04:00,"Cognizant Technologies operates in the IT consulting field. Revenue growth over the past ten years has exceeded 30% per year, on average.Consulting contracts are more long-term in nature, providing excellent revenue visibility.I am anticipating a double in the share price over the next five years as revenue continues to grown at a double-digit rate per year.","When constructing my portfolio, I look for companies that offer above-average gains with minimal downside risk. One of the methods I employ in minimizing downside risk is to purchase shares in a company that has fallen temporarily out of favor with Wall Street. I often find the best gains are realized by the patient long-term investor whose time horizon spans past the next quarter. Unfortunately, the Street is far more myopic, offering the one great advantage the individual investor has over the professionals - patience. Cognizant Technologies (NASDAQ:CTSH) offers investors a rare opportunity to achieve outsized rewards with below-average risk. In the article below, I will illustrate my bullish thesis on CTSH and touch upon its recent acquisition of Trizetto.CTSH data by YChartsCTSH operates in the IT consulting field, providing a range of services, such as software development and maintenance. The company plays an integral role in transitioning its customers into an e-business model. CTSH largest customers are in the financial field, accounting for roughly 42% of CTSH revenue. Healthcare-related work is the second-largest segment of CTSH revenue stream, accounting for roughly 26% of its revenue. CTSH business is contract-based, which makes the company's revenue stream rather easy to predict.CTSH Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsIt is the ease of predictability of CTSH revenue stream that initially piqued my interest in the company. CTSH revenue has grown at an annual rate of 38.5% over the past ten years, which is simply stellar. More impressive, CTSH revenue growth continued unabated even as one of the worst global recessions descended upon the world in 2008. Yes, that is correct, CTSH continued to grown revenue, in spite of a global recession.CTSH Return on Equity (TTM) data by YChartsNow that we have established CTSH business is very durable and highly predictable, the next task is to determine if the business offers rich profit margins. CTSH has managed to generate returns of capital (ROC) and equity (ROE) exceeding 20% for the past ten straight years. Operating margins have remained in a narrow band between 20%-22% over the past decade, which speaks to the profitability of the business. CTSH has managed to post such stellar ROE numbers without the use of debt; in fact, the company currently has no debt on its balance sheet. The absence of debt, coupled with such strong predictable revenues and profits allow for the ease of predicting the company's future earnings. Furthermore, the company will be offered very attractive rates on debt if it so chooses to enter the debt market to perhaps fund an acquisition to fuel future growth. That is exactly what happened today, with the announcement of the acquisition of Trizetto.TransactionStrategic RationaleFinancial ImpactFinancing(Bullet points taken from the recent acquisition announcement.)Trizetto is a privately held IT consulting company, with its main focus on servicing healthcare-related clients. Trizetto posted revenue last year of $676 million, with a customer count of 252 health plan administrators and 28 care management clients. Trizetto's operating margin was 18.4%, which is lower than CTSH; I am certain CTSH will drive the margin higher as cost-saving initiatives such as reducing redundancies are put into place. CTSH foresees significant revenue opportunities of $1.5 billion over the next five years from the combined entity. The acquisition, in my view, significantly bolsters CTSH healthcare offerings, and will have a significant impact on revenue going forward.Now that we have established CTSH strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, the next question that needs to be answered by investors revolves around the current price of the equity. Being a value investor looking to minimize risk by entering into a position at a good price, a construction of a fair value model can be quite helpful in illustrating an excellent entry point.I would like to take a moment to discuss some of the inputs used in the above model and explain why they were chosen. When constructing the above model, being conservative with basic assumptions is critical when constructing these types of models. Being aggressive with your assumptions, such as using an elevated terminal growth value, or a low WACC, can skew the fair value much higher than its actually should. In this particular instance, an investor would more than likely enter into a position at a less-than-advantage time, subjecting themselves to the potential loss of capital. I wish to avoid this unpleasant outcome, and look to minimize risk by making my projections as conservative as possible.In the case of CTSH, the model is indicating the equity is trading roughly 12% below its fair value. I would like to draw your attention to the growth and margin numbers used in the DCF analysis. The numbers used are the midpoint of the range the company has posted over the past ten years, and are below what has been produced by CTSH over the past couple of years. Furthermore, I have growth dropping below 10% in 2018, which I suspect will be proven to be on the conservative side. For example, growth in 2018 remains at 10%, and revenue will jump to $16.061 billion, which is 1.81 times 2013 revenue. It is easy to see why I am so bullish on the prospects of CTSH going forward. An 80% jump in revenue with stable margins, in my view, would imply a double from today's current quote.In my personal portfolio, I have sold AT&T (NYSE:T) and used the proceeds to acquire CTSH. I am willing to forgo the income generated by T for the potential of a double via the purchase of CTSH equity. I intend to hold CTSH for the long term to reap the benefits of this stellar company's continued growth. I would like to thank you for reading, and I look forward to your comments.

2327435,66233,2014-07-21T18:49:04-04:00,Cognizant embeds itself into the daily functions of its customers in a way that makes it difficult to extract.Businesses do not have to be cheap to present exceptional value for investors.Cognizant is priced cheaply in relationship to the returns investors can expect to reap over the next 5 years.There are three excellent ways to open a new position in Cognizant Technology Solutions today.,"Value-oriented investors must train themselves to recognize undervalued businesses even when the business does not appear on the surface to be cheap. Business valuation is much more about what a business can and will accomplish in the future as it is about what they have accomplished in the past. Investment risk comes into play due to the fact that nobody can truly predict the future with absolute certainty.Even though there are no guarantees regarding the future share price of any business, we can certainly mitigate our risk through effective due diligence. A significant part of the due diligence process is to ensure that less than obvious opportunities are not overlooked due to our preconceived perceptions regarding fair value calculations. Part of that due diligence requires that we consider our expected rate of return on our investment capital rather than just simply looking at the current valuations. In other words, we must be cognizant of the fact that high growth expectations can justify above average current valuations and still qualify for the portfolio of a serious value investor.How Does A Business Justify Premium Pricing?There are certain characteristics that endow a business with inherent value. One of those traits is being able to provide its clients with a product or service that is necessary to their business operations and difficult to remove once it becomes embedded. This gives them the ability to keep constant upward pressure on prices without losing existing customers. If the products and services fall within an area that requires sophisticated technical expertise in which to operate, it becomes even easier to assign a premium value.Investors who take the time today to acquaint themselves with the business fundamentals and characteristics of Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) will be in a position to enter into an investment that should reward them with 15% to 20% annual gains for the foreseeable future. They will also quickly come to realize that what, on the surface might appear to be a high-priced growth stock with the normal risks associated with such an investment is really more of a value investment that simply has and will continue to grow at a very rapid pace.What Makes Cognizant Special And Why Now?Cognizant Solutions is an IT consulting and outsourcing firm that assists its clients in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of their business operations. The business operates across four distinct areas of specialized expertise in the areas of financial services, healthcare, manufacturing and retail and logistics. Providing vital IT maintenance and solutions to businesses with complex needs from the IT functions places Cognizant in a very unique position within the day-to-day functionality of its clients' business operations and in a position where it is very difficult to change suppliers without serious disruption to the flow of normal activities. In layman's terms, once Cognizant embeds itself into its clients' business operations, it becomes horribly expensive to change service providers. As long as they do their job, there is little reason for a customer to change and big reasons not to even consider it.Businesses like Cognizant can leverage their unique value by offering an ever expanding line of products and services to its customers who, in many cases are completely dependent upon reliance on the recommendations from the supplier when it comes to deciding what they actually need and the benefits it will provide. This is exactly the kind of repetitive and almost addictive products that investors should dream about finding a business supplying. The more their customers consume, the more they need.Why does the opportunity exist now? At first glance, Cognizant does not appear to be priced cheaply. It is currently trading at 20.51 times estimated 2014 earnings and 20 times free cash flow. These are not bargain basement type numbers that value investors tend to seek, or are they? Maybe not if you are simply looking at the present. But, if you take the time to look forward while considering the business model, then you will see the real value in this business at today's price.First of all, the company has $5.836 billion in cash and receivables on its books and just $1.656 billion of total liabilities leaving net cash after all liabilities of almost $7/share or 13% of the market value of the entire business.Against 2015 consensus earnings, the company's P/E ratio shrinks to a 17.4 times multiple. With a projected 5-year annual earnings growth rate of 17.4%, the business is actually trading at a multiple of only 1 times the expected annual growth rate. But, we must decide if the growth rate is realistic. The best source available for that evaluation is what the business has accomplished recently. Since the past 10 years includes some of the worst business conditions since the Great Depression as part of the period, the past might give us a fair view of what to expect in the future.Over the past 5 years, Cognizant has delivered average annual returns on equity, assets and capital of 23.3%, 17.8% and 23.3% respectively. One of my calculations for establishing an estimated fair value of a business is to average these three numbers and multiply the result by the current year's projected earnings figure. The resulting average of these three measures of performance is 21.467 and, if multiplied by the current year's projected earnings of $2.41 produces a current fair value estimate of $51.73/share with an increase to $59.25/share within the next 12 months. This represents an expected return of 19.8% from the current price of $49.44.However, long-term investors need to look further out than just 12 months to assess the real potential of a business. Analysts covering the stock currently project it to expand earnings at the rate of 17.4%/year for the next 5 years. I completely understand those who will believe these estimates are on the optimistic side. I thought the same thing until I realized that between 2004 and 2013 the company increased its sales from $586.67 million to an astounding $8.84 billion and per share earnings from a paltry $0.18/share to $2.05/share with a projection to grow another 18% this year. Considering the past history of performance, 17% a year going forward suddenly looks much more believable.Accept Value Where We Find It And ActValue does not always have to be a stock that looks cheap by my traditional valuation measures. Good investments are made by selecting those stocks that are cheap compared to the realistic future expectations of the business. Stocks with the past history and future prospects of a business like Cognizant can easily be valued at twice the expected growth rate multiplied by the current year earnings. It is quite unusual to find one trading at a multiple of 1. When the projected growth rate is 17%/year and all that is required to collect that level of return on capital is to maintain the current and fair multiple, investors who can set aside preconceived notions of ""value"" and act will collect excessive returns even without improving valuations.As I always prefer having multiple attractive ways to open new positions, I am pleased that Cognizant offers that opportunity as well. For those who prefer the traditional approach of buy and hold, shares can be purchased at the market today and held until the market assigns a P/E multiple to the shares of 24 or greater.Investors who simply insist on getting discount prices for everything they buy can sell (1) August 16, 2014, $47.50 strike price put option for each 100 shares they wish to purchase and collect a premium of about $0.75/share or 1.5% of the capital required to purchase the shares. This represents an annualized return on total capital of 20.49% and would require the seller to purchase 100 shares of the stock for each option sold at a price of $47.50 each or $4,750 per contract sold. Should the seller be assigned the shares on August 16th, the purchase price would represent a discount of 3.9% to the current market price.Investors who find the current price compelling and wish to buy now; but, who would also like something a little extra thrown in, can consider buying the shares outright and simultaneously selling (1) August 16, 2014 expiration call options with a strike price of $52.50 for each 100 shares of the stock that were purchased for a premium of about $0.45/share. The sale of these options would result in an immediate return on capital of 0.91% for an annualized rate of return equal to 12.3%. Should the shares rise to a level above $52.50 by August 16th, the stock would be called away by the option buyer and the seller would achieve an additional $3.06/share (6%) in short-term capital gains. This scenario would produce a total gain of $3.06 + $0.45 or $3.51 against the $49.44 purchase price of the stock for a total gain of 7.099% over the 27 days covered by the trade for an annualized return on capital allocated equal to 95.9%.So, we have an excellent business with a great history of superior results. We have an attractive valuation based on present facts and future prospects and three superb ways to open a new position. Is there anything else needed in order to motivate investors to take action now? There shouldn't be.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1485061,24294,2013-06-06T11:25:18-04:00,,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:CTSH) is one of the world's leading suppliers of outsourced IT services. This $19.5 Bn market cap company bases its operations in India, with corporate headquarters located in the U.S. It has a record of strong earnings, has little debt and is well poised for the future. It is currently selling at a discount to its intrinsic value, which presents an excellent buying opportunity.This article surveys changes affecting the IT consulting industry, positions Cognizant beside two Indian competitors that also trade on the NYSE, and makes a compelling case for buying Cognizant Technologies now.Recent Disruptive TechnologiesOne of the recent disruptive technologies that is having an important positive impact on IT consulting firms is the increase in availability and use of mobile devices. This includes the many and evolving forms of tablet devices and the ever-expanding use of smartphones. In some cases, the distinction between the two types of devices is blurred; I offer the Samsung Galaxy Note II as an example. ""Phone? Tablet? Best of both."" Enabling these tablets and phones is the availability of wireless internet, which links the myriad of devices to each other and to the cloud. That is becoming the new model for a growing percentage of computer users.The proliferation of devices and the connectivity to the cloud are creating countless opportunities for IT consulting firms, especially those focusing on consumer devices and accomplishing the task of tying them to the corporate data world. Cognizant Technology is a leader in that area and this is discussed below in the section on, ""Next Generation Solutions."" The changing computing environment is not overlooked by Cognizant's competitors - one of them is IBM (NYSE:IBM). Chairman and CEO Ginni Rometty is quoted by Rajesh Prabhakar in his study on the Global Outsourcing Industry.Cognizant describes its approach this way:Socially Disruptive Legislation - ObamacareAnother large disruption to the current order of things is taking place with the passage of the ""The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,"" legislation also known as Obamacare. The current U.S. Healthcare IT outsourcing cost is on the order of $20 billion. It is going to undergo a surge in growth.Obamacare will extend insurance coverage to 32 million uninsured Americans. It also aims to reduce healthcare costs significantly. The development of new and efficient software systems is one of the ways to accomplish this. Key applications include patient records and enhancement of billing systems to reflect the reimbursement of expenses to providers in accordance with the new laws. This will create projects for Indian IT service providers and that will help them to keep up their revenue, maintain margin and grow their businesses. Indian offshore IT consultants, vendors such as Cognizant Technology, Wipro (WIT) and Infosys (INFY) will be some of the beneficiaries of this new business.A RiskIT consultants, including Cognizant, have been under pressure recently given the uncertainty surrounding the changes proposed by the immigration bill. The probable negative impact has caused at least one analyst to downgrade a firm, Infosys. However, Cognizant is maintaining its forecast for the full year, seeing no immediate issues. Others have stated they expect a long-term negative effect.Cognizant Technology - HistoryCognizant was founded in 1994 as a development and maintenance services arm of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. The company was spun-off as an independent organization two years later. Since 1996, Cognizant has worked closely with large organizations. Today, they are helping clients embrace powerful forces - including accelerating globalization, virtualization, a millennial mindset and new cloud-based technologies - that are forcing companies to rethink traditional ways of working. Officially based in Teaneck, N.J., Cognizant Technologies is operationally a Bangalore, India-based firm. By choosing to build a U.S. based management team, Cognizant won the confidence of U.S. Corporations. Using Americans with experience in the U.S. business culture has helped greatly in solidifying consultant-client roles - this is a competitive advantage. Most of the deliverables come through the cost-saving offshore work force.Cognizant Technology delivers its consulting and outsourcing services with 162,700 employees serving over 800+ active clients on 5 continents. This resulted in revenues of $7.66 Bn for 2012.The company calls its consulting model the Two-in-a-Box client engagement model, and tell customers, ""You're assured the onsite attention of a Client Manager, experienced in your industry, working on site with you. Paired with the Client Manager is a dedicated Delivery Manager, who may be located at any of our global, near shore or local delivery centers. One team is assigned to work on your project from start to finish, becoming an extension of your staff.""Cognizant's recent success is shown in this series of charts from the 2012 Annual Report.Next Generation SolutionsCognizant Technology is an innovative leader in reshaping the way businesses work and deliver value in this time of dynamic change. It introduces its approach by stating,""The way businesses work and deliver value has never been more dynamic: Globalization, cloud and social computing technologies, new workforce demographics, and a stubborn economic reset are all reshaping how work gets done. To prepare for the future, organizations are rethinking how to define, deploy, source and manage their technology and business services. We provide forward-thinking companies with new solutions and perspectives that help navigate the challenges, and exciting opportunities, facing today's enterprise.""Throughout the Information Technology world, both IT managers and their consultants acknowledge that new solutions are required by the proliferation of mobile devices. One consultant sums it up in an article by quoting IDC and saying,Exploitation of this growing area, which focuses in part on the integration of typically consumer devices, such as Smart Phones and Tablets, into the corporate IT environment is part of the Next Generation of computing. There is a new acronym in the IT world describing this phenomenon, BYOD, which is short for Bring Your Own Device. These devices, with growing access to wireless internet and cloud computing, are part of an important paradigm shift.Focused Marketing - Flexibility in SolutionsBusiness growth rarely happens accidentally. Cognizant Technology finds success in a focused approach with a limited number of verticals. The Financial Times reports,Besides the good luck of being well positioned in the U.S. Healthcare market, Cognizant Technologies brings a qualitative difference to the table, flexibility. It is able to combine the various IT services it offers into more flexible packages that appeal to cost-conscious blue-chip clients, such as those in the financial industries.Recessionary SetbacksSlashed IT budgets caused Cognizant Technologies and its competitors to suffer greatly during the economic downturn starting in 2008, and IT departments are still cautious about spending. The red line on the below chart indicates the year-to-year percentage of growth in outsourced computing. The industry is crawling back to growth, but it is growth at a slower rate than in the past and often with lower margins.As can be seen from the below 5-year stock price chart, Cognizant Technology has not only recovered from the recession but is clearly outpacing its Indian competitors.Missing its numbers for the quarter that ended March 31, 2013 caused the two similar sized Indian based consultancies to take a hit in the market in April. Infosys suffered the worst blow, and was down 20% on April 13, 2013, after missing by 7%. Wipro missed by 4%. Generally, it was a bad quarter for technology, as giant U.S. based IBM missed numbers by 8%. The market punished Cognizant Technologies for the failure of its peers.Cognizant is seeing demand across the board, company CEO Francisco D'Souza said in the earnings release.""Our performance during the first quarter was strong and we are encouraged by the healthy demand for our broad range of services,"" he said. ""We continue to make solid progress developing emerging offerings in new markets, new SMAC (social, mobile, analytics and cloud computing) technologies and new non-linear solutions and services.""ValuationThe future price of a stock is more closely associated with its future earnings than other measurable factors. Being a younger firm than its Tier I Indian competitors, the last 10 years of P/E ratios includes the rapid early growth of a new firm. Therefore, the early growth of earnings and resultant high P/E ratios are less relevant as a predictive factor than the more recent ones. In addition, since the beginning of the recession, there has been a great caution and restraint in IT spending. To some degree, we believe that will continue. So, therefore, while we are basing our intermediate and longer-term outlook on the F.A.S.T. Graph tools, we are selecting to use a relatively short backward look of 4 years to establish a baseline P/E ratio.The black line in the above graph depicts the price history of Cognizant for the past 4 years. The stock has been fairly volatile and has a 3-year beta of 1.27, which is an increase from the 5-year beta of 1.11, and a lower still pre-recession volatility. The current price shows the stock underpriced compared to its earnings justified valuation of $90, as it is currently trading at about $65.While part of the reason for Cognizant's current low price is lower expectations in a time of slower IT industry growth, the majority of the disconnect is caused by contagion from poorly performing peers. This Forecast Calculator anticipates an average 5-year return of 19.2%.This, very simply, illustrates the excellent opportunity to buy this stock well below its intrinsic value.

1950681,39791,2014-01-16T17:09:29-05:00,,"I had recommended Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) as a top software and service company to buy some time ago and had advised investors to sell IBM (NYSE:IBM), as I considered CTSH as a much better stock. I have been proved right on both counts, as IBM has declined while CTSH has seen its stock price increase. Cognizant has been an amazing stock for investors to hold over the last 10 years, having substantially outperformed not only its software peers but also the iconic technology companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company has very good management and has kept up the growth momentum, even as bigger peers such as Wipro (NYSE:WIT) and Infosys (NYSE:INFY) have faltered. IBM, the big daddy of software services, has seen its revenues stagnate for the last decade, even as Cognizant Technology has seen its stock price increase by almost 20x. Cognizant has benefited last year due to the tailwinds of rupee depreciation against the dollar and a slowdown in India's economy, which has led to declining real wages. We think that investors should look to buy dips as the company has proven itself both during the up and down cycles.FY 2015 growth is expected to be better than forecasted according to NASSCOMIndia's main software industry body NASSCOM expects that growth in FY 2015 will be better than FY 2014 (12-14% growth). This is on account of India's main markets of USA, Britain seeing stronger economic growth which will lead to more IT spending. Recent results by companies such as Infosys have beaten expectations as companies ride on the secular tailwinds of rupee depreciation and recovery in Western economies. Cognizant has typically grown at a faster rate than the industry and 20-22% growth in FY 2015 for CTSH should be considered a base case. The company is forecasting a growth of more than 20% in FY 2014.IBM Revenue (Annual YoY Growth) data by YChartsNew services Social, Analytics and Cloud offerings growing rapidlyCognizant Technology has started focusing on Horizon 3 services, especially the Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud (SMAC) segment. The company believes that the future growth is in these areas and has put considerable resources to expand the SMAC segment. The management has said that the company is already making $500 million in revenues annually from SMAC and that the growth has been faster than they expected.Real Wages in India are stagnating even as Rupee has depreciated sharplyEmployee costs are the biggest cost component for software and service companies. The Indian outsourcers such as Infosys, TCS and HCL have been facing margin pressure as wages in India were rising in the middle part of the last decade. The sharp boom in Indian IT outsourcing led to increased demand for engineers leading to sharp wage increases. However this trend has reversed now, as hiring has slowed even as the supply of engineers in India has increased manifold. A recent Credit Suisse study has showed how the real wages for entry level engineers has fallen over the last decade. With hundreds of thousands of engineers passing out each year, Cognizant and other Indian IT companies are set to benefit from the secular decline in wage costs (at least at the entry level).The rupee has depreciated sharply against the US dollar in the last year as India's current account deficit has become very high. Economic mismanagement has led to India's GDP growth decline sharply, while the deficit has remained stubbornly high due to high fertilizer and oil subsidies. Indian exporters have gained tremendously as their products and services have become more competitive and their rupee earnings have increased. It looks unlikely that the rupee will appreciate, as there are indications that India's national elections (which will be held in May 2014) will result in a weak coalition government.Cognizant Risksa) Not gained traction in selling higher Value Added Services - Cognizant has struggled to compete with the likes of IBM and Accenture (NYSE:ACN) in selling higher value added services such as consulting. It gets a majority of its revenue from plain vanilla IT development and BPO services. Its consulting services are still not at par with those sold by Accenture. The company probably needs to look into acquiring a pure play major consulting company in order to break into the top ranks.b) IT automation reduces need for Cognizant services - Technology advancements have reduced the need for manpower in doing routine and repetitive work. IBM is using its Watson technology to offer new service offerings to its clients.Stock Valuation is Not ExpensiveCognizant has seen its stock price increase by more than 25% in the last year, even as our favorite short in the software industry has declined by ~3%. Cognizant has not seen its stock price increase as fast as the Indian stock market listed companies such as TCS, HCL Technology etc. as it is quoted in USD.Cognizant is not expensive with a forward P/E of 16.9x and is cheaper compared to Indian listed outsourcers, who are trading at a forward P/E of greater than 20x. The company should grow by 20% plus rates over the next 2 years at least, which means that there is scope for multiple expansion. IBM which has stagnated is trading at a forward P/E of 9.4x, while Infosys trades at forward P/E of 17.2x.CTSH Total Return Price data by YChartsSummaryCognizant has been the best performing software services stock over the last decade and has given multi bagger returns to investors. The company is still growing at over 20% annually despite its larger base. The company is focusing on fast growing areas such as Social, Analytics and Cloud which will maintain its growth momentum. Even at $100, Cognizant remains a good buy for long-term investors given the company's history and future growth prospects. We look to buy dips in CTSH as the company still has a lot of space to grow.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1452941,38631,2013-05-22T08:44:02-04:00,,"As the stock market keeps reaching new highs, many investors are discouraged from investing in stocks, feeling that the risk to reward ratio is against them. However, this notion is wrong for two reasons. First of all, when the stock market records new all-time highs, it transmits a very positive technical signal, implying that the technological progress has made it possible to shift to completely new levels of welfare and subsequently stock market prices. For instance, levels of Dow Jones above 1,000 seemed impossible till 1980. However, the stock market exhibited a tremendous rally from 1980 to 2000, when it advanced from 1,000 to 10,000. The second reason for the fallacy of the above notion is the existence of undervalued companies, even at the current levels.Description of the companyCognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) provides information technology and helps numerous companies improve their efficiency and withstand the pressure of highly-competitive markets. About 78% of its revenue comes from the US, with the balance coming from Europe. The company has about 137,700 employees, from which the 112,000 are high-skilled, low-salary Asians, who greatly enhance the earnings capacity of the company while keeping its operational cost at a minimum.The revenue from its 5 top customers is only 16% of its total revenue and hence there is minimal risk from losing a major customer. Even better, it is very rare for the company to lose customers because its customers sign long-term contracts and become greatly dependent once they initiate this type of business.Past performanceSince 2002, Cognizant has managed to increase its earnings per share (EPS) by 30 times! One could argue that the company started small and hence it was easy to grow rapidly but the company is still growing about 20% per year. Even more impressive is the fact that Cognizant has pronouncedly enhanced its earnings every single year, even during the great recession of 2009, when it raised its earnings by 22%. When a company exhibits such an exceptional performance under the most adverse conditions, its shareholders have almost nothing to fear of.Cash positionAnother strong point of Cognizant is that its cash and its receivables greatly exceed its debt. Therefore, not only does it essentially carry no debt but it also has a strong cash position of about $3.1 B, which corresponds to a net cash position slightly greater than $10 per share.ValuationApart from the great recession, Cognizant has traded at a P/E ratio between 16 and 25. As it is a fast-growing company, even a purchase at a P/E 25 would not destroy its investors, as the growing earnings would greatly boost the stock price after a while.Nevertheless, the current P/E is only 16, corresponding to EPS $4.0 in 2013 and the current stock price, $64. This P/E is near the historical minimum, it is lower than the current P/E of S&P (about 18) and represents a unique bargain for a company that grows 20% every year. It would be reasonable only for a cash cow or a company with minimal growth. Even better, when one subtracts the cash per share of the company ($10), the current P/E becomes equivalent to 13.5.DividendAs Cognizant is still in a high-growth phase, it does not distribute any dividends. This might seem as a negative to some investors but in reality it results in an exceptional compounded growth and a simultaneously growing cash position and book value, which will always support the stock price. I would actually be disappointed if the opposite were true; if the company initiated a dividend, it would send a clear signal that the high-growth phase was approaching an end.Risk to reward ratioConsidering the historic behavior of the stock and the normal P/E range for a high-growth stock, an investor can expect the stock to reach a P/E 20-25 within a year, which corresponds to a price range between $80 and $100, representing an upward move between 25% and 56%.In reference to the potential downside, even if an investor is so unlucky that the company does not grow its earnings for the first year in its history, the stock price could remain at the current levels or, in the worst case, fall to $50. It is almost impossible to fall below $50 because that level would represent an essential P/E 10, as the company has a net cash position of $10 per share. The strong cash position and the absence of debt provide a strong floor for the stock price even in the worst-case scenario. It should be noted that the stock has not fallen below $54 during the last 3 years. Moreover, in the two cases it fell to that level, it bounced by 50%.Reason for the current opportunityThe recent 18% steep decline of the stock from $78 to $64 started on April 12th, when Infosys (NYSE:INFY), another tech outsourcing company, lowered its guidance for this year's revenue growth from 12% to 6-10%. However, Infosys is a different case from Cognizant. To be sure, its revenue growth had already fallen to 6% last year and hence its guidance is not that surprising. Moreover, its EPS did not grow at all during the last year, while the EPS of Cognizant grew 20%.Given the above facts and the uninterrupted record of Cognizant, I believe that the concerns about this company have been exaggerated. To be sure, when Cognizant announced its own results a month after Infosys, it met the expectations of analysts and did not lower its guidance for the year. The guidance of Cognizant has an excellent record and hence it is absolutely reliable.CatalystAs mentioned above, the stock of Cognizant has visited the current levels twice in the last 3 years and both times it bounced by 50%. I believe the history will repeat itself once more. The catalyst will probably be the next earnings report of the company (due on August 5th), which will likely prove that the company is maintaining its impressive past growth rate. Of course the market may reward the stock much earlier, as usual.The current valuation of Cognizant would be reasonable only if its growth stalled completely, which is not the case for this company. Its current cheap valuation is not sustainable for a company that grows 15%-20% year after year.Disclosure: I am long CTSH. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1313851,43091,2013-04-02T05:08:24-04:00,,"The last time I wrote on here was just before Cognizant Technology's (NASDAQ:CTSH) earnings for FY12 and Q4:12. The shares were trading right around here and saw a small pop post-earnings but came shy of my $85/share price target post earnings. The Indian IT and quasi-Indian IT (CTSH, due to the fact that its a US-based company with the majority of its work force based in India, is thus quasi-Indian) sector has received a lot of ho hum articles on Seeking Alpha and also received a few downgrades by sellside analysts. They are wrong! Here's a few reasons that they seem to have missed:The majority of pricing cut seems to now be in the past. Take for instance Infosys (NYSE:INFY); EBITDA margins declined by 530 basis points in the last year as productivity also dropped by 5% over the same period. It would seem that the discounts the company had to provide in order to continue its business traction is almost over with. If there is still going to be any adverse impact to margins, it will be minimal.Current utilization rates at the Indian and quasi-Indian IT companies are at record lows and as volume momentum returns in 2013 and beyond, utilization rates should go up by about 5-7% for the sector.All these companies are continuing with their hiring activity at a frenetic pace, hiring at the rate of several thousand new employees per month, month in and month out. A sure sign that management teams expect better revenue momentum going forward.After the challenges these companies have been through since the financial crises, there have been tremendous improvement made in internal operating performance which will help offset the still slightly sluggish external operating environment as clients are still holding on to their purse strings fairly tightly. In addition, clients are still having difficulty on clarity beyond a quarter or two, but the improvements made to the internal operating improvement should be enough to offset those issues.All the Indian and quasi-Indian IT companies are making a strong push into continental Europe which is where there is tremendous scope for growth going forward. European companies need to bring down costs significantly and outsourcing of IT is one sure fire way to do it and management teams know that. Look for more work coming to IT companies as continental European company management teams start to focus on improving operating efficiencies.The US SEC is set to start the bidding process on its $4 billion Consolidated Audit Trail National Market System (CAT NMS) project sometime this month and I expect the two companies mentioned in this article to win different parts of this massive $4 billion pie, thanks to their expertise in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) verticals. This is a high profile deal and will be a feather in their caps when the winners are announced and could be good for 3-5% gains in the shares on announcement of the winners alone. Chatter is that the expression of interest deadline was March 5, 2013, and the bidding process will begin April 25, 2013.Cognizant is expected to report earnings of $0.93/share on revenues of $2.01 billion for its Q1 ended March 31, 2013. For FY13, current estimates are for earnings of $3.98/share on revenues of $8.62 billion.Infosys is expected to report earnings of $0.74/share on revenues of $1.99 billion for its Q4 ended March 31, 2013. For FY:14, the Street is expecting earnings of $3.15/share on revenues of $8.25 billion.In my opinion, estimates are muted for both companies at the moment and should be going up as we move through the year.In summation, filter out the noise and chatter, and focus on these names over the short-to-medium term where returns could be anywhere from 10% to 20% depending on one's time frame.Until the next time, safe investing.Disclosure: I am long CTSH, INFY.

1133801,39791,2013-01-25T11:03:05-05:00,,"IntroductionCognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) has been a star technology company, giving superb growth and returns over the last decade. Let me start by asking you which has been the best performing technology company in the past 10 years - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Cognizant or Priceline (PCLN)? I would expect that most of you would not come up with the right answer. The right answer is Cognizant, which has given an eye-popping 18596% return over the last decade, beating all of the above mentioned companies by a very wide margin. The reason you might have got the answer wrong is that the media and the investor community have been largely ignoring this stock, despite spectacular revenue and earnings growth. Cognizant has continued to outperform its larger Indian and U.S. competitors and has become the new ""Infosys"" of the computer services space. While Infosys is facing a revenue growth slowdown, Cognizant has continued to beat market expectations. We think that investors should look to buy dips, as the company has proven itself both during up and down cycles.Cognizant - Lot of Things to LikeCognizant RisksStock Valuation is Comparable to PeersCTSH is neither cheap nor expensive, with a P/S of 3.4x and P/B of 5.2x. The forward P/E of ~17x is also not expensive given the forward growth projections. In comparison Infosys trades at a P/S and P/B of 4.1x and 4.4x respectively. The forward P/E at 16.3x is also very similar to that of CTSH.SummaryWe have been surprised at how little attention CTSH has got amongst the technology and financial media, despite the spectacular returns it has given. The main reason is that the company does not operate in the latest technology fashion areas of ""daily deals"" or ""social media."" This is probably the reason that the company has never seen irrational investor exuberance like other tech stocks such as Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). However, we think that CTSH remains one of the best technology stocks given its history of exponential growth despite strong competition, great management and an excellent balance sheet. We look to buy dips in CTSH as the company still has a lot of space to grow.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1156971,43091,2013-02-05T10:57:44-05:00,,"Prior to Infosys' (NYSE:INFY) blowout earnings a couple of weeks ago [see call transcript], most sellsiders were expecting the company to report tepid earnings and revenue based on assumptions (proven wrong by INFY) that the company would see slower than expected ramp-ups, Hurricane Sandy would have adversely impacted revenue growth and increased bench strength. When Infosys reported numbers on January 11, the numbers were a positive surprise on every metric. For FQ3 (ended Dec 31, 2012), Infosys reported revenues of $1.91 billion, up 6.35% QoQ and up 5.83% YoY, beating Street estimates of $1.85 billion. Earnings per share came in at $0.76/share versus Street expectations of $0.72/share.For the full year ending March 31, 2013, Infosys guided revenues to at least $7.45 billion and earnings of at least $2.97/share versus Street estimates of $7.32 billion and $2.95/share. Infosys shares were up almost 20% on the day after their beat.All that is well and good and a done deal now. However, for those of you that missed the earnings pop in Infosys, all is not lost. You have another chance with quasi-Indian outsourcing firm, Cognizant Technologies (NASDAQ:CTSH), which is set to report results for its December quarter this week. The company will report on February 7, 2013 before the market opens for regular trading. Current Street consensus is for earnings of $0.91/share on revenues of $1.95 billion for the December quarter. For the March quarter, the sellside expects earnings of $0.93/share on revenues of an even $2 billion. For full year 2013, current Street estimates are earnings of $4/share on revenues of $8.58 billion. Over the last four quarters, Cognizant has beat estimates three times and met estimates once.Since Infosys reported numbers a couple of weeks ago, shares of the company are up over 15% while Cognizant Technologies shares have been relatively flat to up 1.5% or so.Recently President Barack Obama said that the US needs to overhaul its healthcare system to include an additional 30 million citizens and that states need to build online exchanges that will link the insured, new and existing to their insurance companies via the internet. President Obama has demanded that the individual states and insurance companies set up online exchanges that will allow consumers to evaluate various insurance coverage plans and then choose the service provider that best suits their needs. This is an area of huge opportunity for Cognizant Technologies and one where it has a commanding lead over the Indian It/outsourcing companies like Infosys, Mahindra Satyam et al. As the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) vertical is currently faced with some challenges due to global economic uncertainty, health care will more than pick up the slack. Bloomberg recently stated that spending on health care could exceed funds deployed for Social Security and defense by 2014-2015.Look for strong numbers from Cognizant which could lead to at least a 10% gain in the shares post earnings. My price target is north of $85 per share post results.Disclosure: I am long CTSH, INFY. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

2902696,24634,2015-02-10T10:57:38-05:00,Cognizant is an outsource company with most of its employees in India.It recently expanded its healthcare presence with the acquisition of TriZetto.Cognizant is a double play on India AND healthcare infrastructure.,"Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) is one of the largest providers of technology, consulting and business process outsourcing services. The company was founded in 1994 as a captive arm of Dun & Bradstreet and started trading on the NASDAQ in 1998. The stock just hit an all-time high after reporting 4Q earnings and revenues that exceeded analyst estimates. One of the key drivers this quarter was a 26% surge in revenue from the healthcare division, its second biggest division behind financial services.Cognizant expanded its healthcare offering to take advantage of the industry-wide overhaul of the healthcare system spurred by the Healthcare Reform Act. Last year Cognizant purchased TriZetto, which expanded its healthcare industry software. The acquisition was its biggest to date at $2.7 billion in cash, but clearly, Cognizant is reaping the benefits from this acquisition.Even though Cognizant is based in Teaneck, New Jersey, the company also represents a way to play India. Like many IT services firms, Cognizant uses a global delivery model based on offshore R&D and offshore outsourcing. While 80% of its revenue comes from North America, most of its workforce is in India.If you are going to outsource, India is a good place to go given its highly skilled, cheap, and English-speaking workforce. Like its India rivals Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys (NYSE:INFY), Cognizant gets its biggest chunk of revenue from financial services clients. Cognizant has more than 150,000 employees globally, of which over 100,000 are in India across 10 different locations. In addition to India, Cognizant has 9 U.S. delivery centers, and more global delivery centers in the UK, Hungary, China, The Philippines, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico.Why invest in India? India's economy is recovering from its weakest period of growth in decades. Thanks to new government policy reforms and low oil prices, India is on track to pass up China as the world's fastest growing economy by 2016. These favorable economic trends are pushing India's stock market higher. Over the last year, the India stock market (BATS:INDA) is up 42%. The stock broke out last fall and continues to keep breaking out. Finally, thanks to favorable economics, Cognizant finally has the wind at its back.Investors can invest in an India mutual fund or ETF, or they can invest in a U.S.-based company like Cognizant, which has exposure to India. Cognizant is gaining market share versus the likes of IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Accenture (NYSE:ACN), plus the stock is a way to gain exposure to the favorable economic trends bolstering India.So let's take a closer look at the stock.Cognizant Technology Solutions is a Large Cap stock with a market capitalization of $35.2 billion. Its Risk Profile is Conservative. I am long in my Conservative Growth accounts.Data from Best Stocks Now appWith a trailing P/E of 25 and a forward P/E of 19, Cognizant earns a Value Grade of B.

In this case, CTSH call options returned a nice gain in just 5 trading days. For example, the December $70s increased from $0.23 to Wednesday's close at $1.30, a whopping 465% gain. Interestingly, the open interest on these calls nearly tripled from November 9th to November 12th. (All options data from Etrade.com).The options action continues to throw up mixed signals as put volume surged yet again despite the rally in CTSH. This time the December $65 and $67.50 puts saw a lot of action: 1,656 contracts traded versus 4,203 in open interest and 632 contracts traded versus 1,097 in open interest respectively. Call options were traded in much lower volumes in absolute and relative terms.The key lesson here - one that is good to learn and learn again - is that options volume is not always what it seems. It can be very hard to distinguish between volume motivated by buyers and volume motivated by sellers - unless you have access to transaction information indicating whether trades are getting done at the bid, indicating sellers, or at the ask, indicating buyers. Moreover, it can help to review recent history on options volume. Historic trade volumes not consistent with current trade volumes throw any hypothesis into doubt.Regardless, I will keep CTSH in my sights. A close above the October high will be very bullish and suggest that the next rally in the shares is well underway. This becomes the more likely scenario given CTSH's recent 8K release suggests that revenue expectations for 2013 are safe and sound.Be careful out there!Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in CTSH over the next 72 hours.

It is CTSH's sixth straight positive close on strong buying volume. CTSH has closed up 9 out of the last 10 trading days.Cognizant Technology now at the edge of a breakoutSource: FreeStockCharts.comDespite the strength on display, traders continue to dabble heavily in put options on CTSH. This time, the January $72.50 puts experienced the high volume: 2,727 contracts traded against an open interest of just 308. This strike hosted the most active options volume, by far, on CTSH for the day.The open interest put/call ratio has been rising along with the rally in CTSH's stock, from 0.80 to 1.30 at one point. It is now sitting at the 86th percentile for the past 52-weeks. Normally, I would assume that these puts are trading as bets the rally will soon reverse. Such a reversal is approximately what happened when the put/call ratio ran up to 1.50 by mid-October and when the put/call ratio ran up as high as 1.30 in April ahead of a disastrous earnings report in May. However, a sharp and temporary spike in July punctuated a bottom in CTSH. A run-up to near 1.30 in mid-December preceded a 3-month rally. (All put/call ratios obtained from Schaeffer's Investment Research). It is difficult to compare these run-ups to each other without knowing the specific months and strikes that drove the open interest. However, it seems OK to assume that ""something"" big lies ahead for CTSH. This current test of the October highs could provide the important pivot.As I stated earlier, my bias remains to the upside. With this bias, I am assuming that the heavy put volume is driven by traders looking for premium ahead of the next phase of CTSH's rally. For these traders, the worst case scenario is that they buy CTSH for about a $2 discount to current prices. As the chart above shows, such a price drop puts CTSH just above its May pre-earnings price.For the traders looking to make bearish bets, I would have expected put spreads with the Jan $72.50 as the long side of the spread. Absent a spread, buying the $70 or even $67.50 strikes offer much better leverage.Regardless, CTSH is now firmly planted on my radar as I continue to look for the best opportunity under the circumstances to make my next bullish bet.Be careful out there!Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in CTSH over the next 72 hours.

At the time, I argued this marked an opportunity to start accumulating the shares (see ""Planning To Accumulate Cognizant Technology Even As It Fights To Hold 2-Year Lows""). The trade paid off much faster than I expected once CTSH soared after its August earnings and soon ran up to its 200-day moving average. I decided to sell in anticipation of a pullback but instead CTSH went on to fill the May earnings gap.Cognizant Technology is cooling off againSource: FreeStockCharts.comAs the chart above shows, CTSH has now returned to the point where I sold it. It is also now in a precarious trading position having broken its 50DMA again and now selling just under the 200DMA. Heavy options trading is emphasizing the alarm bells.On Tuesday, November 27th, 4083 options contracts sold at the December $62.50 strike against open interest of only 431 contracts. I am assuming most of these will convert into open interest given CTSH barely budged on the day. I highly doubt these options were sold for a premium given the high of only $0.65 per contract. Options sold for premium by bullish traders and investors are more likely to occur close to the current trading price, like the December $65 puts which closed at double the price of the December $62.50s. Instead, these trades have every appearance of speculators trying to get ahead of a large sell-off. With just over three weeks to go until expiration, time will soon tell whether this signal materializes into anything.This bearish trade sticks out particularly given the relative benign, even bullish, options setup on CTSH before Tuesday's trade. From Schaeffer's Investment Research:In other words, the swell in put trading for near-month expiration stands in such stark contrast to all the other signals that it makes a lot of sense to sit up and take note. Depending on what news unfolds between now and the December options expiration, I will prepare for accumulating shares into a sell-off. I will welcome the opportunity to participate again in CTSH's long-term uptrend at cheaper prices.Be careful out there!Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in CTSH over the next 72 hours.

The provider of custom information technology services reported a strong set of quarterly results.Q2 Results Are InThe provider of information technology, consulting, and business processing services reported second quarter revenues of $1.795 billion. Revenues were up 4.9% compared to the first quarter, and 20.9% higher compared to last year. GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.82 versus $0.67 last year. Earnings were negatively impacted by $0.02 per share, as a result of a strong U.S. dollar.The company added six new strategic customers over the quarter, including Philips Electronics. Growth in the remainder of 2012 will mostly come from a ramp-up of current clients, rather than from new client growth.CEO Francisco D'Souza commented on the results: Revenue SourcesFinancial services is still the dominant revenue source for the company. Sales came in at $736.9 million, up 20.3% compared to last year. Healthcare revenues rose 25.3% to $484.3 million, while manufacturing and logistical revenues are up 21.8% to $358.6 million. ""Other"" revenues rose 12.4% to $215.4 million.Revenues in North America increased 24.2% to $1.43 billion. Growth in Europe came in at a mere 2.1%, or $282.7 million, driven by a 3.8% growth rate in the U.K. Revenues in the rest of the company's global rose 45.1% to $77.6 million.OutlookFor the third quarter, Cognizant anticipates revenues of at least $1.875 billion. GAAP-diluted earnings per share are expected to come in at $0.86.For the full year of 2012, the company projects revenues of at least $7.34 billion, up 20% compared to 2011. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis are expected at $3.38. The outlook is in-line with analysts' forecasts of earnings of $3.37 per share on revenues of $7.34 billion.ValuationCognizant Technology ended its second quarter with $2.35 billion in cash and equivalents. The company operates without debt, resulting in a net cash position of roughly $2.3 billion. For the first six months of 2012, the company reported revenues of $3.50 billion, on which it reported net earnings of $496 million, or $1.61 per diluted share.Factoring in today's 11% jump in the share price, the market values the firm at $19.5 billion. Excluding the company's net cash position, the market values the operating assets at $17.2 billion. Based on the full year outlook of $7.3 billion in revenues and diluted earnings per share of $3.38, the firm is valued at 2.4 times annual revenues and 17 times expected earnings for 2012.The valuation compares to a revenue multiple of 2.1 times for IBM (IBM) and 3.2 times for Infosys (INFY). These firms trade at 14 and 13 times earnings, respectively.Currently, Cognizant Technology does not pay a dividend.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of Cognizant trade flat after today's gains. Shares rose steadily to peaks of $78 in March, but fell sharply to $56 in May after the company issued soft guidance for the remainder of 2012.Shares of Cognizant have returned over 50% over the past five years. The stock rose from $20 in the beginning of 2009, peaking around $80 in the beginning of 2011. From that point in time, shares have moved within a $60-$80 trading range.Today's results take away some worries among investors, after the company's disappointing outlook announcement in May. Strong revenue and profit growth, combined with a solid balance sheet, is promising for the future, meaning long term investors can pick up a solid technology company at a fair price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Spun-off as a separate company in 1998 at a price of $10 per share, Cognizant's culture reflects extensive international business experience and educational backgrounds among its senior management. A good example is the company's CEO, Francisco D'Souza, who was born in Kenya, educated in Asia and the U.S., and has lived throughout the world.Over the past five years, Cognizant has generated industry-leading growth and rising profitability with sales compounding at a 30% annual rate to more than $6 billion with net income and EPS both growing at 26% annual rates over the same period. Just 17 years after launching the company, Cognizant joined the Fortune 500 ranking of America's largest companies.Cognizant has delivered this growth by helping its more than 800 clients operate more cost-effectively and efficiently through investments in information technology. Cognizant also enables clients to respond to economic and competitive pressures through its consulting and business process outsourcing services. As companies are being transformed by mobile devices, cloud computing, predictive analytics, social networks and global commerce, Cognizant Technology Solutions helps clients use these technologies to increase flexibility, lower costs and decrease time to market.Cognizant serves an expanding and broad array of industries including financial services, which accounted for 41% of 2011 revenues; healthcare, which represented 27% of sales; manufacturing/retail/logistics, which were 20% of revenues; and other industries making up the balance.STRONG CASH FLOWCognizant's business generates strong cash flows with free cash flow compounding at a 37% annual growth rate over the last decade. During the first half of 2012, free cash flow jumped 68% to $287 million with cash on the debt-free balance sheet topping $2.3 billion as of 6/30/12. Given an attractive stock valuation, the firm spent $419 million on share repurchases during the first half.PROFITABLE OPERATIONSCognizant's business model is highly profitable with return on shareholders' equity exceeding 20% each year over the last decade. Despite a challenging macro-environment, demand for Cognizant's services remains strong as they continue to capture market share. Economic downturns serve as a catalyst for clients to embrace a broader range of Cognizant's services. During the second quarter, the company closed a number of significant transformational engagements including a $330 million expansion with ING U.S. and a comprehensive, multi-year engagement with European-based Royal Philips Electronics.Management forecasts further double-digit growth in 2012 with sales expected to rise about 20% to at least $7.3 billion with EPS expected to be at least $3.38.

The bull-put credit spread was entered in an attempt to recover the -7.6% loss sustained for the protected covered call. The -7.6% loss for the protected covered call is much easier to recover than the -16% loss sustained for a long position in Cognizant's stock.A protected covered call may be entered by selling a call option against a stock and using some of the proceeds from selling the call option to purchase a put option for protection. The protected covered call provides a position with the potential to generate a return even if the price of the stock remains stagnant, yet also provides protection in case the stock price takes a hit.A bull-put credit spread may be entered for a credit by selling one put option and purchasing a second put option further out-of-the-money. The goal is for the options to expire worthless at expiration and to keep the initial net credit as profit.In the most recent article, a management point of $57.50 was set for the bull-put credit spread. If the price of the stock drops below $57.50, consideration for managing the position for an exit or a roll should be given. The price of Cognizant's stock has breached the $57.50 management point (shown below), so we'll investigate the alternatives for a roll or an exit.To exit the current position requires a net debit of $0.70 as found by PowerOptions' tools and shown below:The initial bull-put credit spread position was entered for a net credit of $0.46, so closing at a net debit of $0.70 will realize a loss of -$0.24 which represents a loss of about -5%, so exiting does not look like a great choice at this point.Since exiting does not look attractive, we'll investigate rolling down and out-in-time. Looking at July, the 2012 Jul 47.5/52.5 bull-put credit spread can be entered for a net credit of $0.88 as found by PowerOptions' tools and as shown below:It is possible to roll the 2012 Jun 50/55 bull-put credit spread to the 2012 Jul 47.5/52.5 bull-put credit for a net credit of $0.18 ($0.88-$0.70), which represents and additional potential return of about 3.6% and a total potential return for both bull-put credit spreads of 13.7%. The 13.7% return also represents a net return of 6.1% over the -7.6% loss sustained for the protected covered call.A management point for the new bull-put credit spread position is set for $54.50.

The company serves clients primarily in North American and Europe with a focus on the financial, health care, and retail/manufacturing/logistics industries. CTSH's fast growth, over 34% annual revenue growth in the last 5 years, and consistent performance is driven by its high-quality consultative approach and deep client partnership. CTSH is a young, active player in the rapidly growing IT services market and has the highest growth profile among its peers despite the global economic slowdown. The long-term outlook for CTSH is bright and recession concerned investors should take a look at this investment opportunity.Earnings and FundamentalsAs reported on Nov. 7, 2012, CTSH posted Q3 results with $0.91 EPS for the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of $0.87 by $0.04. The revenue of $1.89 billion also beat the consensus estimate of $1.88 billion. The company's revenue was up 18.2% on a year-over-year basis.

Nomura also reiterated its buy rating and increased its target price from $75 to $80. As directly quoted from Nomura, From a fundamentals perspective, CTSH's 3 year average revenue growth of 29.5 has strongly outpaced the industry average of 4.9 in the IT services industry. The operating margin of 18.5% and net margin of 14.2% are indicating the strong operation efficiency as compared to the averages of 4.1 and 3.7. The remarkable 23.9 ROE, accompanied by zero debt-to-equity, makes CTSH shine in the industry. CTSH is currently under-valued with P/E of 21.1 as compared to the average of 22.7. Strong fundamentals and a solid growth outlook make CTSH a great long-term investment.Outsourcing provides the leverages, allowing the companies to save time, money, free up resources, and gain professional knowledge with ""insider know-how and tricks"" and ""connections,"" thus reducing the risk and improving the efficiency for business operation and development. For IT outsourcing, it is recession-proof as companies will need more IT infrastructures and services to improve their operation efficiency and resource utilization rate. CTSH's outsourcing business model allows it to grow even in the recession or economic slowdown with the increased demand.Technical AnalysisOn Nov. 9, 2012, CTSH closed at $66.00 with 1.12% gain, where the volume of 3.38M is 36.84% more than the 30 day average of 2.47M. The 52 week price range for the CTSH is from $53.92 to $78.00. The MACD (12, 26, 9) had been showing a bearish sign since Oct. 9 2012; however, the MACD difference continued to converge since early November. CTSH is currently trading below its 50-day MV of $68.27 and 200-day MV of $66.66. The RSI (14) of 40.36 is showing a stabilized selling moment as it moves up toward the middle line at 50. If CTSH fails to rebound above its 200-day MV, the next support will be at $64.15, S1 pivot point, followed by $61.65, S2 pivot point, as seen from the chart below.Source: StockCharts.comOptions PlayThe long-term growth outlook for CTSH is very positive and CTSH's business model is recession proof, which is further strengthened by its consultative approach and deep client relationships. While the short-term selling pressure might continue for a little longer, a credit put spread is reviewed for bullish investors who would like to capture the upside potential with a limited downside risk.The maximum profit is $0.70 and the maximum risk/margin requirement is $4.3 ($5 dollar lost - $0.70 credit received), which translates into a 16.28% return for the margin used for the investing period of 9 weeks, if CTSH closes above $60.00 on Jan. 19, 2013.

The company's revenue grew nearly 4% on a sequential basis and 27% year over year with respect to Q4 2010. Quarterly revenue was $1.66 billion and full-year revenue was $6.12 billion, which represented a 33% growth over 2010. The company added 317 new clients and 33,000 new employees in 2011.The company sees a lot of potential in Europe, as the shrinking populations in some European companies is creating a talent gap that is even more intense than in the U.S. Some European financial institutions are relocating technology and operations activities to regions such as Asia-Pacific in order to address talent gap issues. The movement of operations to Asia-Pacific is expected to fuel the company's growth in those regions. The company is projecting growth in revenue of 23% for 2012.

The protected covered call provides a position with the potential to generate a return even if the price of the stock remains stagnant, yet also provides protection in case the stock price takes a hit.In the company's Q1 2012 earnings call held on May 7, 2012, CEO Francisco D'Souza, indicated the company was revising its 2012 guidance lower, and as a result, the company's stock price took a hit as shown below:Cognizant's stock price is now down -16% from the posting of the previous article, but the protected covered call position is only down -7.6%. A loss of -7.6% is much easier to recover than a loss of -16%.The reason the company revised guidance lower was due to not seeing strong acceleration in growth from Q1 to April as is typically the case.Since Cognizant's haircut appears to be overdone, its earnings release is in the rear-view mirror and its stock price is not too far off of its previous support level of $55, closing the protected covered call and entering a bull-put credit spread will be considered for the company.

So entering the bull-put credit spread provides a position which not only recovers the loss from the protected covered call, but also provides for realizing a potential profit.

Cognizant managed to beat analyst earnings expectations by almost 9%, coming in at 86 cents per share over estimates of 79 cents per share, but it only just met revenue expectations of $1.71 billion.These numbers may not be too bad, but investors were thrown after the company announced that it was lowering its 2012 forecast by 7 cents, down to $3.62 per share, and that excludes estimated stock-based compensation expenses. The company is also expecting less revenue - just $7.34 billion for the year compared to the estimate of $7.53 billion announced in February. Analysts had been expecting that it would raise its revenue growth guidance. On the plus side, Cognizant is expanding its share repurchase program by $400 million, which brings the total program to $1 billion. To date, $423 million in shares have been bought back by the company.When the markets opened on May 7, Cognizant was trading at $61 a share, down from $69.66 at the close of trading on Friday, May 4. Analysts expect the company to earn $3.45 a share this year, rising to $4.11 a share next year, making for a forward price to earnings ratio of 14.84 -- a discount compared to its industry's average of 16.55. Analysts estimate the company's earnings will grow at an average of 18.88% a year over the next five years, compared to expectations of 16.61% for its industry.Many of Cognizant's competitors are in the same boat. Last month, Cognizant's Indian rival Infosys (NYSE:INFY) forecasted its revenue growth, reporting less than what analysts expected and sending its shares tumbling. The issue at hand here isn't the companies themselves necessarily but the markets in which they operate -- the demand just isn't there. Infosys recently traded at $45 a share. Consensus estimates place the company's earnings at $3.11 per share this year, rising to $3.38 per share next year. This means that Infosys is priced at just over 13 times its forward earnings. Analysts estimate Infosys will enjoy earnings growth of 15.55% per annum on average over the next five years.The outlook is a little brighter for larger information technology services providers, but not by that much. Accenture (NYSE:ACN) has a larger market cap than Infosys or Cognizant. It recently traded at $61 a share. The company is expected to earn $3.88 a share this year, rising to $4.28 a share in 2013, making its forward price to earnings ratio 14.25. Analyst consensus estimates say that Accenture's earnings will grow by 10.60% a year on average over the next five years.IBM (NYSE:IBM) is another good example. The company managed to beat first quarter earnings expectations by almost 5% ($2.78 per share on expectations of $2.65 a share) when certain items are excluded, but it still fell short of revenue estimates ($24.7 billion versus $24.77 billion). IBM did raise its full-year earnings forecast, going from $14.85 a share to $15 a share, but IBM is much more diversified than its smaller competitors. It is also priced lower at just 12.26 times its forward earnings, but the company also has lower earnings expectations. Analysts say IBM's earnings will grow by an average of just 10.58% a year over the next five years.Overall, Cognizant may be a fine investment - some well-known hedge fund managers like Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital, Jeffrey Vinik of Vinik Asset Management and David Stemerman of Conatus Capital Management have more than 3% of their 13F portfolios invested in the company, but with its recent trade price and current expectations, I recommend hold. I recommend investors look more toward the larger companies in this sector, like Accenture or IBM, that, while they may have lower earnings growth estimates, are more consistent investments.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
748511,21950,2012-07-25T15:05:05-04:00,,"Cognizant Technology (CTSH) has been one of those rare stocks over the decade that investors could just buy and hold. So when CTSH lost a nasty 19% on May 7th after reporting earnings, I naturally took notice and wondered whether the market was offering a golden opportunity to buy the stock. The company raised earnings guidance to $3.62 EPS for its 2012 fiscal year from $3.43 (excluding non-recurring items). However, the company lowered revenue guidance to ""at least"" $7.34B from $7.53B (a 20% year-over-year growth rate) …due to a slower than anticipated acceleration in demand as we entered the second quarter."" This hardly seemed worthy of such a tremendous drop, but the stock market had just started a major sell-off in May and any excuse was the right time to sell.With the S&P 500 and NASDAQ now in slow, grinding recoveries from June lows, I am surprised to see CTSH still struggling to stay above two-year lows. The constant churn action has been great for range-based trading, but I was expecting CTSH to make some progress by now closing May's gap. Instead, that gap has firmly capped the stock and now the 50-day moving average (DMA) is providing additional resistance. In the daily chart below the thick black line represents the two-year lows more easily visible in the weekly chart presented after the daily.CTSH fails to make any progress closing its post-earnings gap downCTSH also struggles to hold two-year lowsThe weight on CTSH got heavier when Goldman Sachs (GS) lowered its rating from neutral to sell on June 26th. The stock promptly dropped to new 52-week lows on the news but recovered quickly to the top of the range. Many other analysts have upgraded CTSH but to little avail. So, the tug of war continues.In the meantime, CTSH is likely purchasing additional shares under its repurchase authorization. In the last quarter, CTSH spent $43M purchasing shares, and it expanded its program to a whopping $1B and pushed out the expiration date to the end of 2013. CTSH has purchased $423M worth of stock under this program as of May, 2012. With cash and equivalents of $1.3B, up 1.3% from the previous quarter, I am relatively confident the company can execute its entire repurchase program on further weakness in the stock. With a trailing P/E of 19, CTSH is much cheaper than it has been over the last 10 years excluding 2009. The forward P/E is 14.This long-term monthly chart demonstrates how consistently CTSH has performed over the years. This year's extended sell-off is one of CTSH's worst. For any plan to accumulate shares here, I think it makes sense to assume the worst case scenario downside risk is capped at the worst levels in CTSH's history (70% and 76%). I highly doubt such a scenario will unfold and would consider such a collapse a true gift. For now, I am managing to an assumed downside risk to 2009′s final breakout around $42, equating to another 25% downside in my ""almost"" worst case scenario. Until next earnings, I expect to continue to play the existing trading range.CTSH has been a relatively consistent performer over the yearsBe careful out there!Disclosure: I am long CTSH.Additional disclosure: I am long CTSH call options"

A Teaneck, New Jersey-based company serves a diversified portfolio of clients in the financial, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, and logistics industries. As a result of its high-quality consultative approach and extensive customer partnerships, the company showed an outstanding performance in terms of revenues as well as profits.As of August 30, Cognizant stock was trading at $62 with a 52-week range of $53.54-83.48. It has a market cap of $19.1 billion. Trailing 12 month P/E ratio is 23.8 and forward P/E ratio is 18.4. P/B, P/S, and P/CF ratios stand at 4.8, 3.6, and 22, respectively. The three-year annualized revenue and EPS growth stand at 29.10% and 27.30%, respectively. Operating margin is 18.70% and net profit margin is 15.4%. Cognizant does not have a dividend policy.Cognizant has a three-star rating from Morningstar. While its trailing P/E ratio is 23.8, it has a five-year average P/E ratio of 29.6. Out of 28 analysts covering the company, 19 have buy, three have outperform, and six have hold ratings. Wall Street has close-range opinions on Cognizant’s future. The bottom line is 13.9% growth and the top-line growth estimate is 33.1%. Average five-year annualized growth forecast estimate is 20.9%. What is the fair value of Cognizant given the forecast estimates? In this article, the 15th in a long series, I will show a step-by-step calculation of Cognizant’s fair value using discounted earnings plus equity model. Discounted Earnings Plus Equity ModelThis model is primarily used for estimating the returns from long-term projects. It is also frequently used to price fair-valued IPOs. The methodology is based on discounting the present value of the future earnings to the current period:V = E0 + E1 /(1+r) + E2 /(1+r)2 + E3/(1+r)3 + E4/(1+r)4 + E5/(1+r)5 + Disposal Value V = E0 + E0 (1+g)/(1+r) + E0(1+g)2/(1+r)2 + … + E0(1+g)5/(1+r)5 + E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5] The earnings after the last period act as a perpetuity that creates regular earnings:Disposal Value = D = E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5] = E5 / rWhile this formula might look scary for many of us, it easily calculates the fair value of a stock. All we need is the current-period earnings, earnings growth estimate, and the discount rate. To be as objective as possible, I use Morningstar data for my estimates. You can set these parameters as you wish, according to your own diligence. Cognizant’s Valuation Historically, the average return of the DJI has been around 11% (including dividends). Therefore, I will use 11% as my discount rate.Since we are in the middle of the year, it will be more feasible to take the average of ttm EPS of $2.66 along with the mean estimate of $3.39 for the next year. E0 = EPS = ($2.66 + $3.39) / 2 = $3.025Wall Street holds diversified opinions on Cognizant’s future. While analysts tend to impose subjective opinions on their estimates, the average analyst estimate is a good starting point. Average five-year growth forecast is 20.9%. Book value per share is $13.01. The rest is as follows:I decided to add the book value per share so that we can distinguish between a low-debt and debt-loaded company. The lower boundary does not include the book value. According to my 5 year discounted-earnings-plus-book-value model, the fair-value range for Cognizant is between $64.87 and $77.88 per share. As of Aug 30th, Cognizant was trading at a price of $62. I like Cognizant as a company. Cognizant is a member of the S&P, the Forbes Global 2000, the Fortune 500, and the NASDAQ-100. The company is ranked among the top performing and fastest growing companies in the world. I see great growth potential, as well. The market has under-priced Cognizant’s growth potential. The current price of $62 indicates the stock is undervalued. Based on my FED+ fair value estimate, Cognizant is 25% cheaper than my fair-value range. The stock has to rise by 25% to be fairly-priced.O – Metrix ConfirmationIf the math above looks too complicated for you, try estimating the fair value using the O-Metrix as such:O-Metrix = [(Dividend Yield + Growth Estimate) / (P/E Ratio)] * 5The back-testing of this valuation technique on 40 large-caps shows that O-Metrix works very well over the long-term, such as five years. I am also continuously checking on specific sectors, and the formula works very well so far. What is the O-Metrix Score?O-Metrix = [(20.9 + 0) / (21.1] * 5 = 4.95Depending on the benchmark chosen, the market has an O-Metrix score range between 4 and 5. Cognizant's O-Metrix score of 4.95 is on upper-end of the fair-value range. Back-testing of this ranking system shows that companies with higher-than-average O-Metrix scores beat the market with lower volatility. At a price of $62, the company is trading within the C-Grade, on-average-return zone.[Click to enlarge]SummaryCognizant’s stock has always been priced at a premium due to its high growth potential. The average P/E ratio in the last five years was 29.6. The stock has debt to equity ratio of 0 and beta of 1.11. The stock has a relatively high PEG ratio of 1.17. It is trading with a slightly high P/E ratio of 23.8, and a forward P/E ratio of 18.4. In the last five years annualized EPS growth was 33.2%. As of Aug 30, Cognizant was trading at $62, lower than my fair-value range of $64.87 - $77.88. Analysts mean target price of $82.64 is a little more than the upper end of my fair-value estimate. Trailing twelve month ROA ratio of 19.04 and ROE ratio of 23.63 are well-above the market. The stock lost 16% in the last quarter. It is trading 25% lower than 52-week high. I think the current price offers an entry point below its fair value range. Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

204131,23179,2010-05-10T05:46:18-04:00,,"Pure GrowthCognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:CTSH) represents a quintessential example of a pure growth stock. Founded in 1994 as a captive arm of Dunn & Bradstreet (NYSE:DNB) it was spun-off as an independent public company on June 30, 1998. A $100,000 investment in its IPO held through May 4, 2010 would be worth $10,298,202.60 for a compound annual return of 47.9%. An equal $100,000 investment in the S&P 500 over the same period would be worth $103,276.80 for a compound annual return of 0.30% (three-tenths of one percent). See Figure below. Now that is a growth stock, and the stock market had little-to-nothing to do with shareholder rewards.Figure 1 CTSH 13yr Price Performance Recessions as OpportunitiesCognizant is headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey and is a leading U.S. based provider of information technology consulting, IT infrastructure and business process outsourcing services. Recessions have historically represented enhanced opportunity for Cognizant to grow their businesses. Economic recovery provides a strong catalyst for growth as Cognizant clients' hunger for renewed top line growth motivates them to outsource non-core processes in order to free up investment capital.Déjà vu all over AgainAs Yogi Berra might put it, the “Great Recession” is déjà vu all over again for Cognizant Technologies Solutions. The only other recession since Cognizant was a public company happened in 2001.Utilizing our EDMP, Inc. F.A.S.T. Graphs™, we will review Cognizant’s stock price, correlated to earnings for the period 1999 to 2003. Figure 2 below covers Cognizant for the two years prior to the 2001 recession (red shaded area) and the two years after. Note that even though earnings growth stayed very strong (green line with white triangles), stock price fell precipitously in 2001 (yellow circle) before recovering strongly in 2002 and 2003. In the short run the emotion of fear drove price down, however, earnings ultimately drove long-term returns.Figure 2 CTSH 1999-2003 EPS Growth Correlated to Price The Present TimeWith Figure 3 below we look at Cognizant’s price and earnings correlated F.A.S.T. Graph from its public inception to present time. Once again we see that Cognizant’s stock price fell during the “Great Recession” just as it did in 2001. However, once again we also see that earnings have continued to advance and price is now moving to those advancing earnings.Figure 3 CTSH 13yr EPS Growth Correlated to Price Cognizant Beats Analysts ExpectationsOn May 4, 2010, Cognizant Technology Solutions reported a 33.6% increase in net profit for the first quarter ending March 2010 (Click here for conference call transcript). Additionally, management raised guidance as strong revenue performance was broad-based where all major industry segments saw healthy demand. Management also indicated that they felt the worst of the recession was behind them.Growth PlatformsFrancisco D’Souza, President and CEO spoke extensively during their conference call about Cognizant’s growth platform. He announced that they added five strategic accounts, defined as having the potential to ramp up to at least $5 million and potentially to $50 million in annual revenue. Two were from Financial Services, two from Retail and Manufacturing and one from Healthcare and Life Sciences. This brings their total strategic accounts to 149 out of 597 active accounts, most of which are Fortune 1000 customers.In addition to strong demand from their core competencies, Cognizant has been investing human and financial resources into what they believe are powerful secular changes. These new opportunities are driven by the megatrends of digitization, demographic shifts, government-mandated change and new disruptive technologies such as cloud, social computing and virtualization.The Cognizant DifferenceCognizant has long distinguished themselves against their peers with their unrivaled client-facing team. Cognizant continues to invest in and build on this team as customers have come to appreciate the hands-on benefit and service provided from their Two-in-a-Box™ [TiB] client engagement model. Additionally, Cognizant’s 2.0 (C2) single platform allows all teams to share knowledge, locate resources and provide access to worldwide talent pools to manage projects in real time from anywhere.Financial StrengthCognizant has no debt on their balance sheet and the business is a strong cash flow generator. Cash on hand at quarter-end totaled $1.57 billion. Management runs the business with a target operating margin of between 19-20%, which they have recently exceeded. Gordon Coburn, COO, CFO & Treasurer, during the Q & A session of their conference call, talked about how margin expansion occurred during 2009 because growth slowed. Figure 4 below illustrates the impact this had on both operating cash flow (dark orange line marked with an “O”) and free cash flow (light orange line marked with a “F”), as both accelerated in 2009.Figure 4 CTSH 13yr Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Thesis for GrowthFor Q1 2010, 79% of Cognizant’s revenues came from North America, 18% came from Europe and the remaining 3% from Asia-Pacific, Middle Eastern and Latin markets. The latter, and smallest market, which Cognizant refers to as “the rest of the world” is the fastest growing-- and in time could be potentially huge.All of Cognizant’s major industry segments are currently experiencing healthy demand. Financial Services represents 41.5% of revenue and grew 5.3% on a sequential basis and grew 20.3% year over year. Healthcare represents 26.3% of revenues and grew 5.1% on a sequential basis and 33.3% year over year. Manufacturing and Logistics represent 18% of revenues and grew 6.4% sequentially and 40.7% year over year. Communications, Media and High Technology represent 14.1% of revenue and grew 11.8% sequentially and 32.7% year over year.Cognizant sees expanding opportunity in Financial Services and Healthcare, their two largest verticals, as both are facing significant government mandated reform. Both of these important verticals could be motivated to outsource more services as a result. Therefore, the changing political landscape could re-invigorate growth in these otherwise maturing markets for Cognizant.Cognizant is organized by vertical industry and service line to serve their customers’ comprehensive needs. Application management represents 55% of revenues and grew 4% sequentially and 28% year over year. The remaining 45% from Application Development grew 9% sequentially and 30% year over year. Whether measured by vertical industry lines or broad application offerings, Cognizant continues to generate strong growth.ConclusionIn our opinion, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. represents a powerful growth franchise. Although historical earnings growth has exceeded 55% (see Figure 3 above), reason dictates that future growth must surely slow. However, that does not mean that future growth will be weak, just slower as the company gets bigger.Consensus analysts’ estimates expect Cognizant to grow earnings between 18-20% for the next five years. Our own expectations are higher at 25% per annum, which is consistent with their average growth since 2007. Regardless of who is correct, everyone agrees that the Cognizant growth story is far from over.Therefore, we believe Cognizant is a solid choice for investors seeking above-average growth of capital at today’s valuation. If price were to pull back, we would be more aggressive in our commitment.Disclosure: Long CTSH at time of writing."

(NASDAQ:CTSH)Investment ConclusionBased on slow IT spending in a deepening global economic downturn – with above-average exposure to the troubled Financial Services segment – we are reducing our estimates as follows: 2009 GAAP diluted EPS to $1.50 on revenue of $2.955 billion (+5% YoY) from $1.60 on $3.103 billion; and 2010 GAAP diluted EPS to $1.60 – including a one-time jump in the tax-rate – on $3.406 billion (+15% YoY) from $1.75 on $3.723 billion. Our current model assumes no sustained upturn in revenue until the December 2009 quarter. In the present environment, any growth in revenue and EPS in 2009 should attest to the durability of a business model.We are trimming our target price from $30 to $28. In 12-months, this would correspond to 15-20x forward EPS – a premium to the current valuation (14x). Our Buy rating remains in effect on the basis of projected upside, as well as industry-leading revenue and EPS growth in calendar 2008-10E.4Q08 Results. GAAP diluted EPS of $0.38 on revenue of $753.0 million missed our $0.39 estimate on $747.2 million. Results included a non-operating foreign exchange loss (due to weakening of European currencies vs. the USD) of $11.4 million or $0.03 per share, which was telegraphed in a December 5 filing with the SEC; as well as a slightly higher tax-rate. Operating income advanced 34% YoY and beat our expectation. Highlights included 26% YoY and 2.5% QoQ revenue growth. Also during the quarter, the board authorized a new $50 million stock repurchase over 12 months.Details. Revenue from ongoing Application Management services rose 5.5% QoQ to 55% of the total. Revenue from discretionary Application Development & Integration projects contracted 1% QoQ to 45% of the total. Areas of relative strength included the Healthcare vertical (+9% QoQ on a reported basis and 25% of total revenue) and Retail, Manufacturing & Logistics (+7% QoQ and 16% of revenue); North American region (+4% QoQ and 80% of revenue); and IT Infrastructure and BPO practices (+16-37% QoQ and 5-6% of revenue). On a constant currency basis, Europe remained resilient (+5% QoQ and 18% of revenue). Meanwhile, weakness was noticeable across the Other/Technology segment (-5% QoQ and 13% of revenue) and Financial Services (flat QoQ and 45% of revenue). Operating income of $142.7 million (18.9% margin) surpassed our $133.0 million estimate (17.8% margin). Profitability benefited from QoQ rupee depreciation and unexpected top-line strength in the second half of the quarter.Excluding 3,000 unbilled trainees, offshore utilization stood at 70% vs. 69% a year ago. Worldwide headcount rose 3.7% QoQ and 11% YoY to 61,700 in December. Attrition improved to 11.5% from 12.4% a year ago. Cognizant is honoring its prior campus commitments albeit with later start-dates.Cognizant posted CFFO of $193 million or $0.65 per share in the quarter, aided by strong collection activity. Major outflows comprised capital expenditures ($23 million), budgeted to climb from $169 million in 2008 to $175-200 million in 2009. Cognizant exited the quarter with net cash of $902.9 million ($3.00 per share).

236352,20568,2010-11-11T13:19:04-05:00,,"Estimates for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (CTSH)  have been on the upswing after the company reported yet another strong  quarter last week. Cognizant reported strong results for the third  quarter of 2010 as both top and bottom-line beat expectations, which led  to an upgrade in the annual guidance as well. Most analysts are  optimistic of Cognizant’s prospects, as is evident from the estimate  revisions following the release of the quarterly results.Earnings FlashbackCognizant reported revenues of $1.217 billion in the third quarter of  2010, up 43% year over year and up 10.1% sequentially, exceeding the  Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.184 billion and management's expectation  of at least $1.175 million.Net income came in at $203.7 million or 66 cents per share compared to  net income of $172.2 million or 56 cents in the second quarter and net  income of $136.6 million or 45 cents in the year-ago quarter. This beat  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents and management's guidance of 59  cents.The full coverage on the third quarter earnings is provided here.Earnings Estimate Revisions: OverviewFollowing the release of strong results and consequent upgrade in  guidance, estimate revisions depict a strong positive sentiment among  analysts for the upcoming fourth quarter, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011 as  well.Agreement of Estimate RevisionsAll the seventeen analysts covering the stock have upped their  estimates for 2010 in the last thirty days. For the fourth quarter,  fourteen of the sixteen analysts covering the stock have increased their  estimates in the last thirty days and four have revised upward in the  last seven days.A vast majority of the analysts are positive for Cognizant’s  performance in 2011 as well. Cognizant continues to benefit from the  growth in discretionary spending driven by pent-up demand (which is  nearing its end) which in turn was created by two years of cost-cutting  and conservative spending. Growth in the near term will be driven by  demand for traditional outsourcing across IT business process and  infrastructure and new slate of domestic and international regulations,  particularly in the financial services and health care industries.  Financial services account for 43% of total revenues and health care  industry accounts for 25% of total revenues.Fourteen of the twenty analysts covering the stock have increased their  estimates for 2011 in the last thirty days and four in the last seven  days. However, one analyst moved in the opposite direction in the last  thirty days and three in the last seven days.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsNot only is there a strong directional consensus among analysts  covering the stock, the magnitude of increase in estimates is noteworthy  as well. Earnings estimates for 2010 have gone up by 8 cents following  the release of strong third quarter results. The current Zacks Consensus  Estimate for 2010 is $2.36, roughly in line with the management’s  guidance of $2.35. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2010 ranges from a  low of $2.54 to a high of $2.87.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2011 is $2.66, up by 6 cents in the last thirty days.Our TakeCognizant remains well diversified among financial services, health  care & life sciences, retail, manufacturing and logistics, which  have helped the company maintain its top line. As the economy begins to  recover and business environment becomes stable, most companies will  start investing more in development projects rather than just  maintenance projects.Cognizant has made significant investments in consulting and emerging  markets, new solutions such as enterprise analytics, and new  technologies such as cloud and mobile computing. These areas should  drive growth in 2011 and the top-line should maintain momentum in the  coming quarters. However, margins might be under a bit of pressure due  to increased labor costs.The stock has had a good run-up in recent times. Hence, we would like  to wait for a more favorable entry point and, therefore, maintain a  NEUTRAL recommendation for Cognizant supported by Zacks #3 Rank."

Recently, the company’s earnings growth rate has dropped from about 50% a year, to just 19% for the last earnings report (Call Transcript). The stock, however, has plunged by over 60% since early 2007.Here’s a chart showing the stock price (blue line, left scale) and the earnings-per-share (gold line, right scale). The two axes are scaled at a ratio of 50-to-1 which means that when the lines cross, the P/E ratio is 50. Using 50 is obviously a very high multiple. But as you can see, that’s what the stock was following for a long time.The stock is currently going for less than 10 times next year's earnings. Here’s what I wrote about Cognizant two years ago:For Q4, the company expects non-GAAP earnings of 43 cents a share. That would be a growth of rate of 18%, and the fifth straight quarter of slowing growth.For number geeks, here's a spreadsheet with CTSH's financials.Disclosure:  None"

Thadhani's recent note to clients on Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH):• • •Investment Conclusion. Based on reassessment of IT spending plans amid the ongoing global financial crisis and economic downturn – cushioned by recent rupee depreciation – we are revising our estimates as follows: 2008 GAAP diluted EPS to $1.45 on revenue of $2.811 billion (32% YoY growth) from $1.44 also on revenue of $2.811 billion); 2009 GAAP diluted EPS to $1.60 on revenue of $3.103 billion (10% YoY growth) from $1.80 on revenue of $3.621 billion; and 2010 GAAP diluted EPS to $1.75 on revenue of $3.723 billion (20% YoY growth) from $2.10 on revenue of $4.617 billion. Our model conservatively assumes subdued or no QoQ revenue growth in the next three quarters.To reflect prevailing sentiment, we are also resetting our target price from $44 to $30. In 12-months, this would correspond to 15-20x forward EPS – a premium to the current depressed valuation.These aggressive cuts enable us to accentuate 1) an upward bias to our estimates; and 2) inexpensive valuation of 13x forward EPS. We are reaffirming our Buy rating on the basis of industry-leading revenue and EPS growth in calendar 2007-09E, backed by substantial margin flexibility. The long-term outlook remains encouraging given recent competitive wins and a healthy pipeline. Cognizant is well positioned to participate in M&A integration, risk management, regulatory compliance and cost reduction initiatives in the Financial Services segment.3Q08 Results. GAAP diluted EPS of $0.38 vs. $0.32 a year ago on revenue of $734.7 million beat our $0.37 estimate on revenue of $723.1 million. Results included a non-operating foreign exchange loss ($14.8 million or -4.2 cent EPS impact) – offset by recent rupee depreciation (+2.1 cents) and a lower-than-projected stock-based payout (+1.9 cents). Operating income advanced 41% YoY. Highlights included 31% YoY and 7.2% QoQ revenue growth. In recent weeks, Cognizant has announced new/expanded client agreements with Deutsche Telekom, AstraZeneca and Health Net ($100 million TCV).Takeaways. Revenue outpaced peers but was adversely impacted by weak European currencies and a lower contribution from a top-5 Healthcare client. For the second straight quarter, Cognizant posted better-than-overall growth in the Financial Services segment (+31% YoY and +8% QoQ). Areas of strength included the Healthcare vertical (+34% YoY and +6% QoQ growth) and European region (up 54% YoY and 4% QoQ to 20% of total revenue). Meanwhile, revenue in the U.S. region rose 26% YoY and 8% QoQ. Operating profitability benefited from 5.1% QoQ rupee depreciation and higher utilization – mitigated by an annual salary increase for offshore employees (effective July). Management noted:- The 4Q revenue outlook incorporates fewer working days and slow project starts in anticipation of late budget approvals in 2009, i.e., potentially in March vs. January usually.- Direct exposure to impacted Financial Services clients – IndyMac, Lehman, WaMu, Wachovia, Bear Stearns and HBOS – is limited to 5% of total revenue with work ongoing and not likely to end abruptly.- Shifting demand toward Application Management, BPO and Infrastructure Management services.- The latter two recorded double-digit QoQ growth but still account for only 5-10% of total revenue.- Good price discipline by all major players.- Client engagement at a more strategic level, i.e., in the role of a trusted partner vs. mere vendor. Investments in relationship management that hold particular relevance in the current environment, e.g., Cognizant boasts 700 client partners, 70+ executives focused on strategic opportunities, an advanced solutions practice and 1,700 business consultants.Revenue from Application Management services advanced 36% YoY and 8% QoQ to 53% of the total. Revenue from discretionary Application Development & Integration projects rose 26% YoY and 6% QoQ to 47% of the total. Operating income of $142.6 million (19.4% margin) surpassed our $126.5 million estimate (17.5% margin). Available levers for countering wage and currency pressures comprise offshore utilization and scale/SG&A efficiencies, i.e., rental, communications, marketing and back-office savings.Hourly price realizations appear to have been stable QoQ at approximately $72-73 for onsite work (25% of billable workforce) and $24-25 for offshore (75%). Excluding 4,400 non-billable trainees, offshore utilization stood at 72% vs. 68% a year ago and should rise throughout 2008. Worldwide headcount rose just 0.3% QoQ and 22% YoY to 59,500 in September. Attrition deteriorated to 17.6% from 17.0% a year ago and is attributed to the spike that usually follows annual salary hikes. Cognizant has elected not to disclose hiring plans in order to retain flexibility on such decisions. In the short term, we do not expect significant headcount growth – reflecting a more appropriately sized offshore bench that should neither compromise revenue upside, nor client requirements.By industry, Financial Services ranked largest (46% of total revenue), followed by Healthcare (24%), Retail/Manufacturing/Logistics (16%) and Technology/Other (14%). Top-10 clients accounted for 29.7% of revenue, down from 31.0% in the June quarter. Cognizant added 63 new clients compared with 63 in the immediately prior period. It exited the quarter with an active roster of 550, up from 520 in June. Out of 124 strategic clients – those offering annual revenue potential of $5-50+ million – most still remain only 20-30% penetrated.Cognizant posted CFFO of $140 million or $0.47 per share in the quarter. Proceeds from exercise of options amounted to $10 million. Major outflows comprised stock repurchases ($28 million) and capital expenditures ($61 million), budgeted to climb from $182 million in 2007 to somewhat less than the $250 million originally planned for 2008. Cognizant exited the quarter with net cash of $734.2 million, up from $686.3 million on June 30. Accounts and unbilled receivables improved to 73 DSOs from 77 in June.CTSH shares are suitable for aggressive investors. In our opinion, principal risks include: U.S. slowdown; rising offshore salaries; appreciation of the Indian currency, which would translate into higher expenses; correction in the Indian and/or U.S. markets; and political opposition."

Its earnings, however, reflect trouble in the global economy and not trouble specific to the company. Cognizant has a unique market niche and is actively diversifying its business. The company still expects revenue to grow 34%, despite the reduced outlook, and for EPS to reach $1.44 vs. last year's $1.15.

Based on a more cautious but achievable revenue outlook and slightly lower interest income – cushioned by recent rupee depreciation – we are reducing our estimates: 2008 GAAP diluted EPS to $1.44 on revenue of $2.811 billion (32% YoY growth) from $1.50 on revenue of $2.900 billion); 2009 GAAP diluted EPS to $1.80 on revenue of $3.621 billion (29% YoY growth) from $1.92 on revenue of $3.842 billion; and 2010 GAAP diluted EPS to $2.10 on revenue of $4.617 billion (28% YoY growth) from $2.21 on revenue of $4.898 billion. We are also adjusting our target price from $45 to $44. In 12-months, this would correspond to 20-25x forward EPS.Recent price weakness can be attributed to renewed concern over the U.S. IT spending environment (78% of revenue). Nonetheless, we are reaffirming our Buy rating on the basis of industry-leading 25% compound EPS growth in calendar 2007-09E, backed by substantial margin flexibility (note utilization headroom) and an attractive valuation (17-18x forward EPS).Due to deterioration in the macroeconomic environment and overall business confidence, Cognizant has assumed a more conservative stance for 2008. Revised revenue guidance includes 5.5% QoQ growth in 3Q08 (vs. our prior 10.0% estimate and 2.0-5.5% at peers) and 5.0% QoQ growth in 4Q08. Near-term revenue should be driven by ramp-up of prior wins and allows for increasing reassessment of spending plans in the Healthcare and European segments. The long-term outlook remains positive given a healthy pipeline, greater emphasis on cost rationalization initiatives and recent competitive wins. Current management priorities focus on the bottom-line, demonstrating offshoring effectiveness to clients and deepening domain capabilities.2Q08 Results. GAAP diluted EPS of $0.35 vs. $0.27 a year ago on revenue of $685.4 million matched our $0.35 estimate on revenue of $681.7 million. Operating income advanced 32% YoY. Highlights included 33% YoY and 6.6% QoQ revenue growth.Takeaways. Cognizant posted better-than-expected growth in the Financial Services segment (+29% YoY and +7% QoQ). Areas of strength included the Manufacturing vertical (+38% YoY and +10% QoQ growth) and European region (up 83% YoY and 15% QoQ to 20% of total revenue). The relatively small BPO and Infrastructure Management practices also recorded double-digit QoQ revenue growth. Meanwhile, revenue in the Healthcare segment rose 39% YoY but just 3% QoQ. Management confirmed moderation in annual wage inflation to 10% (effective late-2Q08) vs. 12-16% in recent years. In June, Cognizant acquired Strategic Vision Consulting, a Los Angeles based firm with 60 employees serving the media and entertainment industry.

88307,21445,2008-07-31T13:01:48-04:00,,"Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) is expected to report Q2 earnings after marekt close Thursday July 31, with a conference call scheduled for 4:00 pm ET. The consensus estimate is 35c for EPS and $682.48M for revenue, according to First Call. The company, on its last earnings call, provided weak guidance for Q2 EPS of 38c to 39c and revenue at least $680M. Wachovia says Q2 revenue should be at least in-line given what they feel was conservative guidance. The firm feels that Q2 EPS expectations have a lot of cushion given the sharp drop in the Indian Rupee which is a plus for operating margin. Wachovia says CY08 revenue guidance will likely be the primary focus item for investors: Current guidance is for revenue of ''approximately'' $2.95B, which implies up about 38%. Although CFO comments at Wachovia's Nantucket conference suggest comfort at 35% with ''work to do'' to get to 38%. Wachovia's estimate is $2.91B, up 36%; Street $2.88B, up 34.7%. Wachovia believes investors are discounting a CY08 revenue guidance of as low as 32% given the cautious commentary from Tier offshore peers Infosys (NYSE:INFY), Wipro (NYSE:WIT), Tata Consultancy and Satyam (SAY) during mid-July reports, and continued economic/credit concerns. Wachovia thinks CY08 EPS guidance less of a concern given benefit of Forex, upside in utilization and a tight grip on discretionary spending: Guidance is for ''approximately'' $1.50; Wachovia's estimate $1.50; Street $1.48. In Cowen's view, the combination of possible downward earnings revisions, a cautious near-term outlook and negative investor sentiment could pressure Cognizant's stock ahead and following the company's June quarterly earnings release. Having said that, Cowen says solid fundamentals, reasonable projections/guidance and an attractive valuation could make the stock more compelling following the company's earnings release."

Thadhani's recent update to clients on Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH): • • • CTSH: CY07-09 EPS Growth Potential 30%, Fwd. P/E 19x Investment Conclusion. Based on slower revenue momentum – offset by a modest 1Q08 overage and certain non-operating items – we are fine-tuning our estimates: 2008 GAAP diluted EPS remains at $1.50 on revenue of $2.900 billion (36% YoY growth but down from our prior $2.955 billion projection); and 2009 GAAP diluted EPS also stays unchanged at $1.80 on revenue of $3.842 billion (33% YoY growth and down from $3.988 billion previously). At this time, we are introducing a 2010 GAAP diluted EPS estimate of $2.15 on revenue of $4.898 billion (28% YoY growth). Additionally, we are resetting our target price from $50 to $42. In 12-months, this would correspond to 20-25x forward EPS – a premium to the current depressed valuation (19x). We are reaffirming our Buy rating on the basis of industry-leading 25% compound EPS growth in calendar 2007-09E – including the expiration of tax benefits that reduces 2009 EPS by $0.15 but will likely be delayed by a year; significant margin flexibility (note the low offshore utilization rate with each 1% improvement = 50 bps); and the lowest currency exposure among offshoring majors (1% swing = 20 bps). Recent price weakness indicates continued concern over the U.S. IT spending environment (80% of revenue). 1Q08 Results. GAAP diluted EPS of $0.34 vs. $0.25 a year ago on revenue of $643.1 million beat our $0.33 estimate on revenue of $642.0 million. Results benefited from a $4.0 million forex gain (1.1 cent EPS impact). Operating income advanced 34% YoY and met our estimate. Highlights included 40% YoY and 7.2% QoQ revenue growth, and stabilization of employee turnover at 12.4% (the lowest level in two years). During the quarter, Cognizant entered into an alliance with T- Systems – the IT services arm of Deutsche Telekom with 56K employees and 2007 revenue approximating $18 billion. This relationship brings a front-end partner with deep local knowledge and should accelerate penetration of the large German market. Takeaways. Cognizant posted slower growth in the Financial Services segment (37% YoY but only 3% QoQ). Areas of strength included the Healthcare vertical (45% YoY and 10% QoQ growth) and European region (up 87% YoY and 12% QoQ to 19% of total revenue). Cognizant also recorded double-digit QoQ revenue growth in the Retail/Manufacturing/Logistics and Technology/Other verticals. Citing heightened economic uncertainty and challenges in the Financial Services industry, Cognizant has adopted a cautious short-term outlook. Current 2008 revenue guidance includes 5.7% QoQ growth in the June quarter (vs. our original 11% estimate and 0-3.5% at peers) while implying aggressive double-digit growth in the remaining two quarters. Management noted the following: client attitudes changed in March (after the Bear Stearns collapse) and the need to reassess spending plans resulted in project delays/cutbacks in the Financial Services vertical; increased emphasis on cost rationalization should still favor offshore initiatives; the 2008 outlook factors in ramp-up of prior wins backed by a record pipeline of ~50 large opportunities – but affords no cushion for further deterioration in the macroeconomic environment; and there has not been any change in pricing expectations. Separately, Cognizant anticipates a moderation in annual wage inflation to about 10% vs. 12-16% in recent years. CTSH shares are suitable for aggressive investors. In our opinion, principal risks include: U.S. slowdown; rising offshore salaries; appreciation of the Indian currency, which would translate into higher expenses; correction in the Indian and/or U.S. markets; and political opposition.

Essentially, they consult other businesses on how to more efficiently run their current technology infrastructure. All companies are looking for ways to do more with less these days, as wringing out costs is the best way to boost the bottom line as revenue growth has been tough to come by in recent quarters. CTSH’s second quarter results announced Tuesday morning show that their business is growing in this environment and show no signs of slowing.Cognizant reported earnings per share of 47 cents which was 10 cents better Wall Street expected, and 12 cents better than a year ago. Many companies have beaten earnings estimates so far this year, but most of them have beaten expectations by cutting costs more than expected. In contrast to that trend, Cognizant actually increased revenue by more than 13% over last year. This strong growth prompted the company to lift its annual growth target to at least 11.5% from at least 10%. Furthermore, CTSH raised its third quarter EPS  target to 44 cents per share, 5 cents better than the street expected and full year was lifted to $1.80 which is 26 cents better than the street’s forecast. The stock has been trading much higher all day, as shares are up about 10.5% approaching the close. Volume has also been quite high, nearly triple the normal daily trading volume prior to the close.Even as the stock has soared nearly 90% year to date, we still believe there could be some fuel left in the tank. This was a breakout quarter, as the last few quarters have seen the company hit expectations but not much more. Clearly, Cognizant is in the sweet spot of this economy; helping other firms save money by improving their current processes. They are growing sales in an environment where that feat is extremely rare, and instead of resting on their laurels they are issuing an upbeat outlook and raising guidance. This report shows us that the run up in CTSH shares has been justified by an improvement in fundamentals. We are going to reiterate our Undervalued stance on these shares for the time being until either the price tag becomes to expensive or their growth story fizzles. They have a stellar balance sheet with no long term debt and a current ratio of about 5. We would start to become more cautious when this stock got into the low to mid $40’s, but until that time it looks like a good candidate for a defensive investor that is still looking for upside.Original post"

54677,20454,2007-11-19T11:18:00-05:00,,"Jefferies is out with a very nice call on Cognizant Tech (NASDAQ:CTSH) saying that with it trading well below its growth rate (for the first time!), they see upside to CTSH relative to almost any scenario for 2008. According to Jeffco, CTSH has grown faster than any leading player in offshore IT; they expect this trend to continue. At the same time, they recognize that given its size, combined with accelerating growth through much of last year, y/y comparables and the law of large numbers are in play here. Also, given recent turmoil in the financial services sector (45% of CTSH revs), it is reasonable to assume that 2008 could experience some softness in demand, or at the very least that 2008 could get off to a slower start than we have witnessed in previous years. They have assumed a slowdown in overall growth next year from 50% to 34%, based on a combination of conservatism and current size of the business. This growth rate relative to current valuation is compelling, in Jeffco's view. Additionally they believe that 2008 guidance when it is released should be a catalyst to the stock. Even if guidance comes in below consensus, the firm feels that current valuation would suggest a sigh of relief for the stock, providing an upside catalyst. Reiterate Buy and $50 target. Notablecalls: CTSH got hit pretty badly couple of weeks ago after not offering investors the usual wide beat & raise quarter they have grown accustomed to over the past years. This was seen as the first sign of trouble about to hit the offshore IT services sector. Must say it's hard to argue with this, with the whole sector leveraged to the US financial services space. Yet even if we don't see the 40%+ growth rates in the financial side over the next year or two (or possibly never), the stock still looks interesting here. The wording of the call is likely strong enough to create some reasonably good buy interest over the next couple of days. I would not be surprised to see CTSH up 1-2 bucks in the short term."
43283,20171,2007-08-02T05:43:27-04:00,,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:CTSH) announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007. Revenue increased to $516.5 million, up 53% from the year-ago quarter and ahead of the $505 million consensus. Diluted EPS on a GAAP basis was $0.54, compared to $0.37 in the year-ago quarter and a $0.52 consensus estimate. The consensus estimate excludes $0.05 in stock based compensation that it shouldn’t. The company also raised guidance for the rest of the year. For the third quarter they now expect at least $550 million in sales and $0.56 in GAAP EPS, which is in line with the consensus estimates but includes stock-based compensation. For the full year, the company expects $2.20 in GAAP EPS and $2.40 non-GAAP, compared with a $2.19 consensus. As I have been saying for some time, it looks like the street is ignoring the good news and focusing on the employee additions: That implies about the same number of new employees as were added last year. But while last years increase amounted to 60% growth in employees, this year’s only amounts to 37.5%. Don’t get me wrong - that is still a very impressive number and the employees have historically been underutilized. Increased utilization can be a good thing. But many will view this as the signal that there is a 15,000 employee per year limit to growth. Next year that would make for just 27% growth and the year after it would be just 21%. You can see that within a few years the growth rate would look “normal,” and the P/E would have to decline from the current 36x to perhaps half that. Then getting a really good return starts to become tough. Consider that this year’s earnings growth is similar to last year’s headcount growth. If that continues, and assuming some increases to utilization: I would guess that investors in Cognizant would be hoping for at least a doubling in share price over the next five years. For that to happen it would have to trade at a 25x multiple of my back-of-the-envelope estimate for 2012. While that is certainly possible, it hardly seems like a slam dunk. CTSH 1-yr chart:"

CTSH is a consulting firm that uses an “offshore model” which has become popular with many of its competitors.  The offshore model essentially uses cheaper more efficient labor typically from India to service Information Technology projects sold in the US or Europe.  A team of US professionals might sit down with a company in Boston and determine the direction they want to go with a particular project.  The local team will then communicate with the “worker bees” in India who tie the nuts and bolts together and deliver the working application.
One of the biggest challenges in this business is recruiting and retaining quality professionals in India to process the work.  Since the business process is duplicated by a hand full of other consultants, there can be difficulty in finding enough qualified individuals to hire.  Currently CTSH is projecting a headcount of 55,000 by the end of the year and this is revised down slightly from earlier forecasts.  Management contends that they can continue to service existing clients and new contracts with their current headcount and that hiring is more of a preventative long-term planning issue than a day to day necessity.  However, attrition rates picked up the last quarter and while management stated that this was more of a seasonal factor, there is still concern that continued weakness in hiring could put constraints on future revenue growth.
One of the reasons I picked CTSH over SAY was because of the stock valuation.  CTSH is trading at a trailing multiple of 36 and a forward multiple of 33x this years expected earnings.  While the higher multiple could be justified by the company’s history of growing earnings quickly, Cognizant is now at a size that makes it very difficult to maintain growth percentages while there is little doubt the company will continue to grow in dollar terms.  If growth slows to 10-15% per year instead of breakneck 50% plus levels, there will likely be a significant decline in the multiple which could leave the stock at a hefty discount to current prices.
While current analysts are positive on the name, I am concerned that this fosters complacency in the investor base.  Sell side research is often slow to recognize and alert investors to changing environments (see Merrill’s downgrade of CFC only AFTER the stock dropped from 40 to 20) and while I’m not anticipating a meltdown in the offshore consulting business, I think people may be surprised to see a decline in the growth rate.  It pays to be cautious and hopefully some short ideas give investors a way to hedge positions or profit from these turbulent times.  As always, use discipline and exercise stop levels.  No need to be a hero in these markets."

Likewise, next quarter’s consensus target of $0.51 on $496 million in sales appears to be in the bag. However, Cognizant’s full-year “at leasts” don’t quite make the cut of current estimates. Let us first say that it is time for Cognizant to toss aside the “non-GAAP” adjustment for options. It sure looks like the estimates are GAAP-based, so why bother? The company did not disclose net employee additions in the body of the press release, but the company description at the bottom says “Cognizant has more than 43,000 employees.” This compares to “over 40,000” at year-end. While we remain impressed that a company can add even 3,000 employees in three months, the pace is below the 4,500 added in Q4 and below the run rate to match last year’s 14,500 additions. Further, since the company is now larger the 3,000 additions represent a sequential growth rate of 7.5%, or approximately 33% annualized. This is not only below the current growth rate of 61% but also below the consensus 2008 revenue growth rate of 36.3%. This is important because Cognizant is a consulting firm, and increasing headcount is the primary way such firms can increase future revenues. While 33% annual growth is indeed good, a trailing P/E multiple of 55x probably requires a bit more. With the growth slowing just a bit faster than expected, however, we still don’t believe that “this day” is “the day.” Cognizant's latest conference call transcript CTSH 1-yr chart:"
46786,20307,2007-09-10T03:26:14-04:00,,"Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) shares have dropped almost 19% since mid-July, largely on fears that the IT outsourcing company could be vulnerable to the recent troubles in the credit markets, given its considerable exposure to the financial sector. Actually, there are already several examples of outsourcing companies that have been affected by the crisis. Last month, WNS Holdings (NYSE:WNS), a Mumbai-based provider of business process outsourcing services, trimmed guidance after the collapse of lender First Magnus Financial. Also last month, ExlService Holdings (NASDAQ:EXLS) announced that a non-prime mortgage lender which represented about 2% of its revenue had stopped originating new loans, and would be cutting back service.But be careful when you extrapolate. In a research note Friday morning, Cowen’s Moshe Katri pounded the table on Cognizant shares. As he notes, 47% of the company’s revenues come from financial service firms, roughly equally divided from insurance, commercial banks and equity capital market firms. The most vulnerable area, he contends, is in the equity capital markets area, where 50% of spending is discretionary; that represents about 8% of the company’s overall revenue. He also notes that the company has zero business from sub-prime lenders.Katri notes that in 2002, after the September 11 attacks, discretionary IT spending almost ceased, amid high levels of anti-outsourcing rhetoric and tensions on the India-Pakistan border. Nonetheless, Cognizant’s development revenue that year grew 26%, and maintenance revenue increased 50%. The point of all this: Katri says Cognizant in 2008 should grow revenue and EPS 35-40%. The stock, he notes, trades at a considerable discount to its growth rate, now at about 25x projected 2008 EPS of $2.84. The selloff, he concludes, is a buying opportunity. CTSH 1-yr chart:"
23281,20452,2007-01-02T05:42:12-05:00,,"I’ve have had Cognizant on my list of businesses to research for quite some time now, and having watched the stock make its way from the low $40’s right up to the $70 range, I wish I had analyzed this one a lot sooner. It’s never much fun sitting out on such a fat return but it’s even less fun taking a speculative position only to get burned because you didn’t have a good grasp on your business to begin with. I am going to be taking a close look at Cognizant. My goal will be to collect and interpret any seemingly relevant information for the long term outlook this business, and to then use that data to determine what I believe is an appropriate valuation for this business. In addition, I’ll be interested in the shorter term price performance of the stock and highlight any possible trader [mis]behavior. To get things started, let’s mention just what it is that Cognizant Technology (NASDAQ:CTSH) actually does. Cognizant Technology Solutions provides custom IT services to Fortune 500 and Blue Chip companies in the U.S. and Asia. MSN Money reports that “Cognizant’s core competencies include technology strategy consulting, complex systems development, enterprise software package implementation and maintenance, data warehouseing and business intelligence, application testing, application maintenance, infrastructure management and vertically oriented business process outsourcing [BPO].” It is my understanding that basically, Cognizant takes a good thing and makes it better. Their clients are usually large organizations that fall into one of the following categories: Financial, Healthcare, Manufacturing or Retail & Logistics Services. Teams of efficiency experts that are specialized in these fields are able to assist in the client’s long term growth and profitability. Several sources noted that Cognizant routinely develops long-term relationships with the firms they work with. A definite plus if we are looking at the long-term stability of this business. Additional online sources also note that Cognizant Technologies tailors their services to these specific industries, while utilizing an integrated on site/offshore business model, which combines technical and account management teams located onsite at the customer location and offshore at development centers located primarily in India. Employing some 38,000 professionals across its 27 development centers throughout the world, this is a world class research and development organization aiming to help its clients manage the rapid technological changes of today’s shrinking global economy. Ok, so now we’ve got an idea of what Cognizant is all about. Now let's see who they are up against. Cognizant faces competition from Wipro (NYSE:WIT), Satyam (SAY), Infosys Technologies (NYSE:INFY) and Tata Consultancy Services. Apart from these companies, Cognizant also faces competition from IBM (NYSE:IBM), Accenture (NYSE:ACN), BearingPoint (NYSE:BE), Sapient (NASDAQ:SAPE) and iGATE (NASDAQ:IGTE). SeekingAlpha notes that consulting and outsourcing is a highly competitive sector, and that these Indian IT firms face problems such as employee attrition and rapid wage expansion. Also that earnings can be impacted by currency fluctuations, and that if expectations of continued high growth aren’t met, stock prices can face sharp declines. As for Cognizant’s competitive advantage, or moat, Phil Town suggests that there are 3 different moats at work here. We’ve got the “secret” moat in that the individual management teams are highly specialized in their fields. Also that by using the on site/off shore business model, they are able to lower costs of their services by some 20% over non Indian based competitors. So we’ve also got some “price” moat built up here. To widen the moat even further, Cognizant is developing its “brand” moat by having consultants directly assigned on site to the customers location. This all seems reasonable and very much in our favor. However, as mentioned above our competition isn’t limited to IT firms based in the United States. There are numerous other Indian Based IT firms such as Infosys (INFY), Satyam (SAY), and Wipro (WIT). They are some of the other major players in the game, and we’ve got some pretty high hopes of growth for this niche market. A member of our community, George from Fat Pitch Financials, cautions us in that often times the bond between the client and firm may actually be trumped by the bond between the client and individual account manager in the end. In other words, with a rapidly increasing market and expanding wages, who is to say that key account managers won’t migrate from Indian based IT firm to Indian based IT firm, taking major clients along for the ride? I think this is a valid concern. Furthermore, Cognizant already employs some 38,000 folks. Assuming the analysts growth predictions are at all accurate, I would think that we’re going to need a lot more help to sustain such high growth. We have to remember that the brand moat is being built on quality - not quantity. I know from experience, it can be damn near impossible to find the right person to fill ONE position for a job. It might be interesting to know how Cognizant plans to find the additional long-term help its going to need as well as how to macro/micro manage the quality control of their teams. CTSH 1-yr chart:"
26084,20171,2007-02-05T10:06:43-05:00,,"IT outsourcing wonder Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) reported record fourth quarter results and the market is happy. Since the revenue and earnings for both the quarter reported and the guidance for next quarter exceeded estimates, the stock is rallying and is already up 5.6% today. The company also appears to have done a good job managing employee turnover (though that remains our biggest concern). According to the release, the company added a net total of almost 4,500 employees in the fourth quarter and more than 14,500 employees in 2006 overall, bringing their total employee count to more than 40,000. That means that during 2006 the employee count grew by 14,500/(40,000-14,500)=57%. This is important because Cognizant is a consulting firm, and increasing headcount is the primary way such firms can increase future revenues. While a simplified assumption, we nonetheless believe that the headcount growth is a reasonable starting point for estimating next year’s revenue growth. And taking last year’s 57% growth in employees and applying it to last year’s revenue of $1.424 billion yields an initial guesstimate of $2.24 billion in 2007 revenue, which leaves a substantial cushion for the firm to beat its new revenue guidance of $2.04 billion. This is not to say that employee attrition is no longer a concern, as a slowdown in employee growth (even to a fairly torrid 30%) would make it difficult to justify today’s multiple. Adding 14,500 employees this year would only make for 37% growth rather than 57%. However, while we believe that ultimately the employee growth will be the factor that stalls Cognizant, as long as the company continues to find staff, the stock can probably continue its steady climb.

CTSH provides application maintenance services, data warehousing, software development and integration, and re-engineering services for legacy systems, primarily to medium-sized and large businesses. The majority of its sales are to customers in North America, including IMS Health(RX), First Data (FDC), and ACNielsen. Most of the company's software development centers and employees are located in India, with others in the US. CTSH serves clients in industries including financial services, health care, retail, and manufacturing. If you look at the below chart of this stock's price, you'll wish you'd bought it in1999 when you could have all you wanted at $1.60 [split adjusted for 3 stock splits since then]. It's now sitting at an all time high of $80. The chart looks like a rocket launch photo, the trailing smoke being the previous price points as the stock continued its upward flight.    CTSH 8-yr chart   The question for investors now is: will the rocket continue to soar? The numbers suggest good things have happened, and expectations are for good results ahead. In the last 5 years, earnings grew by an impressive 48.5% annually, on average. Revenues went up by 39.5% annually, on average, in the same time. Now analysts are predicting a little slowdown. Look for sales to increase by ""only"" 31% a year, on average, over the next 5 years. Earnings are expected to grow by a ""mere"" 30% a year, on average. Of course, all this good news hasn't been buried and lost on investors. The stock carries a P/E [price to earnings] ratio of 54. Here are some more impressive numbers. Return on Equity last year was 21.5%. This year it should hit 23.5%. It's predicted to be 24% next year. Revenues were $885 million last year. They are fore-casted to be $1.4 billion this year and $1.92 billion next year. Net profit margin is 16.4% this year, down a little from 17.4% last year. There is no debt, and the company has about $535 million in cash or equivalents. That war chest gives CTSH plenty of options. Most likely it will continue to make acquisitions in the U.S., India and Europe. With a solid growth company, it's unlikely a dividend is forthcoming. Most shareholders like the return on their equity the company is earning rather than paying them the money to find those returns. Still, many technology companies are paying a quarterly stipend and maybe a small token to shareholders will be forthcoming. Probably not, but when there's lots of cash laying around, shareholders get nervous and want it used or given to them. Ask Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Here's what happened last quarter. Revenues were up 60%, thanks to an increased market share in healthcare, life sciences, and financial services sectors. Earnings jumped by 43%. The company hired 4700 new employees and is aiming for a total of 38,000 total employees by the end of the year. Plans are to spend about $200 million in India through 2008 to expand its infrastructure and hire more than 30,000 new employees. [These new sites are usually built within special economic zones which give the company generous tax benefits.] So what's not to like? Nothing about the company. It's growing as fast as almost any company you can find. The problem is the price of the stock. At 54 times earnings, the price fully reflects the powerful story CTSH tells. Unless CTSH can surprise analysts on the upside, it seems investors have pushed the price a little beyond what the earnings warrant. So if you're going to investigate CTSH further and get excited about all the great numbers, keep in mind one of the largest: the p/e ratio. Investors know this great story and have rewarded the stock's price accordingly.    Disclosure: Author has no position in CTSH"
20710,20073,2006-11-16T10:19:53-05:00,,"Eddy Elfenbein submits: One of the more fascinating companies in the world today is Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH). The company, along with Wipro (NYSE:WIT) and Infosys (NYSE:INFY), is one of the foremost names associated with IT outsourcing, particularly to India. While Cognizant is officially based in lovely Teaneck, NJ, its heart truly lies in the subcontinent. The company currently has over two dozen development centers in India. The growth in this business is simply astounding. The IT/outsourcing sector of the Indian economy is expected to grow from $17.2 billion in 2004 to $50 billion by 2009. For any company looking to cut costs and have someone else handle their IT problems, Cognizant is great place to go. Half of their business is clients in the financial services sector. In fact, JP MorganChase, one of the scions of Wall Street, is a major client. Another 20% of Cognizant’s business comes from health care companies like UnitedHealth. Cognizant was spun off from Dun & Bradstreet a few years ago and it hasn’t looked back since. As someone who pores over lots of financial statements, I can tell you that Cognizant’s results are extremely impressive. The company has consistently been able to grow its earnings over 50% a year. That’s no easy trick. Also, the company has a solid balance sheet and its operating margins are often around 20%. The shares have soared from $12 four years ago to $80 today. In fact, the stock just made a new all-time high. The big news recently is that it was added to the S&P 500. Two weeks ago, Cognizant reported third-quarter earnings of 40 cents a share, two cents more than Wall Street was expecting. For the current quarter, Cognizant expects earnings of 42 cents a share, and that will bring 2006’s total to $1.51 a share (the results are a bit skewed due to the FASB 123R jazz). What about next year? The Street is all over the place. The consensus is currently looking for $2.04 a share, which means that Cognizant is going for about 40 times forward earnings. That’s even pricier than Google. Here’s a spreadsheet with all of Cognizant’s stats from its income statement going back a few years. If you’re new to investing, this might be worth looking over. I know it might appear as a jumble of numbers, but as far as income statements go, it doesn’t get much better. Here's a stock chart of CTSH with its earnings in the gold line (right scale). When the lines cross, that means the trailing p/e ratio is 50:  In early 2002, Cognizant's p/e ratio was roughly the same as the S&P 500. Today. it's over three times the S&P 500."

One that stood out in particular was its cultural affinity with US clients. ‘What makes them so good is their ability to understand the U.S. culture,’ said one customer reference, who rated Cognizant as its top applications outsourcing [AO] provider. Cognizant also exhibited strong price competitiveness: a one-two punch that helps to explain its rapid growth.” The rankings represent Forrester’s selection of the top performers from each of the major categories that make up the North American Applications Outsourcing Providers – multinational corporations (MNC’s) and offshore players. Top companies in each sector were chosen based on current offerings (technical, engagement and functional approach; client references; and complementary capabilities), strategy (solution and corporate) and market presence (based on customer base, financial performance and engagement profile). The Forrester Wave graphic below (also available on Cognizant's website) clearly depicts how Cognizant has edged above the biggies TCS, Infosys (NYSE:INFY) and Wipro (NYSE:WIT) in the Applications Outsourcing space in North America.  This is of great significance as North America is the largest market for IT Ousourcing, and Applications Outsourcing is where most of the IT dollars are spent.

11165,20171,2006-05-24T08:09:34-04:00,,"We have written several times on Cognizant Technology Systems (NASDAQ:CTSH). The IT outsourcing firm has been growing rapidly and gaining market share, and trades at a price/earnings multiple in line with its growth rate, which is to say uncommonly low compared to other high-growth technology names.  We noted before our belief that the greatest risk for Cognizant is managing its growth. We still believe that, although recently the stock is trading down due to some of the other risks it faces. For one, Cognizant is a high-growth, high-beta Nasdaq name, and when the Nasdaq rises or falls one might expect Cognizant to do the same, in spades. However, due to its exposure to India, Cognizant also tends to trade in line with that market. As the chart below demonstrates, over time Cognizant tends to perform somewhere in between the Nasdaq markets and the Indian market (we use The India Fund (NYSE:IFN) as a proxy for that market.) CTSH, IFN, and IXIC comparative performance, last 2 months:  Both Bloomberg and the New York Times highlighted yesterday’s 10 per cent drop in Indian markets. They make Cognizant’s 3.5 per cent drop look tame. Seeking Alpha has charts of the weekly performance of US-traded Indian stocks that highlights just how well Cognizant has reacted (it had the third-best performance).  Bloomberg pinned the blame for falling India shares on Japanese investors taking money off the table. Alternatively, it could be one of a host of other risk factors, including political risks, perceived risks in the Indian rupee/US dollar exchange rate, etc. It doesn’t much matter while the shares are falling. Cognizant is the type of high-quality company that is worth buying when the market turns sour. However, it is also worth waiting until the bottom has been put in. No sense trying to catch a falling knife, as they say. Still, while we continue to believe that Cognizant is a good value, there are certainly a fair share of naysayers who believe the company is still overpriced at current levels. Weighing in on the bear side is a recent article from Motley Fool, ""Considering a Costly Cognizant."" In it the author lists four reasons why it’s overpriced: Valid arguments, all.  It is worth noting that Cognizant has chosen to limit margins itself by investing in future growth. When business is strong enough that margins start creeping above their 20 percent target, they speed up their hiring process and bring in more college grads. For the first year these new employees are a money-losing proposition as they must receive extensive training. Yet without them there is no potential for future growth due to the nature of the consulting business. Furthermore, regardless of how much competition there is or how many companies are starting their own IT offices in India, there is no indication that growth will slow any time soon. The Motley Fool author notes that his own IT offshoring business is booked solid through 2009. Some investments are about moats and leverage. Cognizant is about a massive secular shift that will take several years to complete. As this shift winds down it will be important to reconsider the sustainability of Cognizant’s business. In the meantime, there are more pressing concerns. CTSH 1-yr chart:"

The good news is, that while the tax rate will remain at the higher level permanently (after rising in 2009), once a year has passed it will no longer affect Cognizant’s growth rate. The bad news is, investors should start preparing now for the normalized tax rate. That means lower valuations than the company has historically earned."
10708,20171,2006-05-17T00:13:20-04:00,,"Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) is a rapidly growing IT Services provider. Future earnings growth is likely to moderate for a number of reasons: 1) depreciation expense is likely to grow faster than sales; 2) operating margins are higher than the company’s long-term target; 3) the company currently enjoys tax holidays on a large portion of its revenue, and the holidays are set to expire in 2009; 4) revenue growth of 57 per cent annually will likely slow. However, the near-term growth outlook appears undeterred by these concerns. Investors should keep an eye on unbilled receivables and the relationship between cash flow and net income, which are the most significant blemishes on a fairly attractive fundamental picture.
Income statement analysis
Sales growth – overall revenues increased 57.1 per cent. By segment (in order of size), financial services customers grew 51.4 per cent, healthcare grew 77.2 per cent, manufacturing/retail/logistics grew 25.2 per cent and “other” grew 103.0 per cent. The “other” category grew as a result of the Fathom acquisition in Q205 and the addition of new customers, primarily media and new technology customers.
Sales quality
Seasonality – Rapid growth has obscured any seasonality to the company’s fundamentals. From a trading perspective, the stock tends to do best from September through February.
Earnings quality
Other – diluted share count increased by five million year/year (2.5 per cent.)
Balance sheet analysis
Debt load and maturity schedule – minimal debt.
Value of unexercised options – the intrinsic value of unexercised options is $673 million, which is the minimum value for what some analysts consider to be an off-balance sheet liability.
Accruals
Receivables trends (DSO) - Receivables grew faster than sales in Q1.
Long-term or unbilled receivables - $33 million unbilled
Cash flow analysis
Operating cash flow and net income trends – net income increased by $17.2 million year/year to $47 million, while cash from operations was negative in the first quarter of both periods. Cash from operations deteriorated by $3.5 million to a $3.9 million deficit in Q12006. However, the requirement to expense stock options resulted in a reclassification of $9.1 million from operating to financial cash flows. Without this change, cash from operations would have increased $5.6 million year/year and been positive, although both the growth and the total cash provided by operations would have been much smaller than net income. This is part of a longer trend, as cash flow was $22 million higher than net income for FY03 and $27 million higher for FY04, but was $7 million less than net income in 2005. As the relationship of cash flow to net income is considered one of the most important indicators of earnings quality, this is a significant trend to monitor.
Free cash flow and net income trends – free cash flow remains positive but is now trailing net income significantly. This may simply be a function of the company’s rapid growth.
Capital investment relative to depreciation – As befits a rapid growth company, capital expenditures are much higher than depreciation. In 2006 capex was three times the level of depreciation due to aggressive expansion of their facilities in India. The higher spending will increase depreciation in future years, which will act as a headwind for earnings growth, but the facilities will house more consultants who presumably will drive revenue growth.
Footnotes
Legal issues – none disclosed.
Social concerns – immigration and offshoring remain hot-button issues and could expose the company to negative publicity, legislation, or boycotts by certain investor groups.
Growth indicators
Guidance - On its May 3, 2006 earnings report, the company provided the following guidance:
Consensus estimates are currently at the high end to slightly above management’s guidance range.
Backlogs – while the company does not have backlogs per se, it added five strategic clients (clients expected to eventually contribute $5 million per year or more in annual revenue) in the first quarter, ending the period with 72.
Deferred revenue - unknown
Macro-economic factors – For its onsite staff, Cognizant relies primarily on Indian nationals. These employees require visas to work in the customer’s homeland. In the US, where Cognizant currently generates the bulk of its revenue, the award of H-1b and other visas has been restricted significantly since the 9/11/2001 terrorist attacks. A significant disruption to visa issuance could curb growth, at least temporarily.
Industry analysis
Industry growth – very rapid
Market share and trends over time – the industry is very competitive but difficult to define narrowly. Cognizant’s nearest competitors, who also employ an onsite/offshore model, are Infosys (NYSE:INFY), Tata Consultancy Services, and WIPRO (NYSE:WIT). In addition, large IT consulting firms such as Accenture (NYSE:ACN), IBM Global Services (NYSE:IBM), and Electronic Data Systems (NASDAQ:EDS) offer offshore services. Finally, many potential customers have in-house IT staffs.

10703,20171,2006-05-16T07:03:30-04:00,,"Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) is a stock we have followed for a number of years. Although it trades at a relatively lofty 47x 2006 earnings expectations, its year over year growth in revenue (57.1 per cent), net income (47.5 per cent) and EPS (45.4 per cent) seem to argue that the valuation is merited. That's especially true when one considers that the reported growth in net income and earnings per share was hindered by the new requirement to record an expense for stock options. Those multiples appear reasonable if that growth is at all sustainable. Is it? We have always been in awe of Cognizant’s growth, especially in its business of IT consulting. (Cognizant uses an onsite/offshore model in which local consultants work on premises at customer facilities to determine need and coordinate a team of engineers in India to do the needed work.) Since there are only so many billable hours in the day, in order to increase revenue consulting firms need to increase the number of consultants. And between March 31, 2005 and March 31, 2006 Cognizant added 9,700 employees to end the latest quarter with a total of 26,750. Think about it. A company that already had a large number of employees (17,050 at March 31, 2005) grew its employee base by 57 per cent in one year. Plus, if the 11 per cent annualized turnover the company experienced in the latest quarter is typical (by our recollection it seems on the low side) that means they would have lost 2,400 employees to attrition during the time (11 per cent of the average number of employees during the year.) So to add 9,700 employees the company had to hire 12,000. Almost 50 new hires every working day. Even if they hire a quarter of all applicants that means interviewing 200 per day. And if they want to grow another 50 per cent next year they will have to hire 75 new employees each workday this year. By all accounts there are plenty of graduating software engineers in India to hire. But that is still one heck of a logistical exercise. And someday it will be too much to handle and the company will trip up. If we had to point to one specific risk factor as being Cognizant’s greatest, it would be managing all of that growth. We don’t think it will happen this year, but it could. Or, just as likely, they could continue to coast for several more years. And in the meantime, it is a nice problem to have.

4381298,103480,2020-10-26T08:47:42-04:00,"Shares of Citrix plummeted ~10% after the company's third-quarter earnings release, despite beating Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom line.
        The company's revenue growth decelerated, due to a continued shift away from license products and into SaaS.
        Beginning on October 1 (which is Citrix's Q4), Citrix removed several perpetual license products and replaced them with SaaS-only options.
        Over the long haul, the increasing SaaS mix and growing ARR will help investors to see Citrix more in-line with enterprise SaaS peers.
        Citrix looks advantageously valued at <20x its pro forma EPS guidance for FY21.","Many of the stocks that saw some of the largest surges amid the work-from-home trade, including Slack (WORK), Upwork (UPWK), and now Citrix (CTXS) are now losing a bit of their luster on the concerns that the gains from the pandemic are going to be shorter-lived than the market originally expected.Citrix, in particular, has been one a sharp losing streak of late. Since hitting peaks above $170 in July, shares of Citrix have sunk ~30%, and the past week alone has seen a ~10% correction after Citrix's third-quarter earnings report failed to raise investor sentiment.My take on the recent moves: Citrix is a stock that requires patience. This is an unlikely company to take on a cloud transition, but these are the types of transformational business shifts that require more than just a few quarters to execute. Seasoned software investors will recall that even companies that are riding high today like Autodesk (ADSK) and Splunk (SPLK) had their rocky moments in the quarters leading up to becoming predominantly SaaS-driven companies.Citrix is attempting to do the same thing now. The benefit for Citrix is that the company wields a very foundational and critical piece of technology. Citrix Workspace is one of the leading tools for desktop virtualization - which lets users access their applications virtually no matter what device they are actually on. Tools like this have been around for a long time, but have only become emboldened in the wake of the pandemic - and even when offices return to normal operations, a larger proportion of people will still be logging in from remote places and requiring virtualization services. In other words, Citrix provides a lot of the tools that power modern productivity. Moving these tools toward a subscription-based consumption model is what Citrix is trying to achieve now, both to smooth out and maximize its revenue streams over time as well as to ease adoption for new customers. When you look back in market history at stocks that have successfully pulled off this type of transition, they have not all been flashy, new-age tech stocks like Splunk. Autodesk, too, had been around for a long time before deciding to pull the plug on license sales and focusing on SaaS. Both stocks have been rewarded handsomely with strong gains for successfully converting into subscription-first offerings, and Citrix investors have a chance to do the same.Citrix is very attractively valued in spite of its potential SaaS tailwinds. For next year, the company has guided to $6.20-$6.40 in pro forma EPS, representing ~10% EPS growth (consensus is currently sitting just shy of the low end, at $6.19 - per Yahoo Finance). Against the midpoint of this earnings view, Citrix trades at just a 19.2x forward P/E ratio, which is modest when considering A) how expensive most tech stocks are against earnings, for those who have positive earnings, and B) in the near term Citrix's results will be hamstrung by its shift to SaaS because it will be giving up bulky license deals, but in the long run the company should be able to drive substantially larger revenue/profits.Stay long here and use the dip to carve out a position in this stock.Let's now review Citrix's third-quarter update in greater detail. The Q3 earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Citrix Q3 resultsSource: Citrix Q3 shareholder letterCitrix's revenue grew 5% y/y to $767.9 million, decelerating two points versus Q2's 7% y/y growth rate (and very sharply versus Q1's 20% y/y growth rate, but that quarter was benefited by one-time remote work setups). Still, Citrix did outpace Wall Street's consensus expectations of $758.1 million (+3% y/y) with a comfortable cushion.It's less the near-term results and more about the progress on subscription that I'm eyeing, however. Citrix's subscription mix as a percentage of total bookings hit an all-time high of 77% this quarter, as shown in the trending chart below. That's up sixteen points from last year, highlighting the speed of Citrix's conversion from license sales to subscription. Figure 2. Citrix subscription mix trendsSource: Citrix Q3 shareholder letterIn very brief prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call, CEO David Henshall called out strength in Citrix's execution, particularly for its core Workspace product:On October 1, Citrix made the decision to ""sunset"" some of its perpetual licenses, including for Citrix Workspace, and give customers the option of only purchasing an on-premises subscription or a SaaS subscription (the only difference being where the software is hosted - either in a customer's infrastructure or in the cloud, but either way being paid to Citrix as a subscription fee). This move will continue to accelerate Citrix's transition toward cloud.It's important to recognize that this will cause revenue deceleration in the near term, which we've already seen in Q3 and will see especially more in FY21 as the company comps against a tough FY20. Perpetual licenses offer more revenue upfront, but subscription revenue fees spread out this revenue (but more of it) over a longer period of time. The upside, however, is more predictability of revenue, less sales touch needed for renewals, and hopefully higher margins in the long run. Citrix has aggressively increased its ARR base - as of the end of Q3, Citrix's subscription ARR crossed the $1 billion mark for the first time, growing 53% y/y to $1.03 billion. SaaS is the overwhelming majority of this ARR base, with an ARR of $630 million. Figure 3. Citrix ARR trendsSource: Citrix Q3 shareholder letterBut even in spite of this cloud transition, Citrix was able to expand its profitability. GAAP operating margins bumped up to 16.7%, a 160bps increase versus 15.1% in the year-ago quarter, while Citrix's pro forma EPS of $1.38 beat Wall Street's expectations of $1.25 with 10% upside.Investors have an opportunity to buy into Citrix at ~30% off peak prices and bank on its subscription transition to lift valuation multiples in FY21. The company's >50% ARR growth is an encouraging signal for a stock that is sitting at a very modest 19x forward P/E ratio. Stay long here."
4352134,56142,2020-06-05T03:31:57-04:00,"Citrix may hold decent long-term value against a rosy earnings growth future, using GARP and PEG ideas.High operating margins and returns are noteworthy versus the typical S&P 500 business.Robust upside momentum and buying trends are standout bullish signals, continuing in May-June.","Citrix Systems (CTXS) has witnessed super-strong accumulation trends the past year and is a real beneficiary of the work-from-home shift resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. It is a solid Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) choice, after some price consolidation since early April. Digesting large gains from heightened investor interest earlier in the year, Citrix today holds its best value proposition since the first days of COVID-19 arriving in America.Citrix provides workspace and networking solutions worldwide through software and internet connected computers. The company offers digital working environments; a cloud-based file sharing and storage solution, which provides enterprise-class data services on various corporate and personal mobile devices; mobility and device management capabilities; and workspace intelligence, customizing and streamlining user workflows. It also markets a microapp creation with low-code tooling to automate tasks and functions. Plus, Citrix provides networking products that deliver flexible, automated, secure connectivity and performance for the workspace, including analytic and security software.Image Source: Company WebsiteThe company is a leading work-from-home software and network access provider for government customers and businesses of all sizes. So, the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders have been a boon for its business operations, as you might have guessed. During the March quarter, revenues rose +20% and cash earnings +65% versus the same 2019 period. Below are graphs of the last four quarters of earnings against analyst estimates, and projections for 2020-21 income per share taken from Seeking Alpha.My read of the situation is the pandemic may last longer than expected, perhaps with a major second wave starting in October. If this prediction proves correct, earnings estimates may be on the low side for the rest of 2020 and all of 2021. It is quite possible investors are paying multiples in the low-20s on cash earnings for this year and less than 20x basis next year’s operating results. In contrast, the U.S. stock market is richly valued with P/Es in the 20s as the norm, on falling sales and income during the 2020 recession. In a relative valuation comparison, Citrix’s mid-20s trailing multiple on the prospect of 10-15% annual income gains during this year and next seems well worth the price of admission for investors.Citrix is becoming a bigger player in the quickly growing cloud storage market, and has engaged in a concerted push to move all customers (including workspace and networking) to long-term subscription plans. Both of these efforts should help to generate steadier growth and improved margins over time. The company, nonetheless, has been quick to respond to the short-term demand surge from our coronavirus pandemic work-from-home reality with simple digital downloads and more pay-as-you-go type options. Below are a graph and table of Citrix’s progress in high-growth cloud offerings and overall subscription selling.Image Source: Company Q1 Earnings ReportCitrix has a clean balance sheet, although missing significant cash assets or net tangible equity. Still, it owns a relatively flexible and conservative setup, with a theoretical 3x years of cash flow able to pay off all net liabilities (after subtracting current assets). In comparison, the S&P 500 average business holds a greater-than-5x ratio of net long-term liabilities to trailing cash flow.The company borrowed $1 billion in early 2020 to help repurchase common shares, and jump reported per share results. Overall, Citrix has bought back about 30% of its outstanding float the last decade. Another return of shareholder capital, the company started an owner dividend a few years ago, today standing at 1% for annual yield on a $1.40 payout.Gross profit margins have been stable at a sky-high 85%. Citrix’s net after-tax profit margin is approaching 24%, a decade high currently. Both numbers are roughly triple the S&P 500 averages. Large share buybacks have stretched the return on equity into a top-tier position, and the return on assets calculation is at 10-year record. You can review the noteworthy margin and return picture below on a 5-year chart.In the end, Wall Street is pricing this strong profit margin, better-than-average growth prospect at more expensive valuations versus its recent past. Below, you can review the basic financial valuation story of price-to-trailing 12-month sales, cash flow, book value and free cash flow. While Citrix is at the upper end of its 10-year range for valuation, remember, the S&P 500 is priced in the nosebleed section on a similar decade-long snapshot, with declining operating numbers. If you are going to pay abnormally high valuations, you should require super profit margins and returns, plus sharply expanding results like the Citrix proposition.The best part of the Citrix bull story is the robust accumulation trends in a number of momentum indicators I follow. The Accumulation/Distribution Line (ADL), Negative Volume Index (NVI) and On Balance Volume (OBV) indicator have all been in steep uptrends over the last 12 months. The ADL measures intraday buying using the closing print against the daily range (green arrow on chart below); the NVI looks at buying/selling trends on falling volume, quieter news days (red arrow); and the OBV is a record of price changes multiplied by daily volume (blue arrow). In unison, these three are highlighting about as positive an argument as exists in the U.S. stock market in early June. In particular, the Citrix NVI condition may be the most bullish of any equity in the peer S&P 500 index on a trailing 52-week basis, similar to the Amazon (AMZN) or Apple (AAPL) 2020 charts. Please review the 1-year and 2-year Citrix charts measuring the strong momentum that has continued throughout the last nine weeks of price consolidation.Putting the whole investment argument together, Citrix appears to be a unique GARP selection with plenty of buy momentum. The stock price is high, but not inordinately so. If underlying business growth continues and/or accelerates, another price gain in the stock of 20-50% may occur into 2021.A Price-to-Earnings Growth (PEG) valuation around 1.5x is not the same bargain you can capture at the end of a long bear market in stocks. However, it’s about as good as you can find in June 2020 (after a 40% market gain off the March lows) from any company expected to generate rising income levels this year and next.Outside of normal competitive risks, the only critical issue the company may have to face is a weaker economy overall into 2021. If we get a new black swan economic shock from a geopolitical war, or record Federal Reserve money printing fails to support main street USA, or the coronavirus comes back uglier and meaner than April during the winter months, Citrix could hypothetically sustain a meaningful equity price drop. However, under these circumstances I would expect the S&P 500 to decline as much or more than the company in percentage terms.A Citrix position may fit best as a minor holding in a diversified portfolio construction. A 1-2% size in your portfolio would be enough to add Citrix exposure, without risking much capital if an unexpected period of underperformance versus the general stock market appears. The elimination of nearly all commissions and trading costs at online brokers makes buying small positions a breeze, even for traders/investors with limited capital.Thanks for reading.

4361019,103480,2020-07-27T11:20:38-04:00,"Shares of Citrix Systems have slid a breathtaking ~20% since reporting Q2 results.
        This is in spite of beating Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom line.
        Revenues grew at 7% y/y this quarter versus 20% y/y in Q1, but this was largely expected. Citrix had only guided to 2-3% y/y growth.
        The one-time pandemic-related deals in Q1 and stronger subscription mix in Q2 are solid reasons for the deceleration.","For investors who have been itching to gain exposure to remote work software stocks but have shied away due to valuation, Citrix Systems (CTXS) now presents a compelling buy opportunity. The enterprise software company - one of the oldest-known brands that has supported virtual and remote workspaces since its founding in the late 80s - has dropped a dramatic ~20% after reporting second-quarter results, despite beating Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines, exceeding its own guidance, and showing strength in converting its business toward a recurring-revenue, subscription-based model.Citrix's sharp fall over the past week now takes its year-to-date gains to just ~25%: still respectable, of course, but far below the momentum trades in the tech sector this year, many of which have seen their share prices more than double. To me, this decline is just near-term profit taking. Demand looks extremely strong for Citrix's products in the wake of the coronavirus, even if some of the deals that the company struck in Q1 were one-time.The bullish thesis for Citrix, in my view, is still very much intact. Here are the key pieces of that thesis:In short, stay long here and pick up more shares on the dip.Let's now parse through Citrix's second-quarter results in greater detail. The below chart takes a look at how Citrix's growth has trended over each of the past few quarters:Figure 1. Citrix revenue trendsSource: Citrix Q2 earnings releaseThe first thing you will notice here, of course, is that Citrix's revenue decelerated thirteen points to just 7% y/y growth versus 20% y/y growth in Q1. Of course, this was largely expected - in reporting the strongest Q1 that it had in decades, Citrix noted that $111 million of its revenue during that quarter was due to one-time ""business continuity"" deployments that it did for customers that had to hurriedly piece together a strategy for working remotely. That $111 million represented fifteen points of growth relative to 1Q19 revenues of $719 million - so after stripping that out, Citrix's natural growth rate in Q1 would have been 5% y/y.Citrix more or less guided to revenues returning back to the low single-digit rates that it had seen pre-pandemic. Its guidance for Q2 had called for just 2-3% y/y revenue growth, and Wall Street expectations for $769.1 million (+3% y/y) hovered in that range as well. Instead, Citrix delivered 7% y/y revenue growth, beating consensus by a wide four-point margin.We note as well that while single-digit revenue growth isn't anything to be excited about, it's Citrix's conversion to cloud that is showing a drag on revenue. You can see in the revenue breakout above that the ""old"" model of consuming software - selling a license upfront and then earnings support fees on the duration of that license - is on the decline, as Citrix is favoring moving its customers over to a subscription-based model. So effectively Citrix is robbing itself of near-term revenues in order to secure a steadier, richer stream of recurring revenue for the future.Looking at some of its cloud-specific metrics helps to validate this decision. In Q1, Citrix's subscription bookings as a mix of overall product bookings hit 76% - up fourteen points versus the year-ago quarter. Source: Citrix Q2 earnings releaseSimilarly, Citrix's Subscription ARR vaulted up 55% y/y to $949 million as of the end of Q2:Source: Citrix Q2 earnings releaseSo here's how I would summarize Citrix's revenue trend. Last quarter, I wrote that Citrix would at least be able to sustain some portion of its accelerated growth trends - and it did, with growth lifting to 7% y/y versus its usual 2-3% y/y mark. And it did so even with a much stronger mix of cloud bookings, which actually takes down near-term revenue. Here's how Citrix qualitatively described its second-quarter sales momentum in its shareholder letter:It's important to touch as well on Citrix's strong profitability trends. Operating margins rose to 18.0% on a GAAP basis, expanding 340bps from 15.6% in the year-ago quarter. Pro forma EPS of $1.53, meanwhile, grew 26% y/y and beat Wall Street's expectations of $1.23 (+1% y/y) by a twenty-point margin. Citrix's current P/E ratio of ~23x based on Wall Street's consensus FY21 EPS target of $6.14 (per Yahoo Finance) may look fully valued, but when considering 26% y/y EPS growth this quarter plus the tailwinds on the subscription side, we like Citrix's <1x PEG ratio all the more.It's also worth touching on the recently expanded relationship with Microsoft in greater detail. Just this month, Citrix announced that it would be expanding its go-to-market partnership with Microsoft. As part of the deal, Microsoft sales reps would be leading with Citrix Cloud and Citrix Workspace as part of their ongoing push to move more customers to Azure.Take a look at the summary points below:Source: Citrix Q2 earnings releaseWhile the revenue impact of this deal is still unclear, having the sales might of Microsoft behind it - plus the fact that Azure is still growing at a ~50% y/y pace - adds further impetus to Citrix being able to sustain its above-historical revenue growth rates over the near term.There's a lot to like about Citrix heading out of the second-quarter earnings season, and I think the ~20% pullback in shares was a knee-jerk profit taking reaction that isn't at all justified by Citrix's results. In raising its full-year revenue outlook from $3.10-$3.16 billion to $3.18-$3.21 billion (+6-10% y/y), Citrix also sailed above Wall Street's consensus target for FY20 of $3.18 billion - so there's no red flags on the forward-looking horizon either. Stay long and buy the dip."

In addition, a COVID-19 related tailwind (discussed later) is also driving the share price. However, these near-term positive factors are already built into the share price, and I expect the stock to stay in a range in the near term. In the long term, the stock has a modest upside left. Long-term investors can buy the stock during meaningful pullbacks.Citrix, primarily a software company, develops workspace and networking solutions that help its customers improve the productivity of their employees. The company's workspace solutions help its customers access the apps and content employees need to be productive. The company's networking solutions complement its workspace solutions by delivering the apps and data employees need.Source: PixabayCitrix WorkspaceCitrix Workspace platform is the company's primary growth driver. The platform offers an array of features that tie together lots of applications that enterprises need. The platform also offers a secure and intelligent workspace solution that helps IT administrators easily manage security threats. The platform can be delivered both on-premise and in the cloud.Citrix Workspace can be combined with widely used business applications developed by tech leaders, such as Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Salesforce (CRM), and Workday (WDAY). With cloud and enterprise mobility solutions growing significantly in the market, the Citrix Workspace platform is seeing strong demand among enterprises.Citrix NetworkingThe company's family of networking products is another growth driver. Various apps and data can be delivered with security and speed with the help of the company's networking products. The networking products consist of Citrix ADC and Citrix SD-WAN. Citrix ADC is an application delivery controller and a load balancer that work for traditional, web, and cloud-native applications. Citrix SD-WAN is a next-generation WAN Edge solution that simplifies digital transformation for enterprises and delivers automated and secure connectivity for the Citrix Workspace.Citrix's workspace and networking businesses together generate data that spans network traffic, files, endpoints, and users. Applying machine learning on the data helps Citrix offer customers valuable analytics and insights. This is one of the company's competitive advantages that helps the company grow its market share for its networking products.First, with apps and data moving fast from data centers to the cloud, the company's products and resources are also increasingly targeting the cloud as their area of operation. Second, with recurring contracts gaining popularity among tech businesses, the company's business model is transitioning to subscription-based from perpetual license-based. Third, the company is shifting away from selling individual point products to selling platform-based products to its customers. I believe these changes in the business model will help the company grow its revenue faster as the overall industry climate is favoring these changes.Citrix belongs to an intensely competitive industry. The company believes that (according to the company's 10-K) price competition could become a significant competitive factor in the future, and therefore, the company may not be able to maintain its historic prices and margins. This could adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.Citrix's competitors for its Workspace platform are VMware (VMW), Okta (OKTA), Box (BOX), Dropbox (DBX), Amazon, and Microsoft. Citrix's competitive advantage is that it offers the only solution that works for an individual employee. In addition, it offers unified management and security policies for all components of the digital workspace.In networking, Citrix ADC hardware products compete with F5 Networks (FFIV), Radware (RDWR), A10 Networks (ATEN), Cisco (CSCO), Amazon, and Microsoft. Citrix ADC competes on the basis of offering operational consistency across multi-cloud and centralized management through a single pane of glass. Citrix SD-WAN products compete with Riverbed, VMware, Cisco, Silver Peak Systems, and Oracle (ORCL). Citrix SD-WAN competes on the basis of offering virtual, cloud, and SaaS applications together so that they can perform their best.Citrix's first quarter 2020 subscription ARR (annualized recurring revenue) came in at $837 million, up 50% YoY, and SaaS ARR came in at $555 million, up 48% YoY. The company's first quarter 2020 reported revenue came in at $861 million, up 20% YoY. The company's first quarter 2020 GAAP diluted EPS was $1.42, up 82% YoY, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.73, up 36% YoY.The company delivered strong first quarter 2020 results, driven by a COVID-19 related tailwind. Demand for the company's products accelerated in order to address business continuity needs and to support work from home. To support work from home, Citrix created a flexible and shorter duration offering which was a limited use on-premises term subscription available at a discounted price. As a result, the company's subscription revenue significantly increased.Citrix's peer group includes F5 Networks, VMware, A10 Networks, Box, and Dropbox. Citrix's non-GAAP forward PE multiple is 26.01x compared to F5 Networks' 15.48x, VMware's 23.11x, A10 Networks' 31.67x, Box's 44.36x, and Dropbox's 30.31x. Citrix's trailing 12-month price to sales multiple is 6.02x, compared to F5 Networks' 3.68x, VMware's 5.33x, A10 Networks' 2.36x, Box's 3.59x, and Dropbox's 5.28x. Citrix's trailing 12-month price to cash flow multiple is 22.67x, compared to F5 Networks' 12.53x, VMware's 14.90x, A10 Networks' 29.35x, Box's 57.46x, and Dropbox's 17.63x.Citrix is attractively valued compared to its peers. However, the company has a weak balance sheet with $550.52 million of cash and $1.98 billion of debt. The company's net leverage is 1.85x, which is okay. I believe the company's business model transformation is good news from a shareholder's point of view. The company's stock is creating new highs despite a challenging macro environment due to this ongoing change in the business model. Plus the COVID-19 related tailwind is also driving the stock. The company's relative valuation is attractive and it is allowing the stock to go up. However, I believe the company's near-term positives have been built into the stock price and the stock will stay in a range in the near term.In the past five years, Citrix's CAGR revenue growth remained flat. I expect that the new business model will help the company grow its revenue at a CAGR of mid-single digits in the next five years. The company's trailing 12-month revenue is $3,152.4 million. At a CAGR of 5%, the company's mid-2025 revenue will be $4,024.00 million or $32.60 per share. In the last five years, Citrix's stock has traded between the price to sales multiples of 6.5x and 2.5x. Applying a price to sales multiple of 6.5x on the company's mid-2025 revenue per share, I get $211.90 as its mid-2025 share price.Use of Citrix's services involves the transmission and/or storage of data of the company, its customers, and other parties. With the company continuing to develop its products, it hosts and transmits potentially sensitive data. If the company cannot properly maintain its products and computer networks, service vulnerabilities could occur, which could result in unauthorized access to confidential information. As a result, the reputation of the company could be damaged, which could negatively impact the company's revenue growth, operating results, and cash flow.For the company to be successful, its newer products and services must be accepted in the market. The company's Workspace platform is one of its newer products. It will see increasing adoption if Citrix can offer use cases beyond traditional Application Virtualization and VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure) solutions. The company's new Workspace solutions may not be accepted in the market, which could adversely affect the company's revenue growth and operating results.Citrix is a low-growth company. Its Workspace platform and networking products are its current growth drivers. The company is changing its business model, which is another growth driver. However, Citrix is not a diversified company with plenty of products to offer to its customers. Therefore, its stock has a modest upside in the long term. Long-term investors should wait for significant dips to buy the stock."
4340585,103480,2020-04-28T12:37:44-04:00,"Citrix Systems massively outperformed its own expectations in the first quarter as revenues jumped 20% y/y, versus estimates for roughly flat growth.
        As expected, Citrix has seen a massive boost in demand for its products thanks to the shift to fully remote offices.
        Even so, Citrix barely lifted its full-year revenue outlook beyond single-digit growth, suggesting a cautious guidance stance that leaves plenty of room for upside.
        Citrix also remains a powerful free cash flow generator.","By now, virtualization is an old technology. Citrix Systems (CTXS) has been a legacy software company for quite some time now, barely able to lift its revenues beyond single-digit growth as it endeavored to transition its customers to a recurring-revenue subscription model. But now the sudden demand for remote work tools as offices around the globe re-configure to accommodate shelter-in-place restrictions has proven to be a huge boon to Citrix. Shares are up nearly 30% year-to-date, and in Citrix Systems' recent Q1 earnings release, the company has proven that the coronavirus has been a huge tailwind to business:The last time I wrote on Citrix before the coronavirus hit, the company was looking like a dead stock with stalling growth. Now, however, Citrix looks like it has plenty of room to run higher. Citrix has long been a forgotten legacy stock amid a software sector with much faster-growing names, but given Citrix's new resurgence in growth and investors' obsession with piling onto stay-at-home names (Zoom (ZM), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN)), the company has a chance to raise its profile and get included in the momentum trade.Let's first check in on Citrix's fundamentals. The big highlight was in Citrix's first-quarter results, shown in the snapshot below:Figure 1. Citrix 1Q20 resultsSource: Citrix 1Q20 earnings releaseRevenues grew 20% y/y to $860.1 million. For reference, Citrix had only guided to $730-$740 million in revenue for the quarter (only +2% y/y to +3% y/y growth), and Wall Street had pegged the quarter at $734.3 million (+2% y/y), representing one of the biggest beats in the earnings season so far. The big question is around how much of this revenue growth can be sustained. In a shareholder letter explaining the quarter's results, Citrix strikes a cautious tone, writing as follows:Specifically, Citrix chalks up $111 million of this quarter's revenues - effectively the majority of its beat - to ""business continuity"" solutions sold on an ad hoc basis to Citrix's customers through the use of short-duration licenses. The most pessimistic view would assume that this uplift in revenues will be short-lived, contributing $111 million in Q1 and perhaps another small short-term burst in Q2. This seems to be what is implied in Citrix's full-year guidance. In Q2, Citrix expects revenue growth to fall back down to 2-3% y/y growth, and for the full year, Citrix has only marginally raised its revenue outlook to $3.10-$3.16 billion, up ever so slightly at the top end of its range from a prior view of $3.10-$3.13 billion. This suggests that even this quarter's $111 million one-time lift pulled in demand from future quarters. Figure 2. Citrix guidance updateSource: Citrix 1Q20 earnings releaseDespite this conservative guidance, we have to consider more bullish scenarios:Deviating from the cautious tone of Citrix's guidance, Citrix CEO David Henshall put it best in his prepared remarks on the Q1 earnings call:In my view, it's unlikely that the sudden spike in remote-work needs will have minimal sustained long-term impact on Citrix's business, which is what Citrix's guidance implies. The company's low bar for the year sets it up nicely for a string of ""beats and raises"" - in the likely event that Citrix's Q2 results blow past expectations again, investors will realize Q1's revenue lift wasn't a fluke and re-rate the stock accordingly.In spite of Citrix's year-to-date stock outperformance, the stock still has head room to rise. At current share prices near $147, Citrix trades at a market cap of $18.21 billion. After netting off the $563.2 million of cash on Citrix's most recent balance sheet against $1.73 billion in debt, the company has an enterprise value of $19.36 billion. Versus Citrix's current FY20 revenue guidance of $3.10-$3.16 billion (which conservatively assumes virtually no growth this year), this represents a valuation multiple of 6.2x EV/FY20 revenues. Throughout most of FY19, Citrix traded at forward revenue valuations in the high 4/low 5 range, indicating that Citrix's valuation has re-rated upward by ~20% since last year. While the valuation multiples of faster-growing work-from-home stocks can't provide easy side-by-side compares, we can assess how these valuation multiples have grown since the year started.Zoom (ZM), for example, saw its valuation multiples lift from ~20x forward revenues last year to nearly 50x now - meaning its valuation has more than doubled since last year. Similarly, Docusign (DOCU) investors, banking on a greater conversion to digital contract signings, have re-rated the stock up ~50% from the low 10s last year to >15x now. Citrix's re-rating, so far, has been relatively modest, even if we account for the difference in growth rates between Citrix and other work-from-home stocks. In my view, Citrix's robust outperformance in Q1 (and heavy possibility of continued revenue lifts throughout FY20, which is not incorporated into its guidance) can help drive more enthusiasm to re-rate Citrix shares higher than its current ~20% lift as well. For example, if Citrix re-rated 40% this year (versus an assumed 5x forward revenue average last year), we'd arrive at a multiple of 7x and a resulting share price of $167 and 15% upside from current levels. Citrix also looks attractive from a cash flow basis as well - in FY19, Citrix generated $786 million of operating cash flows on $3.01 billion of revenues, representing a solid 26% OCF margin. So far in Q1, Citrix has grown OCF at a 6% y/y pace; if we assume 6% operating cash flow growth for the full year, Citrix trades at a reasonable 23.3x FY20 expected OCF.Given Citrix's sudden momentum due to the rise of remote work, the stock has a rare opportunity to re-rate upward from its mid-single digit valuation multiple. Keep on the lookout for an entry point in this name."

(CTXS) is one of the few stocks that has its head above water in the pandemic-induced bear market. In fact, Citrix is trading at an all-time high.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)There are a couple of reasons why Citrix is a market darling and also a few reasons why I can't give this company anything higher than a neutral rating. But before I go any further, I would like to mention this excellent article on Citrix. If you aren't familiar with the company then it is a good place to start.There is no doubt that Citrix Workspace is benefiting from the COVID-19 pandemic as workers are being instructed to work at home en masse. Citrix Workspace is used by many large enterprises and the IT department can quickly provide workers with the ability to access applications at home.(Source: Citrix)Using Google Trends, it is easy to research the popularity of such terms as ""virtual app"" and other work-at-home plays such as ""Zoom Video"" and ""AWS Workspaces"".(Source: Google Trends/MS Paint)These search terms, along with the ""Citrix Workspace App,"" have had major spikes starting the beginning of March. But, unlike searches for the other terms, searches for Citrix Workspace App have since dropped. While this is not proof of anything, it suggests that the enthusiasm for Citrix Workspace had an initial spike and is now starting to wind down. This could translate into a short spike in revenue, but as time wears on with this pandemic, revenue growth will subside.The second reason why the Citrix stock price is appreciating is due to the strong history of capital return. Not only is Citrix buying back shares at a significant rate, but it has also started paying a dividend, with a yield of ~1%.(Source: Citrix)This is certainly great for propping up the share price but the return of capital, in my opinion, means that the company management believes that the business is mature, and excess cash generation is being returned to shareholders. If they did not feel this way then they would be spending on M&A, and increasing R&D and Sales and Marketing.The truth is that Citrix has very little revenue growth as shown in the table below.(Source: Portfolio123)The 5-year average annual revenue growth is 3.27%. Sure, the management is making noise about its conversion to subscription revenue, but not for 5 years. I find the level of total revenue growth to be a bit disturbing.(Source: Citrix)While subscription revenue is growing at a pace in excess of 40% annually, it still only comprises ~20% of total revenue.This brings me back to the stock buybacks. It appears that the buybacks are being funded by borrowing money.(Source: Portfolio123)I believe that there will soon be a day of reckoning for the majority of software companies, at least the ones that reward senior management with outrageous compensation packages. I understand that stock-based compensation is a small fraction of the total market capitalization. In good times, when the stock market is rising and stock prices are going up, everyone is happy. But in a falling market, management isn't happy because their level of compensation is decreasing, and investors (should) become aware of what is being given away for poor performance.So I have to take exception for Citrix's share handouts. SBC should really be a reward for high revenue growth. Most software companies typically give in the range of 5% to 15% of total annual revenue for total SBC. The higher end of the range may be justifiable for companies with double-digit revenue growth.Citrix currently pays out ~9%, $279 million in SBC and has approximately $3 billion in revenue.(Source: Citrix/MS Paint)However, the growth portion of Citrix's revenue is the 40+% subscription growth. If employees are to be rewarded, then it should be on subscriptions only. The YoY growth in subscriptions was $215 million, whereas the SBC was $279 million. I leave the reader to reach his or her own conclusions on this topic.The following scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth illustrates Citrix's stock valuation relative to the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red on the scatter plot and represents a typical valuation based on next year's sales growth. As can be seen from the scatter plot, Citrix is situated above the best-fit line reflecting the premium that the market is allotting for this stock. In the long term, the stock price may suffer from reversion to the mean once the market turbulence subsides.Citrix is outperforming the stock market during the pandemic for two reasons: (1) it is a ""work-at-home"" play, and (2) the company is buying back shares and paying a dividend.The fact that the company is returning capital to shareholders suggests that the management doesn't have a better option, such as expansion of its TAM via M&A, increasing its sales and marketing efforts or R&D spend. What I find particularly unusual, is that Citrix is borrowing money to buy back shares.By monitoring the trend in Citrix Workspace searches, I have determined that interest in the application spiked in early March but has subsequently fallen. In my estimation, Citrix has benefited from enterprises converting most of their workers to work-at-home and will likely see a short-term rise in revenue. But I don't believe that there will be consistent growth from this phenomenon on a long-term basis.I also believe that the market is overhauling Citrix based on forward sales multiple. If Citrix doesn't perform as investors expect during the pandemic, then the stock will fall significantly. For these reasons, I am giving Citrix a neutral rating."
4319892,105526,2020-01-29T14:40:36-05:00,"CTXS reported a better than expected 4Q19 earnings print, beating consensus, and reflecting a healthy demand environment for its Workspace and Networking solutions.The ongoing transition toward a recurring, subscription-based revenue stream warrants a premium forward multiple.The longer-term play remains intact, with an ~15x fwd FCF multiple driving a $150 bull case scenario.","Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS) recently reported an encouraging 4Q19 earnings results - adjusted EPS came in at $1.71 on revenue of $810 million, beating Street consensus of $1.68 on revenue of $803 million. Importantly, the company continues to progress well with regard to its multi-year goals, with the revenue mix increasingly shifting towards recurring, subscription-based revenues - 69% of total product bookings now come via subscription (vs. just 51% a year ago).With a healthy demand environment for virtual apps and desktops, along with the potential divestment of the lumpy NetScaler business, as well as strong progress on the business transformation front, the stock benefits from a number of positive tailwinds which could see it trade up to $150 on a moderately bullish fwd FCF multiple of ~15x.Headline Numbers: 4Q19 revenue increased 1% YoY to $810 million, beating consensus estimates of $803 million and at the upper range of management guidance of $789-$809 million, driven by strong demand for its Workspace and Networking Solutions. The quarter witnessed a strong mix shift as subscription revenue grew a solid 49% YoY to $194 million, making up for 24% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. The SaaS portion of subscription revenue increased 45% YoY to reach $113 million during the quarter, accounting for 14% of total revenue and 59% of subscription revenue - a decline from 63% in 3Q19 due to an increase in non-ratable subscription revenue such as term licenses.Source: 4Q19 Earnings LetterIncrement in Paid Subscribers for Citrix Cloud: In 4Q19, the company added ~1 million in paid subscribers, a 64% YoY growth, and now has ~7.1 million paid subscribers for Citrix Cloud. Notably, the paid subscriber growth was the highest in the transition period as compared to ~700/~600/~400 thousand in 3Q/2Q/1Q of 2019, respectively. With regard to the existing base, management said that a more focused effort would be made in FY20 to transition them to the cloud.Source: 4Q19 Earnings LetterManagement views the subscription bookings mix, subscription ARR and committed revenue trends to be reflective of the underlying health of CTXS' business as the company continues to progress in its model transition towards subscription revenue.Subscription bookings as a percentage of total product bookings increase: The jump to 69% in 4Q19 vs. 59% in 3Q19 and 51% a year ago was driven by a few large customers electing to transition to pooled-capacity subscription agreements, including one transaction that was the largest Networking deal in Citrix's history. Workspace subscription bookings as a percentage of Workspace product bookings saw a modest decline in the quarter to 73% from the previous quarter's 75% but was significantly up from 62% in 4Q18. Networking subscription bookings mix increased to 63% from 29% in 3Q19 and 18% in 4Q18. Overall, the growing subscription bookings mix highlights the growing confidence of customers in the company's vision and ability to execute.For FY20, management guides toward the mix of subscription bookings as a % of product bookings increasing further to the 65-75% range (vs. 62% in 2019), although the latest target is relatively modest compared to the ~80% estimated in its analyst day earlier in October 2019.Source: 4Q19 Earnings LetterAnnual Recurring Revenue (ARR): ARR is a key performance indicator of the health and trajectory of CTXS' business and a leading indicator of top-line trends. Subscription ARR in 4Q19 increased to $743 million, a growth of 41% YoY, while SaaS ARR grew 49% YoY in the quarter to $520 million.Source: 4Q19 Earnings LetterDeferred and Unbilled Revenue: The future committed revenue increased 15% or ~$328 million during the quarter to reach $2.5 billion in 4Q19, including an unbilled revenue of $705 million. The growth was aided by an increase in the total average contract duration of deals booked to 1.7 years from 1.3 years in 4Q18.Source: 4Q19 Earnings Letter1Q20 Outlook: The near-term guidance reflects management's expectation that subscription bookings as a percentage of product bookings will be in the range of 55% to 60% in 1Q20. Adjusted EPS for the upcoming quarter is expected to come in the range of $1.15-$1.20 on revenue of $730-$740 million.Source: 4Q19 Earnings LetterFY20 Outlook: CTXS' guidance for the coming year reflects lower expected growth in subscription bookings as a percentage of total product bookings at 65%-75% in FY20 (vs. 62% in FY19 and the ~80% estimated at October's analyst day). Adjusted EPS for FY20 is guided to fall in the $5.35-$5.55 range on revenue of $3.10-$3.13 billion. Further, the operating margin is set to reach a trough in 2020 and decline ~100 bps YoY owing to a higher mix of cloud subscriptions and investments.Source: 4Q19 Earnings LetterAt the prior analyst day event, recall that management had laid out a target of $10 of FCF per share by 2022, driven by net new paid-subscribers addition to Citrix cloud. In addition to a transition toward subscriptions, the majority of the FCF growth will likely come from the migration of the installed user base to Citrix cloud. Further, on the product side, ongoing marketing efforts around Windows virtual desktop should help drive the ""cloud-hosted desktop"" trend, helping the subscription shift.Source: Analyst Meeting PresentationOverall, the 4Q19 results suggest the company is tracking well on its longer-term plans to transition toward a more subscription-oriented revenue base; thus, I see the subscription revenue mix rising from ~30% by FY20 to >50% by FY22. With key metrics set to inflect upward over the medium-term, coupled with a management team that has historically outperformed on the execution front, I see further upside to management guidance. Assuming an ~15x fwd multiple on free cash flow on $10 FCF per share by 2022, I think CTXS could trade up to $150 in a bull-case scenario. While I do acknowledge the 15x multiple is a premium to the historical average, I would argue that a successful transition toward a stickier, recurring revenue base justifies a higher multiple."
4235404,103480,2019-01-24T15:33:07-05:00,"Shares of Citrix fell ~5% in after-hours trading after reporting Q4 results.Though the company beat Q4 expectations on the top and bottom line, the stock fell on a perceived weak guidance.The guidance, however, contained no major surprises. Versus a prior preliminary outlook for 4% y/y revenue growth, Citrix is now calling for a range of 3-4% growth.Citrix remains a solid buy due to a reasonable valuation, stable growth, and shift to subscription revenues.","Not a stranger to disappointing earnings releases, shares of Citrix Systems (CTXS) - a company best known for its virtual desktop infrastructure software - fell sharply after releasing fourth-quarter results, despite posting solid results for the current quarter. Though Citrix has made an impressive recovery thus far in the first few weeks of 2019, this post-earnings pullback puts the stock at ~15% below its 52-week highs.CTXS data by YChartsI wrote in a prior article that Citrix Systems is an attractive investment for one primary reason: its relative stability and rich operating margins in a software sector that is primarily dominated by more volatile, loss-leading growth stocks. Recall that Citrix has made robust efforts at diversifying its product portfolio beyond its core VDI services over the past several quarters, including a greater push into team collaboration tools. There’s no reason to believe that the company is fading from prominence as a top-tier vendor in virtualization.It’s worth noting as well that Citrix has made a tremendous push into SaaS recently. Subscription revenues are up 45% y/y in the most recent quarter. We’ve seen from other “legacy” technology companies like Adobe and Autodesk that shifting more revenues into subscriptions does wonders for both growth and for stock price ascension. Over time, as the company continues to reap the benefits of a reliable billings stream, Citrix shares should see an appropriate re-rating in value.In my view, there’s no reason to exit Citrix stock on the perception of a weaker FY19. The post-earnings share plummet, in fact, gives us additional reason to load up on shares.Let’s discuss the elephant in the room first - Citrix’s guidance. In my view, the company’s latest ranges are no immediate cause for consternation.Let’s also put the guidance into context first. When Citrix released its Q3 results last quarter, it also provided an anecdotal preliminary guidance view for FY19. The company’s prior statement read as follows:Now alongside its Q4 earnings release, it released the following update:Figure 1. Citrix guidance updateSource: Citrix Q4 earnings releaseThe company’s new stated range of $3.08 billion to $3.09 billion now represents a range of 3-4% y/y growth versus FY18 revenues of $2.97 billion, which encompasses Wall Street’s expectations of $3.09 billion (+4% y/y).What is important to note, however, is that Citrix outperformed its Q4 expectations by about $10 million. Citrix had originally guided to $2.95-$2.97 billion in revenues for FY18 (midpoint $2.96 billion), and ended up achieving $2.97 billion. If we strip out this $10 million of outperformance, the implied y/y growth of the new guidance midpoint of $3.085 billion actually represents 4% y/y growth versus Citrix's original expectations for FY18.The bottom line here: it’s not exactly correct to think that Citrix has actually lowered its guidance view. It simply outperformed in Q4 and kept a conservative outlook for FY19. If anything, this gives Citrix room to outperform in the next fiscal year. Note as well that Citrix’s EPS guidance of $6 fell exactly in line with its previous outlook.When it came to actual Q4 results, however, Citrix shone bright. Here’s a look at the earnings summary:Figure 2. Citrix 4Q18 resultsSource: Citrix Q4 earnings releaseRevenues clocked in at $801.9 million (+3% y/y), nearly $11 million ahead of consensus expectations of $791.3 million (+2% y/y).It’s worth noting as well that part of the “weak growth” perceived at Citrix is due to the fact that it’s transitioning from a primarily on-prem license model toward subscriptions. Across many different software companies, we’ve seen that this poses a temporary headwind on growth (license deals, after all, count a greater chunk of revenue upfront).Within this quarter, we note that subscription revenues saw a healthy uptick, up 45% y/y (representing eight points of acceleration versus 37% y/y last quarter), while license revenues dropped 11% y/y. This loss of license revenues is partially to blame for Citrix’s seemingly weak top-line growth. On the positive side, subscription revenues now represent a 15% mix of the total top line for the full year FY18Andrew Del Matto, Citrix's CFO, highlighted the strong subscription push on the Q4 earnings call with a reminder to analysts and investors that subscription growth comes with added volatility - but overall, it’s the right step for Citrix to take. Key points are highlighted below:Margins and profitability performed beautifully in the quarter as well. Pro forma gross margins ticked up by 40bps to 87.6%, up from 87.2% in the year-ago quarter. Similarly, operating margins saw a huge 230bps lift to 35.0%, up from 32.7% in the year-ago quarter. Like most software companies, Citrix allocates the largest portion of its operating budget to sales and marketing, on which it was able to achieve some operating leverage this quarter.The company’s pro forma EPS of $1.67 also represented 4% upside surprise relative to Wall Street expectations of $1.60.Citrix remains a consistent execution story within an otherwise unpredictable software sector. Though most investors wrote off Citrix's FY19 guidance as weak, it's more than likely just a conservative target that the company can easily exceed. Against its EPS forecast of $6.00 for FY19, Citrix trades at a current forward P/E of 17x - which sits below most technology stocks. While Citrix is hardly a bargain stock, its subscription transition and strong SaaS growth make it a good buy amid a continued volatile stock market. Stay long and ignore the noise."
4298975,104812,2019-10-25T03:14:18-04:00,Citrix Systems reported Q3 earnings which beat top- and bottom-line expectation along with an increase to full-year guidance.The company is undergoing a multi-year transition towards a subscription and SaaS model.Revenue growth is flat and faces headwinds through next year based on the transition dynamic with the company seeing an acceleration from 2021.,"Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS) with its digital workspace and networking solutions has benefited by providing a platform for the ongoing adoption by companies across industries for cloud-based systems through its leading virtualization software. A trend of firming profitability has come despite more stagnant growth in recent years with the company challenged to evolve with the changing landscape of tech. The company just reported its latest earnings, which beat expectations and set a positive outlook by management. This article takes a look at the results and our view on where the stock is headed next.(Source: Finviz.com)Citrix reported its fiscal Q3 earnings on October 24th highlighted by a big EPS beat at $1.52, $0.27 ahead of expectations for the non-GAAP headline measure. GAAP EPS of $2.04 also came in well ahead of estimates of $1.35. The spread between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure is related to a change in Switzerland's tax policy that for the company resulted in a one-time benefit of $158 million. Revenues of $732.9 million this quarter were essentially flat year over year, but exceeded management's prior guidance in a range between $700 and $720 million, largely explaining the better-than-expected earnings.The key story here is an ongoing transition towards a subscription model across the core segments which the company explains creates a near-term revenue headwind, evident by the flat y/y sales figure in Q3, but ramps up over time resulting in higher margins and profitability. This quarter, the higher subscription mix impacted reported revenue growth by 700-800 basis points according to the press release, highlighting what is a transitional period for Citrix.(Source: Company IR)On the quarter, ""subscriptions"" revenue increased by 43%, while the traditional ""product licenses"" declined by 23%, but by a nearly offsetting dollar figure. The graphic below shows that with new the subscription model, there is a gap of 2.7 years until break-even compared to the traditional perpetual license model in the workspace segment and 3.5 years for the networking business. Over time, however, forecast revenues grow on average 35% higher, and this dynamic has become the basis for the bullish sentiment and positive outlook for the stock.(Source: Company IR)The message from management is to look beyond the current ""weak"" revenue growth, as it lays a path to accelerate to a higher upside in the near future. Management expects 2020 to be the ""trough year"" for operating margins with a view that the near-term pressures will ultimately make way for a structurally more profitable company.Compared to 2016 when subscriptions represented just 9% of total revenues, that number has grown to 21% year to date and gaining fast traction across product bookings, now representing 72% of the workspace business. The company shared long targets where it sees subscriptions reaching 50-60% of total revenues by 2020 and 85-90% of total product booking by 2022. The company is focusing on the annual recurring revenue between ""SaaS"" and subscription as an indicator of the trajectory of its business which is up 40% year over year to $672 million while booking future committed revenue of $2.18 billion, up 13% from Q3 2018.(Source: Company IR)The result is an outlook for higher free cash flow based on a higher operating margin over the next five years while noting that the current transition weakness should continue through 2020. Going forward, the company wants to focus on its annualized recurring revenue, ""ARR,"" metric for subscriptions and SaaS revenue which each reached $672 million and $463 million respectively, up from $481 and $305 in Q3 2018. The idea is that as the existing license contracts expire, existing customers will eventually renew into the subscription or SaaS model. New customers are joining with new subscriptions.(Source: Company IR)The other development this quarter was an increase in the authorized share repurchase program by $600 million to a total of $1 billion. Last year the company initiated its first ever dividend with a quarterly payment of $0.35, which yields 1.35%.Along with the earnings and revenue beat this quarter, Citrix raised the full-year guidance to non-GAAP EPS between $5.60 and $5.70 from a prior range of $5.35 to $5.60. Full-year revenue at $3.0 billion if confirmed would represent an increase of about 1% compared to 2018. Preliminary guidance for 2020 is targeting revenue growth between 3% and 4%, again impacted by the ongoing transition dynamics.(Source: Company IR)The move by Citrix towards subscriptions and SaaS has been known for some time, but what the results this quarter showed was that the proverbial ""near-term pain"" wasn't as bad as previously expected. Along with higher-than-expected revenues and the earnings, management has laid out a solid road map for investors to follow over the coming years and what to expect. Of course, beyond the metrics and financial statement gymnastics, the underlying organic growth remains the key driver and ultimately that's what the market will be focused on.CTXS surged by nearly 4% on the results with the market clearly bullish on the revised guidance higher for the year and overall positive comments by management. The stock now trading at $107.50 is up an impressive 20% from the 2019 low at $90 back in August, but still 6% away from its all-time high from 2018. Naturally, we think that $115 could be a near-term target given the current momentum, but I want to stress there are reasons to temper expectations particularly for investors who missed out on this latest spike.Our concern here is that much of the enthusiasm is based on the three- to five-year roadmap for the transitional period which will likely involve a number of execution risks by management. If the market is already buying into these 2024 operating margin targets, we question how the company will be able to significantly exceed expectations that are presumably priced in here at the current level.In terms of multiples, CTXS is trading at a relatively reasonable valuation considering a forward P/E at 20x and price to free cash flow of 18x. On the other hand, expectations of revenue growth in the 3% to 4% for next year are hardly impressive leaving aside the transition to subscription context.Data by YChartsCitrix Systems is undergoing a multi-year transition away from licensed product contracts towards a subscription and SaaS model. As the new sales structure is based on recurring payments over many years, in contrast to the previous large upfront fees, the company's revenue profile and operating margins are facing headwinds until the full benefits of higher operating margins can be realized over the next three to five years.As shares are now just a few points from the all-time high, we think caution is warranted as the company still needs to execute and prove it can reach its long-term targets. We rate CTXS as a hold balancing the latest positive results against what has already been a surge in shares which we believe has captured much of the valuation upside to the long-term outlook over the near term. Monitoring points going forward include the evolution of margins and organic growth or bookings and customers."
4334124,105503,2020-03-25T11:39:41-04:00,Citrix provides solutions which enables work-from-home.It has been recently upgraded by analysts on this basis but the target share price seems to be on the high side.Citrix will indeed benefit but the slow-down in economic activity as a result of social distancing and lock-down should not be ignored.A detailed analysis on a per-industry basis is made and a more realistic valuation proposed.,"Citrix (CTXS) was recently upgraded for work-from-home reasons by Raymond James on March 17 with a target price of USD 124. The reason provided was the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, Bank of America recently named Citrix as one of its stay-at-home beneficiaries.While Citrix will undoubtedly benefit from work-from-home, I have doubts about the target price. Moreover, it is important to distinguish between the hype from what is realistically possible, in terms of the benefit the company is likely to derive.I will be discussing the company's product portfolio, competition as well as updating thoughts on finances.I will then wrap up my analysis by identifying the specific industries which are going to use the company's product for working from home.I bring along my experience in leading the implementation of cloud desktop projects from 2015 to 2017.The Citrix Workspace provides users with the means to access the applications which they normally use in the office, without having to actually go to work.This solution is compelling from two perspectives: the user and the IT administrator. For the user, it means that irrespective of the point of connection (home, car or office) or device (PC, laptop or mobile), he or she benefits from the same desktop environment as he or she is in the office.Hence, by using the Citrix solution, users do not need to go through the inconvenience of bringing their office desktop PCs at home but, instead can use their own devices at home to access their applications and get that office environment in which they are productive.IT administrators, by using Citrix solutions, can deliver applications to end users in a rapid and secure way instead of having to make painstaking configurations on each of the company’s applications. By using Citrix Gateway, they do not have to configure a third party VPN (a private network to connect to the company's IT infrastructure from home) each time a user needs remote access. Also, the Citrix Netscaler allows access to additional remote sites without the need to contact other suppliers.Also, the fact that the Citrix Workspace comes with ready-made integrations with the likes of Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Workday (WDAY) and ServiceNow (NOW) makes things easier for the company's IT team as no timely integration efforts are required. Moreover, the fact that Citrix has made provisions for connectors with the ecosystems of public cloud providers such as Microsoft's Azure and Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud also helps to speed up things.Figure 1: Citrix WorkspaceSource: docs.citrix.comHowever, this rosy picture depicting many simple to use features takes time to implement.Citrix XenDesktop (forms part of the Citrix Workspace suite) has been traditionally deployed in IT and related companies in specific use cases. Gradually, it has been deployed in the finance and healthcare industries. It is important to understand that it cannot just be rolled out in a company at the snap of a finger. A working XenDesktop solution is not like Microsoft Office which can just be installed on the fly on a desktop or laptop computer neither it is like WhatsApp which can be deployed on a mobile phone in a few touches.In fact, as a project lead on Thin clients and cloud desktops covering Citrix, Microsoft and VMware (VMW), from 2015 to 2017, I have implemented some ten projects and we always proceeded with a proof of concept (POC) which typically lasted from three to six months. The time period largely depended on the number of applications in the company as well as the network bandwidth available and number of sites. For a company using just Microsoft Office products like MS Word, SAP or even some Oracle (ORCL) flavors, that are widely used applications, the POC would be over rapidly with the Chief Information Officer giving the go-ahead for the actual implementation.However, in other instances, where the company had customized applications connected to databases, distributed over a dozen sites, things would take more time. Each of the applications had to be tested to be accessible through Citrix XenDesktop. The POC would take six months and sometimes more till we got the sign-off of the company's management.Things are sure easier in 2020 with the ready-made integrations Citrix already has with some widely-used business applications. However, the problem is that there is now many more applications deployed within corporations. Also, and in such a short period of time, with social distancing measures in force, it is unlikely for teams composed of Citrix and customer members to work together to make applications work for new companies.As a matter of fact, instead of looking for technology solutions for working from home like the ones proposed by Citrix, some companies have just transported their staff desktops (in case they do not have laptops) to their homes so that they can continue operations from home.In addition to the time factor constituting a hindrance to more widespread adoption by new companies at this particular moment, there is also the fact that Citrix is not alone in the market.Citrix faces tough competition in the virtual thin client computing market. Gone are the days when Citrix was simply the best and could boast use of its ICA technology to optimize network usage. Now, VMware with its VMware Horizontal View has caught up and is a strong contender. VMware Horizontal view has already enabled (before Covid-19) a number of company IT Admins to, just after a few configuration steps, allow remote access in such a way that workers needed to only come to the office a couple of days a week. In other cases, companies were able to eliminate offices entirely.Figure 2: Gartner Virtual client computing contendersSource: IDC Market place published on Citrix.comMicrosoft with its Microsoft Desktop Services offering is not far behind Citrix. With Microsoft Windows already deeply embedded in the minds of users and IT administrators, they can simply opt to build on technologies they already master instead of considering the luxury of having the Citrix or VMware solutions.Now, together with the Workspace, Citrix also provides the network SD-WAN solution to connect the main office located at the network core to the network edge where a company’s branch offices are normally located.Leveraging on its extensive software experience, the company has developed SD-WAN routers which enable companies to extend their network to the cloud. In an already deployed scenario in the premises of a US healthcare provider, Citrix Netscaler enabled secure remote access for clinicians working offsiteFigure 3: Citrix SD-WAN solutionSource: Citrix.comHowever, again here, the company faces challenges, in the form of competition, not only from the likes of Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Fortinet (FTNT) but increasingly from software-driven companies like VMware.Figure 4: Gartner contenders in Edge networkingSource: Gartner magic quadrant for WAN EDGE InfrastructureSome major clients in the last quarter (Q4-2019) have signed for networking but the latter is seen more as a longer-term play as management does not believe that the recent customer wins can be maintained in the short term.In the words of Arlen Shenkman, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer during the Q4-2019 earnings:With respect to the Workspace and SD-WAN solutions, I now take into consideration the industries where Citrix is already present.First, as can be seen (figure 5), Citrix is most widely used in the IT and healthcare industries. It also has a significant penetration of 50% in utilities including telecoms.Now, due to a reduction in the level of economic activity resulting from social distancing measures, many sectors of the economy including mining, construction, finance, manufacturing, transportation and real estate are already operating at a slower pace. Same is the case for the wholesale and retail businesses.Figure 5: Citrix seat penetration by industrySource: Citrix investor presentation, November 2019Moreover, in the present environment characterized by lock-down because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Citrix itself has prioritized the work from home option for its staff and allowed access to the office only in extreme cases when the task could not be accomplished from by working remotely. I understand this effort by Citrix to protect the health of their employees.Figure 6: Work from home guidance by Citrix for employeesSource: Citrix.comAlso, in a context of working from home, companies like Citrix are just ensuring that operations continue for at least a minimal level of customer satisfaction. If the context persists and current and prospective customers cut costs, they may significantly reduce their information technology expenditures and Citrix will suffer from a fall in revenues in the next quarter.However, there are industries where Citrix solutions are really helping, not only in terms of cost reduction as before, but in terms of sustaining operations and even maintaining productivity levels.Now, the four industries (figure 5) which should see increase in remote working are telecommunications, education, government and insurance.Figure 7: Citrix forecast based on industriesSource: Keylogin Forecast for CitrixFor the healthcare sector (yellow), the greatest worry right now is not inadvertently transmitting the virus to vulnerable patients. Home-health caregivers are being advised to take extra hygiene precautions and to stay at home at first sign of any illness. In fact, non-essential care visits have been canceled. Hence, the focus areas right now are tele-medicine and when such facilities are not available to make telephone calls.Now, the solutions proposed by Citrix, namely Citrix XenDesktop and Citrix XenApp have been used by hospital physicians working in independent offices to access electronic medical record applications and NOT to provide tele-medicine facilities. Thus, at this stage of the fight against Covid-19, there is no evidence to suggest increased usage of Citrix solutions.On the other hand, for utilities and telcos, there is scope for expanded use of Citrix in organizations already utilizing the product. Based on some use cases, the increase has been more than threefold as employees from the HR, finance, payroll departments join the work-from-home workforce which was previously more the domain of IT Engineers providing support on critical systems.As for education, some tertiary institutions like the University of Sydney in Australia, have used Citrix Workspace to provide connections since the initial ban was imposed to travel to China following the outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan back in December 2019. Other institutions like the University of Oswego in New York, have already been using Citrix solutions to provide students access to systems without having to physically visit a computer lab. One question in the mind of investors can be whether Citrix can capitalize on its cloud-based solution components to address the needs of other universities.At the government level, whether be it at the federal or state level, Citrix solutions are viewed as a tool to provide business continuity, that is, making sure that operations are being carried out when staff do not have access to their offices in cases of calamities. One public sector organization which has implemented Citrix technology is the city of Corona in California in order to be flexible (not attached to the office location). This was in the pre-pandemic period and staff used the technology to access their systems and data in case of emergency like during fires.I also see Citrix Netscaler (Citrix SD-WAN network) pooled licensing arrangement, a flexible licensing framework whereby there is a common pool of license regardless whether the customer performs the deployment as a physical hardware, virtual device or even a containerized solution. Customers already like the pooled license arrangement as per the words of the Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer of Citrix. In the present context, customers should make optimum use of this flexibility.Overall, the negatives (red: 45%) beat the positives (green: 40%). For healthcare, things are more uncertain for the time being. Here, it’s more a question how medical teams use technology in their fight against the virus.I now take on the financials where Citrix has some strength.Citrix is a highly profitable company with a gross profit ratio of more than 85% on average in the last 4 years despite strong competition. High gross profit means that the company has been able to keep a strong hold on the cost of revenues. It also shows that the company has more to cover for operating and financing costs specifically if there is a significant drop in revenue.Figure 8: Citrix Income statementSource: SeekingAlpha Another factor which is crucial for this analysis is the high operating cost especially the SG&A component which is more than 70% of the total expenses. Now, since the management has given directives to staff to work-from-home, all meetings, conferences except for webinars are being cancelled resulting in a cut-down of travelling expenses.More importantly, the significant sales and marketing costs incurred in order to drive the subscription-based business revenue model should be reduced, resulting in lesser operating expenses. With sales and marketing staff only active over the phone and through webinars and faced with the prospect of customer IT expenditure cuts, Citrix does not have the luxury to do aggressive sales for customers to switch from a perpetual to a subscription model for some timeI strongly believe that the advantage for Citrix is that the additional sales will be generated without significant increase in operating expenses as customers who will purchase the product will do so more out of necessity to work from home.Figure 9: Revenue breakdown by product and servicesSource: Citrix Annual ReportFinally, I also believe that the Professional services component should increase as Citrix uses its reference status in terms of virtual client computing to guide customers and others in the field of business continuity where the company has significant experience. For many IT professionals, Citrix is often viewed as offering the most complete and integrated solution to enable people to securely access their apps, desktops and data from anywhere.Therefore, the slight fall (estimated to be 5%) in customer revenues as a result of a decrease in economic activity should be compensated to some extent by a decrease in Citrix's operational expenses and an increase in professional services revenue.However, since the adverse impact from Covid-19 Could well last till August, there would be a net decrease in revenue in FY 2020 compared to FY 2019.Taking into consideration the above plus the current uncertainty in the healthcare industry, a USD 100-110 target for the share price is envisaged.The major risks at the moment stem mostly from social distancing and lock-down measures causing a significant downturn in economic activities and will impact relevant industries as discussed above. Additional risks to generating revenues include the work-from-home guidance issued to Citrix employees globally as the Covid-19 pandemic progresses.Other risks are over-reaction by the market. For the investor, it is important in this current period of volatility to be able to distinguish the good fish from the bad.Just like other companies, Citrix is also going to be negatively impacted by economic downturn resulting from containment measures to limit the spread of the Covid-19 virus.However, unlike other companies, Citrix has already benefited and will continue to benefit from Covid-19 social distancing and lock-down measures. Even then, these benefits are unlikely to compensate fully for the fall in revenues.Citrix has a very high profit margin and with more control over the operating expenses could emerge as a strategic longer-term work-from-home enabler as a result of those stimulus measures by the government."
4234289,20715,2019-01-18T13:27:04-05:00,Citrix Systems is scheduled to report fourth quarter earnings results after the closing bell on Wednesday.The stock has been trending higher over the last three years with a trend channel guiding it higher.There is an abundance of skepticism toward the stock ahead of the earnings report.,"Software developer Citrix Systems (CTXS) is scheduled to report fourth quarter earnings results after the closing bell on Wednesday. Analysts expect the company to earn $1.59 per share on revenue of $791.95 million. Based on the fundamental indicators, the technical pattern, and the sentiment indicators, I look for the stock to continue trending higher after the earnings report.Let’s look at the fundamentals first. Citrix has seen its earnings grow at a rate of 9% annually over the last three years and they grew by 15% in the third quarter. Analysts expect the 2018 earnings to grow by 15%.Sales have actually declined at a rate of 4% per year over the last three years, but they grew by 6% in the third quarter and analysts expect sales to grow by 4.9% for 2018 as a whole.In addition to the recent earnings and sales growth, the company shows strong management efficiency and profitability measures. The company’s return on equity is 41.3% and its return on assets is 8.6%. The profit margin is at 32% and the operating margin is at 25.4%.The company raised its 2018 guidance when it reported third quarter results and one of the drivers behind the raised guidance is the growth in subscription-based services. The company saw revenues from subscriptions jump 37.1% in the third quarter compared to the previous year.In addition to the solid fundamentals, the stock has been trending higher over the last three years and the stock has been able to maintain that trend even through the recent market turmoil. A trend channel has formed that seems to be guiding the stock higher.You can see that the upper rail is formed by the highs from late 2015 and last summer. The parallel lower rail is formed from the lows in early 2016 and in the third quarter of 2017. The recent market pullback that has caused many stocks to break their upward momentum did bring Citrix down to its 52-week moving average, but it didn’t make it down to the lower rail.The stock was in overbought territory for a good part of the first half of the year, but the recent dip brought the indicators down and they are now in the middle of the range. The weekly stochastics did reach oversold territory in October and that is only the third time this has happened in the last four years.Another possible bullish sign for the stock is the double-bottom pattern formed by the lows in October and December. For the pattern to be confirmed the stock would need to move above the peak price between the two lows which was $111.91.Despite the solid fundamental performance from the company and the strong price performance from the stock, analysts and investors appear to be pretty skeptical of the stock. Of the 22 analysts following Citrix, only nine rank the stock as a “buy.” There are 10 “hold” ratings and three “sell” ratings. Looking at the percentage of buy ratings, only 41% have the stock rated as a buy. When I see a stock that has performed as well as Citrix, the buy percentage is usually in the 70% range.The short interest ratio is also indicating that investors are somewhat pessimistic toward the stock. The ratio is currently at 5.66 with 11.25 million shares sold short as of December 31. The number of shares sold short jumped by 1.65 million shares in the second half of December and that is indicative of growing pessimism. It is also good news for investors as the short sellers can help drive the stock higher by adding buying pressure as the stock climbs.The put/call ratio currently stands at 1.17 and that is also indicative of bearish sentiment toward the stock. A normal put/call ratio would fall in the 0.75 range for a stock that has performed as well as Citrix, seeing above one was surprising.All three of these sentiment indicators are showing signs of pessimism toward Citrix and from a contrarian perspective, this is a good thing. If everyone is bullish on a stock, there are very few buyers left to drive the price higher - even on good news. When you see a stock like Citrix and the pessimism from all angles, it has plenty of potential buying pressure to drive the stock higher as the bears convert to bulls.If you haven’t figured it out yet, I am pretty bullish on Citrix Systems. The complete picture is that you have a company that has been able to grow its earnings and sales in recent quarters. The management efficiency indicators are well above average and so are the profitability measures.The stock has been trending higher and has performed far better than most tech stocks during the recent selloff. The methodical manner in which the stock has been climbing within the trend channel is a benefit as well.The icing on the cake is the bearish sentiment toward the stock. This potential buying pressure adds to the bullish picture if the stock continues to climb.When Citrix was dancing around its 52-week moving average in the third quarter of 2017, the stock was trading around $75 a share. Over the next ten months, the stock jumped over 50%.I look for Citrix to make another big gain in the coming quarters, but I don’t know if the overall market conditions are going to be as conducive as they were in 2017. With that in mind, I can see the stock gaining between 30 to 35% over the next nine to 10 months."
4319343,104608,2020-01-27T16:31:13-05:00,"Citrix reported a good Q4 earnings with revenue and EPS coming in ahead of expectations as the company continues a successful transition to subscription-based revenue.FY20 guidance calls for revenue growth of ~3-4% and EPS to actually decline by 5%+.With the stock popping 7%+ since reporting earnings, valuation has become slightly excessive at ~24x forward earnings.","Citrix Systems (CTXS) is a competitor in the virtualization software market, competing primarily with VMware (VMW). CTXS reported a strong Q4 with subscription revenue growing nearly 50% as the company continues on their successful path of transition into a subscription-based model. Operating margins expanded nicely and the company issued a $1 billion increase in their share repurchase authorization.However, guidance for both Q1 and FY20 fell below investor's expectations. For FY20, the company is expecting revenue to grow ~3-4% and EPS is expected to decline by 5%+ for the year, well below consensus expectations. Even with the lower EPS guidance, the stock popped over 7% following earnings.Data by YChartsWith the stock pushing new 52-week highs following the company's earnings release, it would appear the company is hitting stride and beating all expectations. However, the EPS guidance of a ~5% decline should not give investors the means to push valuation to ~24x forward P/E. In fact, most companies would see their multiple contract if they guided to an EPS decline.The company continues to stride forward with their transition to a subscription-based revenue model, but with margins and EPS expected to decline in FY20, I don't think there is enough to look forward to in FY20 to buy the stock at these levels. With the stock near $130 and valuation now ~24x forward P/E, I think investors would be smart to take some gains and some money off the table. I think I would start to become more bullish around the name if valuation contracted back towards $100, or ~20x forward P/E.Q4 revenue grew only 1% during the quarter to $810 million, which was above expectations for ~$803 million in revenue, or around flattish growth. The company's growth for the full year was only 1%, though their transition to subscription revenue remains on track and healthy.Source: Company PresentationSubscription revenue during Q4 grew 49%, which again accelerated from the previous quarter, similar to the past several quarters. The company's transition to a software subscription model has been relatively easy going. SaaS revenue during the quarter grew 45% while other subscription revenue grew 56%. This slightly more than offset the 16% decline in product and license revenue and a 5% decline in support and services revenue. Nevertheless, investors have been pleased with the company's progress as their stock has been up 25% over the past year.During FY19, the company had strong growth in international markets relative to the Americas. The company reported 4% growth in EMEA and 5% growth in APJ, which compares to a 1% decline in the Americas. However, during Q4, the company reported a 3% growth in the Americas and a 1% decline in EMEA and a 4% decline in APJ. I believe this continues to be an area of focus for the company as nearly 60% of revenue currently comes from the Americas, with a large international opportunity yet to be highly penetrated.Operating margins during the quarter were 34% and continue to improve. As the company moves towards a more subscription-based model, margins should naturally push higher over time. The slightly higher than expected revenue combined with strong operating margins led to EPS of $1.71 during the quarter.Source: Company PresentationFor Q1, the company expects revenue of $730-740 million, which represents only 2-3% growth and was below expectations for ~$740 million. Subscription bookings are expected to be 55-60% of total bookings during the quarter, which continues to demonstrate the company's transition to a subscription-based model. EPS is expected to be $1.15-1.20, which fell below expectations of $1.23.Source: Company PresentationFor the full year, the company expects revenue of $3.10-3.13 billion, which ultimately was slightly above expectations for $3.11 billion and represents ~3-4% growth for the year. The transition to a subscription model continues to weigh on the company's growth, with the company expecting 65-75% of bookings coming from subscriptions for the year, compared to 62% in FY19.Operating margins are expected to be under pressure during the year, with guidance implying margins contracting from 30% in FY19 to 28-29% during FY20. The lower operating margin guidance led to EPS expectations of $5.35-5.55, which represents a 5% decline from the $5.69 EPS in FY19.Even though the company's progress towards a subscription-based model has been going well, revenue growth has been minimal as the company loses license revenue. However, over time, I believe the transition will be a success and the company will return to strong revenue growth.During the company's Q4 earnings release, they also noted a $1 billion increase in their share repurchase program, bringing the total to $1.75 billion under authorization. Given the company's market cap of ~$16.7 billion, this represents over 10% of their market cap, which can ultimately help EPS come in ahead of initial guidance given the lower share count.Data by YChartsValuation has become a little challenging at this point given management's FY20 EPS guidance of $5.35-5.55, which represents a 5% decline from the $5.69 EPS in FY19. Even though the company's increase in their share repurchase program can provide some relief for the expected decline, the contracting operating margins on top of minimal EPS growth make it challenging to defend a 24x forward P/E multiple.Usually when a company guides to lower EPS growth for the year, investors are not quick to push the stock higher. The lower EPS for next year should imply a lower valuation, all else equal. In addition, with the company's operating margin expecting to contract next year, it could take even longer before investors start to see the significant benefits of transitioning to a subscription-based model.The chart above shows how the company's forward P/E has expanded from ~16x only a few months ago to nearly 24x now. In fact, the company's forward P/E has not eclipsed that of VMware, the main competitor. The biggest different here is VMW is a much bigger company with more scale who is growing their EPS in a nice fashion. For now, I think my money is better off in VMW given the current valuation.While the company has been successful in accelerating their subscription revenue growth over the past several quarters, the disappointing guidance makes it tougher to put new capital into the name when the stock is trading near 52-week highs. For now, I continue to remain on the sidelines until valuation comes down a bit or the company better demonstrate a path to clear EPS growth in FY20."
4270420,103231,2019-06-15T06:16:41-04:00,"The recent upgrade of Citrix seems to mark a change in negative sentiment, which has been accumulating in past years.Citrix appears to be a late participant in the cloud computing industry, which has reduced its opportunities for future growth.Although the PS and PE ratios are trading slightly below their historical average, the difference does not leave much margin of safety to new investors.","The recent news that Deutsche Bank upgraded Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) from Hold to Buy seems to have eased the decline in confidence in the company. It appears that the negative sentiment that began to accumulate since 2015 has started to reverse after this last upgrade. Currently, the company of virtualization products that maintains four buy recommendations, well below the 12 it had five years ago, saw a recent rebound in analyst confidence as it sees an improvement in the growth of its desktop computers business in the short term.Although the company has maintained revenue growth above 5% in recent years, and the margins are relatively higher compared to peer companies, the value of its shares has increased by only 100% in five years, below the software industry. Although Citrix holds some competitive advantages such as the value of its intangible assets and a high switching cost, it seems that the business model has become less and less relevant, which has diminished future expectations.In our opinion, Citrix is ​​a late participant in the cloud computing industry, which has diminished the importance of its solutions in the enterprise market over time. The price of its shares has seen a lousy momentum shown by its gradual decline of 12% over the last year in contrast to the 22% increase that the software industry has seen in the same period as shown by the S&P Software Industry Index.While we believe that Citrix has managed to establish itself in strategic sectors thanks to the qualities of its virtualization products, such as security and regulatory compliance, we see that the situation the company is going through does not justify the new buy recommendation. With this in mind, we present a comprehensive analysis of Citrix to determine some of the factors that have caused the decrease in the confidence of analysts over time, and whether the stock deserves a buy or hold recommendation.Citrix offers enterprise-level virtualization software products and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) solutions that give employees the freedom to work anytime, anywhere. This virtual workspace is characterized by being unified, contextual, and safe, qualities that are attractive to government organizations and companies in the health and financial services sector. The clients deeply integrated Citrix's solutions in their IT infrastructure, which has allowed the company to maintain a high switching cost.Enterprises and organizations decide to centralize and optimize their IT infrastructure through a VDI as it allows them to unify applications, desktops, databases, and devices. This unification guarantees coherence in the user's experience, giving ease and reliability to the operations performance of the employees.However, the virtual legacy environment seems no longer aligned with market preferences. Citrix faces threats of new technologies such as cloud services, the increased use of mobile devices within companies, as well as a preferential change in employees. As digital transformation has become more common, companies feel more confident and comfortable in having proprietary databases and applications in the cloud. These difficulties have reduced the growth opportunities for Citrix that has had to adopt measures to adapt to technological changes.Source: Extracted from Q4 2018 Citrix Systems Earnings CallThe evolution in the IT landscape has made Citrix to decide to transform itself into a cloud solutions company while moving towards a subscription-based business model. The company has achieved convergence between cloud technologies and their legacy systems; something executives call ""hybrid IT infrastructure"" or ""hybrid cloud."" Citrix cloud services provide customers with reduced infrastructure, centralized control, and SaaS-style updates that result in lower management costs. The adoption of Citrix Cloud among customers has maintained double-digit growth, although this has not been enough to revitalize the revenues of its Workspace Services segment since this line of services represents a marginal part for the company.On the other hand, as Citrix migrates to a subscription-based business model, revenues have maintained a particular uncertainty that has caused a drop in the expectations of analysts. Although Citrix is ​​not the only company that has had short-term problems as a result of a transition to subscription revenues, we see that the company has adopted this business model belatedly. To date, revenues continue to be highly dependent on support and services for perpetual products and license offers, representing 60% of total revenues in the last quarter.Although there are several success stories of companies in the software industry that have migrated to a subscription business model and a cloud service offering, in the case of Citrix, its transformation has brought only silent benefits. We believe that the strength of the company is and will continue to be the desktop virtualization, which has limited growth opportunities in the medium and long term. Despite this, security remains the most compelling reason to virtualize desktop environments for employees, which has allowed it to create a high switching cost to companies operating in the financial and health services segments.We believe that the difficulties in the transition in Citrix's business model, along with new trends in cloud computing in the software industry, have reduced the relevance of the virtualization offering. This scenario seems to be causing both analysts and hedge funds to have a pessimistic view of the company's future. Despite these difficulties, management has managed to maintain quite attractive metrics in comparison to peer companies, which we consider to be its most compelling feature.Citrix has managed to maintain a gross margin close to 85% in recent years despite its transition to a subscription model. In comparison, this margin is in the highest end of the software industry, which we see as a good feature. Similarly, management has maintained a reasonably stable operational structure over the past five years, which has been characterized by reduced research and development expenditure. We believe that the nature of Citrix's virtualization services has allowed management to focus on improving the core business instead of expanding the product portfolio through R&D. The most significant operating expenses come from sales, marketing, and services, which accounted for 38% of revenues in the last quarter, having little fluctuation in each period.Source: Data provided by YChartsThis profitability above the average has allowed Citrix to return capital to shareholders through the repurchase of shares, and more recently through the payment of dividends. At the end of March 2019, the company had spent almost $94 million in share repurchases, reaching 911,060 common shares at an average price of $102.96 per share. The executives comment that there are still some $674 million available to buy back shares within the program.Unfortunately, it seems that the company maintains high levels of long-term debt in the form of convertible notes. Although this obligation decreased in part in the last quarter, the debt-to-equity ratio remained at 3.4x, well above industry standards. By the end of the first quarter of 2019, the company reported about $1,905 million in long-term debt and convertible notes, an amount that, in our opinion, is very high. Although cash and cash equivalents for the same period were worth $1,612 million, Citrix's excessive leverage is a long-term concern that should be considered by investors.Source: Data provided by YChartsIn general, we see that the most attractive metrics of Citrix come from its rates of returns that are above the rest of the industry, especially from the perspective of the ROIC. The cost structure that translates into wide margins and positive free cash flow reinforces the company's profitability rating. However, we believe that these qualities are not enough to justify a buy recommendation for the company.Although from the perspective of PS and PE ratios, the company seems to be trading slightly below its historical average of three and five years, we see that this difference does not leave much margin of safety to new investors considering the current price of $96 per share.Although comparatively, Citrix maintains price multiples relatively low compared to peer companies, we believe that there are better investment options within the virtualization space, such as VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW). With this in mind, and even considering the potential for short-term growth of the desktop segment, we believe that Citrix has earned more a hold recommendation than the recent buy from Deutsche Bank."
4318607,103480,2020-01-23T12:21:07-05:00,"Citrix shares rose ~7% after reporting Q1 earnings, featuring a beat in Q4 actuals but missing on Q1/FY20 guidance.
        Investors reacted positively to the company's announcement of an additional $1 billion buyback (relative to ~$16 billion in market cap).
        However, Citrix intends to fund these buybacks almost entirely via a new line of credit.
        While Citrix's transition into subscription revenues is still strong and underway, shares have likely attained a full valuation for now at ~22x forward P/E.","Citrix Systems (CTXS), a competitor of VMware (VMW) which is best known for its virtualization software, has just reported fourth-quarter earnings, making it one of the first major enterprise software companies to report this season. Though Citrix is frequently a big earnings disappointer, shares rose ~3% on the news, extending an impressive run that has Citrix up nearly 30% since the beginning of 4Q19:Let's cut to the chase: I was previously a Citrix bull and was happy to include it in my portfolio at ~$100, but I no longer believe the stock has an attractive value proposition. Citrix is a ""steady as she goes"" company - there's nothing particularly good or bad about its story, and its ongoing transition toward becoming a primarily subscription-software offering isn't throwing out any surprises. Over the past year, however, Citrix's impressive rally has stretched its valuation metrics by ~25%, without any significant accompanying improvement in fundamentals. I believe the company now to be quite fully valued at a 23x forward P/E, putting it roughly in-line with SAP despite the latter's much stronger growth rates:In my view, it's a good time to go neutral on Citrix and consider locking in gains.In reacting to Citrix's Q4 earnings release, investors had to choose between two counterbalancing factors: first, a disappointing guidance, and second, an extended buyback program.Let's discuss Citrix's guidance first. See the company's guidance summary below:Figure 1. Citrix guidance updateSource: Citrix Q4 shareholder letterAcross the board, Citrix disappointed against expectations. For Q1, the company's outlook fo $730-$740 million (+2% to +3% y/y growth) disappointed versus Wall Street's mark of $740.6 million (+3% y/y), while pro forma EPS of $1.15 to $1.20 also missed analysts' hopes for $1.23. It also represents a decline versus 1Q19 EPS of $1.27.Full-year guidance echoes the disappointing first-quarter outlook. Citrix's subscription transition is expected to continue weighing on total top-line growth (due to the loss of license revenues, and instead spreading them into longer subscription periods) in FY20, with its forecast of $3.10-$3.13 billion bracketing expectations of $3.11 billion, and representing meager +3% to +4% y/y growth for the whole year. Perhaps more saliently, however, is the fact that Citrix expects EPS to decline in FY20 - its outlook for $5.35 to $5.55 represents a decay of up to -6% y/y versus FY19 EPS of $5.69. Sure, Citrix may call 2020 a trough year, impacted by long-term investments into its cloud strategy. We are still uncomfortable with the assumption of ~100bps of margin decay, however, and it's difficult to justify a ~23x forward P/E for a company whose earnings outlook is negative. Citrix's +7% jump post-earnings, however, suggests that investors are putting more emphasis on the company's extended buyback program. Last year, Citrix had authorized up to $750 million in buybacks in an effort to shore up the share price, and to signal to the market that Citrix was undervalued. This quarter, Citrix's board has extended that authorization by another $1 billion, totaling $1.75 billion in share purchase authorizations. WIth Citrix's current market cap of ~$16 billion, this represents ~11% of Citrix's total market value - a significant proportion.However, it's important to note that Citrix intends to fund the majority of its new buyback authorization with debt.Figure 2. Citrix buyback authorizationSource: Citrix Q4 shareholder letterCitrix doesn't actually have enough cash to execute this buyback program. Its balance sheet as of the end of Q4 had $616 million of cash, not to mention an existing $743 million in debt. To be fair, FCF may be part of the answer in funding these buybacks. Citrix didn't officially share an FCF outlook in its Q1 guidance, but in response to a question on the earnings call regarding a prior FCF target of $7-$8 per share, CFO Ariel Shenkman noted that management was still ""comfortable"" with that target:This rough FCF range translates to approximately $912-$1.04 billion in FCF for FY20, roughly in-line with $973 million in FY19 FCF.However, fairly assuming that not all of Citrix's FCF will be diverted to fund its buyback, it's fair to say Citrix will draw down on a significant portion of its new $1 billion credit line to finance buybacks. In this case, Citrix's extended buyback program isn't exactly a signal of excess cash or fundamental strength, but rather a shift in capital structure toward more debt.Finally, a quick look at how Citrix's subscription transition is progressing. Citrix's fourth quarter more or less contained no ""new news"". Total revenues grew 1% y/y, on par with each of the past two quarters, while subscription revenue growth of 49% y/y accelerated six points from Q3. Counterbalancing that growth, however, was the fact that support and services revenue (Citrix's heaviest component of revenues) has begun to decline alongside product/license revenues:Figure 3. Citrix revenue trendsSource: Citrix Q4 shareholder letterTo be sure, Citrix's revenue came in well ahead of expectations this quarter - Wall Street was only expecting $802.5 million, or roughly flat. Citrix still has a long way to go, however, in becoming a predominantly subscription-first company. Subscription revenues only represented 24% of its Q4 total, while support & services revenue continued to weigh at ~60%:Source: Citrix Q4 shareholder letterI view Citrix's Q4 update as more of a mixed quarter. The acceleration in the company's subscription growth rate is a positive factor, but weight down by a disappointing growth/earnings outlook for 2020. I'm also less enthused about the company's extended buyback program, fueled by additional debt - especially if Citrix plans to be buying back stock at a more elevated ~23x forward P/E ratio. Be careful of Citrix at 52-week highs and consider locking in gains."
4217678,103480,2018-11-02T14:26:44-04:00,"Citrix Systems posted yet another strong quarter, beating Wall Street's expectations on both the top and bottom line.The company also announced its first-ever dividend of $0.35 per share (which at today's stock prices translates to a ~1.5% yield).In addition, the company is increasing its buyback by $750 million, indicating it believes its shares to be undervalued.Like most technology stocks, Citrix suffered a correction in the month of October, losing about 15% of its value.","Consistent as ever, Citrix Systems (CTXS) posted yet another strong quarterly beat in Q3, handily beating Wall Street's consensus estimates by a wide mile and giving investors a cherry on top. The company is initiating a quarterly dividend program of $0.35 per share, as well as increasing its buyback program by $750 million, extending a $2 billion buyback authorization announced in November last year. $1.6 billion of the prior authorization has already been executed, leaving a total of $1.1 billion under the new program - which, with Citrix's market cap at just under $14 billion, still covers a good portion of its total capitalization.Recession or no, Citrix is the kind of software company that will continue to post stable results through the cycle. VPN is its bread-and-butter product, and this is not something enterprise clients can opt out of even in the harshest of times. Citrix has seen tremendous progress as well in converting its clients toward a cloud-based consumption model, increasing its base of recurring revenues and further stabilizing its revenue and billings.Like most software companies, Citrix has seen a bit of a correction in the month of October, and the positive earnings release hasn't done much to arrest the decline either. Relative to its peak at ~$115, Citrix has now lost about 15% of its value.CTXS data by YChartsThe company has also released prelim guidance for FY19. It's expecting to grow revenues by 4% y/y and to hit pro forma EPS of ""approximately $6.00"". To some investors, that revenue view might be light - considering Citrix grew a few points stronger than 4% in each of the past few quarters.Figure 1. Citrix FY19 guidanceSource: Citrix investor relationsSome further useful commentary from management on the earnings call regarding guidance:Note that Citrix has typically been a conservative guidance giver, however. For example, Citrix guided to just $715-$725 million in revenues for this quarter, yet ended up posting just under $733 million in revenues - two points higher. There's plenty of room for Citrix to exceed its targets next year.In addition, tacking on a ~1.5% dividend yield (based on its current dividend authorization of $0.35 per share) and a beefed-up share repurchase program should offer investors further confidence in Citrix's prospects in FY19. After all, Citrix has enough buyback firepower to repurchase about 10% of its current market cap, which isn't a trivial amount.If we take Citrix's EPS as is, the stock currently trades at a reasonable 16x forward P/E ratio. Though Citrix clearly isn't as exciting of a stock as the high-growth SaaS names, it's also not plunging ~40-50% from highs as they are. Every portfolio should have more stable, income-producing tech names, and Citrix fits that slot perfectly. Note that the ex-dividend date for the company's first dividend falls on December 6, so there's still a window of opportunity to invest in the stock before then.Here's a look at Citrix's full Q3 results:Figure 1. Citrix 3Q18 resultsSource: Citrix investor relationsRevenues grew 6% y/y to $732.5 million - which as previously noted surpassed a prior guidance range of $715-$725 million (+4% y/y at the midpoint) by two points. It's pretty typical for Citrix to offer up ~4% growth as a baseline target, then come in well above that. Wall Street, as usual, gravitated toward management's guidance range and expected a consensus target of $722.8 million (+5% y/y).Citrix's new most important revenue component, subscription revenues, saw even stronger growth at 37% y/y to $111.5 million. This indicates continued strong progress at Citrix's transition into cloud bookings. Andrew Del Motto, Citrix's CFO, even notes that subscription revenues will improve in the last quarter of the fiscal year, per his prepared remarks on the earnings call:From a product segment standpoint, Citrix's flagship ""workplace services"" segment and networking products saw stable 7% and 5% y/y growth, respectively. But its nascent content collaboration efforts, which generated $47 million in revenues this year, saw low-teens growth:Figure 2. Citrix revenue breakoutSource: Citrix investor relationsCitrix's strength on the top line also translated into strong operating income growth. From a gross margin perspective, Citrix's margin in the mid-80s was already one of the highest margin profiles in the enterprise software space. This quarter, the company hit a GAAP gross margin of 85.8%, jumping 110bps from 3Q17's gross margin of 84.7%. This is in spite of the company's growing transition into the cloud, which carries near-term margin headwinds.The company also achieved operating leverage on all components of its operating spend. Operating expenses grew just 3.5% y/y in the quarter to $463.8 million, representing 63.3% of revenues, 160bps less than 64.9% in the year-ago quarter. As a result, operating income leaped 21% y/y to $164.8 million, or an operating margin of 22.5% - a 270bps improvement over 19.8% in 3Q17.Citrix also managed to achieve 15% y/y pro forma EPS growth to $1.40:Figure 3. Citrix pro forma EPS bridgeSource: Citrix investor relationsWall Street had only expected about flat EPS growth of $1.25 in the quarter, so Citrix posted a 12% EPS surprise in Q3.In my view, Citrix is executing well against all of its targets: increase in subscriptions, operating margin expansion, and growth in new collaboration products. Despite the fact that all key fundamentals are on track, Citrix Systems is currently trading at a ~15% discount this month. It's understandable why many richly-valued tech stocks saw a correction this month - but Citrix, at a ~16x forward P/E against EPS growth of ~15%, doesn't seem overvalued at all.There are, of course, risks to Citrix's bullish trajectory. While the company is currently the undisputed leader in VDI and virtualization software, much larger companies like VMware (VMW) and Cisco (CSCO) are also fighting for share in the space. Also, while Citrix contends that it's compatible with nouveau infrastructure technologies such as Docker, newer technologies such as Docker's containerization could give off the impression that Citrix is lacking in innovation.This being said, however, enterprise IT spend is growing fast enough for both incumbents and startups to capture a share of that growth. Gartner (NYSE:IT), the leading software industry analyst, still expects an 8.3% increase in software spending in FY19, faster than Citrix's growth rate. Citrix is pursuing the right strategy by shifting to a cloud-based billings model, which is where most of the growth resides.Investors should use the recent pullback to buy. Citrix is a mission-critical component of the enterprise IT stack that has proven the health of its business with an increased capital returns program, in the form of its first-ever dividend and an additional $750 million buyback. Remain long on this stock."
4223962,101421,2018-11-21T14:53:57-05:00,Citrix has announced the acquisition of Sapho for an undisclosed sum.Sapho has created micro application technologies for businesses to simplify employee tasks.CTXS continues to build out its workspace management portfolio as it seeks to reignite revenue growth.,"Citrix Systems (CTXS) announced it has acquired Sapho for an undisclosed amount.Sapho is an enterprise micro application software company.With the acquisition, CTXS is gaining software technologies that appeal to younger generation demographic workers, who seek simpler software solutions to quickly achieve targeted tasks.The deal makes strategic sense as Citrix seeks to reignite revenue growth.San Bruno, California-based Sapho was founded in 2014 to improve employee productivity by empowering them with access to 'micro applications' - tools, activities, and tasks in a seamless work feed.Management is headed by Co-Founder and CEO Fouad ElNaggar, who was previously Chief Strategy Officer at CBS Interactive.Below is an overview video of the company's offerings:Source: SaphoSapho's primary benefits include:Investors have invested at least $27 million in the company and include AME Cloud Ventures, Great Oak Venture Capital, Caffeinated Capitals, Felicis Ventures, Uncork Capital, Bloomberg Beta, Morado Ventures, among others. Source: VentureDeal Venture Capital DatabaseCitrix didn't disclose the acquisition price or terms or file an 8-K specific to the transaction. A report in TechCrunch pegged the price as 'around $200 million in an all-cash deal.'Whatever the price that Citrix paid for Sapho, it is likely the deal was valued primarily based on a 'team and technology' basis, rather than just a revenue multiple.CTXS did not provide a change in financial guidance, so the transaction was likely for a non-material amount, at least in relation to its current $14 billion market cap.A review of the firm's most recent 10-Q filing indicates that as of September 30, 2018, it had $1.8 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments. CTXS had $4.7 billion in total liabilities, of which, long-term debt was $742 million.Free cash flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was $775 million.Citrix acquired Sapho for its micro application capabilities. More employees are seeking to use services to accomplish specific, targeted tasks rather than large software programs that require intensive training and long click-streams to accomplish.As Citrix stated in the deal announcement:In the past 12 months, CTXS's stock price has risen 24.4% vs. the S&P 500 Index 1.7%, as the chart below indicates:Source: Seeking AlphaCTXS's stock has performed extremely well in the past 12-month period. Perhaps it isn't surprising, given that management continues to provide upside earnings surprises and has done so since 2014, as the chart shows below:Source: Seeking AlphaOf course, earnings' surprises are all well and good but may be of less value when investors are more interested in future guidance, which a recent WSJ article (paywall) asserted.Analysts aren't so enamored of CTXS's appreciation potential from its current level, as the graphic below indicates:Source: Seeking AlphaOnly four analysts rate the stock a Buy or Strong Buy, 16 analysts have a Hold opinion, and four see it underperforming or worthy of a Sell recommendation. With a consensus price target of $112 and a current price of around $107 as of press time, the stock's near-term growth prospects may be attenuated.On October 24, CTXS recently declared its first-ever quarterly dividend, at $0.35 per share, for an annual dividend yield at the current price of 1.32%.The ex-dividend date is December 6, 2018, and CTXS currently has a relatively low payout ratio of 25.09%.Citrix has an enviable business that is generating significant free cash flow as its workspace management and networking tools are used by businesses of all sizes.Management isn't sitting still, and with deals for next-generation technologies like those developed by Sapho, Citrix is positioning itself to reignite revenue growth in the quarters ahead."
4192303,103480,2018-07-31T05:28:46-04:00,"Citrix Systems, one of the leading vendors of VPN and enterprise connectivity software, posted terrific Q2 results.The company is one of few names in the tech sector that hasn't been rattled over weak guidance.Part of the reason why Citrix is enjoying respite now is due to the fact that expectations are so low, with Citrix's growth rate only in the single digits.This quarter, total revenue growth accelerated to 7% y/y (versus 5% in Q1), as subscription revenues grew rapidly without causing a decline in license revenues.Citrix's valuation still leaves room for upside.","So far, the Q2 earnings season has been a bloodbath for most technology companies. The takedown of a few big names like Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX), and Western Digital (WDC) has cast a sour shadow across the majority of the technology sector and virtually all the sub-sectors below it, with software and internet companies getting hit especially hard.The main issue with the recent volley of earnings has not been Q2 results in themselves, but a lack of strong guidance for the year. Guidance at Facebook and Twitter (TWTR), combined with weak user growth counts, led investors to pencil in steep deceleration for the remainder of the year. Western Digital's low guidance foreshadowed a weakling of memory pricing, something investors had long feared. The phobia has spread to smaller software companies, including Instructure (INST), which recently sagged below 30% growth for the first time in the company's history.Yet amid the chaos brewing in the sector, there's one major name where expectations have ben so muted that it's virtually immune from bad press: Citrix Systems (CTXS). As I wrote in a prior article, Citrix is a bit late to the cloud game. Only 15% of its revenues in the second quarter are from subscription sources, far beneath other SaaS peers and indicating that Citrix still has a long way to go. As the company converts its installed base from license deals to cloud deals, its revenue growth is taking the normal dive (license revenues provide a significant amount of revenues upfront, while subscription deals divide those revenues over time). In a sense, Citrix's low-growth situation effectively prevents it from being the victim of high expectations and deceleration worries - when the company is growing revenues in the single digits, there's not much to decelerate from, and even if Citrix does see decelerating growth, it can always chalk it up to the cloud transition. For this reason, I view Citrix to be an incredibly shrewd bulwark against the ongoing volatility in the wider technology sector. As it turns out, Citrix was able to defy low expectations for the current quarter, with its revenue growth accelerating 2 points from 5% y/y in Q1 to 7% y/y this quarter. For a company of Citrix's size and with its minuscule growth rate, a two-point acceleration is a tremendous feat. Thematically, Citrix is also in a good spot. Though it competes against a giant in VMware (VMW) for its virtualization business, Citrix is the type of deep-rooted enterprise technology that is slow to be replaced. With the company still having to convert more than four-fifths of its revenue base into SaaS, it can still benefit from the explosive valuation increase that other cloud-shifters like Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (ADSK) have been able to enjoy. CTXS EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsCitrix is far from being one of the most exciting technology companies to invest in - this stock isn't likely to return ~2x like a FANG stock might. But Citrix's consistency as it continues to execute its cloud transition, and the fact that it's also expanding operating margins as it does so, makes Citrix a good pick for low volatility amid an extremely rattled market.Here's a look at Citrix's Q2 results:Figure 1. Citrix Q2 resultsSource: Citrix investor relationsThere are a lot of nuggets to appreciate from Citrix's Q2 results. Chief among them, as noted above, is the company's revenue acceleration feat. Total revenues grew 7% y/y to $742.4 million this quarter, far surpassing last quarter's 5% y/y growth rate. This acceleration wasn't something Wall Street was expecting - analysts had penciled in a consensus figure of just $718.2 million, or 4% y/y growth. The magnitude of this beat - for a company that's growing at a snail's pace like Citrix - is truly commendable.Diving deeper into the results, we note that subscription revenues grew 49% y/y to $110.8 million, representing 15% of Citrix's overall revenues. As a percentage of revenues, that's up 4 points from 11% in the year-ago quarter, and both the subscription mix and subscription growth are key focus points for investors as Citrix picks up its cloud transition. But what's most notable about this quarter is the fact that product and license revenues still grew at a flat 1% y/y rate this quarter - whereas in Q1, product and license revenues fell -6% as subscriptions grew. While it's unclear whether this trend can remain, what this implies for this quarter is that Citrix was able to close subscription-based revenues without completely cannibalizing its existing license business. Very few companies undergoing a cloud transition are able to achieve this - Autodesk frequently posts negative y/y revenue comps, due to the heavy loss of revenues as it shifts customers from license deals to cloud.Andrew Del Matto, Citrix's CFO, called out particular strength in Citrix's flagship products:Compounding on the strength of this quarter's results, Citrix also raised its full-year guidance to $2.92-$2.95 billion in revenues with the entire range now surpassing the high end of the previous guidance of $2.88-$2.91 billion. Wall Street consensus was about 1% lighter, at $2.91 billion.The company was also able to build on top of top-line strength to improve operating margins, underlining the thesis that cloud-oriented businesses will eventually become more profitable than their legacy license counterparts. Operating income in the quarter grew 19% y/y to $145.1 million, continuing the year-to-date trend with operating income up 27% y/y in the six months of the fiscal year so far. This quarter's operating margin of 19.6% also represented 200bps of improvement over 2Q17's operating margin of 17.6%. Underlining this profitability improvement is a -5% y/y decline in general and administrative spending. Of all the primary categories of operating expenses - sales and marketing, R&D, and general and administrative - the latter is the least productive. The fact that Citrix was able to reduce its corporate overhead spend in order to make up for an increase in marketing activities is a true sign of management's cost discipline.The technology sector is getting slaughtered at the moment, but I expect Citrix Systems to be fairly safe from exaggerated volatility. The company's results indicate a business that is deftly executing a cloud transition plan - and because the transition is still in its early days, investors still have a lot more upside to capture (if the stock appreciation of Adobe from the beginning of its cloud transition to today is any indication). Perhaps more importantly, Citrix is able to convert business from license to subscription without harming its overall top or bottom line - in fact, revenues accelerated this quarter, and operating income showed a double-digit jump and a 200bps margin improvement.While not necessarily the most flashy technology play, Citrix Systems is a highly stable, profitable and well-entrenched enterprise software company to balance out against more volatile names in your portfolio."
4064626,98236,2017-04-24T13:43:11-04:00,Citrix is scheduled to report earnings April 26th.Earnings are likely to show a modest over-attainment given the company's conservative projections when it issued its 2017 forecast in January.The shares in whole or in part are discounting some significant probability that the balance of the company will be acquired at some premium.The company certainly has opportunities to raise its growth profile beyond that which is expected and which was recently forecast.The valuation and balance sheet are such that it could conceivably achieve material percentage appreciation in the event of a transaction.,"A refocused Citrix: What's left and how will it evolve?Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) is set to announce the results of its Q1 operations next Wednesday. This will be the first quarter in which CTXS will be without its ""GoTo"" operations although they were still owned by the company for the month of January. Expectations haven't changed since the transaction was consummated and since Citrix forecast its financial expectations for the balance of 2017, and I have no reason to believe that the results of this quarter will be materially different in terms of actual performance vs. expectations than the company has achieved for several quarters, i.e. a beat on EPS and slightly higher guidance.I had written on CTXS in the past, after the announcement of the transaction but before the transaction was actually consummated. The issues then were slow growth and complexity. The company is still complex and growth is what it has been. But put into the mix is speculation, fueled in whole or part by the involvement of Elliot management, that the company is for sale. The rumors have led to reports from analysts speculating on the value of the company as an acquisition, and the shares have recently benefited from renewed chatter. Overall, the shares have appreciated by 50% including the value of the LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM) shares spun to shareholders. This article takes a look at the pieces of Citrix that remain as well as their outlook and tries to handicap the valuation that the company might achieve from buyers, either strategic or private equity.No one these days can ever know the likelihood of a transaction. I certainly do not purport to have second sight, and if I did, I might apply it to more seminal subjects - say the future of Bill O'Reilly or the first day on which the Boston Globe does not have a headline bashing President Trump. Ditto NY Times, Washington Post, etc. Lots of money to be won in office pools on that subject - or so I have been led to believe. But given the drum roll of stories, the most recent linked here, coupled with the usual progression of Elliot investments, it would be surprising if CTXS was not for sale. It seems to me that the shares of CTXS are an interesting speculation based on the fact that the environment for transactions has remained strong, the company has a reasonable if not fantastic level of potential in its business operations and analysts seem highly skeptical that its strategy can produce more than the modest level of growth.Citrix - A company that is hard to defineCitrix is a company that specializes in both virtualization and application delivery controllers. While on the surface there seems little to link the two spaces, most recently the company has begun to offer what is called software defined-WAN technology that is built on a virtualized foundation. While the company's current investor presentation, which has not itself been updated in about a year, has some information regarding its target market and its solutions, it is far more focused on the financial metrics.The company reports revenues within four primary business segments. These include workspace service businesses, network delivery (NetScaler), enterprise mobility, and file sync and sharing. While there are bits and pieces of the offerings that have significant growth potential at this writing, most observers do not believe the company will achieve significant top-line growth beyond that forecast by the company. Looked at in a bit more detail, there is certainly opportunity for the company to exceed such modest expectations given the promise of some of the specific products that it has recently introduced.The company has forecast organic revenue growth for the year of 3-4% with some indication that it has taken a conservative approach both to the modeling of its expectations in the workspace services opportunity and particularly with regard to expectations regarding the growth of NetScaler solutions.Workspace services for Citrix is really all about its Xen family of products and it has started to show a bit of growth. This is the company's largest product offering and represents about 62% of total revenues. In the Americas, Xen is growing in double digits, which is encouraging. Xen is a server virtualization platform which competes in a crowded market that is dominated by VMware (NYSE:VMW) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Interestingly, in addition to competing with MSFT, specifically the Microsoft Hyper-V solution, Citrix also collaborates with Microsoft and that is a significant part of the company's strategy to renew growth. The two companies have a relatively robust collaboration arrangement that is deployed quite broadly that allows Xen solutions to be deployed on Azure. It appears that many users want to deploy Citrix-as-a-Service on Azure.Is Xen ever going to be a high growth business for Citrix? The company has said that it is improving its sales efficiency in the area and that its win rates are improving. But the space itself appears saturated, and the real competition is not necessarily VMW and MSFT, but from companies offering other solutions to automate datacenters. One doubts that the workspace services business segment as it currently exists is ever likely to achieve sustained double-digit growth. Gartner and others say the market is basically saturated and what revenue growth there is coming from growth in maintenance as the number of installed seats continues to rise.The company offers something called Citrix Workspace Suite, which I suppose is most easily thought of as a bundle of Citrix products that enable enterprise users to work in mobile environments. This probably has a higher level of growth potential than the other components of this business segment.Citrix has been involved in the application delivery controller market since it bought NetScaler a dozen years ago now. At the time, the ADC market was ""newish"" if not new and the space was hot. These days the market for ADC controllers is said to have a CAGR of around 4% although there are still parts of the space with projections for faster growth.In Q4, this business contracted 9% year on year, in line with prior guidance. For the first three quarters of the year, the business had achieved double-digit growth. This business has proven to have somewhat lumpy results. And while it is expected to show negative comparisons in Q1, it is expected to show strong gains in the balance of the year. This business represented 27% of total revenues in the quarter and is likely to be somewhat larger as a percentage of total revenue for the full year of 2017.The main competitors in the space had been Riverbed (private), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV). About five years, Cisco left the space. Over the years, Citrix has come to be perceived as one of the leaders in the space. Most recently, both F5 and Barracuda (NYSE:CUDA), another vendor in the space, have seen demand pauses that mirror the guidance that Citrix has provided. NetScaler will likely continue to gain market share because of some specific feature/functionality as well as increasing demand for cloud-based solutions. But that said, NetScaler hardware, even with steady market share gains, is not likely to achieve double-digit revenue growth.Citrix has a business unit called data delivery/cloud services. The company's main-line solution in the space called ShareFile has been able to achieve a CAGR of 25%. There are other paths to being able to sync and share data files securely, but this is and is likely to remain a growth area for the business. Overall, this business unit is less than 10% of total revenues, and it should be able to maintain a relatively strong cadence of growth.Winging the expenses out!I'm sometimes bemused when companies talk about the ""work"" they are doing to remove costs from their operations. I have a picture of senior executives standing over a tub of wet laundry that has recently been washed in a stone laundry sink in the days before sophisticated washers and dryers. The housewives, oops, corporate executives must wring the excess moisture out of the clothes before putting them on the line to dry.Really, the hard work involved is a function of consolidating functions and automating processes and outsourcing every task that can be left in the hands of third parties. I guess meetings and memo writing and getting requisite approvals for a file are hard work, Citrix has done an admirable job of taking costs out of its operations and has driven almost 1,000 bps of margin improvement over the last couple of years.The question going forward is whether or not the company can continue to take cost out or if it has an opportunity through product introductions and improved marketing efficiency and share gains to drive faster growth than the picture presented above.Citrix reached its margin goals a year ahead of schedule, and in Q4, it achieved a seasonally high level of 35% in adjusted operating margins. For the year as a whole, the company achieved non-GAAP operating margins of 31%, and it is forecasting that non-GAAP margins will rise to 32-33% for the full year of 2017. It is hard to make precise comparisons because of the spin-merger transaction, but it appears that overall the company will not choose to continue to reduce cost ratios and will start to invest opportunistically to drive higher growth going forward from this point.Some of the specifics of the company's expense containment are, perhaps, seemingly draconian. In particular, reducing research and development costs by 19% year on year is the product of actions that might be considered a bit excessive. Management, during the course of its conference call presentation, talked about consolidating work groups and promoting a higher level of work group collaboration. The company also spoke to the need to increase its tempo of product innovation to drive faster growth.Less controversially, the company reduced general and administrative expense by 5% year on year. Sales and marketing costs were flat for the quarter which was a bit surprising given that license revenues fell year on year. On the other hand, the deferred revenue balance, both long and short term, showed substantial sequential increases in the quarter, and some of that was the impact of rising product bookings, perhaps an unheralded source of strength in the company's sales generation machine.Gross margins rose noticeably during the period, reaching 85% on a GAAP basis, up from 78% in the prior year period. For the year as a whole, gross margins were nearly 84% compared to 81% the prior year. It is hard to see gross margins rising significantly from these levels, although again, the gross margins of the ""Go-To"" business would likely have been lower than the corporate average given price competition from both LogMeIn and Cisco.Stock-based compensation expense, while not negligible, is a lower percentage of revenue than is the case for many other software vendors. In all, net of taxes, stock-based compensation was about 5% of revenues for the full year and was 26% of reported net income. Stock-based comp. rose by 23% year on year. For the full year, stock-based comp. was 13% of cash flow from operations.The Paths ForwardNow that Citrix has completed its spin-merger transaction with LOGM, the question is the path management will choose with the rest of the company. Citrix shareholders have already received .17 share of LogMeIn since the completion of the transaction, currently worth about $18.20/CTXS share. As mentioned above, the company is probably approaching the top of the range when it comes to improving operating margins beyond those projected for this current year. So, the question that I think might preoccupy investors is the growth opportunities that the company has with its current product set.The linked report suggests that Citrix actually does have a chance to increase its growth rate in the overall virtualization spaces. The company continues to outgrow VMW in Virtual Client Computing as defined by IDC by a substantial margin. To a certain extent, VMW has chosen to de-emphasize its investment in the VCC market and to look at other virtualization opportunities. VMW certainly has many other opportunities that probably do have a higher growth rate than desktop virtualization such as virtualized hyper convergence.But that has apparently left the market open to Citrix, and it would appear that the company is pushing on an open door. Again, I don't purport to be a market research analyst. That isn't what people in my position can or ought to be doing. But I don't think it is terribly farfetched to believe that the company's offerings in the VMM and EMM spaces can achieve revenue growth in the mid- to high-single-digit space simply based on modest market share gains and additional product innovation such as the company's Workspace Suite.The company would certainly appear to have an opportunity to grow market share with NetScaler. The linked study by IDC makes the case that against rival F5, Citrix is the Avis of Application Delivery Controllers and has been willing to disrupt traditional ADC solutions in order to jump ahead in the cloud world. It is worth repeating the analysis of IDC, a firm not noted for making bold pronouncements.In the course of the latest conference call presentation, management spoke to the initial sales results of Citrix SD-WAN which have proven to be very strong, albeit from a standing start. Can SD-WAN develop the momentum and scale to change the revenue growth trajectory of NetScaler? Will the company execute on the opportunity and maintain its current first mover advantage? At the least, it is obviously a management focus. There is certainly a lot of runway for NetScaler to achieve if it can sell users on an approach to the ADC market that is focused on being optimized for the web. The company claims to have the first full-featured ADC in a Docker container and it has been aggressive in making its technology available on AWS and Azure.Citrix has forecast revenue growth of its remaining offerings at just 3-4% for this year. That is really the issue that has driven some analysts to the sidelines. But I think there is a reasonable case to be made that the company might possibly double that growth rate this year and might be able to sustain mid-high single-digit growth in the future.Will Citrix get sold?I think there is a pretty reasonable chance that the company has been seeking to find a buyer and that it is likely to ultimately achieve success in that undertaking. Of course, I do not know or have any special knowledge that I'm trying to share. But in something like mergers, I think the idea that where there is smoke, fire is more likely than not is historically true. There have been more than a few analyst reports on the subject and last month Bloomberg reported that the company is working with Goldman Sachs to find a buyer.Elliott Management still owns almost 9% of Citrix shares. It would be surprising given the history of Elliott if it were not continuing to press for a transaction. Indeed, given that the most likely buyers are private equity firms, it would be surprising if Elliott itself were not engaged in trying to structure a transaction.Citrix shares are valued with some level of merger premium and that premium is another factor in driving analyst opinion to an average rating of hold based on the First Call Consensus. Since the start of the year, and including the value of the spin-off shareholders received, the shares are up by $30/share or 42%. That compares quite favorably to the 18% appreciation of IGV over the same period. Based on the share price performance prior to the turn of the year, I think most of the positive alpha the company's shares have enjoyed relates to merger speculation.The ammunition that Citrix has to effect a transaction is the relatively significant component of its balance sheet that is cash and its very high level of cash flow. Currently, the company has a market capitalization of $13.1 billion, but $2.7 billion of that is cash. Such a significant cash holding would presumably enable prospective buyers to use the company's balance sheet as part of the equity necessary to consummate a transaction.Last year, the company generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow. Management on the conference call made a point of observing that 80-90% of the company's cash flow was coming from the remaining components of its business after the divestiture of ""GoTo"" operations. Cash flow from operations increased by a bit less than 8% year on year in 2016 with much of the increase a function of growth in deferred revenue balances as well as GAAP net income. The increase in stock-based comp was a noticeable, but not overwhelming factor, and the company overcame a fall in the impact of changes in other assets and liabilities.The company generated just shy of $1 billion of free cash flow in 2016, and it is likely that it will be able to generate something close to that amount even with the absence of the ""GoTo"" operations this year.What is a reasonable price for private equity to pay for $950 million of free cash flow? A recent analysis by Mizuho's software analyst talked about a valuation potential of $100 share, which would be equivalent to an enterprise value of more than $13 billion and a free cash flow yield of 7%. The current free cash flow yield of the company is above 9%, one of the highest such metrics to be seen in the software space.Handicapping something like a potential take-out price is a function of available cost savings that exist for private companies compared to those obliged to spend extra general and administrative costs to be a public company and the potential to re-launch the company in future years as a growth story, something that is certainly not considered these days. Elliott has a mixed record in getting super valuations for its investments. And, in this case, the shares already reflect some premium for the potential of a takeout. But I think given some of the company's more recent steps in the product area and its early success, but with its platform and now with its SD-WAN initiative, it may just be able to develop the kind of interest that could lead to valuations greater than expected. I think that a takeout could well fetch significantly more than $100/share, and that number will rise over the course of this year as the company continues to buy back shares at a noticeable cadence after suspending its buyback program in the wake of the announcement of the spin-merger transaction.And if it doesn't?Does Citrix have attraction at this price to investors other than its potential as an acquisition candidate? I think it probably does. I think that it has a product strategy that should be able to support higher growth than forecast by management for this year and estimated by analysts for 2018. That is really the key issue and one that is not totally resolvable by writers of SA articles. But if the company can push top-line growth to 7-9% rather than 3-4%, then I believe share values have significant upside potential.With a current enterprise value as mentioned of $10.4 billion, it has an EV/S of just 3.7X, a relatively modest level if the company can generate any kind of meaningful growth. And with margins at relatively high levels and still rising, the P/E of 18X and particularly its free cash flow yield of greater than 9% are quite attractive and compare favorably to many other older software companies.Overall, I think that investors have a reasonable probability of achieving a nice return in a potential transaction. But, even without a transaction, the set-up for the shares, with 16 of 26 analysts reporting recommendations to First Call rating the shares at hold or sell, affords significant runway for widespread recommendation upgrades. Even modest over-performance of the kind the company has generated in the past is likely to engender some more positive evaluation for Citrix from some of its covering analysts. Without a transaction, obviously the rate of positive alpha will slow down and, to some extent, it already has this past month. But things are going well enough for me to believe that the shares will be able to sustain positive alpha going forward."
4187748,104586,2018-07-17T11:23:23-04:00,"Citrix is a leader in the virtualization market but has been slow to move to the cloud.The company has seen significant changes in management and divestitures over the last two years, bringing in question Citrix's core areas of focus.However, the last couple of results have been impressive and in line with management commentary of where they would want the business to be.If the company can deliver consistently, the current stock price may prove to be a very lucrative entry point.","Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) has been slow to move to the cloud. It is one of the few companies to be generating the majority of its revenue from selling licensed products. While the company is no stranger in the technology world, the delay in the transition to cloud occurred due to portfolio and management reshuffles. However, the recent results corroborate the management focus to move towards subscription. Consistency in results will be the key going forward. Not only will a sustained shift towards subscription-based revenues be positive for the cash flows but is also likely to help the expansion of the company's current P/S of 5.14x.As per the company's 10-Q for 1Q18, CTXS revised ""its presentation of revenue to align with its subscription business model transition"". The new reporting structure is as follows:Source: 10-Q - 1Q18During the company's 2018 analyst day, the management also provided a view of how the subscription revenue has grown over the last five quarters.Source: 2018 Analyst DayThe focus on execution is also evident in the company's view of revenue and profitability, from subscription, over the next five years.Source: 2018 Analyst DaySource: 2018 Analyst DayThe management visibility and confidence do beget the following questions (1) Why did CTXS not move to the cloud earlier? (2) What has changed that made for the company to (almost) suddenly wake up?CTXS did have a growing cloud business.Source: 10-K - 2016However, the company decided to hive off the major contributor of its software as a service (SAAS) revenue, the GoTo business. The market believed that shareholder activism had led the company to divest a relatively unprofitable business, for $2 billion. However, this created another problem - lack of a credible cloud strategy, as evident in the SAAS revenue numbers (ex - GoTo):Source: 10-K - 2017This apparent lack of a cloud strategy led to the CEO's departure. The company installed the erstwhile CFO as the new CEO to 'transform' the company. Around October 2017, the company again set out to re-align and re-focus itself. Long story short: CTXS wanted to subsume the legacy licensing business in the cloud and the company was trying different permutations and combinations.CTXS seems to have finally has found its rhythm in 1Q18 - subscription revenues grew a stellar 49% y/y growth and 15% q/q. The company expects the momentum to continue throughout this fiscal year and extend to F2019. By 2022, CTXS expects subscription sales to contribute to over 70% of the company's total revenues.Source: 2018 Analyst DayWhile the company's overall revenue growth expectation of 6% is nothing special, the implied CAGR in subscription revenue of 42% is nothing short of stellar! The consequent impact on profitability and cash flows can lead to a re-rating of the stock. Using the management guidance for 2018 and expectations for F2020 and F2022, I arrive at the following financials:Source: CTXS Financial ModelCTXS currently trades at a P/S of 5.14x and P/TAM of 0.76x (based on July 12th closing price of 109.85). I use a CAPM derived WACC of 6% (which looks low, given the volatility over the last couple of years) and a terminal growth rate of 2% to arrive at a DCF price of $225.17. This price level looks expensive not only from a valuation multiples standpoint but also owing to the lack of management's track record of delivery. A better way to look at CTXS would be to consider a range of WACCs and terminal growth rates. The table below captures a wide range of possible scenarios.Source: CTXS Financial ModelIn my opinion, the WACC for CTXS should be moved up to 7-8% to reflect for lack of management delivery history (other than the last couple of results). Further, I'll also want to consider possibilities of lower terminal growth (2% and below) - the management expects revenue to grow 6%+ in F2022. The average value across these scenarios is $145.65, an upside of 32.5% from the current levels. The risk to this upside is the management's inability to sustain business momentum. If the company can pull its act together, the current stock price is a steal."
4216686,76975,2018-10-31T17:39:15-04:00,"Citrix has reported Q3 earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations.The company's subscription business remains on track.More importantly, the company has initiated a dividend.That should provide a measure of downside protection especially if the market weakness persists.","Over the past couple of years, Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS), a leading provider of digital workspace solutions, has been plagued by a big revenue growth problem. Citrix has only managed to expand the topline at a paltry 4% per annum over the past five years with revenue growth clocking in at an anemic 3% in 2017. That's way lower than the average market growth for the company's key markets - +29% CAGR for DaaS (Desktop-as-a-Service) from 2018 to 2022; 27% CAGR for VDI from 2017-2023 and 13.3% CAGR for WaaS (Workspace-as-a-Service) from 2017 to 2022.Topline growth has improved quite a bit in the current year, with the company recording a more respectable 6.1% clip for the first nine months of the year while GAAP EPS has improved 67%. The uptrend continued during the company's latest earnings call where it managed to beat on both top-and bottom-line expectations. Citrix reported Q3 2018 revenue of $732.5 million, good for 6%Y/Y growth while diluted GAAP EPS of $1.08 represented a healthy 31.7% Y/Y growth. Meanwhile, Citrix's gross margin, operating margin and net margin seem to have stabilized after multi-year declines.Source: MacroTrendsRemarkably, Citrix stock has managed to rack up impressive gains of 124% over the past five years and 23.2% over the past 12 months despite a severe earnings slump in 2017 when full-year diluted EPS slipped to -$0.13 from $3.41 in the prior year. That led to Citrix's valuation getting out of whack with both the long-term trend and the industry average-CTXS stock currently sports an unusually high PE (TTM)  of 116.4, with the metric having spiked to 172 in June, easily the highest level in a decade. That's tolerable in a growth stock but not in a slow grower like Citrix.Source: MacroTrendsThat's a key reason why news that the company had, for the first time ever, instituted a dividend must have sounded like sweet music in the ears of the company's shareholders. Citrix has announced its first-ever dividend - $0.35/quarter or $1.40 annually. That's good for 1.38% forward yield and yield on cost of 3% in a 5-year time.That's quite generous for a first-payer and exactly the same as Apple, Inc.'s (AAPL) current yield. Tech companies are well known to be stingy with dividends, preferring buybacks or simply investing more in R&D.Citrix is extremely generous with buybacks - last year, the company authorized a huge $2B buyback plan. We are in an era of copious buybacks, with share repurchases set to exceed the $1trillion mark for the first time ever in the current year. Still, Citrix's massive 12.6% buyback yield is only second to Juniper's (JNPR) in the tech sector.Source: InvestopediaWhile massive corporate demand for shares has probably been playing a part in preventing an outright market crash, many investors will take dividends over buybacks any day. Some might even go as far as saying that Citrix is using those buybacks to goose a weak bottom line. Dividends are known to support stocks especially during market downturns, and even over extended periods of time as Seeking Alpha contributor Ploutos noted. According to the Gordon Growth Model (with some simplifying assumptions):Price = Dividend/[(Discount rate) - (Dividend growth rate)]OrTotal Return for Growing Perpetuity= Yield + GrowthNow that Citrix has taken the plunge and added dividends to the mix, what matters most to long-term investors at this point are two things: can the company keep the dividend flowing and, equally important, can it keep growing it?Luckily for investors, the answer to that question seems to be in the affirmative. The payout ratio is currently a lowly 23.3%, suggesting that the company can comfortably grow the dividend for years to come. This view is further buttressed by the company's improving income and free cash flow trends, with earnings expected to grow at 11% CAGR over the next five years. According to Citrix CFO Del Matto during the latest earnings call:Source: MacroTrendsParsing through Citrix's Q3 2018 earnings call transcript, it appears that the company future growth hinges a lot on the subscription business. Contribution from subscriptions reached 15.3% of revenue last term compared to 12% a year ago after expanding 37Y/Y. Though impressive, it was still slower than the 49% clip recorded in Q2 2018; something the company attributed to cloud orders typically being back-end loaded during the third quarter due to summertime seasonality. That means the metric is likely to improve during the current quarter. The company's Workspace Services segment has recorded the most growth in this regard with subscriptions and on-prem revenues being equally matched.Source: Seeking AlphaIt appears the company's move to simplify hybrid cloud adoption by providing the same infrastructure on-premise or in the cloud is responsible for driving the fast subscription growth. Citrix cloud now offers more than a dozen services including options for hybrid and staff models through partnerships with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), ServiceNow (NOW), and Samsung (SSNLF). Hybrid clouds allow customers to realize the value of reduced infrastructure complexity, more flexibility to align with their business objectives, faster access to innovation and an overall better user experience.Citrix has predicted that the mix of subscriptions as a percentage of product bookings will hit 50-55% next year compared to 40% in the current year. Although the company sees this as likely to have 1-2% revenue headwind, the market is still likely to reward the stock with a higher multiple as we have witnessed with companies like Autodesk (ADSK), Microsoft and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) that have successfully transformed their models from on-prem to the cloud. Remarkably, the on-prem license businesses stayed flat during the quarter compared to double-digit declines in previous quarters. That's a positive sign that the cloud transition is no longer cannibalizing the legacy business.Citrix enjoys first-mover advantage in the desktop/app virtualization markets and is also a major player in the server virtualization market where it competes with long-time leader VMware (VMW). VMware has particularly been giving Citrix a run for its money in the VDI market, with the company's Horizon having managed to grow its market share to 26.9% vs. 57.7% by Citrix's XenDesktop, according to Login VSI and Frame's State of the EUC 2018 Report. Horizon boasts some cutting-edge features including Instant Clone, a feature that allows the user to clone a VM while it's running. Meanwhile, Horizon has improved network performance by integrating with F5 Networks' (NASDAQ:FFIV) leading-edge network while XenDesktop runs on Citrix's proprietary NetScaler. Nevertheless, XenDesktop's security and graphic-related features are best-of-class while the company's customer-centric approach continues to be a strong selling point.Perhaps the only thing that should really concern long-term investors is the fact that Citrix's cloud push is not as aggressive as that by companies like Microsoft and Adobe, and the company continues supporting a lot of older on-prem products through Long Term Service Release (LTSR). Nevertheless, the company's improving margins, growing earnings and, now, the dividend should provide ample downside protection even in a broad-market selloff."
4189048,103480,2018-07-23T00:53:12-04:00,"Citrix has been slowly, but consistently executing on its cloud transition strategy.Throughout the transition, Citrix expects revenue growth to be impacted but remain positive, which is something not all cloud-shifters can say.Margins and profitability are also expected to see gradual lift, with Citrix targeting to deliver $10 per share in FCF by 2022.The company is due to report Q2 results on July 25.","Among the many ""themes"" that are running through the technology space right now, the subject of transitioning to the cloud has been a very familiar one. Software buyers are now all but allergic to so-called ""on-premise"" vendors, with the majority preferring some kind of flexible deployment model that allows for subscription-based payments instead of large upfront install costs. The companies that have been slow to realize this sea change in the IT landscape have been pummeled.The ""transition to cloud"" has created a lot of winners. Most notable among these names is Adobe (ADBE), whose stock has essentially doubled since it began converting its old license-based products like Acrobat and Photoshop into a subscription-based model. Adobe emerged out of its cloud transition not only with ~90% recurring revenues, but higher margins and significantly expanded earnings.One company that is still struggling through its cloud transition but is often overlooked is Citrix Systems (CTXS), a company you might be familiar with if you've ever tried to log into your office desktop from home. Citrix is one of the undisputed leaders in virtualization software (aka, the technology that allows you to connect to an enterprise network via a remote location and remote devices), but has fallen flat on the growth front as customers perceived a lack of agility in its transition to more cloud-based environments. The major focus of the company's efforts over the past year - and one highlighted consistently in its Investor Day two months back - is how to close the gap in its cloud transition.Of course, investors haven't ignored Citrix's push into cloud, though it's still early in progress (cloud-based subscriptions represented just 30% of the company's bookings in the first quarter of FY18, against a longer-term goal of 60% mix from cloud bookings by 2020 and 75% mix from cloud bookings by 2022). Like most of the companies that have announced a push into cloud (a group that includes Adobe, CAD software vendor Autodesk (ADSK), and HR software company Ceridian (CDAY)), Citrix's stock has enjoyed a spike in the past year, and influential sell-siders including Goldman Sachs (GS) have rallied behind the company. Shares are up more than 20% since the beginning of the calendar year.Despite this, I still find some opportunity left in Citrix stock. It's valued below its closest competitor VMware (VMW), though it must be said that the latter is growing revenues at a low double-digit growth rate versus Citrix's relatively flat growth rate. However, I'd argue that Citrix has more of a runway for growth going forward given the company's cloud revenues are still a smaller mix of its overall business, whereas VMware's cloud transition has been full-steam ahead for several years, especially after the public debut and rapid rise of Nutanix (NTNX), which competes against VMware's server products and hypervisor.On both a revenue and P/E basis, Citrix trades at approximately a ~20% discount to VMware. Again, VMware's growth premium can explain some of this difference, but I'm banking on the fact that Citrix's cloud transition can help to close the gap in the short term.CTXS EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsWhen I compare against the massive share price appreciation that both Autodesk and Adobe have been able to garnish since the beginning of their cloud transitions, I become extremely hopeful on Citrix's prospects. I'm long with a price target of $127 and 18% upside from current levels, which would bring Citrix's valuation roughly in parity with VMware's.One of the more soothing elements of Citrix's in-progress cloud transition is the fact that the company has noted it will not cause any negative y/y comps in the company's top line. Not many companies undergoing a cloud transition can ensure that. The reason is simple - when companies are weaning their businesses off large one-time payments and opting for a smaller stream of payments over time, the near-term revenue results are prone to suffer.The below chart, for example, highlights Autodesk's revenue growth history. Since it began converting its revenues from its expensive on-prem solutions to subscriptions, it has flirted with bouts of negative y/y revenue comps, often in the double-digits:ADSK Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsCitrix's revenues have been flat over the past several years, but never negative:Figure 1. Citrix FY17 resultsSource: Citrix 10-KThis year, Citrix has currently guided to $2.88-$2.91 billion in revenues, implying another flat year of 2.4% y/y growth. Underlying this flatness, however, is a mix shift in cloud versus on-prem. In 1Q18, while total revenues grew only 5% y/y, subscription revenues grew 49% y/y, fully covering the shortfall within a -6% y/y decline in license revenues. The company was also able to maintain its sky-high gross margin of 84.5%.With cloud revenues and bookings representing only a 15% and 30% mix of revenues in 1Q18, respectively, Citrix still has a long way to go in completing its cloud transition. But when it's building a base of revenues that's not declining on recurring contracts, the company's future growth potential is enormous - because its sales teams can focus on winning new business instead of simply renewing old accounts just to maintain last year's revenues.Longer term, the company has issued the following cloud targets for its longer-term operating model:Figure 2. Citrix cloud targetsSource: Citrix FY18 analyst dayAs long as Citrix continues to execute against these targets, it's difficult to imagine that the stock won't continue to outperform the broader markets.Another contributing factor to stability in Citrix's cloud transition is the fact that its product is incredibly mission-critical and is difficult to rip out. Imagine a corporate IT stack without remote connectivity and VDI capabilities. Also imagine having that connectivity disrupted, even for a week, in order to replace the existing vendor with a different one.Backend IaaS and server technology vendors have always enjoyed a sort of forced loyalty from their customers due to the fact that disrupting an IaaS service is much more difficult than ripping out a frontend application. Even if Citrix's customers initially resist a transition toward a cloud-based consumption model, it's difficult for them to argue (especially when other vendors like VMware are pushing for the same cloud-based services) without disrupting their own operations. Citrix customers also get the benefit from immediate deliveries of patches and new features, with the company implementing 540 releases to Citrix Cloud in 1Q18 alone.The value of the Citrix Workspace and add-on features like collaboration are difficult to ignore. Heading into the second half of 2018, Citrix's analyst presentation notes that it has simplified its go-to-market approach to focus on the following four sales priorities:Figure 3. Citrix 2018 Sales PrioritiesSource: Citrix FY18 analyst dayThe final major bullish factor in favor of a long position in Citrix is its huge profit and margin expansion potential. Even though the company's top line has been flat and is expected to remain flattish for the foreseeable future, the company is continuing to drive tremendous margin improvement. This is consistent with the cloud growth story - over the long term, as we can attest from Adobe's experience, a cloud-based business model is far more profitable and sustainable than an on-prem business.In 1Q18, Citrix delivered 35% y/y operating profit growth to $165.6 million, generating a GAAP operating margin of 23.7%, which is a 520bps improvement over a GAAP operating margin of 18.5% in 1Q17.On top of that, the company delivered 23% y/y growth in operating cash flows to $358 million, up from $292 million in the year-ago quarter. Despite the cloud transition, Citrix has managed to keep fueling cash flow growth and expects the trend to continue, with a target of hitting >$10 in per-share free cash flows by 2022:Figure 4. Citrix FCF trajectorySource: Citrix FY18 analyst dayThough this target is still a few years out, we can note that Citrix currently trades at only a ~11x multiple on this long-term per-share FCF goal.Among the companies that are undergoing a serious transition toward a cloud-based delivery model, Citrix is one of the most overlooked. And given that it still has a long way to go (with only ~15% of its revenues and ~30% of its bookings in the cloud at present), I believe its stock price also still has plenty of room for growth over the medium-to-longer term.Investors will be keenly watching Citrix's progress toward its 2020 and 2022 targets on its earnings releases (the Q2 earnings date is set for July 25), but the most recent indicators on the company show that all is well."

The company's operating margin showed relative strength against its competitors coming in higher than the average of 17.40% for its industry (specific group of companies engaged in similar business activities) - Reuters. The company's operating margin internal growth rate is also impressive, having grown an average of 12.30% per year over the last five years.The FutureKnowing how a company has performed in the past is important in order to evaluate management's past record in running the business. But more important to us is how profitable the company will be in the future because we are investing going forward, not backwards. And it's the forward-looking metrics that should really get you excited about CTXS.I like to use two measuring sticks to gauge the future growth potential for companies: forward P/E and forward rate of return.I prefer to use the forward P/E ratio (current stock's price over its ""expected"" earnings per share) rather than historical P/E to gauge a company's expected future earnings power. A high forward P/E ratio means that investors are anticipating higher growth in the future and are willing to pay more for future earnings - momentum investing is all about following the trend (perceived or real).CTXS has a forward P/E of 18.28 compared to a 18.51 forward P/E for the S&P 100. The Forward P/E for CTXS is slightly lower than that of the index, indicating that investor growth prospects for the stock are lower than that of the broader market, but I view a Forward P/E above 10.00 as acceptable for a long position.The forward rate of return for a stock (created by Donald Yacktman) is one of my favorite quotients for gauging the market's expectation for future growth for a company. Yacktman defines forward rate of return as the normalized free cash flow yield plus real growth plus inflation. In simple terms, the forward rate of return can be thought of as the return that investors buying the stock today can expect from it in the future.The forward rate of return for CTXS stands at 14.45%. This implies that an investor buying the stock today should expect a 14.45% return over the next 12 months. The average forward rate of return for the S&P 100 as of the end of August was at 8.84%, so CTXS has an implied potential rate of return that is 1.63x greater than that of the index.The risk inherent in the forward rate of return is that the calculation is reliable only if the company can grow at the same rate in the future as it did in the past. If the growth rate falters, the projected returns will not materialize. But we are willing to accept this risk as part of the difficult process of forecasting earnings and growth momentum.As per my ChartMasterPro Daily Trade Model, the momentum trend for CTXS would turn bullish with a daily close above $111.00. This would signal a bullish break out of a descending triangle pattern on the daily charts. From here, I see the shares climbing to the $117.00 level over the next three months.Today (article publication date) I will buy the CTXS 19OCT18 105 Call Options, which will provide approximately 17x leverage on my long trade. My stop-loss exit signal for the trade will be a daily close below $108.00. When trading options with leverage, a stop-loss is absolutely imperative in order to avoid oversized losses and wipe-outs. My target return for the trade is 102% (6% share appreciation x 17x leverage on the call options).For investors in the shares, I recommend that you hold for 3 months or $117.00, whichever comes first. For longer-term investors, I believe CTXS is a solid addition to any growth portfolio over the next 12 months.I like to invest in companies that have a proven record of better execution against the competition, especially in regards to profitability ratios. I want to invest in companies that are run efficiently and that are more profitable than their competitors.Profitability RatiosSource: ReutersCognizant Technology is a company with a management team that is very good at turning revenue into profits. The recent price drop in the shares presents a great opportunity to initiate a position in CTXS.For Q2 2018 the company reported a 7.0% YOY increase in revenue, a 24% increase in EPS, and a 400bps increase in operating margin. But the most impressive metric was the 49% increase in subscription revenue - this impressive growth was spurred by the company's strategy of transitioning to cloud services for its customers. As CEO David Henshall stated in the Q2 2018 earnings call:Integrating their products into a cloud service helped generate growth across all three of business segments, but it was the strong growth in their largest segment, Workspace Services, that was most impacted by the transition to the cloud - subscription bookings accounted for more than 50% of total new bookings:   Source: SeekingAlphaBeing able to help its customers across its business segments incorporate cloud services to existing services, and having them transition to the subscription model will help the company drive revenues higher over the next twelve months. When I go long a stock, I want to invest in a company that provides superior future growth potential, but I also want to time the entry into any position to try to maximize my return.So I use fundamental analysis to identify shares with a strong future growth rate, and then I apply technical analysis to identify ideal entry points.In my opinion, CTXS is an attractive buy at these levels from both a fundamental and technical perspective."

Up to $4 trillion has been wiped off shares over the past week.There are, as everyone knows, no sure bets on the stock market, yet buying the dip is a common strategy to pursue, especially in a bull market.It's true that Citrix has now suffered a strong drop (-8.12%) since, and is also down year to date (-1.59%), and trading -2.6% below its 50-day.","By Oisin Breen, ResearchThe market is volatile. Up to $4 trillion has been wiped off shares over the past week, and some suggest that volatility is about to become the new normal. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth, digests the week's market ructions. Source: MSNIf economists like Larry Elliott are right, this is simply that market correction that has been mooted for some time. The nature of the market demands that both bears and bulls are right some of the time.In a more bearish, and more volatile market, however, it is easy to recognise why investors may start looking more at the fundamentals of the firm's they invest in, rather than the narratives that surround them. For many, growth trumps value when you see future gains as a certainty. When you don't, value and stability gain a greater currency.It is also quite true that it is always possible to profit from a dip. Sometimes the pursuit of stability above all else produces unexpected value propositions. In this article, we consider the strategy of buying on the dip, and briefly ask whether Citrix Systems (CTXS) might be a historically supported post-drop stock to consider, especially as the market digests the present changing circumstances.Citrix and the Dow Jones share the most recent drop. The Dow has recovered somewhat, will Citrix? Source: BloombergThere are, as everyone knows, no sure bets on the stock market, yet buying the dip is a common strategy to pursue, especially in a bull market. That said, when the market turns bearish the risk is that the dip goes far further than you expected, and you end up taking potentially substantial losses.Being right all of the time is impossible, not least when dealing with a complex network of relationships like the markets-at-large. What is not impossible, however, is to keep yourself informed, and, if it isn't possible to always make the right choice, two positions might be worth further examination: keeping a long mentality, or holding fire. Before buying in the current market, investors should ask themselves if they are willing to take real losses to try and achieve potentially lucrative long-term returns. If not, it might be prudent to hold fire.Societe Generale SA's Roland Kaloyan issued a warning in November. Source: ZerohedgeBuying the dip seems like such a logical proposition at first examination, but right now there are very much two schools of thoughts doing the rounds, one is the melt-up theory espoused by famous investor Jeremy Grantham, whilst the bearish case is promulgated by, amongst many others, Societe Generale strategist Roland Kaloyan.Grantham's basic premise is that prior to a correction of around 10%, or indeed a protracted bear market that sees prices plunge by up to 20%, the market will ""melt-up"" first. This melt-up, reported on by the WSJ, for instance, will see the current bull cycle in the market force through one last upward surge in share prices before it ends. Grantham himself suggested in early January that such a phenomenon was likely and that it would last between six months and two years followed by a sharp decline.Indeed, analysts like Bespoke Investment Group's co-founder Paul Hickey continue to see profits available in the short to medium term. Hickey suggests that even buying at market highs will yield long-term rewards if the grounds for investment were solid in the first place. Hickey cites previous pre-crash highs and the returns available from such investments in the years following as his precedent.""If you look back historically,"" says Hickey, ""[if you bought] at the top in 1987, since then the annualized returns in the S&P 500 have been 9.6 percent. If you go back to March of 2000, if you bought at the top, the annualized return since then is 5.7 percent. And if you bought at the top in October 2007, annualized returns are 7.5 percent.""Despite such assertions, analysts like Kaloyan are skeptical about the potential for value in buying the dip until the state of the market becomes clearer. In November, Kaloyan warned about the risks of overcrowded short positions on volatility, now he suggests that rising yields will choke the market.""Equity investors have had an amazing time over the past four-five years,"" says Kaloyan. ""Now, the surge in bond yields is reaching the pain threshold for equities.Bearing these two positions in mind, it is quite clear that investors ought to ask themselves whether or not they want to keep the powder dry.Kaloyen predicts further losses for the Dow. Source: BloombergOne thing stands out about Citrix and stock market drops for the past thirty years, says Schaeffer's Investment Research's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White. The Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based software firm has consistently shown signs of strength immediately following such periods of increased volatility.""One month after such a pullback,"" writes Andrea Kramer, a Schaeffer's researcher ""CTXS shares were higher 80% of the time, and averaged a healthy gain of 10.65%.""At the risk of potentially vindicating bearish market concerns with too positive a statement, just before the most recent market drop, Citrix was heading towards its March 2000 high of $97.39, having reached $95 per share on Jan. 29. Such highs are not usually reached for no reason.It is true that Citrix has now suffered a strong drop (-8.12%) since, and is also down in the year to date (-1.59%), and trading -2.6% below its 50 day moving average, but the Dow itself, after the most recent rally, is only up 0.28% in the year to date. The index is also down following the slump (-6.5%), and trading at -1.69% below its 50-day average. As the market is yet to find any new equilibrium, it is worth asking whether such figures ought to be taken as gospel at all.Feb. 2-7, 2018.

CTXS Falls Below 50-Day Moving Average (in black), and 20-Day Moving Average (in green). Source: MarketwatchIndeed, despite such falls, if Schaeffer's data is correct, there is a four in five chance that Citrix shares will be higher in one month's time than their present level, with a potential upside of 10.65%. If such a scenario were to come to fruition that would place Citrix shares at around $96.93 in a month's time.Whilst there are no clear bets, history seems to suggest that Citrix is a stock worth further research in the aftermath of a market correction.

4005776,48501,2016-09-13T01:58:56-04:00,Sales growth is expected to continue in the mid-single digits with improving profitability.Leadership should solidify the balance sheet and future growth prospects before returning capital.Shares are trading at a steep discount to the Nasdaq and the industry.,"Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS) develops and sells products and services that enable the secure and reliable delivery of applications and data over public, private, or hybrid clouds or networks to virtually any type of device. The company has five operating product categories: Workspace Services, Delivery Networking, Cloud Services, Mobility Apps, and Other. Mobility Apps is being spun off into a joint venture with LogMeIn, Inc. (NASDAQ:LOGM).The spin-off of the GoTo product line will allow Citrix to focus on its core product offerings within the desktop and application delivery space. XenApp and XenDesktop remain a leading offering within Workspace Services, providing workers with a reliable and highly functional option for off-site productivity. NetScaler (within Delivery Networking) is, among other things, an Internet application accelerator. For companies operating in a Citrix environment NetScaler is an attach that improves the functioning of applications on the network for the end user.NetScaler is a growth initiative; given the deep penetration of Citrix's remote compute platform within the enterprise space, NetScaler serves to improve the end user experience of already installed applications and integrates well with existing Citrix applications, making it a preferred solution for businesses already on Citrix. NetScaler and to a lesser extent ShareFile are expected to drive sales growth of 7% in FY16. Additionally, the GoTo product line is also a significant driver of sales growth during FY16.Turning to risk, weaker than expected product and licensing sales as well as software-as-a-service sales could have a material adverse impact on the share price. Additionally, competition from end-user compute software solutions providers such as VMware (NYSE:VMW) or network solutions providers such as F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV) could weigh on the consolidated results of operations.With Citrix trading at a 41% discount to the Nasdaq on F P/E basis and at a 32% discount to the industry on a F P/S basis, I think shares of Citrix are undervalued; and consequently there is substantial scope for total return outperformance.Top Line Growth with Expense DisciplineOver the next 18 months, I see CTXS continuing to grow in the mid-single digits on the back of SaaS, new license, and updated license sales. That is expected to come while management decreases operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue. The increased profitability should be used to solidify the balance sheet, providing management with the opportunity to make transformative acquisitions while also returning cash to shareholders.Courtesy of Morningstar and Bottom Up InvestingFor FY16, sales are expected to increase 7% to $3.5B with operating income at 17% of sales or $589 million. The operating margin is expected to increase from 11% in FY15. Net income is forecasted to be $460M with EPS of $2.97 and an EBITDA margin of 25%.Sales in FY17 are anticipated to increase 6% to $3.72B with an operating margin of 18% or $656M. Net income is expected to grow 12% to $514M with EPS of $3.54, augmented by share repurchases.Courtesy of Morningstar and Bottom Up InvestingFor FY16, I see almost all of the $1.214B of cash flow from operations being put into short-term investments, cash; in other words, I'm not modeling share repurchases or debt retirement during FY16. During FY17, I'm modeling the $1.145B of cash flow from operations to go toward $950M of share repurchases. Granted, we could see substantial share repurchases in both FYs, but I think given the underlying business and the competitive environment, it makes sense for management to add liquidity to the balance sheet that can be used to acquire growth and/or technology in FY18 and beyond.Courtesy of Morningstar and Bottom Up InvestingTurning to the balance sheet, as previously discussed, I think it makes sense for management to strengthen the balance sheet, bringing the financial leverage down from 2.78 to 1.80 and the debt/equity ratio down from 67% to 29%. Then in FY17, leadership can make a major acquisition by using cash-on-hand and/or issuing additional debt, with the balance sheet already fortified in FY16.Undervalued with Shares Trading BullishCTXS is in a bull market of primary degree. There was an excellent dip-to-buy earlier in the year, and I would bet against seeing that good of a dip for quite some time. The play is to get long and ride the uptrend through most of FY17.Courtesy of Morningstar, Bloomberg and Bottom Up InvestingGiven the steady growth and improving profitability, shares of CTXS are undervalued, trading at a 41% discount to the Nasdaq and a 32% discount to the industry."
4020781,68695,2016-11-07T19:33:34-05:00,"Citrix Systems is trading near historical averages, with the market expecting ROA’ to decline from 34% in 2015 to 27% in 2020, accompanied by 6% Asset’ growth.However, the firm has historically demonstrated the ability to consistently improve profitability while growing at robust double-digit rates.Moreover, management is confident about the potential of their products and partnerships and that growth in their CSP segment is sustainable.Given such low expectations, the firm need only sustain ROA’ at current levels to justify material equity upside.","Performance and Valuation Prime ChartCitrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) is a software company that provides server, application and desktop virtualization as well as networking and cloud computing services. Recently the firm sold their GoTo business, allowing the firm to focus on execution of their enterprise mobile, virtualization solutions and cloud initiatives, among other efforts. This positions the firm well for sustained strong results going forward as they are now focused on areas with strong tailwinds. As such, the firm is unlikely to see a sustained material step-down in profitability and is more likely to see sustained growth and favorable ROA' going forward, spelling equity upside.Historically, CTXS has been able to consistently improve ROA' while growing at fairly robust levels. Since bottoming in 2003, CTXS has seen steady improvements in profitability with ROA' increasing from 17% to a peak of 37% in 2013, before falling to 33-34% levels in 2014-2015. Meanwhile, Asset' growth, which ranged from 44-52% from 2000-2002, has since slowed, ranging from -7% to 22% from 2003-2015. This shows a company with strong competitive positioning and substantial growth opportunities in their markets historically.For context, the PVP chart below reflects the real, economic performance and valuation measures of Citrix after making many major adjustments to the as-reported financials. This chart, along with all of the charts included in this article, as well as the detail behind the graphics, can be found here.The four panels above explain the company's historical corporate performance and valuation levels plus consensus estimates for forecast years as well as what the market is currently pricing in - in terms of expectations for profitability and growth.The apostrophe after ROA', Asset', V/A', and V/E' is the symbol for ""prime"" which means ""adjusted."" These calculations have been modified with comprehensive adjustments to remove as-reported earnings, asset, liability, and cash flow statement inconsistencies and distortions. To better understand the PVP chart and the following discussion, please refer to our guide here.Performance Drivers - Sales, Margins and TurnsIt can be helpful to break down ROA' into its DuPont formula parts, Adjusted Earnings Margin (Earnings' Margin) and Adjusted Asset Turnover (Asset' Turns), which are cleaned up margins and turns metrics used to calculate ROA'. The chart below details both Earnings' Margin and Asset' Turns historically to help us better understand the drivers of the firm's profitability and performance.CTXS' ROA' improvement trend has been driven by expansion in both Asset' Turns and Earnings' Margins. The company has both been able to continue to charge more for their goods while not seeing expenses grow nearly as fast, and has done an excellent job of maximizing their return on their assets. Specifically, they have improved working capital management substantially and for the last several years have operated with a negative working capital balance, driving turns and ROA' higher.Embedded Expectations AnalysisAs investors, understanding what the market is embedding in the stock price in terms of expectations is paramount to making good decisions. Without understanding what the market is pricing in, it is impossible to claim that the market is wrong. We derive market expectations for the firm from valuations and historical performance trends to give a clearer picture into what the market is projecting for the firm.CTXS is currently trading at a 17.1x V/E', which is near historical averages. At these levels, the market is pricing in expectations for declining ROA', from 34% in 2015 to 27% in 2020, accompanied by 6% Asset' growth. As one other contributor explained, part of this discount may be a result of the complexity of the firm's business and the amount of work it takes to value each of the firm's various focuses. That said, the recent sale of their GoTo business and other restructuring activity may bring their business model better into focus, leading to this discount disappearing.Analyst and Management Expectations and AlignmentAnalysts have bullish expectations relative to the market, projecting ROA' to fall to 29% in 2016 before recovering to 31% in 2017, accompanied by 4% Asset' growth.Moreover, Valens' qualitative analysis of the firm's Q3 2016 earnings call highlights that management is confident that growth in their Citrix Service Provider segment is sustainable, and about the potential of their Workspace technology and partnerships with hyper-converged appliance providers.Peer Analysis - Valuations Relative to ProfitabilityA major benefit of adjusting as-reported financial statements is to clear away accounting distortions to allow for more accurate peer-to-peer comparisons. To this end we have included a scatter chart below that plots CTXS against its peers based on their Adjusted Value-to-Assets ratio (V/A') and ROA'.Looking across industries, markets and time, there has been a very strong relationship between a company's ROA' relative to the corporate average (6%) ROA' and the multiple the market will pay above the value of the company's adjusted Asset' base in terms of Adjusted Enterprise Value relative to Assets (V/A' or Value to Assets'). A company that generates a 6% ROA' will tend to trade at a 1.0x V/A' and a company that generates an 18% ROA' will trade at a 3.0x V/A', etc.Relative to its peers, CTXS appears to be trading at a discount with its 5.3x V/A' and 29% ROA'. On the low end of the spectrum, CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA), VMware (NYSE:VMW), and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) trade around 4.0-4.5x Assets', with ROA' around 25-30%. Relative to these peers alone, CTXS appears fairly valued. However, at the high end of the spectrum F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV) trades at a 6.7x V/A', while Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) trades at a 10.1x V/A', and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) trades at a 13.9x V/A', all with ROA' only ranging from 30%-36%. Evaluated in the context of these peers CTXS appears undervalued given its significant growth opportunities. Similar to CRM, CTXS operates in a rapidly expanding industry with substantial macroeconomic tailwinds. These growth tailwinds along with the firm's robust historical and expected growth rates should justify higher valuations similar to those of CRM and ADBE, providing room for material multiple expansion and equity upside.Valuation Matrix - ROA' and Asset' Growth as Drivers of ValuationWhen valuing a company, it is important to consider more than a singular target price and instead the potential value of a firm at various levels of performance. The below matrix highlights potential prices for CTXS at various levels of profitability (in terms of ROA') and growth (Asset' growth). Prices that are in excess of 10% equity upside are highlighted in black, and prices representing an excess of 10% equity downside are highlighted in red.To justify current prices CTXS would have to see ROA' fall back to levels not seen since 2005 while growing at 6%, below recent growth rates. Should the firm merely succeed in sustaining ROA' at current 33% levels equity upside would be material. Furthermore, considering management's confidence that growth in their Citrix Service Provider segment is sustainable, and about the potential of their technology and partnerships it is likely that the firm may be able to drive ROA' back to prior peaks while growing at +10% levels, indicating that equity upside may be substantial.To find out more about Citrix Systems, Inc. and how their performance and market expectations compare to peers, click here to access the open beta of the Valens Research database.Our Chief Investment Strategist, Joel Litman, chairs the Valens Equities and Credit Research Committees, which are responsible for this article.

4008332,98236,2016-09-26T00:35:34-04:00,"Citrix is one of the more complicated of the mid-sized software vendors with 4 significantly disparate business operations.The spin-merger of the ""GoTo"" business segment will simplify the analysis of the company and is likely to lead to better margins for Citrix and the new, merged entity.The company's future is really a function of how well it can exploit the opportunity in desktop virtualization.Results of that division within the Americas last quarter were a substantial upside compared to prior expectations.The shares have a remarkably attractive valuation when looking at a free cash flow yield that is likely to surpass 8% in the coming year.","Citrix- A company that is a bit of a puzzlementCitrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) is a well-known software vendor, but it has such a broad set of solutions that many people do not know what it really does or what makes it tick. The company is in the process of selling what had been one of its core technologies, so it can concentrate on the more enterprise-oriented segments of its portfolio. That transaction was discussed in an article I wrote on Seeking Alpha regarding LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM). The shares, other than the valuations reached during the tech bubble at the start of this century, are near an all-time high and have achieved about average performance year to date, up 13%, which is just a bit better than the IGV software index which is now up by 12% over the same span.The company's P/E, at about 16X forward earnings, is modest in this market, but then its top line growth rate, which is estimated to be in the low-mid single digits is also modest. It has chugged along with growth at less than 5% for some years now. It has had a history of significant earnings beats and estimates have been drifting up, but on balance, analysts were not impressed with the prior quarter, which saw but a small EPS beat.The company has a relatively elevated EV/S of 3.8X based on the expectations for the current year, which is forecast to show top-line growth of 3.5%. On the other hand, the company's cash flow from operations (CFFO) is quite strong because of very high depreciation expense, coupled with above average profit margins and a fair level of stock-based compensation. Last quarter, which also enjoyed a benefit from a reduction in receivables, partially offset by other balance sheet items, the CFFO margin was a truly remarkable 67%. Even with relatively high capital expenditures, the company was able to generate free cash flow for the quarter of almost $500 million. CFFO rose 15% year on year, and free cash flow rose by 19%. The free cash flow yield based on historical numbers is 7.6%, and that yield will almost certainly be higher looking at the forward 12 months. So, the valuation is really quite modest when looking at my favorite measure of free cash flow yield, which I like to use to compare valuations.Then company raised guidance some in the wake of its beat in the June quarter. That being said, the increase was of the eye-dropper variety, and analysts were unimpressed and there were some downgrades. The shares have done very little since the earnings were announced. In the last couple of months since the earnings release, the shares have lost about 6% of their value and the IGV is up a couple of percent. Compared to many other mid-sized enterprise software vendors, this is a more reasonable time to enter the name than in the recent past.The guidance provided on that call two months ago represents revenue growth of 3%-4% and EPS growth of 15%. The top line number includes revenues from the ""GoTo"" businesses that are in the process of being divested. Mobility apps as a whole showed growth of 10% last quarter, more than double the results of the rest of the company's business lines. Overall, ""GoTo"" revenues last quarter were $169 million for the quarter, or 20% of the total revenue for the period. The consensus forecast for the following year reflects minimal growth in revenues and little in the way of margin improvement. Management suggested it would include the ""GoTo"" business segment in its operating results and its guidance until the spin-merger transaction closes. So, the relatively modest growth forecast for the coming fiscal year, seems to reflect more than a little skepticism that management's transformation initiatives will bear fruit. I disagree, and think that based on the mismatch between current published expectations, and a more balanced set of expectations for the future that I provide below, there is an excellent investment case to be made for this name with potential rewards overtopping risks.Many analysts seem to be dubious about the name with an average rating on First Call of just better than hold from the 27 analysts publishing recommendations. That is far below the average ratings posted by analysts for most stocks they follow.I think part of the issue, and really the purpose of this article, is that Citrix has so many moving parts that it can be tedious at some point to attempt to evaluate all of the pieces and to come up with a combined growth rate better than the mid-single percentage, which seems to be all that is anticipated by most observers. The other part of the issue is that most observers have negative history with this company. Xen, historically speaking, was both a big hype and then a big flop. It is no accident that activist shareholders are prominent in this company's ownership. The company generates lots of cash and not lots of growth. At the end of the day, it is going to have to determine if it can achieve better growth, or return the cash flow to investors in some form or the other or if it is going to sell the company. Depending on one's point of view, all of those alternatives ought to produce better share price performance than this company has achieved recently.The company has had an operating margin target of 30% and results last quarter showed operating margins reaching 28.5% (non-GAAP). So, 30% operating margins are just around the corner.""Getting to know you"" from which the title of this article is taken is the name of a famous song from the well-known Rogers and Hammerstein musical, the King and I. And ""it's a puzzlement"" is another less well known number from the same show originally sung by the incomparable Yul Brenner. I have been puzzled in trying to understand the CTXS strategy for years now. I think the results of the first half and the increased guidance suggest that getting to know the story is a useful undertaking and one worth pursuing.Trying to figure out the focusOnce upon a time it was really simple to figure out what this company did - it was all about the consumer apps such as ""Go to my PC."" Citrix acquired that product in an acquisition back in 2003 and became a real high-flier as usage of the product grew fantastically. That's all gone now for better or for worse.The area of focus that will make or break the stock is the company's offerings of Xen solutions. These products include the virtualization offerings that are called XenApp, XenDesktop and Xen Server. This market has been a dog fight against industry leader VMware (NYSE:VMW). It still is and it is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future, and Citrix is in the position of being a strong challenger and not the market leader.XenMobile is a software that manages mobile devices in terms of their physical and logical security and includes the management of the most common productivity apps that run on those devices. Citrix created the product by making an acquisition and folding its own internally-developed gateway software into the acquisition.Citrix calls the Xen family its Workspace Services group. Can Workspace Services become a growth engine going forward? I think the consensus of opinion suggests that this isn't a likely outcome although some of the work that the company has done is showing some benefits. But server virtualization is a saturated market at this point. The company has been able to create some creative packaging around what it calls Workspace suite and that product is showing reasonable growth. Citrix also sells its products through the channel packaged as what it calls Citrix Service Provider (CSP) offerings and that has been a successful approach with growth last quarter of 37%. Some of that are clearly new users who would not otherwise be Citrix customers and some other amount is displacement. It isn't really possible to tell how much is which.As will be discussed below, it is desktop virtualization and what is called Desktop as a Service (DaaS) that is the future for Citrix, both as a business and as an investment.There are a couple of other issues to consider with regards to trying to analyze the real growth potential of the portfolio; the significant differences in geographical performance. Overall, the Americas grew by 11%. The other two geos, EMEA and Asia/Pac, showed revenue declines. Management says this is sales execution and represents the impact of a transformation in the sales force that is more than a year old in North America. Skeptics are entitled to their opinions and I don't have enough evidence to say that there isn't something else at work. But obviously, part of the case for this company becoming a double-digit growth story is that the rest of the world follows the Americas. Those kinds of things do happen, and not infrequently. The other major thing to consider is the role of mobility apps in the new scheme.Mobility apps, which just to confuse things is not the same as Xen 33Mobility, as mentioned earlier, grew a solid 10%+. The transaction that this company has agreed to with LOGM is one of those spin/mergers, and this company will be left with some significant residual ownership position. The concept of this deal, as is true with all other spin-mergers is that the company that is the parent of the larger cohort of revenues will have a smaller interest but faster growth and profitability. With regards to the ""GoTo"" portfolio, that seems to me to be a reasonable bet, and I think it is one of those rare cases when there is a win/win outcome for all shareholders.Management plans to present the results of its ""GoTo' businesses over the next few quarters as a consolidated entity for both reporting and for guidance purposes. Exactly how results will be reported after that time has not yet been disclosed. I will not spend a lot of time discussing the outcome of the spin-merger for current and potential Citrix shareholders. It is likely a positive, although one of undetermined magnitude at this point.Looking at Citrix by Solution typeI do think I have to say a few words regarding the outlook for the company based on its different products and their potential growth rate to see if the results support the thesis of potential double-digit growth that could translate into significant positive alpha going forward. Much of Citrix, as it currently exists, has been the product of acquisitions. Over the past 20 years, the company has acquired no fewer than 47 companies and its virtualization and application acceleration/controller products both have come from acquisitions. But those acquisitions took place years ago now, and it would be difficult to describe CTXS as a roll-up at this point.CTXS reports its revenues in 3 major buckets including Workspace Services - primarily the virtualization solutions, Delivery Networks and Cloud Services. In that breakdown, Workspace Services currently accounts for about 50% of total revenues, Delivery networks is a bit less than 25%, Cloud Services is about 4% and the revenues in the ""GoTo"" segment are about 20% of the total.Last quarter, amongst the product groups, Workspace Services grew by 2% year on year, Delivery Networks saw more than 11% growth and the small cloud services business achieved more than 30% growth.If investors are trying to evaluate Citrix and determine what it is worth, then the future prospects for the Xen family and the company's Workspace Services offering is going to basically determine the investment case. I don't want to seem cavalier - but the visibility of the future of Workplace Services is far more controversial in terms of growth than is the case for the other revenue sources of the company. As some readers may remember, this company has had two major share price hikes over time. One of those was back in the tech bubble when the ""GoTo"" products had just been developed. The other spike, however, was back in 2011, a few years after the company acquired XenSource and entered the market for desktop and server virtualization. Regardless of the history of the space, the goal of displacing VMWare from its throne as the virtualization king was grossly under-fulfilled. And of course, server virtualization is now a mature market with no growth remaining to be had according to Gartner's latest survey on the subject.But if server virtualization is saturated and market share gains or losses in a mature space are hard to come by, the future of the space is something else again. Citrix Workspace Services or CWS as it is called, is the future of XenApp and XenDesktop and what is called DaaS (desktop as a service). And I obviously have no real objective way to say that Citrix has a solution that is better or worse in this area than that offered by either VMware or by Amazon WorkSpaces. A market research entity called Mordor Intelligence says that Desktop Virtualization, as they define it, is supposed to achieve a CAGR of greater than 54% between now and 2021. The size of the market is supposed to be in the billions of dollars and Citrix is one of the three leading vendors in the space. Without trying to evaluate whether or not VMW's solutions are better or equal to those offered by CTXS, the point is that given the revenue that CTXS generates in the space today and the overall growth of the space coupled with a product that is, at the least competitive, the growth of this part of the company should be able to exceed the negligible growth or the shrinkage that it has had in the recent past.Workspace Services grew by 2% last quarter; overall, the space is growing at many times that rate and so decent execution on a worldwide basis should set the stage for much more rapid growth overall. Overall, in the North American geo, Workspace Services showed 23% license growth last quarter. This implies relatively poor performance outside of the Americas and in turn partially validates the company's claim that its slow growth is more of a function of sales execution than anything else.As mentioned above, Delivery Networks is about half of the revenue contribution compared to Workspace Services. The company now has rebranded most of its offerings under the NetScaler brand, which is well known and is the core of the Delivery Networks offering. Basically, NetScaler is a company that sells what are called Application Delivery Controllers - which balance and accelerate workloads. Again, for most investors going through the product functionality of NetScaler would be overkill and wouldn't improve their chances of making a better investment decision in Citrix. NetScaler competes against F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV), and not too surprisingly, CTXS says it is significantly more functional. But the fact is that Citrix commissioned the research that lays out the performance data, so I have no real way of knowing just how valid the statistics are. More objective are the market share statistics in the Application Delivery Controller brand leader report which shows CTXS up a few hundred basis points on F5 and enjoying a leading market share. CTXS says its ADCs have advantage in agility, security, cost, performance and reliability in the ADC race. I am confident that F5 has its own set of charts that reach the opposite conclusion. The ADC market is already quite consolidated and is decently penetrated, and so its CAGR is thought be in the high-single digit range at best. Citrix, notionally ought to gain share in the space because of the change in the problems that ADCs are being used to solve.Overall, it is believed that the ADC space is supposed to reach almost $4 billion by 2022 according to the research provided by a firm called Grand View. CTXS saw 11% revenue growth in Delivery Networking last quarter with license revenue growth of 16%. That is consistent, I think with overall market trends and clearly, over time, the 16% license revenue growth will flow through to more rapid overall growth in the sector. I suppose that there is the potential for this company to start to improve its market share significantly when compared to FFIV - but in order to make the case, that kind of result is not necessary.The company sells a solution called ShareFile which it includes in the Citrix cloud-based services bucket. As many readers are probably aware, the ShareFile space has many competitors including common names such as Box (NYSE:BOX) DropBox (DROPB), SharePoint etc. The space is fast growing and Citrix has a position in the leader's quadrant of the Gartner MQ survey that is actually ahead of Box and significantly ahead of SharePoint, DropBox and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). ShareFile has actually been achieving percentage growth as fast as Box lately, although of course, its revenues are only 1/3rd those of Box. ShareFile has a slightly different emphasis than the other companies in this space, and there is no reason to think that its revenues will not sustain the kind of growth going forward that it has in the recent past.Right now, the revenue contribution from ShareFile and its ancillary solutions represents just 4% of total revenue, but at its growth rate, it is contributing a bit more than 100 bps to overall revenue growth.There is one other way that investors might look to slice and dice the revenue stream of this company, and of course, that is the growth of its recurring revenue sources outside of the ""GoTo"" product family. At this point, the company's cloud delivered services revenue, including ShareFile has reached $200 million of ARR and that is growing somewhere above 30%. On this last conference call, management foreshadowed that it is likely to make a more substantial transition to a real cloud/ratable model in the near future in a fashion that might be viewed as akin to what Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has just completed. It was just foreshadowing, and it will not impact the balance of the fiscal year. But it is likely to happen, based on the inferences that can be drawn from commentary and when it does, it is likely to be well received by investors who are willing to pay premium multiples for companies with recurring and visible revenue streams.Looking at Citrix in terms of products and in terms of geos, I think a very reasonable case can be made that over time this company should evolve into a solid double-digit growth company in terms of revenue and that there are still some further margin opportunities, and there will almost certainly be share buybacks of the extent that EPS growth will be visibly impacted. Obviously, foretelling the evolution of the Xen business, which has not had growth of any kind till recently to a business that is growing high-single digits or above and be ""substantiated"" in any other fashion than in looking at market growth and the performance of a key geo - but I think the possibility is there and is not really incorporated into consensus estimates at this point.CTXS has had its share of ups and downs over the past years, and there are more than a few observers and most likely some readers as well, who have been amongst the host of disappointed stakeholders. That said, and trying to be objective, the company would seem to have all of the elements necessary to show significant top-line growth acceleration over the next several years.Margins and ValuationBefore embarking on this section, I think it should be noted that the CFO, David Henshall, indicated that the company, excluding its ""GoTo"" segment had already reached its 30% operating margin target. As I have suggested earlier, companies that reach their margin targets are going to have to rethink some of their tactics in terms of growth initiatives or capital allocation or some other element of potential expenditure. Management guided to the numbers that are now the consensus. But to some degree, the guidance is based on using static expenditure targets that are more or less independent of revenue achievement. If revenues increase a bit faster than forecast, and that has really been foreshadowed, there will be additional leverage at scale that might lead to more significant upside than has been seen year to date. This company has seen some very substantial earnings beats over the past year ranging to as much as 40%. The beat this past quarter which was just 6% was the lowest percentage earnings beat in some time both absolutely and in terms of percentage. So I might expect to see something more substantial in terms of earnings upside in the balance of the fiscal year than that which has been guided.The company has reached 83% gross margin and that is likely as high as it is going to go in the near future. Management maintained that it charged premium prices compared to competitors, and I have no way of doing much more than reporting that statement.The company's research and development expense ratio was 15% this past quarter and that compares to 17.5% in the prior year's Q2. Sales and marketing expenses decreased from 37.7% to 35.3% and general and administrative expenses increased from 10% in the prior year quarter to 11.5% this year. Management indicated that the spike in general and administrative expenses was one time in nature and that it would be reasonable to expect expenses to return to the levels seen in Q1 of this fiscal year. The company is forecasting a typical sequential decline in Q3 revenues, but forecast that EPS would be consistent with Q2 levels, partially reflecting the expected decline in Q3 general and administrative costs. On the other hand, the company, in response to questions, noted that some maintenance revenue had been pushed from Q2 into Q3, making the current forecast more conservative than the business trends articulated during the conference call by CEO Kirill Tatrinov.The company is expecting to see Q4 revenues reach close to $890 million which would be a marginal decline for that period from the $905 million the company actually saw in Q4 of 2015. It really doesn't seem quite likely based on the other commentary and looking at the growth rates of the various pieces of this company's revenue. It has been one of the factors leading to a couple of analyst downgrades and to the relatively muted performance of the shares, in my opinion.As mentioned earlier, this company generates substantially more cash flow than it reports in non-GAAP earnings. That is partially a function of stock-based compensation which is more than 10% of revenues, but also relates to significant depreciation expense and in some quarters changes in assets and liabilities. (Self-evidently changes in assets and liabilities is not a long-term source of operating cash flow.) The company is forecasting non-GAAP EPS of $5.00-$5.10. The company's CFFO for the trailing 12 months was more than $7/share and that was up 31% from the year-earlier period. While the company doesn't explicitly forecast CFFO or free cash flow, it would be reasonable to assume that the current year will see CFFO of $1.2 billion or $7.75/share and free cash flow ought to be in the range of $1,050 billion as capex is actually declining on a trended basis.As mentioned at the start this article, neither the P/E which is a bit over 16X based on consensus estimates for the forward 12 months or the EV/S, which is about 3.6X again on a forward 12-month basis is remarkably cheap given the company's current growth rate. The company's projected free cash flow yield of greater than 8% is a significant stand-out in the world of IT equities and provides the company with the opportunity to return significant capital to investors. The company repurchased all of $28 million of shares in the June quarter. Management spoke to a more thorough discussion of its capital allocation program upon the completion of the LOGM spin-merger transaction, but it is highly likely that it will significantly accelerate its share purchase activity based on the comments of the CFO.As mentioned earlier, CTXS shares have more or less matched the IGV since the start of the year despite beating earnings estimates handily and raising guidance by around the amount of an eye-dropper. The shares are not without their scary moments as they declined substantially in the tech wreck that marked the start of this year and in the Brexit fall that came in June. But for the most part, this a GARP story that has the potential to turn into a story with significantly higher growth levels than most investors currently expect. The shares have pulled back about 5% from their high in late August and that seems to be a reasonable entry point. I think there are significant opportunities for substantial positive alpha."
3704666,89576,2015-11-22T11:37:52-05:00,"Citrix Systems is set to spin-off its GoTo product line and cut 1,000 jobs.In absolute terms, the stock looks overvalued, even though it's reasonably priced relative to peers.In our opinion, Citrix will be a much better buy closer to the $60 mark.","Citrix Systems (NASDAQ: CTXS) provides server, application and desktop virtualization, networking, software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud computing technologies. It's consolidating its business at the moment in a downsizing effort to cut off less lucrative product lines. To meet this goal, the company is narrowing its product focus. As part of this consolidation, we can expect Citrix to spin off its GoTo (12-month trailing revenue $600million) product line and we can expect 1,000 job cuts in the near future, with a hope of achieving approximately $200 million in annualized pre-tax cost savings.On the financial side, adjusted EPS was $1.04, an increase of 38%. 3Q/14 revenues were up by 7.2%. The 3Q/15 net income increased by 17.6% when compared to 3Q/14, going from $47.53 million to $55.93 million. Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 58.28% to $259.80 million when compared to 3Q/14 and it has also beat the industry average cash flow growth rate of -10.48%. Citrix improved earnings per share by 20.7% in 3Q/15 compared to 3Q/14.To understand Citrix Systems' prospects as a long-term investment, we need to take a step back and estimate the intrinsic value of the stock based on their ability to generate cash flows. To complement the analysis, we will also asses the relative richness/cheapness of Citrix's ordinary stock compared to their peers.ValuationOur valuation model for Citrix is based on the company's ability to generate cash. The key measure of cash flows that we use is free cash flow, which is the total cash inflow from operations minus the dividends and capital expenditure outlays. This is effectively the amount of ""excess"" cash that the company is making and therefore accruing to its lenders and shareholders.While we do look at historic cash flows, cash flows projections are of crucial importance because markets are forward looking. We start with the analyst consensus free cash flow projections. For our own projection, we assume that the analyst consensus is correct for the next three fiscal years. After that, we assume that the growth rate of cash flows falls back to its previous trend and remains on it for the next seven years, after which it normalizes toward the sustainable rate of 3.9% per annum, based on the average real GDP growth over the last 15 years and the average inflation rate of 2%. The chart below shows the historic (blue line) and projected free cash flows (red line).To calculate the total value of the firm, we discount the projected cash flows and the company's terminal value by its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). Our estimate of cost of debt is 2.19%, based on their interest expense and amount of debt outstanding in the last fiscal year. The cost of equity is calculated using the 10-year Treasury yield as the ""risk-free"" proxy plus the implied equity risk premium of 10.93% times the historic beta of 1.47 for the stock. Some of the other key metrics summarized below:•Beta = 1.47•ERP = 5.98%•Cost of Debt = 2.19%•Cost of equity = 10.93%•Debt to Assets = 24.02%•WACC = 10.10%•Current Price = $78.42•Fair Price = $61.91 (-21.06% return)After discounting the projected free cash flows and the company's terminal value in 10 years' time, we subtract the current value of debt and arrive at the total equity value of 9,726,985, which equates to $61.91 per share. With today's share price at $78.42, re-pricing toward the estimated fair value would result in a return of -21.06%. The green line in the below chart represents the estimated ""fair value"" per share, with the dashed lines showing the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval based on the stock's volatility.From the technical perspective, CTX has not been able to break above the $90 mark for years. In fact, it has been range trading since 2011, between $55 and $80.Relative ValuationAdobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN), CA Incorporated (NASDAQ:CA), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) are the remaining software companies in the S&P 500. The table below can help us understand Citrix Systems' valuation in relative terms.Table 1: Relative Valuation Table, Software in the S&P 500 indexOn a relative basis, Citrix is a mixed bag. Price to earnings is in the upper quartile, while price to cash flow is below median in relation to its peers. Price to book is the median compared to its peers. With ROE in the upper quartile in comparison, the stock looks more favourable than its peers. Beta of 1.47 is in the uneasy upper quartile.The chart above shows that the stock is neither cheap nor expensive on its price to book ratio after taking into account the industry relationship between this multiple and corresponding ROE.ConclusionCitrix operates in a very competitive and fast-changing market segment. In comparison with its peers, the revenue growth came in higher than the industry average of 17.3%. With mixed multiples in our absolute analysis, business restructuring is coming at the right time to even out the variables. In our opinion spinning off its less lucrative business segments should allow for a more a concentrated control and investment in its core business.Despite the company's potential to increase its cash flow through a successful restructuring and reasonable valuation multiples relative to peers, we choose to avoid buying at these levels due to overvaluation based on consensus cash flow and unfavorable technicals. The $60 mark would be an ideal entry point, and we continue to monitor valuations, price action and business fundamentals for Citrix."
3691696,24276,2015-11-17T09:58:43-05:00,"The cloud providers you want to look at sell software support, not hardware.Dell's use of VMware as currency obscures the good outlook for these companies.The fight to go up the stack.","One of the most important investing theses of this decade is that cloud computing primarily benefits the users of the technology, not its makers.Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are primarily users of the technology they are selling. The use of the technology gives them the capital to build it, and they can resell that capacity at a profit.By contrast, hardware companies that supply this technology to cloud operators, like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), have a tougher time. They are stuck with a commodity product. The cloud operators suck it up at the lowest possible price, and cloud reduces demand for it elsewhere.The real ""arms merchants"" in cloud are software companies. They don't do as well as the cloud operators, but they're doing pretty well anyway. Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) is one such company. The stock is up 14% this year. Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) is another. They're up 25%.Many investors are being misled by the action in VMware (NYSE:VMW), which is down 28%. The reason for that fall has nothing to do with its market. It has to do with the fact that it's the currency through which Dell is buying EMC. Financial engineering is killing the stock, not the market.Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst explained all this to me, quite well, a few years ago. Computers are machines, like steam engines. The big revolution of the industrial age was the creation of standard parts, nuts and bolts, parts that could then be used to build trains, planes and automobiles. If you were investing during the industrial revolution, you might have been tempted to bet on the engine market, or even on the parts market. But it was the machines built using those parts that were the revolution - the factories, the transportation systems - that were the revolution.The same is true here. Facebook is a machine. Amazon.Com is a machine. Google is a machine. The essence of the turnaround at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the effort to turn it into a software machine.But the question remains, what happens to the software cloud merchants? The key is moving up the stack, from basic infrastructure (commodity) through platforms (commodities) toward applications (not commodities). The success of Salesforce.Com (NYSE:CRM) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is based on the fact that they produce applications.And that is the difference between Citrix and Red Hat, at least right now. Citrix calls this unit its ""Mobility Apps"" division, and it includes products like Go To Meeting. Red Hat's strategy continues to rely on standards, and open source, the creation of better tools and alliances with tool users such as Microsoft. That may be sub-optimal, but would it make sense for Red Hat to do something that it's not equipped to do? Probably not.My own view is that Red Hat is itching to do a deal, one that will let it retain its autonomy and move up the stack, both with its product line-up and its open organization management style. My assumption had been that the company would eventually be bought by IBM. But Microsoft is now looking more like an ideal partner."
3368995,24276,2015-07-30T10:14:17-04:00,"Citrix shares are bouncing upward after its CEO left and popular products were chosen for a spin-off.Elliott Management is now in charge, with a standstill agreement lasting a year.Can they get more for this cloud laggard than it's presently worth?","Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) got a pop in early trading on Thursday, rising 7% to about $74.50 per share, after CEO Mark Templeton said he would leave and the company would give Elliott Management a seat on its board.The moves were made alongside a decision to spin-off the popular GoTo product line, things like the heavily advertised GoToMeeting shared videoconference service which have in the past been heavily advertised and could be run profitably for another few years with some investment.Citrix also reported earnings of $103 million, 64 cents per share, on revenue of $797 million. The earnings news was practically buried under the restructuring announcements and for good reason. The top line was up only 2% from a year earlier, and the bottom line was helped by a one-time tax benefit amounting to 13 cents per share.Basically, Templeton was saying that he's done all the obvious things Elliott wanted him to do, and he's now out the door, laughing all the way to the bank. The company leadership is a poisoned chalice, because the fact is that Citrix has proven to be a laggard in the all-important cloud market.Citrix came to the cloud out of network management and tried to build a proprietary cloud infrastructure after buying Cloud.Com in 2011, then building a Cloud Platform off that base. The offering was constantly adjusted to support the hot product of the moment, whether that was Xen virtualization or the notion of open source - the Cloud Platform project is now run by the Apache Foundation. For its time it was pretty good stuff.But the fact is that the cloud tools market has consolidated rapidly and that Citrix's offerings are on the outside of that consolidation, looking in. The Amazon Web Services API (NASDAQ:AMZN) has become a de-facto standard in the public cloud, and Open Stack is on its way to becoming one in the area of private cloud. Cloud Foundry drew far more support in the open source platform space from companies like VMware (NYSE:VMW) and Red Hat (NYSE:RHT).Elliott has now agreed to a standstill on its 7.5% stake, lasting a year, and beyond the spin-offs now wants share buybacks and cost cuts that are certain to send the remaining Citrix cloud customers scurrying in the direction of stronger vendors.Paul Singer's guys may want to milk this cow, but they will probably find the udders to be pretty dry after spinning out GoTo. They could try to sell the rest of the company to VMware, IBM (NYSE:IBM) or even Dell, but why should those companies buy something they can kill far more easily? The only way to grow the company's cloud operations is to invest in them, and the Elliott agreement pretty much precludes that when it comes to Citrix.So what you're likely to see from here is the company being rapidly blown-up, sold for parts, and dismantled over the coming year. Maybe Elliott can squeeze more from the pieces than the market currently values the whole at, but technology is not what they specialize in, and a market cap of $11 billion on trailing-year revenues of $3.1 billion sounds like pretty full value, especially when margins are continuing to contract and can easily plunge below zero.Templeton, and more unbiased observers, may enjoy seeing Elliott get burned on this one. I don't personally sell things short, and I'd hate to be on the other side of any trade with Paul Singer, but it's hard for me to call this a long idea, either. If I got this morning's bump on the news, I'd be a seller.Best to call it a popcorn idea - sit back and watch."
3317875,24063,2015-07-11T04:16:42-04:00,Both companies maintain significant investment by hedge funds.Citrix offers a better relative valuation compared to VMware.Elliott’s activist investment could be catalyst for appreciation in Citrix shares.,"By Andrew SebastianSeveral hedge funds had interests in the shares of VMware (NYSE:VMW) as of their latest filings. Scopia Capital was VMW's top shareholder among hedge funds with a new position composed of 1.73 million shares worth about $142 million at VMW's share price as of writing. Joining Scopia in initiating positions in VMW shares were 9 other funds including Visium Asset Management with about 215,000 shares and Bluecrest Capital with 186,000 shares. Discovery Capital had the second largest position in VMW with 1.02 million shares, an increase of 50% over its previous position. Two Sigma Advisors and Marshall Wace followed Discovery with about 957,000 shares and 843,000 shares each, both increases over their previous holdings. Five other funds increased their stakes in VMW as well. Eleven funds reduced their stakes; among them were Highbridge Capital decreasing its stake by 30% and Renaissance Technologies trimming its position by 47%. Highbridge maintained a stake just short of 595,000 shares, and Renaissance had 343,700 shares at last count. Moreover, 7 funds eliminated their stakes in VMW. Zenit Asset Management exited the largest position in VMW shares at 200,000 shares, so the exits were relatively tame compared to the volume of the new positions.We are interested in how funds like Scopia and Highbridge are trading VMW because we found that the most popular large-cap picks of hedge funds underperformed the S&P 500 Total Return Index by seven basis points per month in back-tests (read the details here). VMW is a large-cap stock with a market cap of $35 billion. Contrarily, we discovered that a portfolio of the 15 most popular small-cap picks of hedge funds actually beat the S&P 500 Total Return Index by nearly a percentage point per month on average between 1999 and 2012 - and in forward tests since August 2012, these top small-cap stocks still beat the market by an impressive 84 percentage points, returning over 144%. Now let's compare VMW to Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) to see if it offers good value and can be potentially an exception to what we found.From a valuation standpoint, VMW offers a mixed profile in terms of earnings and cash flow. It currently trades at a trailing P/E of 40 versus 18 for MSFT and 50 for CTXS. All three companies more or less trade at par on a forward P/E basis, however, as VMW has a forward P/E of 20, MSFT 17, and CTXS 18. Looking out even further, VMW trades at a 5-year PEG ratio of 1.1, while MSFT trades at 3.3 and CTXS at 1.4. VMW is the cheapest on a PEG basis, but CTXS is not far behind, so it is tough to say that VMW is the clear buy based on PEG or the other P/E multiples. Turning to cash flow, VMW trades quite higher than both MSFT and CTXS with a P/FCF multiple of 25. MSFT trades at 15 and CTXS at 18. Utilizing analyst estimates of cash flow over the next twelve months, VMW trades at a P/CF of 17.6, while MSFT trades at 11.5 and CTXS trades at 11.7. In light of these cash flow valuation multiples, it seems that VMW may be a little expensive and that CTXS may be the better buy when considering both earnings growth and cash flow.In addition to CTXS's valuation, Paul Singer's Elliott Management took an activist position in CTXS just recently and has been pushing for change at the company believing the company could realize a per share value of $90 to $100 - an increase upwards of 45% over CTXS's current price. Elliott's suggested path to that price range for CTXS includes CTXS buying back 38% of its shares, reining in out of control R&D expenses, and streamlining operations. Elliott may have some help in implementing change at the company as other funds had significant stakes in CTXS as well including Brookside Capital with 3.67 million shares and D. E. Shaw with 1.9 million shares. AQR Capital, Tetrem Capital, and Carlson Capital also had stakes ranging from 1.22 million shares to north of 500,000 shares. With other funds involved, it should increase Elliott's chances of driving change at the company and realizing a higher share price. Thus, with the activist investment and relatively low valuation, now could be a good time to go long on CTXS and realize significant gains in the interim with catalysts on the horizon."
3336815,73145,2015-07-20T21:37:55-04:00,"CTXS has underperformed the Nasdaq Composite Index so far in 2015 due to its slowing growth rate and expensive valuation.CTXS' upcoming earnings report will reveal further weakness in its revenue and margin performance as the company is struggling due to an unfavorable product mix.It remains to be seen whether CTXS' increasing customer base and new products will help it gain traction, otherwise the company's top and bottom line performance will remain under pressure.Despite increasing revenue, CTXS' net income, EBITDA and gross margin have consistently declined over the past few years, raising a red flag for investors concerning the current valuation.","Virtualization and mobility management services provider Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) has turned in a fairly decent performance on the stock market so far this year. Its shares have appreciated over 8% in 2015. But when compared to the Nasdaq Composite Index's gain of over 9% so far this year, it becomes evident that Citrix has underperformed the market.Now, Citrix is slated to release its second quarter results on July 28. Will the company be able to inject some life into its stock price performance after its upcoming results? Let's find out.The expectationsIt is expected that Citrix will deliver top line growth of 1.10% in the second quarter to $790 million. This is not a phenomenal number by any standards considering the company operates in a fast-growing market with a huge end-market opportunity. But, in my opinion, the company should be able to at least meet this target as it has expanded its customer base of late.For instance, in the first quarter, Citrix had 2,200 unique customers compared to 1,900 in the prior-year period. Moreover, the company's launch and adoption of the CloudBridge Virtual WAN Edition should help it bring more customers on board, thereby leading to a top line beat. The reason why I'm optimistic about the increasing adoption of this solution is because it lowers the cost of delivering documents, applications and IT services to branch offices by approximately 80%, while guaranteeing approximately 100% application accessibility.Thus, on the back of the efficiency and cost effectiveness delivered by such products, along with an improving customer base, Citrix should be able to deliver a top line beat.But, as far as the bottom line is concerned, it is expected that earnings will drop from $0.83 per share in the prior-year period to $0.82 per share in the second quarter. Now, this is not surprising, as gross margin has declined consistently in the past five years, as shown below:CTXS Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsThe decline in the company's gross margin is attributable to an adjustment in the product mix. As a result, Citrix's net income in the last-reported quarter had declined to $106 million from $119 million in the prior-year quarter. Now, last quarter, gross margin was 85%, and it expects its gross margin to remain in the 84%-85% range this year. Thus, the drop in earnings is not surprising.All in all, investors can expect Citrix to at least meet expectations in the second quarter, although the company's performance won't be extraordinary. But, is there any chance that Citrix will be able to improve its flagging revenue and earnings performance in the long run? Let's find out.Can Citrix justify its valuation?As mentioned at the beginning of the article, Citrix has underperformed the market this year. For a stock that trades at 51 times last year's earnings, this is not impressive. Additionally, EBITDA and net income have taken a beating of late despite the rise in revenue. This can be seen in the following chart:CTXS Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThus, strong revenue growth has been the only saving grace for Citrix, but as seen above, even this metric is flat-lining. In fact, the company's top line growth has slowed down to a trickle, which will lead to further weakness in its EBITDA and net income. Considering the above chart, it looks like Citrix isn't making the most of the end-market opportunity present. As seen in the chart below, Citrix sees strong growth in its addressable market going forward:Source: Investor presentationIn comparison, Citrix has generated $3.15 billion in revenue in the last 12 months. Hence, the company has a huge addressable market ahead of it, which it is trying to tap by way of its new products. For instance, as already discussed above, Citrix should see an increase in customer volumes with its CloudBridge product. In addition, the company is developing a workspace delivery controller to integrate the functions of WAN virtualization, remote access and application delivery controllers designed on a flexible software-driven architecture.This workspace delivery controller will connect existing networks to futuristic service networks. Moreover, by way of this solution, Citrix will be able to deliver a number of applications on a single network, making it easy for customers to handle various applications. However, the fact that Citrix is seeing a slowdown in growth rates across its various business segments cannot be denied, as shown in the following charts:Source: Investor relationsConclusionFrom the above charts, it is clear why the company's overall revenue growth rate has slowed down in recent quarters. The company's products don't seem to be gaining enough traction, which is why the growth rates in its various segments have dropped. At the same time, the company has a really high valuation of 51 times last year's earnings to justify, which is greater than the industry average of 33.Also, Citrix's bottom line performance is declining on account of a weak margin performance. Thus, in my opinion, investors should stay away from Citrix until and unless its growth rate improves or its valuation comes down, and not get carried away by a decent performance in the upcoming earnings report."
3999580,68855,2016-08-15T11:03:04-04:00,"Most technology companies want to entrench themselves within global enterprise clients.There are many companies with dominant positions within the enterprise solution market, but many offer an overwhelming amount of complex product offerings.Citrix has demonstrated their ability to capture robust adoption with large enterprise clients, maintaining a strong brand image, doing so in secular growth markets.This may be a good time for a large company to move deeply into enterprise solutions with an acquisition of Citrix.Management is ideal for a takeover.","Many large enterprises use legacy products spread across multiple business segments, languages, and countries, making it problematic to switch to new vendors. This is what we call high switching costs. This barrier makes those businesses already entrenched within the business enterprise solution segment that much more valuable to investors.There were a variety of directions we could have gone with searching for the right company within enterprise solutions, but many we often avoid given their complex business structures and often confusing product offerings. This is where we think it is best to begin talking about a smaller to medium sized, yet well-known company called Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS). At an enterprise value of just $13B rankingthebrands.com ranks Citrix 14th in brand image among computer related companies. To put that in perspective for you, SAP (NYSE:SAP) valued at over $100B ranks 15th, and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) currently valued at over $55B came in at 21st. That is quite a divergence when comparing valuation to relevance.Citrix Really Does Have a Dominate Position Within Enterprise SolutionsAs it stands today over 400,000 enterprises large and small rely on Citrix to create better ways for IT, employees, and business to work through virtual meetings, desktops, and global data centers. Their virtualization networking and cloud solutions deliver over 100 million desktops to corporations and help facilitate nearly 75% of internet users each day.Security, Internet Usage, Workforce MobilityThe trend towards secure global internet usage and the shift to a mobile workforce remain strong secular tailwinds for Citrix.Security: Gartner's research highlights that worldwide spending on information security will reach $170 billion by 2020, from $75B in 2015. This helps to prove that interest for secure technology is on the rise, and in our view, those companies with strong brand images have an immediate advantage. It is this demand for security that Citrix will be able to leverage their brand image.Internet Usage: Cisco Systems believes that global IP traffic will increase nearly threefold over the next 5 years. They forecast that from 2015 to 2020 overall IP traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22%. While not a surprise to most, Cisco believes that smartphone traffic will exceed PC traffic by 2020, making secure mobile solutions vital to future success. Citrix offers Citrix XenMobile, which ranks as a leader in the category as per Gartner's 2016 magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites report.Mobile Workforce: Finally, in our view the shift to a mobile workforce is in the mid cycle. According to a new forecast from International Data Corporation (IDC), the U.S. mobile worker population will grow at a steady rate over the next 5 years, increasing from 96 million in 2015 to 105 million mobile workers in 2020. By the end of this forecast period, IDC expects mobile workers will account for nearly 72.3% of the total U.S. workforce.Where Was Citrix at and Where Are They Headed?Source: Avory & CompanyInvestors may think that reporting on the company is high given the general brand image for Citrix. However, a quick scan of SeekingAlpha proves otherwise. We concluded that this is the first analysis on the company since November 2015, therefore we wanted to briefly discuss the current restructuring taking place.On November 17th, 2015 Citrix announced the initial results of its operational review. The decision was to significantly increase their focus on its core enterprise strategy of secure and reliable delivery of applications and data, and consequently build a more scalable, resourceful and therefore more profitable business. The image above displays the organizational structure of the company prior to the restructuring.The biggest announcement made was to spin-off the GoTo family of products into another publicly traded company. As shown in red in the image above, this makes up roughly 20% of revenues and was their main communication business. This difficult decision was made in order to enhance their strategic focus on their core enterprise products for secure and reliable application and data delivery, including XenApp, XenDesktop, XenMobile, ShareFile and NetScaler.The second decision, which is common in restructurings was to realign resources by eliminating about 1,000 full time and contract roles, excluding the effect of spinning off the GoTo business.Citrix and Investors Stand to ProfitTurning to today, the company is beginning to see operational enhancements and increased profitability. Below are the operating profit results from the latest quarter:Source: theMarketMeter.com ; Bloomberg DataThis leverage in margins is not by accident however. This is the combination of both their stated restructuring initiatives. To reiterate, this was a more focused product offering, combined with a leaner more concentrated sales force. Below highlights their revenue per employee provided their most recent available employee data. As shown, Citrix is quickly seeing benefits to their new strategy.Source: theMarketMeter.com ; Bloomberg DataWho Would Want to Buy CitrixThe easy answer is everyone, but not everyone is sitting on $10-20B in cash, making it hard to participate in any type of offering bid. Here are a couple names to think about that could be interested and a brief description on why.Apple (AAPL): Apple recently saw its enterprise segment grow 40% to nearly $25B in 2015. It has taken a great deal of time for Apple to get to this point and this is one of their avenues of future growth. As businesses continue to adopt employee mobility into their overall framework the concept of ""bring your own device"" is often cited. Apple can leverage the employees of those Citrix relationships into future Apple product users. In addition Sharefile, which according to Gartner is the leader in the enterprise file synchronization and sharing space (Dropbox, Box, etc) would be a strong product offering for Apple to securely gather vital business data while maintaining iCloud for consumers.VMware (VMW): There are obvious synergies between Citrix and VMware as they compete on multiple levels. A combination would combine the #1 and #2 mobile solution according to Gartner, and improve their file and sharing solution as it is viewed poorly relative to the peer group. Citrix Sharefile is their fastest growing solution, as it is cheaper than their other products and implementation is much shorter and less complex. Having the #1 solution in the space allows for VMware to further increase their ecosystem.Microsoft: Very similar to Apple, Microsoft can leverage the employees of Citrix relationships into future Microsoft product users. Microsoft has focused on their more mobile friendly solutions like Surface Pro to gain share in the computer/tablet market. In addition Sharefile is a more robust solution to Microsoft's OneDrive.Management Has What It TakesThe entire management team is fairly new to Citrix. The CEO Kirill Tatarinov officially took over in January 2016 following a long standing career at Microsoft. Prior to 2007, he was the leader of the Management and Solutions Division at Microsoft. Following that he became the VP of Microsoft Business Solutions Division from 2007 to 2016. During his tenure he grew the Businesses Solutions Division from $1B to $2B.Executive Chairman Bob Calderoni took a seat on the Citrix board starting in 2014, and became Executive Chairman in 2015. Two interesting aspects of Bob are that he is currently a senior advisor to Silver Lake, a large well known private equity buyout firm. In addition, he was also the CEO of Ariba before selling to SAP in 2014.With this management team at the helm, we think the probability of an acquisition has increased. Bob Calderoni has had successful acquisitions in the recent past, while Kirill is more than familiar with Microsoft and Citrix.ConclusionAcquisitions are hard to forecast as it takes time, resources, and willingness from two parties, the acquirer and the seller. Citrix however is in a good spot for a potential takeover. As illustrated above they are in the early stages of a restructuring. The company is seeing higher revenue per employee, more leverage in margins, and they are focusing more on their core products. The company has a strong brand image along with deep-rooted relationships with key global enterprise businesses. Leveraging both their core product with their relationships, we think it could be beneficial to an outside acquirer to accelerate their move into enterprise business solutions for a premium to the $13B enterprise value. In addition Bob Calderoni has historically been prepared to sell at the right price and has the buyout relationships to gauge interest. Assuming the restructuring continues to move in the right direction, we feel a future acquisition of Citrix should not be a surprise."
3260195,24063,2015-06-15T16:29:30-04:00,Elliott Management bought a 7.1% stake in Citrix.Elliott would like management to lower operating expenses from 63% to 54.5-55% and do a $4.5-5.3 billion dollar buyback.Elliott believes Citrix Systems will trade above $90 a share in 2016 if management follows its proposal.,"By Jay SmithSoftware virtualization company Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) is a laggard in a tech bubble that has left few companies behind. Citrix shares have been flat since 2011, going from the high 70's to $71.91 per share on Friday. Earnings have been equally flat, with the company reporting EPS of $1.87 in 2011, $1.86 in 2012, $1.80 in 2013, and $1.47 in 2014.$26 billion dollar hedge fund Elliott Management wants to change the underperformance. In a letter to Citrix's board of directors on June 11, Elliott Management announced that it has taken a 7.1% stake in the company and called for management to do more to unlock shareholder value.The 7.1% stake in Citrix is a new position for Elliott Management, which held no shares in Citrix at the end of the first quarter. Elliott Management joins Quant hedge funds D.E Shaw and AQR Capital Management as major holders of Citrix. D.E. Shaw owns 1.9 million shares while AQR Capital Management owns 1.2 million shares.Following hedge funds like Elliott Management can generate alpha. Activist hedge funds create their own catalysts and set off self-fulfilling prophecies that increase the value of the companies they target. Because of its activism, Elliott Management has averaged annual returns of 14.6% since inception, substantially better than the S&P 500's performance. Our research shows that the 15 most popular small-cap stocks among hedge funds have outperformed the market by nearly a percentage point per month between 1999 and 2012. We have been forward testing the performance of these stock picks since the end of August 2012. These stocks managed to return more than 132% over the ensuing 2.5 years and outperformed the S&P 500 Index by nearly 80 percentage points.In its letter to management, Elliott Management called for Citrix to focus on its core and cut costs. Elliott wants management to sell off noncore assets such as CloudBridge, ByteMobile, and CloudPlatform, and consider taking bids for GoTo and NetScaler, which Elliott believes could receive accretive bids. Elliott would also like for management to reduce expenses to increase operating margin. Although Citrix has laid off 10% of its workforce in 2015 in a plan that should save $100 million in annual pretax costs, Elliott believes management could do more. After consulting with a team of former C level software execs, industry consultants, and IT specialists, Elliott believes that Citrix could lower operating margin from the current 63% to 54-55% and maintain its revenue growth.Elliott also believes that Citrix should leverage its balance sheet to repurchase shares. Elliott calculates that Citrix could borrow $4.5-$5.3 billion, maintain its investment grade credit rating, and buy back 56-61 million in shares from now to 2017. If Citrix follows Elliott Management's plan, Elliott anticipates that Citrix will make $6.20-$6.70 in EPS in 2017. With a 14.5x-15.5x next twelve month PE ratio, Elliott Management believes that Citrix stock could trade for $90-103.75 per share in 2016.Citrix management has done some cost cutting and share repurchases before, having repurchased 26.1 million shares or 14% of the float in 2014 and cut 10% of its workforce in 2015. Elliott's plan would just be an accelerated version of the existing road map. In its response to Elliott's letter, Citrix management said that they 'are committed to acting in the best interests of all our shareholders' and would evaluate the proposal. Given Elliott's reputation and the substantial underperformance in Citrix shares, we believe that Citrix management will make significant concessions and the stock will likely trade higher in the coming quarters."
3288215,41741,2015-06-28T03:31:18-04:00,Elliott has found another break up opportunity.His EMC battle hasn't gone so well.But this one could go much better.,"Elliott Associates went activist in Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) earlier this month, penning one of its long letters and asking for a split of the company. Elliott owns just 2.3% of Citrix. It believes there's just too many inefficiencies at the companyElliott likes the split or spinoff thesis. A few names Elliott has targeted in the tech space include Riverbed Technologies, Juniper Networks, Informatica, Compuware, Emulex, BMC Software and Brocade Communications. Many of these have ended up as buyouts. Yet, it's hard not to think about Elliott's battle with EMC.Elliott has been pushing EMC to spinoff VMware for close to a year. The activist believes the upside is close to $40 (50% from current levels) if would do the spin. However, EMC has pushed back and shares are flat over the last year. The fund did settle with EMC earlier this year, agreeing to put its push for a split on hold until September.Thus, Elliott has found a new company to push into a split. The idea being that Citrix needs to focus on the core business and get rid of non-core assets like GoToMeeting or NetScaler. By taking its campaign public, the move is a bigger play to get a meeting with the company to be able to outline its plans.The core of Elliott's thesis is that Citrix could get to $100 a share (40% upside from here) in just 18 months. Now, one of Elliott's big theses is that Citrix has been a relative underperformer over the last five years or so.Part of that could be because Citrix is just too complicated, as a business model. Which in many cases can lead to inefficiencies and market discounts. So that's where a split comes into play. There are a few ways to split this thing too.They could spin off Citrix Online, GoToMeeting, NetScaler, etc. or create three separate companies - a virtualization, SaaS and networking company. In that case, you have smaller companies that should theoretically be able to grow faster and expand margins quicker. Many spinoff options could get the stock to between $80 and $90 a share. The best option in terms of rate of return would likely be an outright buyout by private equity, the cleanest and quickest option.Yet, the big idea is that Elliott has learned something from EMC and can push Citrix to consider the split, but put equal emphasis on streamlining operations and management focus. Citrix has been lacking on the operational front, with poor product launches and a high level of R&D spending.Citrix has done some fruitless spending on R&D and other endeavors, which is stretching it thin, such as its foray into mobile, continue push into file sharing while competition remains robust, and its 10-year push to grow GoToMeeting. Meanwhile, its other core products are lagging. An operational overhaul could include a debt raise and buyback in the interim, upwards of $5 billion.Granted, we've never been huge fans of Eliott, but it's worth noting that they are getting better in terms of pushing buyouts with a quicker turnaround. But it still took two years for a Compuware buyout, a year and a half for Riverbed, and Elliott sold out of Emulex before a buyout - ultimately losing money on the investment.Based on how things have been handled at EMC, you have to hope they've learned some lessons with trying to push a cloud computing company into a split. But still, I think it's somewhat telling that Elliott is open to an operationally focused overhaul and not just a buyout or split. The key being that expense reduction should be the focus."
2787165,23471,2014-12-30T05:25:42-05:00,"CTXS is not suitable for Defensive Investors or Enterprising Investors following the ModernGraham approach.
        According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is fairly valued at the present time.
        The market is implying 10.02% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, which is within a margin of safety relative to the rate the company has seen in recent years.","Citrix Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS) has demonstrated stable earnings over the last ten years, a trait that will often attract investors. However, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here is a look at how Citrix Systems Inc. fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.CTXS data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 3/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 2/5Key Data:Balance Sheet - September 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryCitrix Systems Inc. does not pay a dividend.As shown by the data, it is clear that conservative value investors may wish to seek other opportunities. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the low current ratio in combination with the lack of dividend payments and the high PEmg and PB ratios, while the Enterprising Investor has concerns with the high level of debt relative to the current assets along with the lack of dividends. As a result, both investor types would find the company to be too risky to proceed. That said, any investor willing to speculate about the future of the company may go ahead with the next step of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When calculating an estimate of intrinsic value, it is important to consider the historical earnings results along with the market's implied estimate for future growth. Here, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.17 in 2010 to an estimated $2.27 for 2014. This level of demonstrated growth is fairly strong, and is within a margin of safety relative to the market's implied estimate of 10.02%. As a result, the company appears to be fairly valued at the present time."
2935066,76475,2015-02-21T09:40:25-05:00,Citrix has been facing competitive pressure in its most important revenue segments for years.A closer look at the company’s strategic moves seems to suggests that this is not about to change.Citrix remains a poor long-term investment choice.,"I generally tend to be sanguine about the future prospects of tech companies with large exposures to the cloud-centric revenue model. I believe that even old-line software companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) that are making a concerted effort to transition to a cloud model will have a chance to better engage their customers and cross-sell their numerous products. Many investors associate Citrix (NASDAQ: CTXS) with desktop, mobile and server virtualization. Its server virtualization product XenServer competes against the likes of VMware (NYSE: VMW) with its ESX/i, Microsoft with Hyper-V, and Red Hat (NYSE: RHT) with its KVM Hypervisor. To wit, Citrix derives about 60% of its revenue from virtualization products, making it the company's largest revenue segment.Citrix Playing Second Fiddle to Competitors in Key ArenasBut, Citrix has other up and coming businesses as well. The company has a good cloud business that currently accounts for about 19% of its revenue. Citrix has managed to build a SaaS cloud with popular products such as GoToMeeting. The company's cloud grew at an average 12% clip in fiscal 2014, which was considerably faster than the company's 8% topline growth.What I find disconcerting, however, is the fact that Citrix cloud growth rate is just too low compared to pure play SaaS vendors such as Salesforce.com (NYSE CRM), Workday (NYSE: WDAY), Cornerstone OnDemand (NASDAQ: CSOD), NetSuite (YSE: NN).The cloud space in general is growing fast with companies such as Microsoft , Amazon (NASDAQ; AMZN), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) recording strong cloud growthA survey done last year by Cowen and Company analysts ranked Citrix's cloud as the second most popular by enterprises after Azure. You would, therefore, expect much better growth by the cloud than the 12% it recorded.I suspect that one reason that partly explains why Citrix's cloud is underperforming is because it's a niche cloud, and niche clouds usually come with a price to match. For instance, IBM's cloud has for long been classified as a niche cloud and was until recently considerably pricier than the leading cloud services. Consequently, the cloud grew slower than Azure and AWS. But, IBM joined the cloud pricing wars last year and has seen its cloud growth accelerate--the cloud is now the second-fastest growing after Azure.Rackspace Hosting (NYSE: RAX) is another niche cloud player. Rackspace offers managed cloud services characterized by intense customer support. The company supports all types of users ranging from technical users to businesses. Rackspace's cloud business had for some time been floundering due to its IaaS businesses which was unable to compete with deep-pocketed rivals such as Azure and AWS, each with large IaaS components. Yet, the cloud still managed to crank out 20% growth last year. It's therefore hard to make the case that Citrix cloud is growing much slower than those of its peers simply because it's a niche cloud. Citrix's cloud growth is way below the market average for SaaS companies.Now let's turn out attention to server virtualization, one of Citrix's revenue drivers. Citrix has been facing serious competitive pressure in the server virtualization arena. VMware is ranked as the leader in the space, followed by Microsoft, Red Hat and Citrix in that order.Looking at Citrix virtualization revenues tells the whole story. Citrix's virtualization revenues have been growing at around 3%-5% for some time now (just 4% during the last quarter). This can partly be attributed to the IT trend towards convergence and hyper-convergence. Hyper-converged systems combine server, network and storage systems, which offers better value proposition to customers than siloed systems. A good example is VCE's vBlocks wherein VMware vSphere supplies the server, Cisco supplies the network and EMC supplies the storage. vBlocks have been growing at a 40%+ clip, much faster than the server virtualization market growth of around 15%.An organization known as Virtualization Matrix tries to gauge the overall completeness of the features of each of the leading hypervisors. Here is how it ranks the four hypervisors:Citrix's XenServer ranks well below the other three. Citrix's share of the market has as a result remained quite low. To make matters worse, the company is steadily losing market share considering that its server virtualization license revenues are growing much slower than those of its rivals.Source: IT CandorXenServer is available for free since it runs on an Open Source platform. There is, however, a commercial version that sells for $500 per socket per annum or $1,250 per socket for a perpetual license. Red Hat is luckier than Citrix in this regard because even though KVM also runs on Open Source Linux, the company bundles it with new RHEV subscriptions. This strategy works pretty well for Red Hat judging by its 18% growth in new RHEV licenses compared to -1% for XenServer last quarter. Red Hat derives about 85% of its revenue from server virtualization.VMware's good top line growth can partly be chalked up to its stake in VCE where vBlocks are doing so well. Citrix's virtualization revenues growth is well below those of its contemporaries even after adjusting for these factors.The notion that XenDesktop could be headed for oblivion could turn out to be well justified, when you consider that the company tentatively said during its last earnings call that it was going to drop VDI-in-a-Box. When the company acquired Kaviza in 2011, it appeared like a very strategic move to extend its desktop virtualization business by using the Kaviza's VDI-in-a-Box and its grid-like architecture that is based on virtual appliances. That would have streamlined Citrix's rather cumbersome XenDesktop product. But, four years later, Citrix has done nothing to leverage VDI-in-a-Box to improve XenDesktop. It, therefore, appears that the company's main strategy when making the acquisition was as a defensive move to prevent a competitor from picking it up.Deep restructuring--good but not nearly enoughCitrix announced during its latest earnings call that it was going to cut off 700 full-time workers and 200 contractor positions as it tries to improve its operational efficiency. The company said that this will result in cost savings of about $90 million-$100 million every year. I'm sure this will help to enhance its bottom line. But, you can only go so far with cost cutting when your top line growth continues to languish.ConclusionAll these trends have been badly impinging on Citrix's top line growth. The fact that the company issued revenue guidance for the current fiscal year that implies it expects to grow its top line at just 4%-6%, considerably lower than the 8% growth recorded in 2014, does not help to allay investor concerns about its sluggish growth. Barron's intoned in an article late last year that Citrix could be a good investment because the company together with VMware and Red Hat give ''the best cash returns on investment,'' noting that the market was likely to start focusing more on cash flow growth as revenue growth for companies in this space continues to slow down. But, in a tossup between Citrix, VMware and Red Hat, I would rather pick the latter two any day. Citrix shares might perform well on the basis of cost-cutting and maybe even good FCF growth over the short-term, but I find it hard to believe that this kind of momentum can be maintained over the long-term as the company continues to record anemic top line growth. Long-term Citrix investors are more likely to see their returns follow the path displayed in the graph below.Citrix 5-Year Share ReturnsSource: CNN.com"
2644295,54222,2014-11-05T15:08:12-05:00,"Citrix Systems has lost steam in the past three months as the company's bottom line performance has been weak.Citrix, however, is moving forward impressively to tap the fast-growing virtualization market by enhancing its product portfolio.Citrix is landing more deals as its customer base grows, while increasing cross-selling opportunities by integrating its products.","The last three months have been difficult for Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS). The provider of virtualization and cloud networking solutions has seen its stock price drop by roughly 6%. Given the company's relatively weak financial performance, this should not come as a surprise. In fact, Citrix saw a massive 38% year-over-year drop in profit in its recently reported third quarter. But, at the same time, the company raised its outlook for the full year, which indicates it expects the business to improve going forward.Tapping a big opportunity with product improvementsThe virtualization market is a fast-growing one. In fact, according to SNS Research, the market will be worth $4 billion by the end of the year, and grow at a 60% clip, each year, for the next six years. To tap this fast-growing market, Citrix is aggressively introducing new products.For example, Citrix recently launched the Citrix Workspace Suite. This solution combines data, desktop, services, and apps under a single licensing agreement. It is primarily crafted for large, mid-market, and worldwide enterprises. The introduction of this workspace suite is expected to accelerate account penetration, enhance revenue per customer, and solidify the company's position in a competitive marketplace.Citrix has also launched Version 7.6 of XenDesktop and XenApp with an enhanced user experience, better security and superior performance. This should allow its customers to address complex computing and intensive graphics requirements. Crucially, Citrix has also released migration tools for these new versions, making it simpler for customers to shift XenDesktop and XenApp to Windows Server 2012.Citrix is also witnessing considerable expansion in test downloads, with customers and partners initiating migration through its rollout plans. For example, XenMobile 9 is expected to be a landmark introduction that eases user experience and strengthens security. Citrix is also replacing its MDM-centered offerings with a better user experience, along with strong data security and highly integrated mobility apps.The company has also crafted an extensive plan for its workspace services business. This plan has been designed to allow simplicity, high speed, and magnitude for medium and large enterprises. Citrix is also keen on delivering the industry's most sophisticated solution for mobile services, along with accelerating growth for Citrix service providers.Additionally, Citrix is focused on speeding up delivery networking, developing key partnerships by leveraging OEM products and technical integrations. Citrix is also developing its market capacity through innovative networking center channels. The roadmap for its product line is primarily focused on multiple areas that include higher configuration and security combinations. Thus, Citrix is targeting the high value market with its products and workspace services such as XenDesktop, XenApp, and XenMobile.The company is also making improvements to its product line for enabling video caching and allowing auto-configured multi-site cloud bridge, along with multi-cloud offerings of XenDesktop, XenApp, XenMobile. It is also using WAN links and making improvements to enhance the NetScaler opportunity in carrier networks.Gaining more customersIt is clear that Citrix is working hard to improve its product lines. Now, the good thing is that its customers are recognizing the company's efforts and buying its products across different verticals such as legal, medical and financial.For instance, Citrix's integrated XenMobile service secured two multi-million dollar deals in the third quarter. The company witnessed strong traction in the EMEA market and is planning to enhance its document sharing capabilities. Citrix will focus on expert electronic document signing, reducing time and money by adopting paperless technologies where legal obligation documents are frequently exchanged. This is expected to enhance the revenue of ShareFile, opening fresh opportunities for acquiring new customers and further building its package of mobile productivity.Citrix continues to add features to its GoToMeeting product, such as new HD audio and a virtual whiteboard, along with quicker ad-hoc meetings. In the third quarter, Citrix launched an innovative freemium version of GoToMeeting, and added integrations with XenMobile Worx Apps and ShareFile. These initiatives are directed toward allowing accelerated customer acquisition, higher retention rates, and differentiating itself competitively. Going forward, Citrix targets on expanding its mobile app range.ConclusionClearly, Citrix is moving in the right direction by focusing on product innovation. This has allowed the company to land more customers, and gain additional business from existing customers. For example, Citrix's strong product integration efforts resulted in the inflow of more than 525 virtualization orders last quarter. It dealt with more than 2,200 varied customers during the period as compared to nearly 1,900 last year, and the increase was driven by both cross selling moves and new customers.The focus on improving its product portfolio should allow Citrix to land more customers and increase its sales opportunities. As such, investors need to look beyond the recent sales drop at Citrix and focus on its long-term prospects as the company looks well positioned to benefit from growth in virtualization."
2507535,71765,2014-09-19T11:54:31-04:00,"Citrix is a company operating in a highly competitive environment against giants like Microsoft. Owing to this, there are certain risks associated with its stock.Citrix has around $1.6 billion in cash reserves, about $8.50 per share.The company managed to achieve revenue growth of 7% at $782 million as compared to $730 million in the second quarter of 2013.The company’s subscription business, which now has over 400k users, was the strongest point in the segment.","When it comes to the world of software developers, there are a few large players who always compete with each other. Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) is one such prominent name, but a number of factors have led to the continuous decrease in its stock's value. The fact that it competes with giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) makes it difficult for the company to maintain a very high stock value. There are multiple factors that have been affecting the company's stock. What is affecting the company's stock even though it is neither in a weak financial position nor a small player in the market? What are the factors that have been contributing positively toward the value of the stock? Let's take a look.Citrix has around $1.6 billion in cash reserves, about $8.50 per share. Ideally, this should act as a factor to encourage investors to find the stock more attractive. However, in reality, the opposite has been happening. In 2013, the stock fell by 22% even though the S&P 500 index increased by 20%. In the present year, the company's stock has managed to fall down by 11% which is a lot as compared to a mere 1% drop in the index. The main reason behind the most recent drop is the fact that the company reported weak earnings in late January, which adversely affected its stock's value. However, the stock has been recommended as a top stock to buy for 2014. The consensus target price for the stock is $70.In late January, the company reported weak earnings, but in November 2013 the company managed to surpass all expectations associated with it for 2013. The main reason was that the company managed to operate effectively in a competitive environment in a market that was impacted by adverse global economic conditions. In terms of the stock, its massive share buyback plan worth $500 million approved by the company's board of directors was a huge step. The plan was an effective approach to deal with the falling value of the stock. With a fewer company shares available in the market, the basic principles of demand and supply would kick in and the company's stock would appreciate in terms of value.A 10% increase in revenue also is expected for the company in 2014 because its management has started to focus on the core offerings, XenApp and XenDesktop. This will allow the company to not only increase its revenues but will also lead to an increase in the stock's value.Currently, the stock is undervalued at around 28%. In January 2014, JPMorgan & Chase gave Citrix Co a status of ""hold"" owing to the fact that the company had not managed to perform well. However, with the current expectations from the company and its new management plans, it can be expected that the company's financial performance will significantly improve and keeping the fact that currently the stock is undervalued, it can be said that buying the stock can be a good decision as the stock will improve in the future. As a result, those investing in the company at present can benefit from the stock.The company has managed to perform fairly well in the second quarter of 2014. The company managed to achieve revenue growth of 7% at $782 million as compared to $730 million in the second quarter of 2013. Its second quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.31 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.83. This hike is attributed to cost-control measures undertaken by the company. The company repurchased 20.8 million shares in Q2 2014. In addition, the company's expected revenue growth for 2014 is somewhere between 8.5%-10%, which is close to the 9.4% consensus. However, the expected EPS is $3.20-$3.25 per share, which is higher than the $3.0 consensus. The company's network and cloud sales, including its NetScaler application delivery controllers, grew by 9% in Q2 to $179 million. At the same time, SaaS/cloud sales rose by 12% to $16 million, 60% of which are attributed to communication products such as GoToMeeting. However, its core mobile and desktop business which includes PC/app virtualization and MDM offerings only rose by 4% to $396 million due to fierce competition from VMware (NASDAQ: VMW). The company's subscription business, which now has over 400k users, was the strongest point in the segment.For the third quarter, the company expects non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.70 to $0.73 and revenues in the range of $765-$775 million. However, analysts expect EPS to be $0.76 and revenues to be $785.80 million.It should be noted that the company does not have a dividend history, which basically means that investing in the company can only be beneficial if the stock's value increases. Otherwise, it is a highly risky stock for putting money in, as the only returns in this case are gains from changes in the stock's value.In short, Citrix is a company operating in a highly competitive environment against giants like Microsoft. Owing to this, there are certain risks associated with its stock. The stock's value has been declining lately and at present it is undervalued. However, if future expectations are met, the company's stock can see an increase in its value. The main risk associated here is the fact that lately the company has not managed to show strong results, so future prospects for the company remain bleak. It is true that the company has some new plans that may allow it to grow significantly if they are implemented effectively. However, JPMorgan's recommendation to put the stock on hold makes sense, as there is a lot of uncertainty associated with the stock at the moment."
2211613,48501,2014-05-12T11:59:46-04:00,Citrix's core growth story remains intact with a strong product refresh heading into the channel.The accelerated share repurchase program should help drive the share price higher.Citrix continues to trade about 30% below its intrinsic value.,"Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS), the provider of the go-to-meeting application, reported solid first quarter results as revenues came in better than I expected, but management issued second quarter guidance that is below my expectation. Also, the firm announced a significant debt offering that will lower the cost of capital for the firm. I have been advocating a debt issuance as a way to boost the share price for a few quarters, so it is good to see the note offering being made.Also, management recently announced the 2014 product roadmap that includes refreshes to the company's core offerings with updated feature sets. That should help drive results through the back half of the fiscal year and could be responsible for some of the weakness forecasted for the second quarter. So, the two main stories for this year are the product refresh and the substantial share repurchase program.I firmly believe that the combination of these two stories will act as a catalyst to drive shares to their intrinsic value of $79.50.Recent DevelopmentsAnalyst's NoteCitrix Systems designs, develops and markets technology products and services that enable information technology to be delivered securely on demand, regardless of location, device or network.During the first quarter, revenues increased at a faster pace (12%) than I'm forecasting for the full year (10%), with management guiding towards 5.5% revenues growth in the second quarter. GAAP net income is expected to come in well below my initial forecast for the full year, as I was expecting an operating margin of 11% and management is running the business at 9-10%. But I expect profitability margin expansion during the rest of the year as management adjusts operating expenses to meet their diluted EPS forecast. Also, my EPS forecasts are adjusted as a result of the reduction in outstanding shares that emanates from the share repurchase program.As Citrix gains scale, management seems committed to reducing the re-investment of revenues into operations. Without guidance from management, the operating margin is expected to rise to the mid-to-high 20s as the company matures. The increased operating margin may come from a 1000 basis point reduction in SG&A expenditure as a percentage of revenues.NetScaler is growing at an above corporate rate as cloud and networking become a larger portion of consolidated sales, but professional services, cloud and networking have a below corporate average gross margin profile. The consolidated gross margin in expected to settle in the low 80s to high 70s in the coming fiscal years.Citrix issued between $1.25 and $1.44 billion of convertible senior notes. The notes mature on April 15, 2019 with a final conversion date of October 15, 2018. The conversion price estimate is $90, which represents a $30 per share market conversion premium. Given the favorable income differential per share of $0.45, the premium payback period is 66 years. The estimated potential dilution could be 129.33 million shares, but some of the potential dilution has been offset.Aside from repurchasing shares, it is likely that management will continue use excess cash to make strategic acquisitions. The firm has an increasing stockpile of long-term investments that is reaching $1 billion and almost $1 billion in cash and marketable securities. The SaaS division could be the beneficiary of incremental investments based on the company's recent acquisition history.For the full year, I'm expecting cash flow from operations of $1.03 billion with free cash flow to the firm of $842 million. Free cash flow to equity is expected to be $2.28 billion of which $1.5 billion will be used to repurchase shares. The return on equity for the full year is expected to be the same as the cost of equity.General RisksThis section does not discuss all risks related to an investment in CTXS.Portfolio & ValuationCitrix is in a bear market of primary degree, but there appears to be significant support at the $50 per share level. That suggests to me that there are relatively large funds accumulating shares in the $50-60 zone. Additionally, management is planning to support the share price with a significant share repurchase program.The intrinsic value of the firm is estimated based on the fundamentals of the business. Citrix is currently 32% undervalued based on the estimated value. The share repurchase program is expected to decrease the price-based valuation multiples; consequently, at $79.47 per share, CTXS would be valued at 3.55 times the forecasted year-end book value.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2161713,62713,2014-04-24T13:27:41-04:00,"The majority of analysts (56%) rate Citrix as a buy, with a median price target of $65.Citrix has staked its claim for a strong portion of the cloud/virtualization market going forward.I project the stock to reach $70 in the next 12 months, on the basis of continued earnings and free cash flow growth.","In the tech sector, the market sometimes takes a ""who cares"" attitude whenever the word ""valuation"" is raised. This is regardless of the logic value investors may present. While enterprise software vendor Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) has been a dominant force in the virtualization/cloud industry, the stock has struggled amid growing concerns of weak enterprise spending, including a 40% decline over the past two years. For that matter, rivals VMware (NYSE:VMW) and Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) have not fared any better.Given how this sector often trades in tandem, investors automatically assumed that the struggles of one company will immediately translate to the other. While the cloud and virtualization market appears to be doing performing moderately better, enterprise spending still has not returned to their robust levels. The question is, when things do get better, which company stands to outperform its peers. On Wednesday, Citrix made that answer a little easier.The company reported first-quarter revenue and earnings per share that topped analysts' expectations. For the quarter ending in March, Citrix posted revenue of $750.8 million, which jumped roughly 12% year-over-year. Ahead of the report, analysts had been modeling for revenue of $733 million. This continues the company's streak of double-digit revenue growth that now spans five consecutive quarters. Equally impressive, during that span, revenue has increased by an average of 16%, including a 19% surge in the January quarter.Also impressive was the fact that Citrix grew revenue from license updates by double-digits. This means that the company has a healthy pipeline of recurring business; an advantage that can help Citrix offset the type of near-term headwinds that VMware and/or Red Hat may experience.In terms of profits, Citrix delivered earnings per share of 64 cents, which beats analysts' estimates by more than 8%. Analysts were looking for 59 cents per share. It seems the Street had underestimated the company. Estimates had fallen ahead of the report. As with the company's strong revenue streak, Citrix has seen its net income grow by an average of 22% over the past four quarters. So it's a little surprising that the stock has performed so horribly. But things are about to change.For the current quarter, the company guided for revenue in a range of $765 million to $775 million, and earnings per share of 57 cents to 59 cents. While these figures are lower than what analysts had hoped (est. $785 million and 67 cents), the numbers do signal that the worst is over. Because for the full year, the company raised its outlook to a range of $2.90 to $2.95 per share, up from a prior guidance of $2.85 to $2.95 per share. That is above consensus for $2.91 per share.While these numbers aren't exactly breathtaking, on a relative basis, they are a strong beat. This also addresses my earlier question. As much as I like all three companies, there will come a point when the market decides it no longer can support all three names, due to saturation. It happens in every industry. From my vantage point, Citrix has staked its claim for a strong portion of the market going forward.This does not mean that VMware and Red Hat should pack up their tents. The real winner won't be decided for (at least) two more years. But given Citrix's partnership with (among others) Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), it's tough to bet against the enterprise advantages this presents. This now makes Citrix an interesting stock to follow.The majority of analysts (56%) rate Citrix as a buy, with a median price target of $65. The high price target is $85, which I consider a bit too aggressive. There are still unanswered questions that need to be considered, not the least of which has to with the projected growth of the cloud/virtualization market. Not only is that industry still in transition, IT managers will need to decide how much of a priority virtualization will remain. What is clear, however, is that Citrix will not leave it up to chance. And I project the stock to reach $70 in the next 12 months, on the basis of continued earnings and free cash flow growth.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Wall Street Playbook's tech sector analyst.

However, Citrix revenue growth has slowed to 9.2% in 2014.In order to increase growth, management has entered the desktop as a service and enterprise mobile management market. These markets are expected to grow rapidly and are attracting significant competition.Citrix will have to grow revenue in two intensely competitive markets without a significant advantage.The EMM and DAAS markets are expected to grow rapidly but several competitors have an advantage over Citrix and their current product offerings.Several new competitors don't have a great product offering but have the expertise and resources to quickly refine and fix them.","Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS) is a technology company specializing in digital collaboration tools, virtualized environments, mobile and desktop management. Management has been able to grow revenue double digits over the last several years. From 2009-2013, revenue grew at a CAGR of 16.0%. The company's double digit revenue growth has resulted in net income growing at a CAGR of 15.5% over the same period. However, Citrix's growth has slowed down considerably in 2014. Revenue grew 9.2% y/y in the first half and only 7.0% y/y in Q2. The slowdown in growth has resulted in net income falling 12.2% y/y for the first half. In order to speed up growth, management has been trying to establish a foothold in the enterprise mobile management or EMM market. They started this process with the introduction of XenMobile in 2013. Citrix is in the early stages of their mobile efforts but mobile will be an important piece of future growth. Along with their mobile efforts, Citrix has XenDesktop and XenApp which are used to serve the desktop as a service or DAAS market. Management is leveraging their knowledge of server virtualization to expand into these emerging markets. The XenMobile, XenAPP, and XenDesktop solutions are needed to help drive future growth.Citrix product sales are vital to the company's other operating segments. The company's maintenance, updates, and professional services segments all benefit from increased product sales. Although, product and license sales represent only 28.7% of revenue. Product and license sales increase demand for professional services (5.5% of revenue) and license update and maintenance revenue (45.1% of revenue). The company sells a wide selection of products but management believes their XenDesktop, XenApp, and XenMobile are going to drive future growth. Investors appear to feel the same way. Although Citrix stock is down 4.1% from a year ago, the stock is up 10.25% YTD. Investors have been encouraged by management's growth plan and their recent increase in full year EPS guidance. Management believes XenDesktop, XenApp, and XenMobile will drive revenue but both the DAAS market and EMM market are becoming very competitive. These new market competitors will make it very difficult for Citrix to gain and maintain market share. The DAAS and EMM market are getting more competitive due to the current state of the virtualization server market.Expanding Out Of The Server MarketCitrix used to occupy the second position in the server virtualization market. However over the years, they have relinquished their second place spot to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The virtualization market has always been a battle for second place because VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW) has been able to establish and hold a dominate market share. Since entering the market, VMware was quickly able to capture nearly the entire market but has since lost market share. Although, the IDC estimates VMware still holds a 60% market share. Microsoft is second with an estimated 28% market share. Microsoft has been stealing market share from both VMware and Citrix. Microsoft has been able to steal market share because of its significantly improved product offering. As Microsoft's product improved, Citrix started to lose market share because their product was lagging behind. Additionally, Citrix's market share has been impacted by open source virtualization products which have become nearly as good.As a result of their subpar product offering, Gartner has moved Citrix out of the virtualization server leadership quadrant and into the niche player quadrant. VMware and Microsoft are the only two companies in the leadership quadrant. Although, Citrix's management claims they aren't giving up on the server virtualization market. Their market share has declined to the low single digits. Additionally in 2013, Citrix management decided to give their XenServer source code to the open source community. Citrix's declining market share has forced them to seek profits elsewhere. This is why Citrix is focusing on the DAAS and EMM markets. The same competitive forces and slowing market growth have also pushed Microsoft and VMware to look elsewhere for significant growth. As a result, VMware and Microsoft have followed Citrix into the DAAS and EMM markets.Desktop As A Service Emerging But Very CompetitiveThere is rising demand for virtualized desktops according to Forrester Research. In 2013, 11% of survey participants said they would implement a DAAS solution in less than a year. This is up from 5% in 2011. DAAS has the potential to be a multibillion dollar a year industry. Gartner estimates the market for 3rd party maintenance and management of desktops was $30 billion as of 2013. These 3rd party managers use local management rather than an implementation in the cloud or a hosted solution. However, this shows there is significant demand for maintenance and management solutions. Additionally, 451 Group estimates the desktop virtualization ecosystem market will reach $5.6 billion by 2016. Yet, the desktop virtualization ecosystem market does include infrastructure and non-related DAAS services. The potential size of the DAAS market can be in the billions but even Citrix admits the market adoption rate is difficult to estimate. Yet despite the unknown market adoption and size, there has been a flood of competition entering the market.Citrix uses their XenDesktop, XenApp, and XenMobile product to create a virtualized desktop for any device. As of Q2 2014, the company is servicing 400,000 users. The 400,000 users represent a sequential growth of 11% from Q1 2014. The DAAS industry is small but growing rapidly and has the potential to be a multibillion dollar a year industry. This is why there has been a rapid increase in competition. VMware acquired Desktone, a DAAS solution provider, at the end of 2013. VMware has already partnered with Google, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to deliver a DAAS solution for Chromebooks. VMware is also directly targeting Citrix's customers with their vendor switching campaign. Microsoft has a product called Azure RemoteApp which works like a DAAS solution but they don't have a true DAAS solution. However, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has entered the DAAS market and is already proclaiming to have the lowest priced DAAS solution. The DAAS market is getting more competitive. Citrix is going to be dealing with an intensely competitive market environment which they have already experienced some issues in. On the Q2 conference call, David J. Henshall CFO stated ""We are also working to address the issues that have impacted overall revenue growth within the desktop and apps part of this business.""The DAAS industry has the potential to be a multibillion dollar a year industry. Citrix is depending on the segment to generate significant revenue growth. Yet, new competitors like VMware and Amazon will make it very difficult. Amazon is already claiming to have the cheapest DAAS system which should keep pressure on prices. VMware should be able to leverage its server virtualization knowledge to help create a great DAAS solution. Additionally, VMware is moving aggressively and specifically targeting Citrix's customers. The DAAS market segment will be tough to gain and maintain market share.Mobile PushOn the Q2 conference call, David J. Henshall CFO stated ""Throughout the first half of the year, we continued our pivot towards mobile, recognizing that customers are looking for better ways to embrace mobility and leverage the full power of cloud infrastructure."" Citrix's XenMobile is a mobile device management or MDM solution. A mobile device management solution helps companies better secure and manage employee's work phones. The rapid increase in smartphones has resulted in more employees using work related applications on their own phone. Although the market is expected to grow rapidly, the MDM market has experienced significant price deflation over the last three years.Product prices in the MDM market have been more than cut in half. In 2010, the product price for one device could be $60 or as high as $150 but in 2013 the price has fallen to about $30, according to Gartner. The rapid commoditization of MDM products has forced vendors to offer a more complete solution. Citrix and other vendors now offer an EMM solution which can be a combination of MDM and a mobile application management or MAM solution. A MAM solution simply allows companies to better control access to their applications and data. Citrix has seen more demand for their combined product offering than each individual solution. On the Q2 conference call, David J. Henshall stated ""Similar to the last few quarters, 80% of our mobile platform customers have opted for this complete solution, demonstrating the value of our integrated offerings versus stand-alone MDM technologies."" Fortunately, the EMM industry is expected to grow rapidly. The Radicati Group, Inc. estimates the EMM industry will grow 320.9% from $1.3 billion in 2014 to $5.7 in 2018. Additionally, the industry isn't currently experiencing significant pricing pressure but that could change with the increase in competition.Microsoft entered the EMM market but with a weak offering. In fact, Microsoft failed to make Gartner's magic quadrant for EMM vendors due to their subpar offering. Yet, VMware bought AirWatch which ranks high for its EMM solution. Citrix will struggle with the increased competition because of their average EMM solution. Gartner ranked the best EMM offerings by product/service and use case. Citrix's average score for product/service was only good enough for 4th place and they placed 5th for use case. AirWatch had the highest average score for both product/service and use case. Citrix needs the mobile market to help reverse their slowing revenue growth but their current product offering doesn't give them a competitive advantage. Additionally, new competitors like VMware have a superior product and the expertise to compete fiercely with Citrix. Along with the DAAS market, Citrix is facing a very competitive market without a significant competitive advantage.Citrix Tough Road AheadManagement has been able to grow revenue in the double digits over the last several years. However so far in 2014, revenue growth has slowed to 9.2% y/y and was even slower for Q2 (7.0%). Management has been looking for a way to increase their growth rate. As a result, they entered the DAAS and EMM market over the last several years. Management believes their XenDesktop, XenApp, and XenMobile solutions will drive revenue growth. Yet, the DAAS and EMM markets have become very competitive and will require a significant competitive advantage. Citrix doesn't have a significant competitive advantage in either market. Additionally, new entrants like VMware and Microsoft should be able to leverage their virtualization expertise in the EMM and DAAS market.These two competitors forced Citrix to look outside of the server virtualization market. Citrix naturally turned to the DAAS and EMM markets for growth. This is because the DAAS and EMM markets are similar in nature to the server virtualization market. The rapid expected growth and similar requirements have attracted the leading virtualization market participants to enter the DAAS and EMM market. This doesn't mean they will be able to quickly gain market share but they will greatly increase the competitive environment. Additionally, these two companies have acquired a significant amount of knowledge which will translate well in these new markets. Lastly, Amazon's entry into the DAAS market should put significant pricing pressure on the entire market segment. They are focused on delivering a quality product for the lowest possible price.Citrix's revenue growth has slowed and they need to increase their growth rate. The DAAS and EMM markets offer great potential for growth but this has attracted significant competition. Citrix's total revenue growth is dependent on product and license sales. Yet, XenDesktop, XenApp, and XenMobile will have a tough time gaining and maintaining market share in the DAAS and EMM market segments."

During the period, profit declined relative to the year-ago quarter, but that was a non-core Citrix story; core Citrix performance was rock solid.CTXS data by YChartsBut, the Citrix story is not a ""bed of roses"" as I attribute declining profitability to competitive pressures.That said, at this valuation, given the industry, company, and economic growth rates, I'm bullish on Citrix. Tactically, the market is still trending lower, but there are early signs of accumulation.Recent DevelopmentsFundamental AnalysisDuring the most recent quarter, total operating expenses grew in line with total net revenues as both were up 11% relative to the year-ago quarter.The increase in total operating expenses was largely driven by an increase in sales, marketing, and services expenditure and to a lesser extent driven by an increase in research and development expenditure.Increased total net revenues were driven by license updates and maintenance, and software as a service. While its contribution to total net revenues growth was smaller, products and licenses revenue growth of 3% was solid.The 2% decline in net income is attributable to the decline in other income, net, which is not part of core Citrix.Management plans to significantly accelerate the share repurchases in calendar 2013 Q4, which will have an adverse impact on assets and shareholders' equity and is value neutral unless management repurchases shares above the market price. The book value per share should decrease, which would increase the price/book ratio, and the earnings per share would increase, which would decrease the price/earnings ratio. Citrix has been repurchasing shares for more than 5 years now; consequently, the share repurchases do not have substantial valuation implications for the 5-year average multiplier model valuations.Goodwill represents 34.4% of total assets and about 50% of total shareholders' equity.The impact of recent acquisitions on the results of operations has been accretive.Also, Citrix is showing growth of positive cash flows from operations, which is a bullish indicator.Lastly, management is predicting sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in the calendar fourth quarter.Overall, these fundamentals appear bullish, but the trend of profitability margins is a cause for concern and suggest competitive pressures may be weighing on the results of operations.Portfolio ManagementThe share price of Citrix is in a bear market of primary and intermediate term degree. This has helped the share price enter my buy zone, which is below $61 per share. With the bear market having begun in 2011, I expect Citrix's next primary degree bull market to begin at any moment. With that said, the tactical perspective of the situation tempers my optimism as the bear market of intermediate-term degree continues.In terms of valuations, on an absolute basis, 4 times sales for mid-teens growth does provide me with some upside potential. On a time series basis, Citrix is undervalued.CTXS Price to Book Value data by YChartsIn the previous report, I estimated the intrinsic value of Citrix as $70.25 per share; I'm lowering the estimate to $69 per share. This estimate is based on the historic average valuations.Given the current share price, I would be looking at about 20% upside potential using the intrinsic value.Using statistical techniques, the 52-week price target is $89.33 per share, which is above the current intrinsic value.Since March 2009, the monthly compound rate of return is 1.8%; that is an excellent rate of return.The return distribution is positively skewed and is not leptokurtic; both are positive indications.In summary, Citrix is a growth stock that is undervalued and is in my buy zone; all that is left to do is to tactically execute the long investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1902741,48501,2013-12-17T10:51:19-05:00,,"Citrix Systems' (NASDAQ:CTXS) third-quarter results were consistent with management's Oct. 9 revenue warning; total revenue increased 11% to $713M. As a result of the disappointing quarter, the share price has languished at about $58 since the last report. With that factored into my valuation, I'm maintaining my bullish disposition toward Citrix and reiterating my intrinsic value of $69 per share.CTXS data by YChartsWhile in my experience doing this is uncommon, I have a preference for estimating the wealth creation of the company during the year. For calendar 2013, I estimate that Citrix has an equity charge of $1.57 per share. Management is expected to create wealth for investors during this calendar year, but the increase is about 3% of the current share price.The relatively low level of wealth creation stems from weakness in the sales of Citrix's two key product offerings, XenDesktop and XenApp. But sales of NetScaler and XenMobile are picking up. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW) should continue to adversely impact sales of XenDesktop and XenApp in calendar 2014, but I expect continued uptake of the NetScaler and XenMobile solutions.FundamentalsCitrix has a core objective of allowing the individual to be productive on any device, any network, and from any location. To reach that objective, the company provides tools that enable IT, and networking solutions that enhance the delivery. So, think of the key areas as desktop, app and device, networking, collaboration, and CloudPlatform.XenMobile enables and simplifies the utilization of mobile devices for increasingly complex work-related endeavors while maintaining the security of the devices, data, and applications. The server side mobile device manager is a recent addition to the Citrix product portfolio. XenMobile posses the potential to be a future driver of total revenue enlargement; it could be a $600M to $1B or more opportunity. Additionally, Gartner positioned Citrix in the Mobile Device Management ""Leaders"" quadrant.NetScaler decomposes into four offerings: ADC, Gateway, Branch Repeater, and App Firewall. ADC enhances application performance and is recommended by Cisco. Gateway provides administrators granular application- and data-level control. I think of NetScaler as a growth area.XenApp and XenDesktop are the product offerings with which the reader may be more familiar. These offerings deliver virtual apps and desktops to users. This is an area of relative weakness, according to management. So, growth is slower than it was in the recent past.In terms of competition, F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) offers ADC. VMware provides solutions for desktop and application virtualization. IBM provides MDM solutions. Microsoft is also a key competitor.Citrix's profitability has deteriorated recently. The deterioration is because of an increase in cost of revenues and research and development expenditure. This a trend that could continue. But Citrix can improve profitability by decreasing sales, general and administrative expenditures; we could see an operating margin close to 40% of revenues.ValuationFor now, I'm continuing to use the historic multiplier model valuations on Citrix. After re-examining the valuation, I am maintaining my intrinsic value estimate of $69 per share, which is 19% above the current share price. I may change models if I deem that another model is more appropriate. That said, Citrix is undervalued and in my accumulation zone.The share price is in a bear market of primary- and intermediate-term degree. This has helped the share price enter my buy zone, which is below $61 per share. With the bear market having begun in 2011, I expect Citrix's next primary degree bull market to begin at any moment. Also, the tactical perspective of the situation looks more favorable than it did a few months ago.Additionally, there is scope for a prolonged bear market, but I'm not sure of the catalyst. It may be higher interest rates. Or it could be competition. Such a bear market would mean that the share price would deviate from the intrinsic value for longer than I would like, or I may have to decrease the intrinsic value estimate.I consider VMware and F5 Networks to be comparable assets. Using the price/book value metric, Citrix is fairly valued when incorporating profitability and risk into the analysis. Relative to its own value, Citrix is undervalued, but relative to comparable assets, Citrix is fairly valued.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Of course the company is also a leading provider of virtualization software and networking and cloud computing solutions to more than 230,000 organizations worldwide.But the company's earning's profile and resultant stock performance over the past year is another matter altogether. And they gave us nothing to cheer about last week when they reported mixed financial results for the fourth quarter of 2013.While net income surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, total revenue missed the same. Following the results, management significantly slashed its earnings per share projection for the next quarter. Citrix shares gapped down 10% the next day not just to a new 52-week nadir, but to lows under $52 not seen since August of 2011. Zacks Rank Warned Investors -- Last Week, and All Last YearWall Street analyst earnings estimate revisions the week before this quarterly report pushed CTXS back down to a #4 Rank (Sell) on January 25 warning investors 3 days before the event and giving them a chance to exit at $59.In fact, since July of 2012, CTXS has held a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) or worse, with many #4 (Sell) and #5 (Strong Sell) ratings. The proprietary Price & Consensus chart below tells the tale of a company in an earnings's decline that the stock followed from highs above $80 to today's pause at 2.5 year lows.When you can't do enough research on a company or industry yourself, sometimes the Zacks Rank can tell you almost all you need to know. That's because it is a quantitative measure of a company's earnings momentum relative to the rest of the market.What's Wrong With Citrix?But sometimes you still want to understand what's driving a particular company or industry up, or down. Here, from the January 3 Zacks Research Analyst report, are some of the technology trends which might explain why Citrix analysts have been steadily downgrading the company's growth outlook for over a year ...Several industry researchers have predicted that of all the corporate desktop PCs, only a few will use virtualization in the future due to costs associated with this technology. As a result, the long-term growth of Citrix may face headwinds beyond 2013-2014.The server virtualization market is intensely challenging and is becoming more commoditized. Citrix has been steadily cutting the prices of its XenServer product line and as a result, most of its offerings are currently free. The company witnessed a relatively slow conversion from free offering to paid-for-essential versions.Citrix continue to face stiff competition from VMware (NYSE:VMW). Acquisition of Desktone by VMware will allow the company to offer DaaS through its Cloud Hybrid Service. Moreover, Citrix's desktop platform faces stiff competition from VMware's View product and Oracle's broad virtualization stack.Bottom line: The Zacks Rank will tell us when the earnings picture shows any signs of a turnaround at Citrix. Until then, proceed cautiously."
1733142,25120,2013-10-07T16:56:36-04:00,,"Shares of Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) ended Monday's trading session unchanged after the company received an upgrade from analysts at Barclays Capital.Unlike analysts at Barclays I don't see the compelling upside in Citrix' shares at the moment. The premium valuation and continued margin pressure make me very hesitant to pick up some shares at the moment.Barclays Is PositiveAnalysts at Barclays upgraded their rating on Citrix from ""equal-weight"" to ""overweight,"" while raising the price target by a buck to $78 per share.Barclays noted that the desktop growth/sentiment is improving after a tough second quarter, and improved enterprise spending in the second half of this year.According to analysts, the recent pullback gives an opportunity to pick up some shares. Desktop license growth of 5-8% should be achievable, given the easy comps. Channel checks with partners of the firm indicate that none of the business partners is performing below plan.Note that Citrix is scheduled to release its third-quarter results October 23.ValuationCitrix ended its second quarter with $700.2 million in cash, equivalents and short-term investments. The company operates without the assumption of debt, for a solid net cash position.Revenues for the first six months of the year came in at $1.40 billion, up 16.5% on the year before. Net earnings fell by 22.5% to $124.1 million. At the presentation of the second-quarter results, the company guided for full-year revenues of almost $3.0 billion, and earnings of $350 million.Trading around $71 per share, the market values Citrix at some $13.3 billion. This values operating assets of the firm around $12.6 billion. As such, operating assets are valued around 4.2 times annual revenues and 36 times annual earnings.Citrix does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveOver the past decade, shares of Citrix have seen considerable upside. Shares rose from lows of $15 in 2004 to highs in the mid-80s in 2011. Ever since, shares have been trading in a $60-$80 trading range, currently exchanging hands at the midpoint of the range.Between 2009 and 2013, Citrix stands to increase its annual revenues by a cumulative 85% to just below the $3 billion mark. Net earnings nearly doubled to $350 million, similar to the earnings reported in 2011 and 2012.Investment ThesisCitrix Systems operates in the business software and services infrastructure, a segment that is generally showing growth although it depends largely on which specific segments you are focusing on.As such, Citrix is facing headwinds in desktop applications while it benefits from cloud computing and mobile markets. Yet Citrix is facing tailwinds as well, including the trend to access work places from the cloud and mobile devices. This results in an increase in demand for secure and virtualization tools as offered by Citrix, both in the public and private cloud.A key product launch was the XenMobile Enterprise Edition, which was released in the summer. The offering is an integrated product of apps, data management and e-mail. Notably the pipeline for the mobile edition is doing great. Other important and well-known offerings include the ""GoToMeeting"" collaboration application.Notably the cloud operations are showing rapid growth. Second-quarter revenue rose by 46% to $165 million in the segment, making up a solid portion of Citrix' revenue. The division with its major product offering ""Netscaler"" made up 23% of total revenue.Within the infrastructure, maintenance and the SaaS business, growth is less impressive. Within the entire spectrum Citrix is competing against the likes of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), VMWare (NYSEARCA:WMW) and F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV), to name a few.CEO Mark Templeton remains focused on the long-term strategy to focus on the cloud and mobility, thereby improving the agility and security of customer's technology infrastructure.While I do think that Citrix has a nice business going on, its main issue is the lack of profit improvements as margins continue to be under pressure. While Citrix has grown revenues from $2.2 billion in 2011, to an expected $3.0 billion this year, earnings will stagnate around $350 million, valuing operations around 36 times earnings after backing out the net cash position.This makes me quite cautious given the fall in recent earnings, and the premium valuation. Unless Citrix can show real prospects in improving earnings, I remain on the sidelines. Unlike Barclays I don't see the compelling upside at the moment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1994621,48501,2014-02-05T05:26:09-05:00,,"Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS) designs, develops, and markets technology solutions that allow applications to be delivered, supported, and shared on-demand with high performance, enhanced security, and improved total cost of ownership. CTXS recently reported full-year results that disappointed investors as slowing growth fueled concerns about the competitive landscape.For fiscal 2014, management is forecasting revenues growth of 8%-10% with GAAP diluted EPS of $1.58-$1.69, which would represent a 12% decline at the low end. For the first quarter, management is guiding towards revenues growth of 8%-10% with diluted EPS of $0.24-$0.26. In my opinion, revenue growth of 500 basis points or more represents excellent financial performance.While CTXS faces increased competition from VMware, especially following the acquisition of AirWatch, and Microsoft, CTXS remains well positioned in 2014 with updates to its XenMobile, XenDesktop, and XenApp offerings. Additionally, CTXS's partnership with Microsoft helps it to tackle challenging legacy workloads, which provides CTXS with an advantage. Also, the partnership with Cisco should allow CTXS to capture incremental revenue as existing ACE deployments eventually migrate to NetScaler.The distribution of CTXS shares has made the firm cheaper as investors adjust to the new normal growth rate of CTXS. This represents an opportunity for shrewd investors to accumulate shares as CTXS could grow between 7%-12% over the next three years and 3x book value is relatively inexpensive.Recent DevelopmentsBusiness SummaryCitrix is a leader in virtualization, networking and cloud infrastructure that enable new ways for people to work better. Citrix solutions help IT and service providers to build, manage and secure, virtual and mobile workspaces that seamlessly deliver apps, desktops, data and services to anyone, on any device, over any network or cloud.Citrix and industry-leading systems and storage vendors are working to bring down the cost of desktop virtualization. A new class of converged infrastructure architectures is delivering upfront equipment costs of under $200 per user leveraging local storage, powerful CPUs, and large capacity low-cost memory. The solutions are part of the Citrix Ready Low-cost Converged Infrastructure Verified program.Net revenues increased $332M during fiscal 2013, relative to the year-ago period. That represents a 12.8% increase. The increase was mainly driven by license updates and maintenance revenues growth. Software as a service growth contributed a significant portion of the net revenues growth. The 7.3% increase in product and licenses revenue represented 18.4% of the total increase in net revenues. Looking forward, Software as a service could become the second largest portion of net revenues.Gross margin during the year contracted, which is primarily attributable to the cost of services and maintenance revenue increase and partly attributable to increases in cost of product and licenses revenues and amortization of product related intangible assets. If this trend continues, the cost of services and maintenance revenues, which is lower margin than product and licenses, appears likely to weigh on the consolidated gross margin. Reinvestment in research and development, and sales marketing, and services drove the operating margin lower. That suggests the potential for above industry revenue growth in future reporting periods. The net profit margin declined 100 basis points, which was a decline of 15%.Liquidity declined substantially at the end of the December 2013 quarter relative to the December 2012 quarter. The cash ratio declined from 0.69 to 0.50, and the current ratio declined from 1.28 to 1.06. The current portion of deferred revenues, which increased 14.6% y/y, adversely impacted both measures of liquidity. CTXS isn't carrying debt and the financial leverage ratio was 1.57, at the end of 2013. Shareholders' equity increased 6.3% y/y.During fiscal 2013, cash flow from operations was just under $1B with free cash flow of $765.5M. Operating cash flow in 2012 was $819M. Net stock repurchases were $406M. CTXS should earn more than EPS of $1.41 during fiscal 2014.RisksThis section does not discuss all risks related to an investment in CTXS.Portfolio & ValuationThere are latent signs of strength as CTXS is in a confirmed bear market of primary degree. Aggressive investors would attempt to pick a bottom while conservative investors would wait for more signs of strength. Near term, there could be a bit of a bounce back to the 50-day SMA. Additionally, the $50 per share level should act as support, investor/trader psychology.There are diversification benefits from investing in CTXS. Since 2009, the correlation is 0.63. But since 2011, the correlations have been negative. The correlation since 2011 is -0.36 and is -0.59 since 2013. As the broader market has trended higher, CTXS has trended lower.The variations of the broader market explained 40% of the variations of CTXS since 2009. But since 2011 that drops to 13%. Since 2013, variations of the broader market have explained 34% of the variations of CTXS. CTXS variations could be company and/or industry specific.I use 3-months, 6-months, and 12-months price targets. The price targets are $80.29, $82.20, and $86.01. At just over $50 per share, CTXS is well below the 12-months price target.Given the fundamentals of the business, CTXS should be trading at a premium to the market. But the 20% premium is low by historic standards. Also, Citrix could trade at 3.5 to 4x book without being pricey. The company is likely to continue to grow (7% to 12%) over the coming three years, which could limit downside risk. Consequently, 3x book appears inexpensive.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1501802,45511,2013-06-15T06:45:00-04:00,,"Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) stock has been a massive underperformer, down 8% since it reported an ugly Q1, and has generally languished since Xen Desktop growth slowed. The stock sits where it has bottomed several times over the last few years. Citrix will receive a tremendous boost over the next 2-4 quarters as Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) most prevalent O/S, Windows XP, comes off support April 8, 2014. As it comes off support, roughly half of total enterprises will need to evaluate their future O/S. Many enterprises will evaluate and decide that desktop virtualization represents a compelling investment as storage/server costs have finally gotten to the point where the ROI makes sense. In addition, Citrix has amassed a compelling portfolio of assets in the MDM (mobile device management) and MAM (mobile application management) side which represents one of the hottest areas in technology spending. If Citrix stumbles again, the stock could see an additional 10% downside taking it where it was in late summer 2011 when Europe imploded and the S&P looked poised to follow. However, if Citrix turns things around as it has so many times post a weak quarter, investors will focus on its mobile portfolio and the stock could easily see $80 representing 30% upside. If a financial dictionary had a definition of positive risk: reward, there would be an entry with the ticker CTXS.What happened in Q1?There is no way of describing Q1 as anything besides an ugly quarter. Desktop license declined 11% year over year, only the 2nd ever y/y decline. Citrix blamed the macro, distractions following Zenprise closing and rebranding as Xen Mobile, and a tough comparison from a year ago. Sloppy quarters are hardly an anomaly in enterprise software especially this past Q1 with a who's who of companies missing. Citrix blamed the macro as did many of its competitors. Citrix CFO Henshall on the call, stated -Citrix also closed the Zenprise acquisition in late January and quickly integrated it and rebranded it alongside Cloud Gateway as Xen Mobile. According to CEO Mark Templeton -In addition to customers evaluating the new Xen Mobile offering, Citrix employees spent a tremendous amount of time learning the combined product offering and doing proof of concepts. I will explore the Xen Mobile offering later on the note, but it clearly is a major company directive and is generating excellent customer interest.Will Q2 Be Any Different?Q1 was clearly a tough quarter for technology companies across the board with broad based misses regardless of technology exposure. Whether the Washington budget impasse froze spending will be tough to determine but Q1 was weak for not just Citrix. Indications on Q2 progress have been solid. CFO David Henshall said during the Q1 conference call -Xen Desktop will have an added boost this quarter with the release of Xen Desktop 7.0 that was GA (general availability) to customers in June. Xen Desktop 7.0 is the first major feature release in three years. The upgrade will simplify management reducing total consoles from 18 down to just 2. In addition, the comparison in Q2 will be much easier as overall license growth in Q2'12 was up 9.7% y/y vs. an impressive 18.7% in Q1'12. Desktop specifically increased 17% in Q1'12 and decelerated to up 7% in Q2'12. Citrix management presented at a few conferences during the course of the quarter and sounded optimistic about the current tone of business. Management reaffirmed Desktop license growth of 8-12% year over year and noted the re-emergence of big deals.Windows XP Support Ending April 2014 - Big CatalystAccording to Microsoft website- ""If your organization has not started the migration to a modern desktop, you are late."" Microsoft will end support which includes bugs and security patches for Windows XP on April 8, 2014. According to Gartner, 40% of enterprises are still on Windows XP. The risk of not modernizing your desktop would include being exposed to an increasing amount of security risks. Based on NIST.gov data, Microsoft released 34 high severity updates that affected Windows XP in just this past quarter (Q1'13). A survey done by Tech Republic shows 52% of enterprises still have more than 50% of their PCs running Windows XP. According to Detwiler Fenton research, CIOs are making XP migration a top budgetary allocation over the next year and they have detected a noticeable increase in project interest for Xen Desktop 7 and VDI in general. Clearly, there is one last surge of enterprises who are waiting until the end before upgrading off of Windows XP and in doing so will at the very least evaluate desktop virtualization.ROI for Xen Desktop ImprovingThe main benefit of desktop virtualization has been increased security, ease of deployment, and the ability to cut back on related IT personnel. ROI in the past was a tough sell for desktop virtualization especially vis a vis its counterpart server virtualization. Server virtualization provided a quick and robust ROI as a company's server footprint could be reduced as utilization increased dramatically on existing server. In rolling out desktop virtualization, a company generally needs a commensurate increase in storage and server capacity to handle the additional images in the data center. Steadily storage and server costs have decreased to the point where now per-user server and storage costs of virtualizing a desktop PC are significantly below that of a comparable PC. According to Deutsche Bank CTO Rolf Riemenschnitter,Mobile Asset Portfolio- The Potential Home RunCitrix has been a very acquisitive company in its history but one with a very good reputation for acquiring hot technologies, repackaging them and giving it wide distribution. For instance, many were skeptical when it acquired XenSource for $500 million in the summer of 2007, but Citrix used this acquisition as the foundation for the current Xen Desktop business.Zenprise (closed January 2013) could be a XenSource-like acquisition in its potential upside in the hyper growth mobile management space. Citrix paid $355 million for Zenprise, a leader in the hot MDM (mobile device management) space. MDM allows a company to permit a user to bring in any mobile device equipping it with enterprise applications securely. With MDM software, a user has secure access to all of his/her applications through the corporate app store. The IT department can easily onboard, configure, provision and support all mobile devices. So if a user loses his/her mobile device with sensitive enterprise data, the IT department can remotely wipe the device. The following is Gartner's analysis of Zenprise in its latest report:The day Citrix closed the Zenprise acquisition, it announced the product availability of Cloud Gateway, its MAM (mobile application management) product. Cloud Gateway aggregates, controls, and securely delivers all applications to any mobile device. Combined, the two offerings will be delivered as a mobile solutions bundle.Gartner on Citrix Mobile SolutionsXen Mobile Huge Upside Vs. GuidanceCitrix has guided for $30 million in total revenue for 2013 with 2/3 of it coming in the form of license and 1/3 subscriptions. Management has publicly disclosed already a $300 million pipeline for Xen Mobile despite only having Zenprise acquisition closed and folded in for a few months. The MDM total addressable market was around $500 million for 2012 and is expected to grow 21% annually to $1.1 billion. According to Gartner, only 20% of medium and large businesses in the U.S. have already purchased MDM tools. As more and more employees bring their own devices, both smartphones and tablets, to work and are accessing enterprise applications, the need for securing these devices and applications increase dramatically. The remaining 80% of medium and large businesses in the US will need to adapt a mobile solution strategy and Citrix has one of the most complete of any of the competitors. For investors, Citrix is the best way to gain exposure to this theme as other Gartner market leaders are private companies (note - excluding SAP where it's a small component).Risk Return is Very GoodWith Citrix trading near multi-year lows and expectations depressed, additional downside would require extremely poor execution and/or market correction. The stock sports an attractive 8.3% free cash flow yield and trades at 20x p/e and 3.5 EV/2013 revenue, well below 3 and 5-year averages of 26x/23x and 4.9x/4.2x, respectively. Earnings estimates for '13 remain very low after weak Q1, so consensus 2013 and 2014 EPS of $3.09 and $3.53 could quickly resemble my $3.25 and $3.85 after a couple strong earnings reports. As the year progresses and the mobile portfolio gains momentum, the multiple will expand as investors seek exposure to this market segment. Note I have not delved into the networking and cloud business as that segment continues to be one of the shining areas in technology. My price target of $80 or 30% upside would take the stock to high end of 3-5 year averages and is not aggressive. At $80 the stock would be valued at 26x my '13 EPS, 4.6x EV/'13 revenue, and 16x EV/FCF still at or below 3 and 5-year averages.Disclosure: I am long CTXS.

1651102,48501,2013-08-22T10:51:02-04:00,,"Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS), the business software and services company, is in an intermediate uptrend. Citrix is a cyclical growth company that is facing profitability margin pressure. Also, the firm is in a cyclical growth industry and is benefiting from the expansion of the cloud computing and mobile markets.The combination of those factors should be helping Citrix to outperform the market, which it has over the three-year and five-year time periods. But, more recently, Citrix has underperformed the market -- with the exception of the one-month and three-month time horizons. I think Citrix will continue to outperform because of the favorable industry dynamics and quality of its product offerings.Citrix recently released solid product offerings, which are factored into my revenue growth forecast. Furthermore, I expect Citrix to continue its active acquisition strategy. All that said, Citrix is fairly valued; I would like to accumulate share of this company on a decline in the valuations. (My intrinsic value estimate is $70.25.)RisksBusiness ProfileCitrix is a cloud computing company that enables mobile work styles simply and securely. The company empowers people to work and collaborate from anywhere as easily as they would in their own office. Citrix cloud computing solutions help IT and service providers build both private and public clouds, leveraging virtualization and networking technologies to deliver high-performance, elastic, and cost-effective services for mobile work styles. Citrix is also the maker of the GoToMeeting collaboration application.The company's revenues are derived from its infrastructure products (which primarily include its mobile and desktop products), networking and cloud products, license updates, maintenance and professional services, and SaaS products (which primarily include collaboration and data sharing, remote access, and remote IT support products). Infrastructure and SaaS constitute the company's two reportable segments. Citrix markets and licenses products directly to enterprise customers, over the Internet, and through systems integrators. That is in addition to marketing and licensing products indirectly through value-added resellers, value-added distributors, and original equipment manufacturers.Citrix is pursuing a growth through acquisition strategy. As of June 30, 2013, goodwill represented 35% of total assets. Total intangible assets were 46% of total assets, and 70.8% of total equity. A decrease in the value of intangible assets could adversely impact the valuation of Citrix. Besides acquisitions, Citrix is investing cash from operating activities in available-for-sale investments.Citrix has technology relationships with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Alcatel-Lucent (ALU), Dell (NYSE:DELL), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Fujitsu (OTCPK:FJTSF), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). These relationships are bullish for the valuations and give Citrix a competitive advantage. In terms of total revenue composition, Ingram Micro accounted for 16% of net revenues in 2012, 17% of total net revenues in 2011, and 17% of our total net revenues in 2010. Ingram Micro has bargaining power, which is bearish for the valuations.Citrix's competitors include Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), VMWare (NYSE:VMW), F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV), Microsoft, Cisco, and Riverbed (NASDAQ:RVBD). Citrix faces competition from larger rivals, but my research suggests Citrix's offerings are outstanding. Citrix competes in the virtualization, mobility, networking, cloud, collaboration, and data sharing markets (which are all growth markets). Thus, Citrix is in an industry that is cyclically bullish.Recent DevelopmentsFinancial Performance ForecastCitrix is positioned in a growth industry; that and the quality of the product and service offerings should drive Citrix's financial performance over the foreseeable future. Also, the key strategic technology alliances should contribute to revenue growth. Consequently, I am forecasting revenue growth of 17% in fiscal 2013 and revenue growth of 10% to 15% in fiscal 2014.Revenue should be about $3.03 billion this year, and between $3.33 billion and $3.48 billion in fiscal 2014. I'm forecasting a continued decline in the gross margin to about 81% in fiscal 2014 with operating income in the 12% to 16% range and net income in the 10% to 14% range. Revenue composition will be a contributing factor in margin determination; the growth of the Networking and Cloud, and Services divisions could weigh on the gross margin.In terms of the ratio analysis, I have seen more liquid technology sector firms; the lack of liquidity may be due to the active acquisition strategy. The financial leverage ratio is trending higher, but the debt/equity ratio is zero. The asset utilization is improving. Overall, the ratio analysis is bullish for the valuations. The industry dynamics, financial performance forecast, and ratio analysis are bullish for the valuations of Citrix.ValuationsI'm going to use the multiplier models to value the common equity shares of Citrix. I'll use the absolute values, the time-series trend, and the historic averages. The current share price is $71.96.Given the growth rate of revenue, Citrix is fairly valued to modestly undervalued on an absolute basis. Based on the time-series trend, Citrix is fairly valued after being undervalued a couple of months ago; there is room for the valuations to continue to increase. The intrinsic value using the historic price/earnings ratio is $60.22, using the price/book ratio it is $66.69, using the price/sales ratio it is $71.96, and using the price/cash flow ratio it is $82.11. The average of those intrinsic values and the intrinsic value using the historic averages is $70.25.Citrix is fairly valued. I would use a 15% to 20% decline in the share price to accumulate shares; the highest level I would consider purchasing shares is $61.17. Unfortunately for me, the opportunity to purchase shares in that price range happened during June and July. That said, I'm bullish on the firm's prospects and will use a dip to accumulate shares.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2105473,48501,2014-03-24T12:06:00-04:00,The share price is starting to rebound.The competitive pressures were overblown.Citrix generates substantial free cash flow to equity.,"The share price of Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) is starting to rebound, which is what I have been looking for the past few months. Investors were too worried about competitive pressure from AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN) and VMware (NYSE:VMW); my view is that the companies compete in different verticals. Additionally, XenApp and XenDesktop are best-in-class solutions.Looking forward, the forecast is for 10% revenues growth in fiscal 2014, as management begins to refocus on the core offerings, XenApp and XenDesktop. Also, there should be pull through from XenMobile to XenApp and XenDesktop. The trend to a mobilized workforce is just beginning and Citrix should play a critical role in helping IT to build out the mission-critical infrastructure.Consequently, given the fundamentals of the firm, I strongly believe that Citrix is undervalued by about 28%.Recent DevelopmentsBusiness SummaryCitrix Systems designs, develops and markets technology products and services that enable information technology to be delivered securely on demand, regardless of location, device or network.From the industry perspective, the outlook for the software industry remains bullish both near term and longer term. Software is projected to grow at a rate above global economic growth. The productive enhancements offered by the industry make it an attractive investment. Additionally, Citrix is well positioned within the industry as the company benefits from the mobility and security trends.Revenue is forecasted to increase 10% in 2014 on continued strength in license updates and maintenance as well as software as a service revenues. For now, revenues growth is forecasted to slow to 9% in 2015. Profitability margins are forecasted to continue to contract as management reinvests in operations. My diluted EPS forecast is towards the upper end of management's guidance, which is coincidental.The solvency position is strong and the liquidity is ample. That said, the WACC is higher than it needs to be. Management could increase financial leverage to lower the WACC and increase the valuation of the firm.The forecast is for continued growth of cash flow from operations and free cash flow. Free cash flow to the firm is forecasted to increase 10% in 2014 and 9% in 2015. Given the low capex requirements, management could increase leverage to increase free cash flow to equity and return the capital to shareholders.The quality of earnings during 2013 was good. About 15% of earnings were the result of accruals. Cash collected from customers was 7% larger than reported revenues.The near term outlook for Citrix is bullish. The firm is expected to continue to grow in at least the high single digits. While the firm does face increased competition, market participants may not be appreciating the value added of Citrix's offerings relative to competitors. Lastly, XenMobile is likely to spark the pull through of incremental revenues from XenApp and XenDesktop.Portfolio & ValuationCitrix is in a bull market of intermediate degree and a bear market of primary degree. This is the bounce that I have been writing about for the past few months. Truly, I expect this to be a sustainable bounce as investors start to realize that the competitive environment isn't quite as competitive as they feared.Citrix is undervalued by 28% in the base case scenario. Under that scenario, the firm would be trading at 47.7 times fiscal 2014 earnings and 4.04 times the end of year book value. Management continues to reinvest in operations; consequently, the price multiples are higher than they would be for a mature firm. Using conservative fundamentals estimates, Citrix is 28% undervalued.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1141571,24706,2013-01-29T18:21:18-05:00,,"By Todd M.OverviewCitrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) is set to report fourth quarter 2012 earnings after the close on Wednesday, January 30, at 4:15 p.m. EST, with a conference call to follow at 4:45 p.m. EST. Citrix is an enterprise IT provider that offers cloud-based solutions, as well as products such as GoToMeeting and XenApp. Following a disappointing release from competitor VMware, look for Citrix to garner extra attention this quarter.Outliers & StrategyRecent NewsTechnical ReviewCitrix shares are up 11.91% this quarter, sitting between its 200-day SMA and 50-day SMA. Therefore, these should serve as initial support and resistance levels headed into earnings. Beyond those points, look for stronger support near $64, should earnings disappoint. Conversely, if earnings surprise to the upside, significant resistance can be found at the aforementioned 200-day SMA near $72, followed by $76 (the top of early October's decline). (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryCitrix Systems has had a solid 3-month run, reflecting positive sell-side sentiment, an improving economic backdrop, and an increase in enterprise spending. However, it is important to note the implications of VMware's guidance on its competitors. Ahead of the upcoming earnings release, expectations have been dampened in the entire sector. If Citrix reports solid numbers, coupled with a better than expected outlook, there could be significant upside following earnings dissemination.Disclaimer: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

1402891,25036,2013-05-04T21:48:49-04:00,,"Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS), provider of products for un-tethering people from their desktop computing platforms, has developed and/or acquired a broad array of products and as a result the company is looking ripe for harvesting by a larger company. The company has a number of very large partners such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), any of which could be a prime candidate for making an acquisition. Historically, when a company matures to the point of Citrix, some larger company decides to acquire them, so it would not be a surprise to see Citrix acquired at some point in the near or near-to-distant future.In the most recent quarter, the company reported total revenue of $673 million, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 14%. As proof of maturity, David James Henshall, CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Executive Vice President of Operations and Treasurer, noted in the company's Q1 2013 earnings conference call held on April 24, 2013, that the company closed more than 41 transactions for more than $1 million with sales in a wide array of areas such as technology, healthcare and financial services.Citrix is a global company and had year-over-year revenue growth of 17% in the Americas, 9% in EMEA and 15% in the Pacific region.After recently acquiring Zenprise, Citrix immediately took advantage by working with companies such as Hewlett-Packard, CSC (CSC), Atos and Fujitsu for rolling out new solutions based on Zenprise's XenMobile (renamed from MobileManager to XenMobile after the acquisition) which enables companies to provide mobile device management.Mark B. Templeton, CEO, President and Director of Citrix, noted in the Q1 2013 conference call that macroeconomic conditions pushed some larger desktop deals out to the next quarter. Additionally, Mr. Templeton also noted the company has been taking market share with respect to enterprise and providers in cloud networking.The stock price is down for the year and is near its previous support level in the $60 range as shown below:While not cheap, the company's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 33 and Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of 5.6 are not out of the range for consideration as an investment, since the company is growing very rapidly in several high-growth technologically related market segments. With the stock near its previous support level, potential for being acquired and a potentially good Q2 earnings report due to deals in Q1 being pushed out to Q2, this could be a good time to consider a long investment in the company. Since the P/E and P/S ratios are pretty expensive, a protected position will be considered such as the married put stock option strategy. With expensive fundamental ratios, any bad news could result in a dramatic plunge in stock price, so it's good to have some protection.The married put stock option strategy positions an investment for unlimited upside with limited downside. A married put position can be entered by purchasing a put option against a long position in the stock. The expiration month for the put option is typically selected several months out in the future in order to reduce the per-day cost of the put option ""insurance.""Several potential married put positions were found for Citrix with option expiration in September of 2013 as shown below:The married put position using the 2013 Sep 65 put option looks attractive, as it has a maximum potential loss of 6.2%, so even if the price of the stock goes to zero, the maximum loss which can be sustained is 6.2%. The details for entering the Citrix married position are shown below:Citrix Married Put Position:A profit/loss graph for one contract of the Citrix married put position is shown below:For an increasing stock price, the value of the married put position also increases. For a stock price below the $65 strike price of the put option, the value of the married put position remains unchanged. And, if the price of the stock increases to above the $65 strike price of the put option, then income methods for receiving income and reducing risk can be applied as taught by RadioActiveTrading.com.Look forward to hearing your comments below!Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

747451,21445,2012-07-25T12:08:02-04:00,,"Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) is expected to report Q2 earnings after the market close on Wednesday, July 25, with a conference call scheduled for 4:45 pm ET. The consensus estimate is 59c for EPS and $613.24M for revenue, according to First Call. The company has reported double-digit revenue increases for the past four quarters. The biggest boost came in the most recent quarter when revenue increased 20.1% year-over-year. Analysts contend that recent global trends toward virtualization and cloud computing will facilitate Citrix to report solid results. In late April, Citrix provided a Q2 non-GAAP EPS/revenue outlook of 58c-59c/$605M-$615M. In addition, the company expected FY12 non-GAAP EPS/revenue of $2.75-$2.79/$2.53B-$2.56B. ThinkEquity expects Citrix to show strength in its cloud networking NetScaler business, driven by the company's dominance in the Internet/ hosting vertical, which, according to its checks, continues its strong expansion. The firm expects Citrix to also show incremental improvement in VDI license revenue and to continue to grow the SaaS business ahead of overall revenue growth. ThinkEquity expects the Desktop business -- with the exception of VDI -- to show some of the strain of European and financial services exposure. ThinkEquity believes the closure of the Bytemobile acquisition, which was not included in Citrix's FY12 outlook provided in late April 2012, will likely act as buffer to Citrix's updated Q3 and FY12 outlook. The firm believes Citrix will reiterate its FY12 revenue outlook as Bytemobile's incremental revenue of approximately $40M will potentially offset the negative impact of a slowing global macroeconomic environment on virtual desktop adoption."
933881,23407,2012-10-18T17:53:45-04:00,,"A few weeks ago Cisco announced its exit from the network load balancer market, paving the way for competitors F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV) and Radware (NASDAQ:RDWR) to grab share. However, the biggest winner may end up being Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS), which just inked a deal to become Cisco's go-to partner for such equipment.$160 million in sales of Cisco's ACE ADC's are at stake.As I wrote previously, F5 is the load balancing leader, owning nearly 50% market share.In the wake of Cisco's announcement, F 5's competitors, including Citrix, offered steep discounts for those willing to convert from Cisco's ACE line.F 5 responded in kind, kicking off a margin busting price battle, squeezing profits. As a result, all the related stocks have traded lower over the past two weeks - despite the top line opportunity for share growth.Cisco's deal with Citrix reshuffles the deck yet again, positioning Citrix's NetScaler as the preferred option for current Cisco customers.For Cisco, the deal allows it to keep control of its unified network solution. For Citrix, it gives them a shot at pocketing a substantial share of Cisco's low double digit ADC market share, worth some $160 million annually.Cisco's end-to-end solution is a key to future growth.Broadly, Cisco has recognized the tidal shift to cloud data and virtualization and the resulting potential for software defined networks poses a significant risk to its switch business. I wrote about the threat recently here.As a result, Cisco's been building out its end-to-end Cisco Cloud Network Services offering. The soup-to-nuts solution is geared to provide data centers with one stop shopping for data management, control and security. NetScaler will become a part of this Cisco solution.Cisco is also sharing resources with Citrix to develop solutions integrating their Unified Computing System servers and Nexus switches with Citrix's CloudPlatform. In this way, the two take aim at market leader VMware (NYSE:VMW), in a bid to disarm risk from VMware's software defined network push. While VMware remains a Cisco partner, the company's $1.2 billion purchase of Nicira this summer has many thinking its setting up more as foe than friend to Cisco.This past summer, Citrix VP of Strategic Development hinted at a closer Cisco relationship at a Pacific Crest Investment Conference. When asked about VMware's Nicira acquisition, he is quoted saying ""People seem to forget that Cisco is the 800 pound gorilla in the lower layers of networking and a very good partner of ours and I'd say a less good partner going forward with VMware.""Citrix is far from a small company, with a market cap north of $12 billion and nearly $2.5 billion in annualized sales last quarter. But it dwarfs in size to Cisco, which has a cash hoard of over $45 billion.Whether the Citrix relationship becomes something much more is a wild card not worth betting on. But for investors looking for a double digit revenue and earnings grower in a high growth field, they could do far worse than Citrix, which has slumped 20% in the past month.For those interested, here are Citrix's average monthly returns for Q4 over the past 10 years.Source: Seasonal InvestorDisclosure: I am long CTXS, FFIV, VMW.

1051371,24276,2012-12-07T09:19:56-05:00,,"As enterprises get serious about moving real applications to clouds, whether public or private or hybrid, cloud software companies are finding they need to differentiate themselves, to ""niche"" as the techies say.Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) has decided its niche is mobile.The company's acquisition of Zenprise is designed to help it build a secure mobile suite that will include its Citrix Receiver virtualization technology, GoToMeeting, Podio and ShareFile. The idea will be that mobile devices will be able to do all the things desktops can do, with full security and control.Zenprise specializes in Mobile Device Management or MDM, which is the security piece of the puzzle.Citrix' main competitor in this area was expected to be VMware (NYSE:VMW), which has a ""Horizon Suite"" of tools that lacks an MDM component. But VMware is consumed right now with other problems, namely building a cloud suite under former CEO Paul Maritz, and may not be paying attention to this area as it should.All of which gives Citrix a good head start in the market. The heavily-advertised GoToMeeting can thus be seen as just the entry portal into a much larger offering, one that could prove highly profitable going forward. The consumer product can then lead directly into an enterprise offering, sold for the ""bring your own device"" or BOD market.BOD is going to be a big buzzword in 2013, and Citrix is already on it.CTXS stock, meanwhile, has been on a wild ride this year that has gotten it right back to where it started. But annual revenue growth is in the 20% range, its operating margins are at about 20%, there's no debt, and operating cash flow is solid.Now that the company knows what it's about in the cloud space, it's poised for take-off.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The consensus estimate is 76c for EPS and $618.61M for revenue, according to First Cal. Citrix has enjoyed double-digit year-over-year percentage revenue growth for the past four quarters. Guidance from management for Q4 is: adjusted EPS 75-76c, on revenue of $610M-$620M. For FY: adjusted EPS $2.45-$2.46 on revenue of $2.2B-$2.21B. Wells Fargo expects strong results from Citrix. They are modeling revenues of $619M and EPS of 76c, in-line with consensus estimates. The firms' estimates represent a 16.9% year-over-year growth in revenues and 12.9% growth in desktop revenues. Wells Fargo sees Citrix as a key beneficiary of the ongoing data center transformation and all three segments -- virtualization, datacenter, and SaaS -- are growing at double digit rates for Citrix, consistent with industry growth rates. The firm believes Citrix’s XenDesktop continues to win in competitive evaluations against VMWare (NYSE:VMW) and the trade up program continues to drive benefits. Wells Fargo's checks indicate that the pipeline is solid and security and flexibility are key drivers of growth. The firm also expects new features and enhancements to continue the growth into FY12. Wells believes the NetScaler product line continues to see traction due to cross-sell into the existing customer base.

Openstack is offered under the Apache license, but using the license and being supported by the foundation are different.Among the companies using Cloudstack for their clouds are Zynga (ZNGA), Bechtel and GoDaddy.In an interview with GigaOm, Citrix cloud platforms group VP of marketing Peder Ulander also said that the company will push for a closer relationship with Amazon, saying its API is a ""de-facto standard"" and that OpenStack's efforts to build its own API is thus unnecessary. Openstack says it has had compatibility with the Amazon API from the beginning.For now, it appears that open source cloud developers are hedging their bets, many of them working with both OpenStack and CloudStack.Investors might want to note the recent performance of both CTXS and RAX. Seen over a distance of a month or less, the stock of CTXS has been gaining a little faster. Take it to the start of 2012 and the two are about even. Taken from the perspective of a year, however, Rackspace has done much better.Investors need to ask themselves two questions. First, to what extent are the latest CTXS moves a serious threat to Rackspace's open source model, and to what extent do they represent marketing? Second, has the cloud standards race already been run, with Amazon the obvious winner?My money is on Amazon. Please feel free to disagree.Disclosure: I am long AMZN."

The next on tap is Citrix Systems (CTXS). Citrix is scheduled to report 4Q 2011 earnings after the close of trading on Wednesday, January 25 with a conference call to follow at approximately 4:05 p.m. EST.Outliers & StrategyRecent NewsTechnical ReviewCitrix Systems recently clawed its way back to the 200-Day SMA near $69.50 before stalling out at this key resistance barrier. Should earnings and guidance surprise to the upside, the $70-level is the first area of resistance, followed by the recent highs near $75. Conversely, support is at the 50-Day SMA near $67, followed by $65 and $61. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryCitrix Systems is widely expected to deliver solid quarterly results after the close on Wednesday, stemming from increased adoption of desktop virtualization software, coupled with the growth trends in cloud-computing. Recently upbeat reports from F5 Networks and VMware also support the bullish argument headed into the release, while the shares have risen more than 15% off the December lows. Guidance for the upcoming 1Q period is expected to dictate the trading direction.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
321047,20568,2012-01-21T15:46:48-05:00,,"Citrix Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS)  is scheduled to release its fourth quarter 2011 results on Wednesday,  January 25, after the closing bell. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate  for the fourth quarter is pegged at 65 cents, representing an  annualized growth of 18.42%.With respect to earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters,  Citrix Systems has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the  four quarters. The average earnings surprise was a positive 12.83%,  implying that the company has outdone the Zacks Consensus Estimate by  the same magnitude during the same period.Third Quarter RecapOn October 27, 2011, Citrix Systems reported its third quarter 2011 financial results.Quarterly net revenue was $565.3 million, up 20% year over year and  ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $545 million. GAAP net income  was $92.2 million or 49 cents per share compared with $87.8 million or  46 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. However, quarterly  adjusted EPS of 64 cents was well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  46 cents.Gross margin in the third quarter of 2011 was 86.4% compared with 87.8%  in the year-ago quarter. However, quarterly operating margin was 18.5%  compared with 17.3% in the prior-year quarter.Agreement of Estimate RevisionsIn the last 30 days, out of the 15 analysts covering the stock, one  analyst increased the estimate for the fourth quarter of 2011 while none  reduced the estimates. However, for the first quarter of fiscal 2012,  only one analyst reduced the EPS estimate.For fiscal 2011, in the last 30 days, out of the 15 analysts covering  the stock, one analyst increased the EPS estimate but none decreased the  same while for fiscal 2012, out of the 15 analysts covering the stock,  one analyst raised the EPS estimate and one slashed the estimate.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsDuring the last 30 days, the current Zacks Consensus Estimates were in  line with the previous estimates of 65 cents and 44 cents, respectively,  for the ongoing quarter and the first quarter of fiscal 2012.However, for fiscal 2011, during the last 30 days, the current Zacks  Consensus Estimate was just a penny short of the earlier estimate of  $2.09. For fiscal 2012, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate was a penny  above the previous estimate of $2.33.Earning SurprisesThe current Zacks Consensus Estimates for the ongoing quarter reflects a  0.00% upside potential but the upcoming quarter contains a 2.22%  downside potential (essentially a proxy for future earning surprises).  Similarly, fiscal 2011 has a 0.00% upside potential while for 2012, the  Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects a 1.28% growth potential.Our RecommendationStrong financial outlook, increased demand for desktop virtualization  led by XenDesktop and other new product launch will propel growth for  the company going forward. However, deteriorating economy coupled with  stiff competition from VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW)  will act as a headwind for the company going forward. We, thus,  maintain our long-term Neutral recommendation for Citrix Systems.Currently, Citrix Systems has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold rating on the stock.CITRIX SYS INC: Free Stock Analysis ReportVMWARE INC-A: Free Stock Analysis ReportTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.Zacks Investment Research"
302281,24706,2011-10-26T10:10:34-04:00,,"SummaryCloud-based computing companies have delivered solid earnings releases so far this quarter, evidenced by the results from VMware (NYSE:VMW) and F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV). The next on tap is Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS).Citrix is expected to report Non-GAAP Earnings per share of $0.58, the high end of the previously provided range of $0.56 to $0.58. Analyst estimates are as high as $0.62, implying the Street may be pricing in above-consensus results. Revenue is expected to fall in at the mid-point of the targeted range of $540.0 million to $547.0 million. Keep a close eye on revenue guidance for the 4Q period. Estimates call for a 12% sequential improvement to around $609.3 million. Anything less would be seen as a disappointment considering the recent run-up. Aside from the future outlook, the potential impact of slower sales in business and enterprise given the recent economic weakness is a concern facing Citrix. Valuation is another factor, with the shares now trading at 37.1x trailing earnings. Despite those fears, Citrix is a leader in desktop virtualization and application-delivery software, with earnings expected to grow at a 16% clip over the next five years, supporting a higher valuation. Data center spending also remains strong and the company is seeing demand for new products, including the XenDesktops. Note that the shares have traded higher the day after each of the four previous earnings releases, with Non-GAAP EPS topping estimates by an average margin of 14.4%. With that being said, Citrix shares are still vulnerable to any missteps and a potential pullback if results are not at the high end of forecasts. Chart ReviewCitrix shares have rallying in advance of its quarterly earnings release, pushing through resistance at $62.50. This level now becomes support in the event of a miss on earnings or revenues. Resistance is at the 200-Day SMA near $70. The 20-Day SMA recently crossed above the 50-Day, while the RSI and MACD are pointed higher – signs of positive momentum ahead of the 3Q numbers.

282334,21445,2011-07-27T15:31:43-04:00,,"Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) is expected to report Q2 earnings after the market close on Wednesday, July 27, with a conference call scheduled for 4:45 pm ET. The consensus estimate is 55c for EPS and $522.86M for revenue, according to First Call. Back on April 27, the stock rose 5% after an earnings beat and guidance. Management provided guidance for Q2/FY11: EPS of 54c-55c/$2.38-$2.41 on revenue of $515M-$525/$2.14B-$2.17B. CLSA believes Citrix is well positioned to exceed Q2 expectations on strength in desktop and SaaS offerings. The firm sees Citrix benefiting from a healthy XenDesktop migration cycle, solid enterprise spending and secular interest in endpoint virtualization. CLSA believes Citrix is likely to beat its forecasts and will sustain a bullish full-year outlook. For Q2, CLSA estimates $528.2M and 56c, slightly ahead of consensus. CLSA forecasts Q2 bookings of $596.2M or 17.3% YoY growth, 19.1% QoQ. Strong enterprise results from IBM, VMWare (NYSE:VMW) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) support positive virtualization trends that CLSA believes should offset concerns over Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, weakness that contributed to Q2 disappointments at F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV) and Riverbed (NASDAQ:RVBD). Looking forward: For Q3, CLSA estimates revenues of $537.9M and non-GAAP EPS of 60c, slightly below consensus of $542.80M and 61c. CLSA reiterates an Outperform rating and $92 target price. Citrix is currently trading at the high-end of its 52-week price range. The stock price has moved a whopping 94% in the past one year."
292034,24714,2011-09-07T07:01:23-04:00,,"Web 2.0 refers to the new age of software products and services. This includes cloud computing, social networking, virtualization, and several other recent technological advances. This space is expected by analysts to have enormous growth over the next few years.Investors are willing to pay high premiums for stocks of companies at the forefront of the Web 2.0 movement. Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) is becoming a leader in on demand IT services, and its stock does not trade at multiples as high as its competitors, yet its expected growth is similar to that of its competitors.Due to the recent economic downturn, Citrix is trading at $56.14, which is much lower than its 52 week high of $88.49. In this article, I explain how investing in Citrix Systems is a relatively cheap way to hold a long position in Web 2.0.Citrix offers a pretty wide variety of products and services, but it is best known for GoToMeeting. Citrix shares currently trade at a P/E ratio of 31.83, which is high for the current market, but is low when looking at competitors. For example, VMware (NYSE:VMW) trades at a P/E ratio of 68.8, and Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) trades at a P/E ratio of 62.72. If comparing Citrix to cloud computing companies, its P/E ratio looks tiny compared to Salesforce.com’s P/E ratio of 597.81 and NetSuite’s net loss and shares that trade at ten times revenue.In addition to trading at a lower earnings multiple, Citrix has a lot of expected growth. With a current EPS of $1.76, Citrix is expected to have an EPS of $2.76 by the end of 2012, which is an increase of 56.8 percent. This gives Citrix shares a P/E ratio of 20.34 by the end of 2012 if Citrix shares trade at the same price. VMWare would have a P/E ratio of 35.88 in 2012 if its price stayed constant and it met its earnings estimates. Red Hat would trade at 32.13 times earnings and Salesforce.com would trade at 66.08 times earnings. Netsuite is expected to be profitable by the end of 2012, but would still trade at a staggering 102.79 times earnings.I believe that Citrix has the potential to become one of the leaders in cloud computing and virtualization. Its products and services are well designed and it has the reach (100 million users per day) to market new products and expand on current ones. In a few years, it has a chance of being a dominant player in the technology sector. I expect Citrix to continue to grow and be one of the few stocks in the high-priced, Web 2.0 space to grow over the next couple of years.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

(NASDAQ:CTXS) has become a formidable player and has solidified its foothold in the  cloud computing businesses by taking the route of acquisition.  Yesterday, the company announced that it has completed the acquisition  of Cloud.com Inc., a leading developer for software infrastructure  platform for cloud computing service providers. The financial terms of  the deal are not yet disclosed.The CloudStack product suite of Cloud.com offers an open-source  platform-as-a-service environment that enables the cloud service  providers to deploy and manage scalable applications in simplistic and  cost-effective way.Citrix is growing gradually as virtualization and cloud computing  becomes essential for large enterprises to reduce costs when the economy  begins to recover from the recession. Telecom service providers coupled  with several other larger enterprises are at present relying more on  third-party cloud infrastructure to offer and access cloud services  easily and quickly. According to a research firm IDC, the cloud  computing infrastructure market size is expected to cross $11 billion by  the end of 2013.With Cloud.com in its kitty, Citrix is now comfortably placed at par with cloud computing software leader VMware Inc. (NYSE:VMW) -- which, incidentally, is the closest competitor of Citrix. The company became a strong challenger for Amazon.com’s (NASDAQ:AMZN)  web services software and Microsoft Corp.’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows Azure software. Cloud.com has a solid list of clientele including Tata Communications Ltd. (NYSE:TCL-OLD), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nokia Corp. (NYSE:NOK), Zynga Inc., and GoDaddy Inc., to name a few.Virtualization and cloud computing have become one of the most effective  tools to reduce costs as enterprises expanded in size. Instead of  installing their own virtualization and data center set up, the  corporate bodies are now sharing cloud computing platform of dedicated  providers like Citrix. As a consequence, the companies require the IT  infrastructure to support this virtual office. We believe large and  medium sized enterprises will increasingly move toward more dynamic and  converged infrastructure.We maintain our long-term Neutral recommendation on Citrix. Currently, it holds a short-term Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) on the stock."

The average earnings surprise was a positive  10.07%, implying that the company has outdone the Zacks Consensus  Estimate by the same magnitude during the same period.Fourth Quarter RecapOn January 26, 2011, Citrix Systems reported its fourth quarter 2010  financial results. Quarterly net revenue was approximately $529.7  million, up 17% year over year and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate  of $508 million.

The company had guided FY11 revenue to $2.04B-$2.07B. Citrix needs a strong beat and raise quarter to propel the shares meaningfully higher in the short term, after its shares retreated on F5’s (NASDAQ:FFIV) disappointing results. CLSA expects Citrix to beat its forecasts of $509.5M in revenues, the high end of guidance, representing year-over-year growth of 12.9%. The firm forecast non-GAAP earnings of 61c, also above the guided range. Because Citrix typically hedges currency, CLSA expects the impact from a stronger euro to be muted. The firm forecasts 10.5% license growth, up 10.1% quarter-over-quarter, and well below the 15.3% Q3/Q4 seasonal average from 2002-2009. XenDesktop will be in focus. CLSA expects solid bookings at $90M, up from $60M in Q3 and some investors are looking for at least $100M. CLSA is looking for upside to the quarter to come more broadly from XenApp, NetScaler and other products. Results from VMWare (NYSE:VMW), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) point to strong enterprise IT spending trends.

251110,23679,2011-02-06T10:32:35-05:00,,"After investigating the networking sector a couple weeks ago, I was intrigued by Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS).  Let me start off by saying that Citrix Systems Inc. is a great company.  They have been a leader in their sphere for years, and their growth has been phenomenal. Couple that with the fact that they just had a great Q4, and one might call me crazy for issuing a sell recommendation on this company.However, I am firm in my beliefs that no matter the story behind a company, you have to combine that with the right price to call it a good investment.  Some highly priced companies do this with explosive growth, competitive edge and proprietary technologies.  Some companies individually break this rule and sometimes the market disproves this rule over the short to medium term, but I think it in the long run value prevails.Citrix Systems has had a competitive advantage in terms of application virtualization for some time now.  They have been the best option for companies hoping to run an application from a central server with XenApp, and also from remote locations using Access Essentials.  Their technologies are applicable across a wide variety of operating systems, including Windows, which made them unique in this sphere; many competitors bundle desktop and application virtualization into one package.Because of this flexibility, CTXS has a strong relationship with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which it relies upon to avoid direct competition with companies like VMware (NYSE:VMW), who focus on more complicated holistic server infrastructures.  Recently, VMW released their earnings, which beat but were tempered by soft guidance on margin outlook.  Their CFO, Mark Peek said (see conference call transcript here):However, the caveat with their earnings call was a flat margin for 2011.  Could CTXS be caught in the same boat?  Let’s take a look at their earnings and see.See the earnings press release here.Q4 Financial Summary:  In reviewing the fourth quarter results of 2010, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009:Annual Financial Summary: In reviewing 2010 results compared to 2009 results:Financial Outlook for Fiscal Year 2011: Citrix management expects to achieve the following results during its fiscal year 2011 ending December 31, 2011:By all estimates, a solid quarter.  Revenue growth was solid all across the board, and their per share earnings guidance of $2.29-2.33 beat the street's estimate of $2.28.  The other strategic issues surrounding Citrix are what I feel overshadow this upbeat earnings report.Microsoft - The Elephant in the Room:  I find issue with CTXS’s strategic positioning in the market right now.  They have positioned themselves as a technology leader in application services, especially in Windows based virtualization efforts.  However, very soon they may come head to head with MSFT as a potential rival.  Microsoft has made not made it a secret that their entrance into the cloud would include application virtualization.  Combine this with the fact that CTXS relies on Windows for a competitive edge, and I am not convinced this relationship can hold up in the long term.  Right now it is working but five - or even three - years from now I wouldn’t be so sure.Acquisition Target:  It has been whispered that Citrix could make a good acquisition target for a variety of firms with piles of cash that want to play in the cloud.  Their technology would provide any larger company with the foundation to compete immediately with anyone in this market, and could also create synergies if combined with the right partner.Insider Selling, CTXS 10b5-1 Plan Sales:  Insider trading is generally not a leading indicator for stock performance.  Executives need to sell stock for anything from liquidity to diversification, and since options make up a large portion of salaries for these employees, turning those into cash is a natural progression.However, there is one type of insider selling that is generally considered a negative sign in the eyes of the market.  That is the 10b5-1 plan.  With this type of sale, you can enter into a transaction agreement, but then rescind that agreement even if you come across insider information.  The SEC says that insider trading must involve an actual transaction of shares.  According to InsiderMonkey, companies with large 10b5-1 filings have experienced abnormal negative returns of 70 basis points a month.Valuation:  Given the advantages Citrix still claims and their history of strong results, I have to be careful about handicapping them too much for strategic reasons that could change.  Nonetheless, even using appropriate growth assumptions without any penalty for a failing relationship with Microsoft, I still can only justify a price floor of $34 and a ceiling of $55 for Citrix.  This is around where they were trading in mid October 2010.However, their abnormal returns over the S&P for 2010 were incredible.  They have also recently been trading near their five year high (which is not a sell indicator, just a fact).  Citrix’s growth in the coming years will be high simply because of the expansion of the cloud.  However, I feel their technological moat is no longer significant enough to warrant such a premium.  The erosion of technological superiority will allow competitors to leverage their solutions in a way that will eat at Citrix’s market share.  The thought of an acquisition could be appealing, but that is only a whisper in the wind at this point in time.Ratios:  Their ratios are a mixed bag.  From a liquidity standpoint, they look perfectly healthy.  Their current ratio has been constant for the last five years and they hold no long term debt.  They generate free cash flows in excess of five hundred million, and should be able to cover any short term obligations.  Their margins and return ratios had been decreasing since 2005, but recovered slightly in 2010.  Their profit margin was the most notable increase, moving from 11.83% in 2009 to 14.78% in 2010.  I believe this is due in part to the growth of their technical services (40% in Q4 and 31% in all of 2010) which include consulting and technical support, traditionally high margin items.From a relative perspective, their price to earnings is almost double what it was in 2008/2006 (~46 currently versus 24.2 in 2008 and 26.78 in 2008).  However, their price to book and price to sales have increased at a less alarming rate.Citrix is a great company.  They have been aggressively repurchasing shares.  They have growth potential, but that is coupled with some potential strategic roadblocks.  I feel that investors have already cooked in phenomenal growth for the next five years into the price of this stock, and I cannot justify that price with my assumptions.If there were to be a run on the stock, and it returned to October 2010 levels, then I’d be more comfortable making an investment.  However, at the $67 price level, I think Citrix is too expensive.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Citigroup says Q3 inputs were 'OK' -- in core desktop, which is about 65% of revenue, momentum slowed after the strong Q2 “trade-up” but may re-accelerate in Q4. The firm expects the direct business had some of the same dynamics. In datacenter, about 15% of revenue -- mostly Netscaler, Citigroup continues to hear of strong demand driven by enterprise and service provider capex initiatives in improving application performance. Citigroup expects Online, 20% of revenue, to show another solid quarter of growth. Hiring trends are comparable to 2007 time-frame suggesting operating expenses are biased higher, limiting upside to Citigroup's 49c EPS estimate. Looking forward: Guidance provided on the last earnings call is for FY10 EPS of $1.87-$1.89 on $1.81B-$1.83B in revenue. FY11, Citigroup believes expectations of 10% revenue growth looks safe, but expect that buy-side expectation is in the 15%+ range. The firm expects management may offer initial FY11 revenue guidance that is “double digit.” Conference Call: Investors expect the company may try to de-focus investor from XenDesktop bookings. Preliminary thoughts on FY11 expectations will be expected. Commentary on trade-up activity following adjustments to promotions in July 4 will be closely watched. Additionally, investors will be looking for commentary around the expense ramp. Also, any commentary regarding renewed takeover speculation will be welcomed."

The first fruit of the acquisition is an integrated web-based platform for monitoring, controlling and supporting IT infrastructure.  Dubbed GoToManage, the new service lets Citrix Online tap into the growing demand for software-as-a-service (Saas)-based IT management, a market Forrester Research predicts will reach $4 billion in 2013. Citrix Online is positioning the latest addition to its online services portfolio as an affordable alternative to premise-based software.  I expect that as more enterprises experiment and adopt more mixed-hosted services -- including cloud, SaaS, IaaS, and outsourced ecosystems solutions -- that web-based management capabilities will become a requirement. In order to manage across boundaries, you need management reach that has mastered those boundaries. On-premises and traditional IT management is clearly not there yet.  Elizabeth Cholawsky, vice president of Products and Services at Citrix Online, explains the reasoning behind the acquisition: The Paglo puzzle piece  According to IDC, Citrix Online was the remote support market leader in 2008 with a 34.7 percent global share via its GoToAssist services. IDC also pegs Citrix Online as the third largest SaaS vendor in the world based on 2007 revenue, but Citrix Online needed Paglo-like log analysis technology in order to offer its customers the next puzzle piece in its full SaaS picture.  Paglo has made a name for itself providing SaaS-based IT search and management services. In short, Paglo helps companies harness and analyze the information explosion coming from all their computer, server, network and log data. Paglo helps companies improve operating efficiencies, gain a clearer understanding of true IT costs and meet compliance requirements.  Now, Paglo serves as the foundation for GoToManage. GoToManage creates an IT ""system of record"" to give businesses with the ability to discover and identify all network devices, monitor critical servers and applications in real-time, manage network usage, and track configuration changes. Like other Citrix Online products, GoToManage can be accessed from anywhere, and doesn’t require costly server infrastructure.  A seamless transition?  With GoToManage, Citrix Online is once again disrupting the traditional IT model. Brian de Haff, CEO of Paglo, expects a seamless integration for Paglo customers and GoToAssist customers that tap into the new service. With behind-the-scenes integration completed, customers can click on a link and instantly access GoToManage. De Haff also expects Paglo customers to adopt GoToAssist and use the two services in tandem.  “When we look across the Paglo customer base, the integration of monitoring with remote support is by far the number one requested feature that customers are asking for,” de Haff says. “So bringing these technologies together is a terrific win for the customers of both companies.”  Cholawsky declined to comment whether Citrix Online will make additional acquisitions to add to its portfolio, which also includes GoToMyPC, GoToMeeting, GoToAssist, GoToWebinar, GoToTraining and GoView. What she did say is that Citrix Online is witnessing a large growth spurt, which she expects to continue.  “We’re constantly looking at partners and acquisitions,” Cholawsky says. “With the venture capital investments in smaller companies with great technologies over the past couple of years, acquisitions are a terrific way to grow our company. But whether we develop more organically or go out and partner closely or do more acquisitions, we’ll be investing heavily in the SaaS market.”  Financial terms of the Paglo acquisition were not disclosed.Disclosure: Paglo is a sponsor of BriefingsDirect podcasts."

Presentation Server, now known as XenApp, allows software applications to be hosted on a server and accessed remotely.Lacking growth in its core software business of Application Virtualization, Citrix is seeking fresh growth areas to revitalize its top line. The most promising is Desktop Virtualization, a product area long hyped as the “next big thing” with little to show for it — until now. Citrix acquired XenSource, which develops server and desktop virtualization tools, for around $500 million in October 2007 ; at the time of acquisition, XenSource generated minimal revenue.Desktop virtualization decouples the Operating System (OS) from a desktop PC, and allows the OS to be loaded from a network server. This not only adds complexity to an IT environment, but also gives managers more control over applying patches and keeping computers secure. Desktop Virtualization also enables Thin Client computing, a system where Desktop PCs are stripped of hardware such as hard drives and major computing power. Data is stored and processing is conducted at the centralized server, ensuring that sensitive data is closely monitored and controlled.Citrix emerged as a leader in the 4th quarter of 2009, generating $30 million in desktop virtualization revenue during the period. Combined with its server virtualization product, Citrix Essentials, growth in the segment was 150 percent on a year over year basis. The company strongly established itself as the leader of the pack, although it faced stringent competition. Server virtualization pioneer and leader, VMware (NYSE:VMW), is looking to build on its success and deep enterprise relationships. Similarly, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) are building desktop (and server) virtualization tools.As enterprise PC upgrades continue, particularly on the heels of Microsoft’s Windows 7 release, desktop virtualization is a tool that corporations will closely evaluate. Leaking of sensitive data is becoming a major cost to companies and organizations, and well managed desktop virtualization could play a crucial role in mitigating the problem.Desktop virtualization could be a major growth opportunity for Citrix, and it appears that the acquisition of XenSource is beginning to pay off. If the company’s Q4 performance becomes a trend, the stock could be viewed as undervalued and ripe for appreciation.Disclosure: No positions"

Trading activity in Citrix call options has jumped to four times the normal level ahead of earnings. Also, Citrix shares have been trading higher on renewed takeover speculation. William Blair says that given the strength in desktop virtualization and higher number of larger deals in the quarter, they expect revenue to be above the firm's estimate of $430M and consensus estimates. William Blair forecasts a non-GAAP operating margin of 27.3%, 90bp higher than the prior year but sequentially higher by 220bp, driven by the company’s cost-cutting and headcount reduction programs.

The core business held up reasonably well in the quarter, with William Blair estimated XenApp license revenues of $88M. The firm's checks continue to indicate strong customer interest in desktop and client side virtualization, and it believes the company is well positioned to capitalize on this trend in the long term. However, despite its confidence that Citrix is likely to maintain full-year guidance, William Blair believes there is a small risk that management might provide Q3 guidance that is slightly below consensus because of continued softness in Europe. That said, the federal business has been strong over the past three quarters and as the September quarter is the government year-end, William Blair expects a federal budget flush to offset some of the weakness in Europe. Consequently, the firm did lower its Q3 estimate to $397M, slightly below the Street’s $398M."

While Think views XenApp, 63% of sales, as a discretionary spend, they believe expectations are conservative, and checks suggest low-single-digit sequential growth, which should support an in-line quarter. Think Equity's checks also suggest that Application Networking Federal activity was solid and that a strong virtual desktop, or VDI, continues to drive broad pilot activity.

(NASDAQ:CTXS), a leading provider of virtualization, networking and cloud computing solutions, will declare its first quarter 2010 financial results on April 21 after the market closes. The virtualization market is still reeling under the recession. The broader virtualization market has taken a hit due to the economic downturn as firms tighten their spending on server hardware.Nevertheless, we believe the virtualization market will flourish in the long run with desktop virtualization as its central point. Several enterprises are likely to opt for virtualization solutions as a cost effective method to reduce the amount of server and storage hardware within their set-up. Citrix is benefiting from the trend toward globalization and the virtual office.Estimate Revisions TrendEstimate revisions trend remains very much static since none of the 12 analysts covering the stock changes their estimates in last 30 days for both the first quarter 2010 and full fiscal 2010.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter 2010 earnings is 28 cents per share, which would be a substantial improvement of 62.8% over the prior-year quarter. However, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39 per share for full fiscal 2010 earnings indicates a modest improvement of 2.9% year-over-year.Given the static nature of estimate revisions trend, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remains the same in the last 30 days for the first quarter 2010 but decreased by 1 cent for the full fiscal 2010 during the same period.With respect to earnings surprises, the company’s fairly good track record is not expected to hold in the coming quarters. Citrix produced an impressive average earnings surprise of 20.7% in the last four quarters, which means that it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by that amount over the last year.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents for the first quarter 2010 contains a downside potential (essentially a proxy for future earnings surprises) of 10.7%. For full fiscal 2010 earnings estimate, there also exists a downside potential of 4.3%.Our RecommendationThe desktop virtualization market is expected to accelerate further in 2010 and has the potential to impact more than 600 million desktop users in corporate environments alone. Despite this, global recession and the uncertainty about future economic conditions could negatively impact Citrix’s current and prospective customers and may result in delays or reductions in technology purchases.

RBC Capital expects mixed Q4 results with revenues likely in-line or slightly below consensus due to weakness in both North America and EMEA. Given the mixed demand environment RBC would not be surprised to see Citrix achieve the low end of its targeted revenue range or slightly below consensus.

Kaufman Bros. believes that Citrix is poised to meet expectations, based on the company's history of execution, as well as its broad product line and ability to provide customers with meaningful value. Friedman Billings said recently that its field checks on Citrix have become incrementally more negative due to company-specific and macro headwinds. Although the firm believes the June quarter should still be relatively in-line with Street estimates, it is becoming more cautious on the outlook for 2H08 and 2009, as it believes the company will face a more challenging spending environment over the next 12 to 18 months.

92861,21168,2008-08-27T05:58:26-04:00,,"Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) has overhauled its flagship presentation server product, promising IT operators higher performance and lower costs, while improving the end-user experience. The company this week announced Citrix XenApp 5, the next generation of its application virtualization solution.The new version of XenApp, formerly the Citrix Presentation Server, combines with Citrix XenServer to create an ""end-to-end"" solution that spans servers, applications, and desktops. Companies using the new combined product can centralize applications in their datacenter and deliver them as on-demand services to both physical and virtual desktops.Virtualization, while not a new technology, has currently been gaining a huge head of steam, as companies realize the deployment, maintenance, and security benefits of central control across nearly all applications, while also providing businesses with agile and flexible solutions.In my thinking, virtualization is allowing the best of the old (central command and control) with the new (user flexibility and ease of innovation). Virtualizing broadly places more emphasis on the datacenter and less on the client, without the end user even knowing it.What's more, from a productivity standpoint, the end users gain by having app and OS updates and fixes done easier and faster (fewer help desk calls and waits), while operators can exercise the security constraints they need (data stays on the server), and developers need only target the server deployments (local processing is over-rated).And, of course, virtualization far better aligns IT resources supply with demand, removing wasted utilization capacity while allowing for more flexibility in ramping up or down on specific applications or data demands. Works for me. Currently, most IT operations are faced with managing myriad Windows-based applications, and are hampered by the demands of installing, patching, updating, and removing those applications. Many users have simplified the task and lowered cost by using server-based deployment. We'll see a lot more of this, and that includes more uptake in the use of desktop virtualization, but that's another topic for another day.According to Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based Citrix, version 5 of XenApp, which includes more than 50 major enhancements, can improve application start-up time by a factor of 10 and reduces applications preparation and maintenance by 25 percent.Of the major new features, I like the support for more Windows apps and compatibility with Microsoft AppV (formerly Softgrid), the HTTP streaming support, the IPV6 support, as well as the improved performance monitoring and load balancing. Also very nice is the ""inter-isolation communication,"" which allows each app to be isolated and also aggregated as if installed locally. Add to that the ability of the apps to communicate locally, such as cut and paste. Think of it as OLE for the virtualized app set (finally).I've been watching Citrix since it took the bold step of acquiring XenSource just a little over a year ago. At that time, I saw the potential for its move to gobble a piece of the virtualization pie:The new XenApp 5 release is being featured on Sept. 9 as part of a global, online launch event called Citrix Delivery Center Live! This virtual event is the first in a series that will take place in the second half of 2008 highlighting the entire Citrix Delivery Center product family. This debut event features presentations, chat sessions and online demos from Citrix, as well as participation from key partners such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). I'm also looking forward to attending Citrix's annual analyst conference in Phoenix on Sept. 9.XenApp 5, which runs on the Microsoft Windows Server platform, leverages all the enhancements in Windows Server 2008 and fully supports Windows Server 2003. This enables existing Windows Server 2003 customers to immediately deploy Windows Server 2008 into their existing XenApp environments in any mix.XenApp 5 will be available Sept. 10. For North America, suggested retail pricing is per concurrent user [CCU] and includes one year of Subscription Advantage, the Citrix program that provides updates during the term of the contract:Standalone pricing for client-side application streaming and virtualization begins as low as $60 per CCU. TCO for virtualized apps will over time continue to fall, a nice effect for all concerned."

Over the last few months it seems that the consensus view of Citrix has been to steer clear of the stock due to a lack of catalysts. On April 22 BMO Capital Markets downgraded Citrix to Market Perform as their survey of Citrix resellers suggests lackluster sales execution in Q1 and a less favorable 12-month outlook than their survey last quarter. As such, BMO doesn’t think the recent bounce in Citrix’s stock is underpinned by improving fundamentals. The firm cut their estimates as XenServer revenue is proving more difficult to materialize, XenDesktop revenue are not likely to ramp meaningfully until 2010, and NetScaler demand remains weak. On March 24 PacCrest downgraded the stock to Sector Perform, citing weak sales trends, saying larger deals are being delayed, canceled or reduced. The firm noted that there was no immediate catalyst to spark a surge in share price. The firm expects Q1 revenue of $355M and 29c. Thomas Weisel earlier had also downgraded Citrix to Market Weight, saying it was more expensive than other technology companies. Weisel said Citrix shares are fairly valued at their $26 price target. Stifel's Q1 revenue forecast assumes a 20% y/y decline in license revenue and reminds investors of management's history of conservative guidance. Stifel says feedback from checks seems mixed, as has been the case for the last several quarters.

Within this segment, Kaufman forecasts XenApp to decline 5% YoY and account for 22% of total revenue. They also expect $6M from XenSource, and modeling Online Services to grow 20% YoY to $67M. Kaufman's gross margin expectation is 89.6%, which is a 130 bps sequential improvement and in line with the company's historic gross margins. The slight expansion should be due to improvement in XenSource and NetScaler, which carry a lower gross margin than XenAppr.

72639,21168,2008-04-17T05:33:27-04:00,,"Heralding a new era for desktop as a service (DaaS), the long-awaited XenDesktop line from Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) will become available during the Citrix Synergy 2008 conference in mid-May. The XenDesktop product line is the latest entry in the effervescent virtualization market and will be co-marketed with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). With the XenDesktop, companies can virtualize entire Windows desktop instances from their data centers and deliver them on-demand as a service to any workers with a web browser and broadband. General good guy and fellow ZDNet blogger Dan Kusnetzky has a post on XenDesktop too. With
current PC software management, updating and upkeep costing some $5,000
per user seat annually (and that's low for many companies), according
to some industry experts, Citrix is predicting a saving of up to 40
percent in PC desktop TCO using the virtualized server delivery and on
demand UI approach. Because the Citrix DaaS system dynamically
assembles each user's personal desktop image from fresh software
components each time the user logs in, updates and upgrades are
seamless -- for the operating system and applications. Management
centrally saves from help desk calls and visits to the physical
location of the PCs. Combined with remote access, PCs may never feel
the warm touch of an IT admin or help desk steward once its out of its
shipping crate, if then.  The system separates applications from the desktop OS and provisions them independently at runtime
from new master images. Each time they log in, users get a fresh
desktop that is more secure, personalized, and free from corruption and
conflicts. A high-speed delivery protocol provides instant access to
desktops and applications over any network, no matter how far users are
from the data center. That means near-instant boot-ups.  From an
administration viewpoint, managing desktops and applications
separately, and combining them only at runtime, allows IT to maintain a
single master Windows desktop OS image for all users, rather than fully
loaded desktop virtual machines for each employee. This also simplifies
lifecycle management. And Microsoft still get its CAL, but saves the enterprise on the PC TCO at the same time. Why
didn't they think of this sooner? Guess MSFT had other things on its
mind other than helping out its customers with the high cost of
computing. I guess we're glad Citrix and others forced their hand. And so how about that $500 PC thin client market, eh? I'm Wyse to that. HP (NYSE:HPQ) likes it too. What's
more, Microsoft is also perhaps embracing DaaS now so to diminish the
market opportunity for non-Windows thin clients, and the DaaS delivery
of Linux and Unix (Open BSD) offerings. How much cheaper would
non-Windows PC TCO be when the delivery's via DaaS? Probably not enough
to energize that market. There's always the SaaS and cloud markets,
however, to keep MSFT busy on the commoditization front. I tagged Citrix and its desktop virtualization as a powerful market disrupter about six months ago and it seems to be living up to its promise. As I said then:The desktop as a service market has been bubbling vigorously lately. Just over a week ago, MokaFive announced its desktop virtualization product, which combines cloud computing with local execution. And I expect news any day now from Desktone, which is aiming for many of the same values that Citrix is delivering with XenDesktop -- but to service providers
so that an ecology for DaaS can develop to homes and small businesses
(and maybe enterprises too). The Desktone approach gives the tools to
deliver DaaS to, say, your telephone company so they can offer a PC as
a service at a flat fee per month. More on that later. Incidentally,
Citrix is an investor in Desktone, so they see eye to eye on a lot of
this. The XenDesktop comes in three editions: Platinum, which offers the most flexible user access, performance monitoring and quality of service (QoS)
capabilities, and remote virtual desktop support; Enterprise, an
integrated system for cost-effective scalability; and Standard, the
entry-level product. Pricing will begin at $75 per concurrent user. Details about requirements can be found at the XenDesktop Web site. Until May 20, XenDesktop is available as a public beta and can be downloaded from the Citrix site."

Wyse is also partnering with Citrix, but I didn't see any mention of Flash (perhaps in a genuflection to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)?).Management of VDI is also simplified in XenDesktop 3 with a fully integrated profile management, which provides a consistent personalized experience for each user every time they log in.The new features include broad support for smart-card security, which moves virtual desktop capability in those markets -- government, financial services, and healthcare -- that rely on smart-card authentication. Rounding out the new XenDesktop capabilities is USB plug-and-play capability for transparent support of all types of local devices, including digital cameras, smart phones, MP3 players, and scanners.I'm a big fan of VDI and think it offers even more in a strapped economy. If netbooks are all the rage, then why not VDI too (or VDI on older PCs that can't well run Vista or Windows 7?)Also announced Wednesday was the HDX high-definition technology, which adds enhancements for multimedia, voice, video, and 3D graphics. It also includes “adaptive orchestration” technology that senses underlying capabilities in the data center, network and device, and dynamically optimizes performance across the end-to-end delivery system to fit each unique user scenario. This allows HDX-enabled products to leverage the latest user experience innovations developed by third-party software, server, device and processor partners.Six categories of HDX technologies work together to provide multimedia capability. These include a broad range of new and existing technologies that extend throughout the Citrix Delivery Center product family.Citrix XenDesktop 3 will be generally available from authorized Citrix partners this month, and from the Citrix website. Suggested retail pricing begins at $75 per concurrent user."

lays out the bull case. Although profit margins are going down next
year, it’s all for the good. “some investor patience will be required
in the next few quarters as investments ramp for XenSource and other
initiatives,” he writes in a note this morning. “Although margins are
expected to decline in F2008, we believe that the magnitude of the
addressable market justifies the resources being allocated.” His
estimate revisions are going in two different directions today, with
projected sales in 2008 for Citrix and XenSource, combined, rising to
$1.606 billion from $1.536 billion, while his profit estimate falls to
$1.64 from $1.83. Oof. Misek thinks the stock has upside to $50 and has
a Buy rating on the shares. He notes that at about $40, the stock
trades at 27 times the next four quarters’ earnings, which by his
estimate is below the 28 times multiple, on average, of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Sun Microsystems (NASDAQ:SUNW), Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), and F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV). And the bear case comes from Daniel Ives with Friedman Billings Ramsey.
In a note this morning, he writes that the company’s “solid” third
quarter was noteworthy for the strong rise in license sales, which
shows the company’s latest version of its main product for software
virtualization is able to “tap into [Citrix’s] massive installed base”
of clients. But, he concedes, the company is in “investor detention
hall” today because of the company’s projection of operating profit in
the “low 20s” as a percentage of sales, next year, versus Street
expectations for mid-20s operating profit, mainly because of added
costs from the acquisition of XenSource, writes Ives. “This dynamic
could spook some investors that may have to wait until 2009 to see
operating margins return to more normalized levels.” He’s raising his
price target on the stock from $36 to $42 to reflect higher sales
growth in the company’s main product line, but is keeping a Market
Perform rating on the stock. That $42 would represent 27 times his
profit per share estimate of $1.56 in 2008."

Sales of $350 million and profit per share of 41 cents, excluding some costs, was above analysts consensus forecast of $339.7 million and 38 cents. The outlook for the fourth quarter calls for sales in a range of $374 to $382 million, above a mean estimate of $373.1 million. But the forecast profit per share range of 42 to 43 cents is just shy of the 45 cents analyst are projecting, on average. That 42 to 43 cents, by the way, excludes a 10-cent charge the company is taking to write off some of the value of software vendor Xensource, which Citrix announced it would acquire in August.No word in the press release on any stock buybacks Citrix might be contemplating, about which there’s been recent speculation.The company’s conference call with analysts is here.Citrix shares are down 3.5% at $40.30 after falling fractionally during the normal session.CTXS 1-yr chart:"

Overall, they are hearing strong deal flow for Presentation Server (with continued Platinum adoption), strong NetScaler business, and implementations of Xen Desktop. Specifically, they have uncovered a few large NetScaler deals in EMEA with large internet companies, and one sizable transaction with a US-based financial institution. Regionally, checks in EMEA have come back with confidence in achieving revenue ahead of plan with strong UK contribution, while the US is also slightly ahead with large deals in financial institutions. Bottom line, RBC believes there is a strong possibility of upside to Street estimates of $380.2M/$0.43 (RBC estimates $378.3M/$0.42) and managements guidance of $374M-$382M/$0.42-$0.43.

38936,20521,2007-06-20T13:56:43-04:00,,"I have recently written several pieces on the Enterprise 3.0 and the Extended Enterprise trend. In this article, I am going to cover a company that aligns well with the trends of collaboration and the Extended Enterprise, a space that has really heated up of late, following Cisco’s acquisition of Webex.  Today, businesses are no longer limited to one location or office. Employees need to access data while on the move or even while working from home. More and more work is being outsourced and there is a need to share and access data and applications throughout the extended e(n/x)terprise. Citrix (Nasdaq: CTXS) provides this flexibility of working from anywhere while ensuring the security of the data. It provides solutions that can control how users connect and how they access and use applications from various locations. Citrix seems to have cracked the Extended Enterprise phenomenon by extending the enterprise beyond its physical walls. Citrix provides on-demand applications for remote desktop access, Web conferencing, and online collaboration. Its products include Citrix® GoToMyPC® for secure remote PC access, Citrix® GoToAssist™ for live remote support, Citrix® GoToMeeting® for online meetings, and Citrix® GoToWebinar™ for Web events. Citrix® GoToWebinar™ won the 2006 Frost & Sullivan award for “Best New Web Conferencing Service” along with awards from LAPTOP Magazine Editors’ Choice, TMC Labs Innovation. It also won the 2007 SC Magazine Reader Trust Award for IPSec/SSL VPN Solution. Though there are numerous competitors for individual Citrix products, as an integrated provider of on-demand access to networks, data, and applications, the company’s position is strong. Citrix has been aggressive in acquiring complimentary technology to maintain its leadership position. Major acquisitions include Expertcity (2003), Net6 (2004), Netscalar (2005), Reflectent (2006) and Orbital Data (2006). In the first quarter of 2007, Citrix acquired Ardence Inc. to improve its application delivery infrastructure for Windows-based applications. For fiscal year 2006, Citrix reported annual revenues of $1.134 billion, compared to $909 million in 2005, a 25% increase. For fiscal year 2007, the company expects net revenues to be around $1.31 billion. For the first quarter of 2007, Citrix reported revenues of $308 million, compared to $260 million in the first quarter of 2006, an 18% revenue growth. Its stock has done well, especially in 2007. Its current market cap is $6.19 billion with its stock trading around $34. Furthermore, SAP and Oracle are 2 large companies in the Enterprise Software space who need a serious collaboration strategy that includes Web Conferencing, Desktop Sharing, and such, and Citrix can be an excellent acquisition for either of them.

40062,20521,2007-07-03T15:12:13-04:00,,"I recently wrote about Citrix being an acquisition target for Oracle on the grounds of their on-demand collaboration product suite. Since then, I did a bit of digging on the numbers for the Citrix Online business. Whereas Citrix (NASDAQ: CTXS) is primarily an enterprise software company with: Citrix Online is a much higher growth business with: Today, Citrix Online constitutes 25% of the Citrix business, and in Q1 2007, scored triple digit growth with $50 Million in revenues.   One of the reasons I have always liked the online collaboration space very much is that it truly saves huge costs of doing business. Business travel is not only very expensive, it is also extremely tedious. Flying somewhere for a 2-3 hour meeting has just become an unpleasant experience due to waiting time, rampant flight delays, etc. It also thoroughly disrupts quality of life. However, on the other end of the trend spectrum, we have globalization and outsourcing - working with people elsewhere, on another continent, has become routine. Web Conferencing and real-time collaboration, including desktop sharing, offers a very nice compromise between the two extremes - flying all the time, and not communicating enough. I expect, therefore, that Web Conferencing and Real-Time Collaboration will become standard fare in every business workflow within the next decade, if not sooner. The Extended Enterprise trend makes it even more compelling. Citrix Online is well-aligned with the market trends, and will probably become an even larger percentage of the overall Citrix portfolio within the next 18 months, offering up some interesting options to the company. One such option is to roll-up the Enterprise 3.0 players to build a larger SaaS play. A roll-up of Citrix, Rightnow, Omniture, Taleo, Concur, etc. would be an interesting way to consolidate the space, and for the time being, stave off Oracle. CTXS 1-yr. chart:"
24986,20454,2007-01-24T07:51:20-05:00,,"Mostly positive comments on Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) following Q4 results:
- JP Morgan notes there is some hair here--but this is a much better outcome than most expected and CTXS should trade well.
At first blush, the results and guidance look strong across the board with the exception of operating margins, where CTXS has been historically inconsistent. Q4 earnings of $0.39 exceeded consensus of $0.38 with about $0.01 from repurchase activity and operating margins of 26.7% were below 27.6% estimate. Deferred revenue of $356M was ahead of $349M estimate while CFO of $97M exceeded firm's $82M target.
The stronger license is likely a result of the direct business-where firm's checks were stronger and should provide comfort that there is some stabilization in the core App. Virtualization business, which should enable mgmt. to maintain growth targets for the App Virtualization-key for CTXS to

emerge from its transition post Q107. They also believe ANG was solid vs. $28M target.
Guidance encapsulates Q1-which most viewed as a key risk heading into the quarter--and should enable consensus estimates to modestly move higher, and leave room for further upwards earnings revisions through the year.
Shares traded at 20.7x JPM's CY07 $1.55 in the after market, still below group average of 22-24x.



- Merrill Lynch notes Citrix delivered modest 4Q06 EPS upside, while across-the-board YoY license strength should temper lingering pessimism over Presentation Server. The robust product pipeline supports firm's conviction in Citrix' portfolio strategy, while added distribution breadth could underpin potential for appreciation in the shares.
Citrix' 4Q results suggest at least part of the weakness in Presentation Server in 3Q may have been execution related - which is easier to remedy than a secular decline. ML thinks management understands the need to maintain focus while expanding the product portfolio both organically and through acquisitions. Looking forward they expect a steady calendar of new product launches and new introductions to the channel beginning with the Partner Summit later this month. They continue to like the story and the stock and would be aggressive buyers at current levels.
Reits Buy and $39 tgt.
- Goldman Sachs notes Citrix Systems reported strong 4Q results, with core Application Virtualization business growing 11% in the quarter with license revenue growth of 2% year-over-year. The bear case had largely revolved around potential yoy declines, and thus the report should help bolster the belief that new use cases such as outsourcing, disaster recovery, and potentially even Vista upgrades for enterprises could drive low-mid-single-digit growth here.
Results should prove to be a positive for the stock, which has already rebounded significantly from its December lows when fears of Application Virtualization weakness were strongest. That said, they see plenty of new product releases and upgrades to carry performance higher from here. Firm's EPS estimates for FY07 and FY08 are $1.55 and $1.77 (ex-ESOs), compared to $1.55 and $1.76 previously.
- Stifel thinks there are not a lot of negatives but they believe that some could be disappointed in the lack of upside to EPS estimates for 2007 in the face of a higher 2007 revenue outlook along with the overall lack of margin expansion flavor in the story. Voluntary stock option investigation a minor negative but their sense is that the market cares less and less about stock option issues with each passing day.
Maintains Hold rating. The firm notes they clearly missed a short-term buying opportunity with early January concern about how 4Q would play out. At this point, they don't see any major near-term catalysts that would yield a meaningful acceleration in Citrix's growth and yield upside to estimates though a number of initiatives could prove interesting in terms of the 2008 outlook. They also don't believe that the shares will likely experience any significant multiple expansion in the near term.
Notablecalls: Waterpistol to the head, I think we will see an initial surge of short covering after the open, followed by a sizable pullback. But that's a low conviction call. The results were surprisingly good."

20117,20149,2006-11-08T05:12:57-05:00,,"Software maker Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) was one of the ten stocks I highlighted on our 2006 Peridot Capital Select List (which, by the way, has returned 18% year to date). After posting a gain of 40% through the first six months of the year, in my Select List Mid-Year Update I recommended investors take their profits as the stock traded above $40 per share. It appears that we are getting another chance to make money in the name. After an earnings disappointment, Citrix is trading back down to $28 and change, which is where I recommended purchase at the beginning of the year. Given that the company has the ability to grow sales and earnings at a low to mid double digit rate, the current valuation looks very attractive. Estimates for calendar year 2007 stand at about $1.50 per share. The company's balance sheet is pristine, with no debt and $736 million in cash, which equates to $4 per share in net cash. So, investors buying CTXS at $28 are getting a stock with an enterprise value of only $24 and $1.50 in earnings power. This equates to a 16 forward P/E multiple, which in my view is too pessimistic given Citrix's growth outlook. I would expect Citrix shares to head well into the thirties again during 2007, and as a result, suggest investors reenter the stock. Evidently, CTXS management agrees the shares are undervalued, as they just announced a new $300 million share repurchase authorization.

44692,20307,2007-08-16T06:58:18-04:00,,"Exactly one day after VMware’s (NYSE:VMW) mammoth IPO, Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) announced a deal to buy privately held XenSource for about $500 million in cash and stock, including the assumption of about $107 million in unvested stock options. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
XenSource provides open source server and desktop virtualization software. Along with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), it is viewed as one of a handful of companies that poses any competitive threat to VMware’s domination of the virtualization software market. The release, interestingly, stressed that the deal will “strengthen each company’s strong partnership with Microsoft and commitment to the Windows platform.” They even have a quote in the release from Bob Muglia, Microsoft’s SVP for the server and tools business, describing how “exciting” the deal is.
Citrix said the deal should add about $50 million in revenue and $60 million to $70 million total cost of revenue and operating expenses in 2008. The company also will take a non-cash charge of $8 million to $10 million to write-off in process R&D. In 2007, the company said, the acquisition is expected to add about $1 million in revenue and $3 million to cost of revenue and operating expenses.
According to XenSource’s web site, the company raised $41.5 million in venture capital; investors included Kleiner Perkins, Accel Partners, Ignition Partners, New Enterprise Associates and Sevin Rosen Funds.
Some interesting comments on the deal Wednesday morning come from analysts William Fellows, Rachel Chalmers and John Abbott of the research firm the 451 Group. They note that Citrix built its core application delivery infrastructure business “on the back of its access to Microsoft source code.” XenSource, they note, in 2006 cut an exclusive deal for access to Microsoft’s forthcoming Viridian “hypervisor” (I’m been seeing that word a lot the last two days; Wikipedia defined hypervisor as “a virtualization platform that allows multiple operating systems to run on a host computer at the same time”). XenSource’s access to Viridian, they say, “is a key driver for this deal.”
“For Citrix, Viridian becomes the base operating system component for its next business,” the 451 analysts write. 
The 451 analysts also ask whether the deal could be prelude to Microsoft buying Citrix. “That way, Microsoft distances itself from the awkward GPL aspects of what XenSource does, fuses it own server consolidation story into a credible ‘virtualization desktop utility’ stack, and - not least - gets its hands on the lucrative $1 billion enterprise Windows revenue now generated by Presentation Server [which is Citrix’s lead product.]” They say other potential buyers for Citrix would include Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ).
Finally, the 451 analysts offer this juicy tidbit:"
31964,20657,2007-04-11T04:29:56-04:00,,"Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) is an enterprise infrastructure software company with revenues of ~$1.1B and an installed base of 180,000+ enterprise clients. The SAM at ~2.7B grows at a rate of ~25% YOY. Citrix sells into three product categories – app virtualization, app networking and online services. Citrix is mostly known for its application virtualization solutions. Application virtualization is a $1B+ market growing 10-15% YOY; Citrix is the market leader with ~$800mm virtualization revenue in 2006(75% of revenue). Virtualization brings in mostly license revenue with high 90% margins. Virtualization enables applications to run centrally at a data center, and be viewed remotely by users through dumb terminals. In a data driven world, it is critical to protect corporate data and ensure that only authenticated personnel can access or utilize the data. It’s also cost efficient to deploy applications centrally, for ease of IT management. Workers can enjoy a great desktop experience while avoiding many of the traditional disadvantages like theft, viruses, extended downtime, or having the rebuild preferences after a research cycle. This solution is particularly timely, as many customers consider their plans for migration to new Windows platforms. App networking (10% revenue) represents a $1B+ market growing 30-35% yoy. App networking includes products like Netscaler, Wanscaler etc that accelerate applications in a LAN or WAN environment. Citrix competes against companies like F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Riverbed (NASDAQ:RVBD) in the space. Riverbed has the best Wanscaler in the industry – but they sell into the networking group within companies. Talking to IT managers at large corporations makes me believe that the Wanscaler market growth will be driven quite a bit by application groups; essentially people who get called when applications get slow. Hence this is an opportunity for Citrix in their embedded customer base. Online service, which is 13% of revenue, is a $750mm opportunity with a 20-25% growth rate. Online service includes a host of applications delivered on a SAAS (software as a service) model. Products include GoToPC, GoToMeeting etc. Citrix competes with WebEx (acquired by Cisco) in the space –I believe WebEx is the high-end online meeting provider and Citrix is the SMB no-frills+low-cost provider.  In short, Citrix is a market leader in the high margin virtualization space that’s growing annually at 10-15%. The Presentation Server [PS], a virtualization product, is the largest revenue component – 67% of total 2006 revenue, down from 75% in 2005. The PS brings in two streams of revenue - License and Update revenue.  PS accounted for 71% of Software License revenue FY-2006. License revenue represents the PS subscription fee – it has an 80% renewal rate. Update revenue (called Subscriber Advantage or SA program) is a 12-24 month contract fee that subscribers pay to get subsequent product upgrades for free. 50-60% of the subscriber base has purchased the SA program. Renewal rates are at 70% for SA. The SA typically is 20% of the initial license revenue and constitutes 90% of deferred revenue. This is a high margin, high visibility revenue stream - the balance sheet deferred revenue component will keep increasing qoq through 2009. Starting 2007, sales force will target the lapsed presentation server license customer base (clients who bought PS before and never renewed) which represents a potential opportunity of $400mm to $1B. Citrix also has introduced a new release of the presentation server at a higher ASP (5% ASP increase). The sales force commission structure has been tweaked to motivate people to sell higher revenue package by June 07. The combination of selling higher ASP products, increasing renewal rates in licensing, getting more subscribers to purchase the SA program and getting old clients back into the product will grow software license revenue 7% FY-07 and 08. SA revenue will increase 20% YOY in 07 & 08. The market is fixated on the large presentation server revenue component that Citrix has. However, understand that this revenue component has steadily declined over the years, and will continue to do so going forward. This company has high margin revenue, low capex and will generate increasing free cash going forward. Citrix has ~$6B in market cap, ~$800mm in cash and has no debt. The company will generate ~1B+ in free cash over the next 3 years. Street estimates CTXS to do 1.307 and 1.487 in 07 & 08 respectively (I expect guidance to be upped quite a bit). I believe that the company will beat estimates for Q1-07. The momentum in SA revenue coupled with growth in networking products will bring about upward revenue revisions for 08. Citrix will earn $2 in 2008; I expect the stock to trade at $40, 20x 08-earnings. The stock currently trades at $33 ( 16x 08 earnings). Disclosure: Author is long CTXS"

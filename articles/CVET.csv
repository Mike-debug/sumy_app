We did so in this article, here. Rather, this article will serve as a brief refresher on the company and our thesis, followed by a review of the notable events that happened following our last article, along with a review of the most recent earnings release.We strongly encourage readers to follow the link above for a comprehensive overview of the business model and our take on the stock. If you've done so already, feel free to skip this next section. For readers with an emphasis on brevity, we offer the following summary:Moreover, we believe investors do not understand the underlying attractiveness of the legacy HS Animal Health business. This business is #2 in a consolidated industry, enjoys significant competitive advantages, and generates copious amounts of free cash. The business is integral to vet practices, offering supply chain management, practice management software, and a comprehensive product suite supplying vet practices with pharmaceuticals, equipment, and more than 150k SKUs. This segment is a market leader, providing over 100,000 Vets with their supply chain services. Over 90% of American-located vets use this business. The market seemed oblivious to this, as investors were likely overly focused on the short-term reduction in guidance - not the quality asset that CVET is.Well, a little and a lot. Insofar as the business is concerned, not a lot. CVET took ~$1 billion goodwill impairment charge, all non-cash, that was solely a result of the stock price drop. Aside from that, the numbers didn't look terrible (more below). However, following the publication of our last article, CVET announced that Ben Shaw - founder and CEO of VFC prior to the merger & CEO of CVET - had ""stepped down"" (been fired) effective immediately. He was replaced by Benjamin Wolin, who was previously a member of the Covetrus board. While we would have remained content allowing Shaw more time to turn the situation around, given that the company was facing pressure from its shareholders, it's understandable why the board chose to act in the manner they did. We think Wolin is a fine replacement as acting CEO, having prior experience on several boards, being associated with CVET since the merger, and successfully founded Everyday Health - remaining CEO for 15 years during which he took the company public and then successfully sold it.Wolin has only been running the show for 1 month now, so we won't venture to comment on his performance given the short duration of his tenure. Nonetheless, he did offer some color on what led to Shaw being ousted as CEO, commenting on the conference call:They basically bit off more than they could chew and couldn't integrate the mish mash of companies on such a short time scale. We would like to remind readers that Covetrus wasn't simply the merger between two businesses; rather, the HS Animal Health business represented over 30 different businesses that have been consolidated over the past decade. A $4 billion globally-integrated supply chain business is a completely different animal than a couple hundred million dollar start up that Shaw was running prior to the merger. We don't blame him and we don't even think he's incompetent - sometimes the dice just don't roll your way.Now that we're up to speed on recent events, let's review Q3 financial results. In the quarter, Covetrus:By our estimation, that's a strong quarter. The market in the near term has agreed, as the stock sharply rebounded off the lows of ~$8 to the current price of ~$14. This was largely a relief rally, as following the news of Shaw's departure the stock faced maximum pessimism. Any news that wasn't the equivalent to ""the world is ending"" was likely to be viewed as favorable by the market.With that said, we're pleased with the results. VFC is accelerating its top-line growth, and well on its way to capturing 10,000 vet practices by year end. The HS Animal Health distribution business remains steady and profitable. Despite the market's infatuation with high-flyers like Chewy (CHWY), CVET's main business remains resilient.Wrapping up, CVET remains the dominant business that it has been for the past decade, VFC is rapidly growing, and management looks well on its way to restoring trust with the market. With the current EV being ~$2,750 million, and FY'19 EBITDA projected to be $195 million, the stock is trading slightly less than 14x on an EV/EBITDA basis. We remain long."
4297877,103910,2019-10-25T10:00:00-04:00,"Based on the implied valuation for VFC from the merger, the distribution business is being valued substantially below peers (~5X EBITDA), multiples not seen even in the financial crisis.While there have been some headwinds in the legacy distribution business, VFC (prescription management software) is still operating on all cylinders with 46% top-line growth (y/y; last Q) and vast white space on international growth opportunities.Headwinds on the distribution business are manageable, and year-over-year comps should improve substantially in 2020 versus very difficult '18->'19 comps.Optically, this is a growth business that just had a negative four percent top-line quarter. However, if one can look past the noise created by the merger, this is a business that has underlying organic growth in the +2-3% range this year, and in 2020 and beyond, a sales growth profile in the mid to high-single digits with corresponding double-digit EBITDA growth.","This article was selected to be shared with PRO+ subscribers, who also got 7 days' exclusive access to CDM Capital's original Top Idea on Covetrus (NASDAQ:CVET). Find out more about PRO+ here.Seeking Alpha: Can you briefly summarize your bullish thesis for readers who may not have seen it yet?CDM Capital: Let me start by saying Covetrus is one of the more compelling investments I've come across in the past few years. The dislocation is striking given the overall quality of the business.Covetrus is a newly-created entity through a Reverse Morris Trust (""RMT"") transaction from the spin-off of Henry Schein's ((HSIC); 63% ownership) Animal Health distribution business (HSAH) combined with Vets First Choice (VFC; 37%) in a non-taxable spin. Covetrus exhibits many of the typical spin dynamics that investors find in special situations, including a parent spin-off size mismatch, vastly different growth and perceived risk profiles and a reclassification from S&P 500 to the S&P MidCap 400. It is likely that the existing investor base in Henry Schein preferred the more diversified distribution business (dental and animal health) versus the more levered and higher-growth profile of Covetrus, which includes a significant software component. The situation to us has many similarities to Chemours (CC) after the spin-off from DuPont (DD), where the narrative was that the parent company had saddled Chemours with an overwhelming amount of debt. It was clear most investors did not understand the quality of the business or its industry-leading position, as investors voted with their feet and sold the stock down ~80% within seven months, similar to what happened at Covetrus. Just over a year and a half later, the stock rose over fifteen-fold off the lows in early 2016. While we don't necessarily think the short-term upside exists to that degree at Covetrus, we think, in a couple of years, Covetrus could easily be worth 3-5x its current valuation.For example, if one gives a reasonably conservative valuation for Vets First Choice (growing 46% y/y), at 4x sales, the animal health distribution business is being valued at roughly 4x EBITDA. At 4x EBITDA, that is half the valuation of a lower quality distribution comp, Patterson (PDCO). At no point have any of the distribution peers ever traded at those multiples, not even during the height of the financial crisis.Since hitting an all-time high of $50 back in February, the stock has essentially been on a straight line down, falling around 78% off its peak. Optically, the most recent quarter looked like a disaster, as pro forma sales were down 4%, but if one adjusts for foreign exchange headwinds, North American and Brexit weakness, and the previously announced customer losses, organic growth in the quarter would have been +2%.Given the initial hiccups at Covetrus, we think many investors who are not familiar with the long-term story essentially tapped out in the past few months. While management is not innocent, we think many of the issues affecting Covetrus have to do with external forces out of its control. Our view is the sell-off is due to a combination of factors, including: investor base turnover after the HSIC spin-off, index fund selling/repositioning, slowing U.S. Veterinarian visits, Brexit, lack of sell-side coverage, lost customers, complexities/delays with CVET filing its first 10-Q, large FX headwinds, high debt levels post-RMT dividend, noisy financials resulting from one-time integration costs, and heavy merger-related investments. Given some of the positive secular trends in the animal health space, investors had high hopes, with a compelling combination and IPO isolating the faster-growing animal health segment from HSIC. To summarize, management totally underestimated the complexity of all the integration challenges, accounting changes, and one-time costs needed to unify the platform under one entity. All these items in some way have masked what we believe is a great business that has significant long-term competitive advantages over peers, none of which are being valued today.On a normalization of the operating trends (LSD top-line and HSD EBITDA growth) and 50% of the synergy realizations, we think Covetrus trades in the low $20s. Our more bullish case is if Covetrus can sustain mid-to-high single-digit sales growth in tandem with double-digit EBITDA growth while delevering the balance sheet (capturing > 80% of the synergy target). In this scenario, we believe the shares could trade in the low-to-mid $30s, essentially where the stock traded 6 months ago.SA: Can you discuss the limitations of quants/algos as it relates to value investing - what are they really good (and not so good) at compared to a human PM? It seems they would not be able to put this story together as you have given the number of moving parts, temporary headwinds, etc.CDM: Quant investing/trading typically avoid securities that lack liquidity, transparent financials, and appropriate size - all of which are characteristics present in spin-offs.Thus, spin-offs are typically fertile ground for fundamental investors due to temporary imbalances in supply and demand of the shares of the spun-off unit, with supply exceeding demand. Furthermore, a lack of sell-side coverage commonly dampens the understanding of the new entity thus creating even more confusion from investors. Additionally, there are frequently one-time costs, such as integration or separation expenses associated with the spun-off unit that creates short-term noise in the financials. Thus, investors frequently overreact to any hint of variability in the results even if these temporary fluctuations normalize over time.Typically new spin-offs aren't picked up by quants for some time as the financial trends are not in place to get a multi-year estimate of profit and sales growth trajectory. Given that pro-forma adjustments are needed and disclosure changes can make the analysis from parent to spin convoluted. On top of this, a complex spin such as Covetrus' RMT transaction with so many moving pieces is even more difficult due to the merger creating noise around the financials. From a quant perspective, it would be quite difficult to reconcile the multitude of one-time items in both Q1 and Q2. Optically, from the point of view of a quant fund, this is a growth company that has a declining top-line profile. While that could not be further from the truth if you make adjustments for all these one-off items. Given that spin-offs have so many unique attributes that need to be analyzed individually, this makes special situations as one of the few areas in the investing universe that is still fruitful for fundamental analysts.SA: In general, do you think investors undervalue (and therefore create mispricings in) distribution businesses because they think they are only (using your words) ""moving items from location A to location B"" when in reality it's a lot more complicated than that?CDM: When I first mention an animal health distribution business most people immediately think it is an antiquated and basic business, something similar to delivering Coca-Cola or Frito-Lay snacks. When in reality it is highly complex both in scope and scale, much like the human health care market.When looking at the vet practitioner market I continue to be amazed at the depth of care at a vet clinic/hospital. Vet clinics and hospitals perform an array of services that would be the equivalent of roughly 5-10 specialty offices in a human healthcare market setting. For instance, many vets have in-house laboratory testing, full dental, radiology, diagnostics (ultrasounds, electrocardiograms), basic and specialized surgeries, overnight care, boarding facilities, fully stocked pharmacy, etc. Given the operational complexity at the practice level, distributors are dealing with an exponential amount of SKUs per practice relative to a single human healthcare practice. These items can range from basic items like gauzes and syringes to laser surgery equipment and chemotherapy drugs. Every year there are hundreds of new products hitting the market and it's the sales team's job to educate and update the vets on best practices.SA: Can you discuss the value in looking to the bond market to validate a thesis as this seems like a valuable, if underutilized, part of the due diligence process?CDM: Bond investors are usually quite skilled at assessing the probability of getting repaid, their foremost concern is not capital appreciation, but rather the return of capital and a decent IRR. Thus, I've developed it into one of my checklists when looking at various levered businesses. Given how the 1st liens are trading in the secondary market it is reassuring that there has been an inverse correlation with the stock price. Typically when one sees a 10%+ yield to maturity on short-dated financing it is pretty clear that there is a high degree of insolvency risk. While clearly, indications from the bond market are not a be-all end-all, this is really just another item that hints at a mispricing.While I don't want to put too much emphasis on the bond market validating the thesis, I think Covetrus is a situation where you certainly need to assess the leverage levels and triangulate how capable they are of managing over 5x leverage. It obviously depends on the type of business being analyzed as well, a commodity business with over 5x leverage is vastly different than a stable distribution business with a long history of profitability and cash generation. On top of this Covetrus has a half a billion in excess working capital which gives them some cushion while integrating. If the 1st liens were trading at 75 cents on the dollar it would give me a clue that perhaps I'm missing something. Certainly debt paydown is an important financial KPI to keep track of over the next 18 months as the thesis plays out. We think they should be able to delever about one turn in the next 18 months through a combination of synergy capture, organic EBITDA growth, and debt paydown.***Thanks to CDM Capital for the interview."
4333346,102631,2020-03-20T17:21:55-04:00,"Vet practices will use distributors over Chewy/Amazon/Walmart because they don’t do bulk orders, and longer term, seem more focused on winning the retail war - the bigger opportunity.Customers will still buy medication from the vet because of warranties, wellness plan programs, convenience, and availability.COVID-19 is having a mixed impact on foot traffic and supply orders at vet practices. Some have said they are increasing their orders and visits. Vets are considered ""essential businesses.""CVET’s equity would need to trade in the range of  $19 - $20.5 per share based on similar transaction multiples. I estimate $15 per share in the next 3-5 years.","Thesis:I would recommend buying here with a price target of $15/share over the next 3-5 years - re-evaluate if close to being achieved.The stock price and volatility certainly doesn’t reflect what I think about CVET: a stable business over the long-term with decent growth prospects and a safe price. The stock has been hammered by COVID-19, but in speaking with vet practices, the damage seems massively overdone. Chewy, Walmart, and Amazon remain competitive threats, but have yet to demonstrate an interest in vet supply distribution and seem more interested in the bigger opportunity in retail.Covetrus has several reinvestment opportunities which may help the company to continue it’s mid-single digit growth throughout COVID-19 and beyond: 1) developing their own private label brand for flea,tick, and heartworm medication 2) improving their prescription management platform 3) acquiring regional distributors to increase scale 4) winning new markets as the pet/capita ratio increases globallyBackground:Covetrus (CVET) is a $4 billion in sales global value-added distributor of animal health products and practice management software provider with over 100,000 vet clinics/hospital customers across 100 different countries. The business grew 5% annually for the last few years and the industry is projected to grow in the mid-single digits.Covetrus is the largest companion animal health distributor in the world, with only 2 other primary competitors. Their massive scale and relationships creates a competitive cost advantage against smaller distributors and barrier to entry for new competitors. The company also owns Vet’s First Source which helps practices establish their own online pharmacy. The company distributes things like pet food, headgear, sanitizer, vaccines, pharmaceuticals, dental products, syringes, wraps, etc, sourced from hundreds of different manufacturers across the globe.The vet clinic/hospital saves time and money purchasing supplies from one source. There are hundreds of different manufacturers that supply the animal health industry. Unless a single manufacturer begins producing all the things a vet practice needs, I don’t see why they wouldn’t continue using distributors. Vets also receive other benefits from CVET like client management software and a white-labeled online pharmacy called Vet’s First Source, which competes against Chewy Pharmacy and others.From a manufacturer perspective, distributors act as an outsourced sales force and logistics arm to move inventory and educate vet clinics/hospitals about new products and practices around the globe. CVET derives 50% of their revenue from the US, and are expanding internationally in Europe and Asia. Vet practices are numerous and fragmented geographically and would require a massive sales-force to interact and maintain relationships with, so it’s faster and less expensive hiring a distributor rather than hiring your own sales force.COVID-19’s impact on intrinsic value:Regarding the actual impact of COVID-19 on vet practices, in Hong Kong some practices have seen a decline of volume up to 30% based on readings of vet clinic traffic with others claiming to see increased traffic. At the same time in Italy, vet offices appear to be one of the only brick and mortar locations that are still open, along with grocery stores and pharmacies.I’ve asked several vet practices t how they are responding to COVID-19 and any impacts to their volumes and input costs to get a better sense of what is happening on the ground:“Just as busy, clients still breathing down our necks during exams. We're disinfecting surfaces more. Today I'm going to limit the number of clients in the exam room, try to go over meds and discharge from more than inches away but not sure if that's possible Many of our clients insist on being present for EVERYTHING and ""helping"" so not sure how we techs can keep anything resembling social distancing. Noone has addressed that issue. Just how to keep pens clean. not how to keep clients' breath out of your face.” “We are busy today but at the same time have now opened up curb side service for medication pick up and a lot of clients are wanting us to go grab their pet for exams and they talk to the Dr. Via phone while they stay in the car.”“I keep track of how much revenue we get by day/week/month etc... Saturday was our largest take in a year and a half...”“At least in Spain there is no obligation for them to close, so it depends on clinic owner. As far as I'm aware, here most of them are fully or partially open.”“I live in WA, where it's been awful here for weeks already and we are a few weeks ahead of everyone as far as when things started shutting down. Even dog grooming is still open....”“Maryland has declared veterinarians as essential. We are open but doing curb side only with exception for euthanasia. So far so good, pretty busy. Surprised at how many people have kept wellness appointments though.”(HONG KONG) - “some of them report that business has actually picked up because so many people have been working from home and spending more time with their pets. Some of them have even had whole families show up for appointments because it's something interesting to do with the kids! However, others have seen up to a 30% reduction in business. Some clients have postponed elective procedures or wellness visits because they don't want to leave the house unnecessarily. Others may need to tighten the belt financially so they're canceling expensive procedures.”“Clinic in endemic part of Norway here. We get a lot less visits now than usual, people are staying home mostly. We try and use Vircon (antiviral cleaning) on door handles, flat surfaces and spot that most come in contact with, hourly.”“We're starting to lose staff left and right due to quarantine. Unfortunately it seems everybody is home from their own work and have decided now is a good time to bring their pets in for all those long past- due services they've been meaning to take care of. ”“We are absolutely ordering more supplies. More gloves, more masks, more cleaning items. If we get sick, our patients don't get treated. If our clients get sick, our patients don't get cared for.”----------------“We have had some wellness appointments cancel or just no show. We have a lot of people wanting more meds at a time to reduce how often they want to come in.”The feedback is mixed, but even when we assume that 50% of earnings this year and next year will be lost due to COVID-19 disruption, and as long as CVET doesn’t go belly up, the impact to intrinsic value is minimal if earnings normalize by 2022The company has $821 million in liquidity (revolving credit facility of 281, cash of 130, and 511 in working capital) which should more than offset the 153 million in fixed cost obligations for 2020 and beyond if the company runs into trouble over the short-term. The company could cut inventory purchases to free up even more working capital if COVID-19 slows business down. They will need to refinance or pay down $960 million of their long-term debt in 2024, but for the next 4 years, they will only need to pay down 60 million annually.Online pharmacies, i.e Chewy, and OEM direct-sales, disruption?It really all comes down to whether CVET can grow earnings. The stock trades at a P/E of 5x based on my estimate of earnings in 2 years, it is clearly cheap. COVID-19 is obviously a temporary issue, so let’s focus on the longer-term. I care about COVID-19, but in order for an investment in CVET to be a home run, we need long-term earnings growth after COVID-19 is resolved. Can CVET do this?CVET has a few reinvestment opportunities that should help it grow in the mid-single digit rates for many years, such as: 1) developing their own private label brand for flea,tick, and heartworm medication 2) improving their prescription management platform 3) acquiring regional distributors to increase scale 4) winning new markets as the pet/capita ratio increases globally.CVET also has a few risks: 1) Chewy, Walmart, and Amazon start distributing veterinary supplies 2) Chewy, Walmart, and Amazon start winning market share in pharmaceuticals and 3) OEMs start selling directly to vet practices.Do the traditional animal health distributors have any special competitive characteristics to stop that from happening?Valuation:CVET currently trades around ~5x forward 2022 P/E, which is 66% below the median forward P/E of 18.5x and significantly below the transaction forward P/E of 22x for MWI’s equity in 2015.I’ve provided my projections of normalized earnings (see below) based on 1) historical margins, 2) my expectation that eventually CVET will turn their high SG&A costs related to the integration and investment in Vets First Source into economies of scale, 3) CVET will find ways to compete against online pharmacies 4) not all OEMs will sell direct to the customers 5) there will be opportunity for M&A and 6) the industry should grow around 5%:I use a simple DCF to arrive at a PT of $14.85/share by 2025 with $1.04 in EPS, for a P/E of 14x. I use a 10% discount rate and 3% nominal terminal growth.For context let’s compare valuation of peers:1) MWI - Subsidiary of ABC, was acquired in 2015 @ 15.7x NTM EBITDA, or 32x trailing P/E, for 2.5B equity value on 3B of revs, no debt, 4% EBTIDA margins and 2.4% net margins)2) AHI - Subsidiary of Patterson, was acquired in May 2015 @ 16x TTM EV/EBTIDA, for 1.1B EV on 1.5B of trailing sales and 68M of trailing EBITDA,4% EBITDA margins. The business was previously acquired in 2011 for 114M in equity and 251.4M in EV on 25.6E EBITDA or 10x fwd EV/EBITDA, but with 142M in debt, 3.2% EBITDA estimated margins, 16% gross margins, 5.1m in net income, or 22 fwd P/EIf CVET were to trade in line with some of these historical valuations, we would be looking at a PT of $19-$20 today.Conclusion:I would recommend buying here with a price target of $15/share over the next 3-5 years and re-evaluate if close to being achieved.CVET is a stable and durable business that is going for a cheap price today due to an overreaction of COVID-19. After COVID-19 passes, CVET stands a good chance to continue growing for many years. We will see if Chewy/Amazon/Walmart become more interested in vet distribution eventually, but they seem more focused on the retail opportunity for now."
4377752,50662,2020-10-06T10:00:00-04:00,"Covetrus's share price has performed very well this year.Trading at an enterprise value of 15 times the expected 2022 EBITDA, Covetrus is trading relatively expensive.The 2% free cash flow yield is also pretty low, although I understand the company is still in a growth phase.I currently have no position in Covetrus.","Covetrus (CVET) has a relatively short history as a listed company. The animal health technology and services company was spun off from Henry Schein (HSIC) in 2019. The majority of its revenue is generated in the so-called supply chain services division which offers a portfolio of products and services to vets and end-customers.Source: annual report 2019 (apologies for the bad image quality)The company's share price has been relatively flat since the company was floated in February 2019; but in the past six months, the share price has more than six-folded, giving it a current market capitalization of around $3B.Data by YChartsCovetrus reported a total revenue of almost $1.03B in the second quarter of the year which is approximately 1.5% higher than in the same quarter of FY 2019 but as its COGS increased by approximately 2%, the gross profit actually came in approximately $1M lower. And although the company was able to reduce its SG&A expenses by 1%, the operating income was still negative: the operating loss of $4M was slightly better than the operating loss of $5M in Q2 2019 but that hardly is something to be very enthusiastic about.Source: SEC filingsIn fact, the only reason why Covetrus reported a positive net income of $54M (or 40 cents per share) in the second quarter was its one-time $76M income, representing the pre-tax gain from the sale of its scil animal care business to Heska Corporation for $110M. Without this capital gain, Covetrus would have recorded a pre-tax loss of almost $20M.The sale of the division to Heska also helped to push the bottom line into the positive territory for the entire first semester as Covetrus recorded a net income of $20M or $0.15 per share for the first semester. But excluding this one-time capital gain, the net loss would have been close to around $45-50M.For those that have been following me for a longer time, you know I focus more on a company's cash flows rather than its income statement as I believe the cash flows provide a better overview of how a company is doing.In the first semester of 2020, Covetrus reported an operating cash flow of $54M, including changes in the working capital position and including a $2M payment on the preferred shares. On an adjusted basis, the operating cash flow was $58M.Source: SEC filingsAs you can see above, the total capex (excluding payments for acquisitions or related to investments) was just $24M, resulting in a positive free cash flow of approximately $34M for the quarter. Admittedly, that's better than I expected and that's entirely due to the big difference between the depreciation and amortization expenses ($94M) versus the capex ($24M). Additionally, the high expenses related to share-based compensation ($19M in H1 2020) are a non-cash expense as well. The share-based compensation doesn't result in a cash outflow but could result in a dilution further down the road, as options and bonus shares will increase the share count.I was pleasantly surprised to see Covetrus reporting positive free cash flows and I admit the balance sheet also looks a bit better than I would have expected. The company has $414M in cash on the balance sheet while it has $31M in short-term debt and approximately $1.1B in long-term debt for a net debt position of just over $710M.With a positive free cash flow and a respectable EBITDA of $70M in the first half of the year the net debt is high, but not unreasonable for a company where the average analyst expectations are pointing to an EBITDA exceeding $250M in FY 2022.Kudos to anyone who correctly identified the opportunity Covetrus offered in the first quarter of the year and I'm convinced the 52-week low of $4.05 was an absolute steal for this company. However, with the share price now having six-folded since printing the low, I don't see much more upside potential from the current level of $26/share as this already represents a market capitalization of around $3B and an enterprise value of $3.7B.With a free cash flow result of $34M in H1 2020 and an EBITDA of $70M in the same period, Covetrus now appears to be more than fully valued as the majority of its near-term growth appears to be priced in (the current enterprise value represents almost 15 times the expected FY 2022 EBITDA). I'm not a buyer at these levels as I think the risks are outweighing the potential rewards at the current share price. And although I'm bearish, I don't have a short position in Covetrus and I have no intentions to go short as the market can continue to award Covetrus with this premium to its fair value."
4277017,105080,2019-07-24T22:14:08-04:00,"Covetrus is currently trading near its 52-week low due to typical spinoff dynamics, and one-time, pre-spin organic growth headwinds.We believe that as the merger is integrated, it will become clear that in this deal, 1+1=3.We see five stages in the path to value creation at Covetrus.","The following segment was excerpted from this fund letter.Covetrus (NASDAQ:CVET) is an animal health technology and service company. Formed as a result of a Reverse Morris Trust merger transaction between Henry Schein Animal Health and venture capital backed animal health technology company Vets First Choice, Covetrus is currently trading near its 52-week low due to typical spinoff dynamics, and one-time, pre-spin organic growth headwinds. A key part of our investment process is that we must have a differentiated view, supported by our research, that we believe will eventually become widely held as earnings growth comes to fruition. With Covetrus, we believe that as the merger is integrated, it will become clear that in this deal, 1+1=3.Central to understanding the opportunity in Covetrus is understanding the business of a veterinarian. Veterinarians manage a wide variety of complex medical services for a wide variety of species, all while running laboratories, surgery centers, pharmacies, and retail stores. Covetrus helps veterinarians run their diverse businesses by simplifying the administrative tasks of the practice, while increasing coordination between medical records and prescription management technology. In simplifying the management of the practice, Covetrus not only reduces inventory and shrink, which frees up cash flow and grows margins, but more importantly, allows a veterinarian to focus on their core competency of delivering healthcare to animals, and services to pet owners.We see five stages in the path to value creation at Covetrus. First, Covetrus will increase penetration of the Vets First Choice platform across the Henry Schein Animal Health network. Vets First Choice was previously a startup in hypergrowth phase that was constrained by sales and customer service resources. The merger with Henry Schein Animal Health brings a significantly larger sales force with a relationship network that will help grow penetration from the current 8,000 practice footprint to the existing 100,000 Henry Schein Animal Health customer footprint.Second, as the Vets First Choice platform penetration grows, the addressable market grows. Addressable market growth comes from eliminating gaps in care by increasing medication compliance, from returning sales to the vet from online channels, from increasing sales of private label and compounded medication products, and from growing end markets.Third, Covetrus increases the lifetime value of the customer through increased sales and increased customer captivity. The Vets First Choice platform offers customer analytics and insights which help the vet practice grow revenue streams. In doing so, Covetrus creates opportunities to upsell products (consumables, equipment) and services (business clinics, financial services, inventory management, professional development). The increase in purchasing frequency, and increased usage of operating services raises switching costs and barriers to entry, which increases the lifetime value of the customer, effectively growing the moat around Covetrus’ business.Fourth, the maturity curve of Covetrus customer sales has a long tail of growth. Vets First Choice customers typically start slow on the platform in the first year, and then the ramp in years 1-5 shows double digit annual sales growth. Covetrus’ increased sales force and high touch service offering create value by fixing any integration issues that could potentially cause churn in the first year before the strength of the business model goes into effect.Fifth, as sales per location grow, the benefits of the distribution footprint create value. Specifically, the scale that Henry Schein Animal Health has from its position as the largest global distributor of animal veterinary products spreads the benefits of increased inventory turns across the fixed costs of 54 distribution centers worldwide, and creates more efficient truck rolls for deliveries, and the sales people who visit the 100,000 veterinary clinics every two weeks.The aforementioned self-help initiatives are all backed by secular tailwinds from increasing companion animal ownership globally, and the “humanization of pets” flywheel which feeds increased spending on pets, causing pets to live longer, further causing an increasing range and complexity of medical diagnostics, therapies, and procedures for companion animals. In conclusion, we believe that Covetrus is in the early innings of growing the moat around the business which will lead to long term compound growth in earnings and shareholder value.Editor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4296596,104893,2019-10-15T11:26:10-04:00,"CVET is the combination of Henry Schein's Animal Health business and the Vets First Choice platform.The stock has seen nonstop selling pressure since the spin and is down >75% from highs.Both businesses maintain market-leading positions.CVET is trading for less than what shareholders paid for the Vets First Choice platform alone.With a dominant distribution business combined with a high-growth B2B platform, equity holders should see double-digit growth rates in earnings and a meaningful rerating in the multiple of the stock.","Henry Schein's Animal Health business was spun-off in February of 2019 and subsequently merged with Vets First Choice via a Reverse Morris Trust, creating Covetrus (CVET). The company went on a roadshow (Capital Markets Day) that seemingly got Wall Street euphoric as right out the gate CVET was trading at > ~ 20x EBITDA multiple. Since then, the stock has seen nonstop selling pressure that culminated in the company cutting guidance on the second quarter as a standalone entity. A stub-equity that CVET was following the spin, combined with management reducing guidance led to the following:(Source: Yahoo! Finance)CVET saw a high of >$40 and is now hovering around $11/share, or is now more than 70% off the highs. Make no mistake, CVET has been a thoroughly botched spin-off as the spin coincided with a confluence of negative developments. These ranged from the loss of a $100 million contract to a competitor, to delaying its first quarterly report to work with its lawyers to file and consolidate the financials, and on the following report reducing guidance from $235-$250 million in EBITDA to ""at least"" $200 million.Investors already tend to be highly critical/apathetic of spin-offs in the first place (likely selling them as soon as they hit their account). This phenomenon is well documented, but when the company adds to the already existing skepticism by dropping the ball on the first two quarters as a standalone entity, it's little wonder why the stock has been beaten down so drastically.Nonetheless, we believe the classic time horizon arbitrage opportunity is available to investors with CVET at these prices. The reasoning is straightforward: investors seem disgusted with the company after they reduced guidance on the second quarter as a standalone entity. Wall Street hates it when new companies go on a roadshow detailing in slideshows and presentations what next year will look like then abruptly changing their tune 6 months later.We would point out to readers that we have positive historical experience with higher quality spin-offs getting trashed after reducing guidance. We wrote up Frontdoor (FTDR) in November of 2018 after the company, under similar conditions, reduced guidance and saw its stock fall by >65% from the highs. Frontdoor has more than doubled since then. Yet again, Wall Street seems to be solely focused on the reduction in short-term performance metrics instead of the long-term financial viability of the enterprise.As Vets First Choice is currently losing money at a rate of $15 million in EBITDA in FY '18 (pg. 69 of Investor Day - I'm using the figure excluding executive comp. and one-time add-backs), CVET's earning power is currently understated and VFC's value does not flow through to reported financials. At an EV/UFCF (unlevered free cash flow) multiple of ~ 14x, we believe the market is pricing CVET is such a way that has completely written-off the value of Vets First Choice.(Source: Investor's Day)In other words, even if investors didn't have exposure to the rapidly growing, industry disrupting platform that is Vets First Choice (details below), CVET still wouldn't be expensive today at a ~7% UFCF yield ($164/$2,386). Yet, investors do have exposure to VFC, which should be contributing a run-rate of $100 in EBITDA by the end of 2022 (management's guidance). At current prices, CVET offers investors an attractive entry point for an industry-leading animal health business, with a significant ""call-option"" embedded in the stock as VFC represents ~5% of sales, yet is growing rapidly and already has captured >1/3 of veterinarian practices in the US (details/sources below).With the current unlevered free cash flow yield offering a sufficient margin of safety, we think CVET is a strong buy. Earnings are likely to grow double digits moving forward, boosting investors' returns on top of the current high-single-digit earnings yield currently accruing to shareholders - offering investors an attractive risk/reward.Following the Henry Schein spin-off, Covetrus is a technology-enabled pure-play animal health business with two main segments. The first, and by far the largest, is the Animal Health distribution and services business that was formerly apart of Henry Schein. CVET leverages its supply chain infrastructure to offer clients (i.e., veterinarians) practice management software via its proprietary technology platform.CVET's platform works with veterinarians to offer data-driven insights to improve the operations of their business. Their service suite consists of practice management solutions, prescription management, pharmaceutical services, and inventory management. CVET works with veterinarians to make their practices more efficient to the end consumer, along with making the business more economical for the client. The value proposition Covetrus offers to the veterinarian practices is that of business acumen. Meaning, the people who run the vet practices aren't 'business people'. They suffer from lack of know-how and consequently have very little bargaining power with suppliers/manufactures and/or are overextended by the time-intensive administrative work that comes with running a small business.CVET works in this light to reduce the workload on any single veterinarian. The company assist their clients to reduce the minutia of mind-numbing administration tasks that's associated with running a small business. The veterinarians win as they can focus on their main job of being doctors while the pet owners win as their pets receive higher quality treatment that comes from a more focused practitioner. This, in turn, results in the vet's business becoming more efficient and better run, leading to increase in revenue and margins.(Source: Capital Markets Day)CVET is a global leader in the industry, serving 100,000 customers in over 100 countries. With ~$4 billion in revenue in FY '18, CVET's customer base includes over 90% of veterinary practices in the U.S. and close to 70% of practices in the U.K. and Australasia. The business is headquartered in Maine, and has over 5,000 employees.The Henry Schein Animal Health Business (supply-chain management) served approximately 100,000 customers in over 100 countries and had net sales of approximately of $3.6 billion for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018.The former HS Animal Health business that is now being operated by CVET is one of the world's leading supply chain management, technology and software providers to the animal health industry. This segment primarily operates the distribution of pharmaceuticals, vaccines, supplies and equipment - over 14,000 SKUs in total - to over 100,000 customers worldwide and operates over 50 distribution centers.Additionally, they offer the development, sale and distribution of veterinary practice management software solutions to the same customer base (22,000 practices use the software globally). This product suite is dubbed the Practice Information Management Systems (PIMS). Currently, 18,000 U.S. veterinaries and 4,000 foreign practices utilize this management software for services such as management of financial records, appointment management, inventory management, and patient treatment history. As management touched upon in the Q1 report, PIMS is currently undergoing a business model change from an on-premises software model, to one utilizing the cloud. Currently, ~8% of customers use the new cloud software; additionally the cloud-based software now represents the majority of new wins.The nature of these practice management products is such that the consumer base is incredibly sticky. There are several reasons for this. For one, everything CVET does for their customers is relevant to day-to-day operations of the business. Meaning, these services are highly critical and most vets would be unlikely to switch as A) the cost and time burden would be immense, and B) if any information were lost or otherwise tampered with, the vets would suffer from loss of business. These characteristics are the embodiment of a business with high switching costs. Since the cost of switching providers is so staggeringly high, many veterinarians simply won't.These dynamics lead to robust financial results. As is typical with distribution-type businesses, the supply-chain management segment has low margins (gross margins ~18%) but generates healthy returns on capital by turning over inventory rapidly. Whereas, the technology and software management segment has ~24% EBIT margins and brought in $100 million in revenue in 2018. When we consider the earnings before interest and taxes these two business segments turn out, compared to the net invested capital in the business, we have returns in excess of 25%.(figures in millions)Vets First Choice has similar dynamics to that of the typical VC-backed high-growth enterprise: the business has formidable gross margins at 40%, a 40%+ CAGR in number of practices joining the platform, and they continually spend an incredible amount on SG&A (~43% of revenue) which leads to the company being EBITDA negative, losing $15 million in FY 2018 (my calculations, based on management's guidance). These characteristics translate into the type of company whose value isn't captured in traditional financial reports - it's too young and is growing too fast to judge the company based on traditional operating metrics like NOPLAT. (Source: Capital Markets Day)As described above, VFC is a platform company that offers business analytics, pharmacy services, and marketing services to their clients. The business currently has over 8,700 practices on the platform, which represents over 33% of the total market in the US (AVMA), and management is projecting to end 2019 FY with more than 10,000 practices. As demonstrated in the chart above, there is a gradual increase in utilization of the VFC platform by the vet practices, which leads to continued increase in revenue from clients captured years ago. Indeed, VFC's oldest client group (practices that have been using the platform for 6 years) grew FY '18 y/y revenue by > 20%. The company, when breaking out KPIs for the VFC platform, refers to the growth in revenue from these cohorts as ""same-store sales"". In the most recent quarter, SSS were 16% compared to the prior year.VFC offers a pay for performance platform - requiring no upfront capital commitment from veterinarians. VFC collects revenue as a service fee, as the clients simply use the platform to order prescriptions and pharmacy services. Management describes the characteristics of the platform as one resembling a subscription-based model. The inherent stickiness of the client base leads to extremely low churn. At the Investor's Day, management responded to a question regarding retention rates in the business by saying,These dynamics give management top-line visibility. Additionally, the 1,200 sales force team coming over from the Henry Schein Animal Health business will work to leverage their reach as a global supply chain business which should result in significant cross-selling for the VFC platform.The end-market is staggeringly underserved, as management touched upon in the Investor's Day. By way of example, in the single subset of services CVET offers to vet practices, close to 70% of canines had not received treatment for parasiticides from 2017-2018 (the industry term for the pets receiving treatment is ""compliance""). This represents a $5 billion market alone as CVET aims to assist their clients to identify and address these gaps in care - and this is only one corner of the market. As the total Covetrus business is operating the $150 billion market of veterinarian services, management sees a long runway for growth in the coming years. This has led the company to project mid-to-high single-digit growth in revenue for the foreseeable future for consolidated financials (VFC is currently ~5% of CVET's consolidated top-line), with the VFC segment growing substantially higher as detailed in the graph above (revenue up ~50%, clients being added to the platform ~40% CAGR).(Source: Capital Markets Day)Part of the opportunity the company sees to expand their target market, aside from increasing compliance rates, is to help veterinarians take back market share that has been conceded to online retailers. As consumers have shifted their preferences toward online shopping, e-commerce businesses like PetMed Express (NASDAQ:PETS) and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) have capitalized on this trend by selling pharmacy products to consumers. Veterinarians still have to write the prescriptions when the pet owner needs a medication, but as vet practices are small-businesses, they have simply been overwhelmed and unable to serve this market. Covetrus seeks to reverse this trend by bringing back that lost revenue to the vet practices. As PETS detailed in their most recent investor presentation, vet practices still maintain a market leading position despite these setbacks. As players like VFC are set on improving the convenience with which consumers can use veterinarians to order prescriptions, it seems likely they will be able to succeed as the vets already maintain a competitive advantage:(Source: PETS Investor Day)Ben Shaw was CEO and Co-Founder of VFC prior to the merger and remains CEO of Covetrus. His father, David Shaw, currently serves on the Covetrus board. It should be noted the Shaw family has prior experience creating immense value in this industry as David Shaw founded IDXX in the 1980s - a company operating in a similar space now worth >$20 billion. Further, Ben Shaw has more than 20 years experience in the industry - making the CVET board extremely well-versed in the industry. David Shaw owns ~2% of the combined company, while Ben Shaw owns ~1% (page 211), with the remaining directors owning 1.5% of the company.Covetrus' current market cap stands at ~$1.2 billion. This is despite the fact that total consideration for Vets First Choice preceding the merger was over $1.4 billion for the platform business alone (S-4, page 127). We're left to believe that the market has completely written off the value of the VFC platform - which is an absurd overreaction to the company bringing EBITDA guidance down from ~$250 million to ""at least"" $200 million for FY '19. A 20% haircut in EBITDA for one year certainly does not justify the 50% sell-off the equity-holders suffered in the trading days that followed.Seeing that the legacy HS Animal Health business and the VFC business are meaningfully different from a shareholder's perspective, we've opted for the Sum of the Parts valuation methodology for CVET.If we assume the market multiple (based on transactions cited below) for the legacy animal health business is 15x EBITDA, we're left with the following valuation:AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC) acquired MWI Vet Supply (CVET's main competitor in the supply-chain business) for $2.5 billion in 2015. At year-end 2014, MWI did $117 million in operating income, $129 million in EBITDA and $58 million in CFFO - equaling take-over multiples of 21x on EBIT, 19x on EBITDA and 43x on CFFO. These multiples should be taken with a grain of salt as MWI was growing faster than CVET's supply-chain business is currently. Nonetheless, given that ABC paid more for a business that was bringing in less in EBIT and cash flow than CVET currently is, we can be confident our projections of fair value are sound. If readers want a second example, Patterson Cos. (NASDAQ:PDCO) bought Animal Health International for $1.1 billion in 2015, as the business reported $68 million in EBITDA - for a multiple of 16x.Given the high-growth nature of the VFC business, we have decided to value the business based on revenue - as we view operating income a misleading metric due to the substantial investment the company is making in SG&A. When we annualized the $50 million in revenue the business did in the most recent 3-month quarter, we're left with top-line of ~$200 million. Assuming a 5x multiple, we get a value of ~$1 billion. As a sanity check, the consideration for VFC when the two businesses merged was $1.4 billion - so we can be reasonably confident we're on the conservative side of estimates.Adding the two together, we get an appraisal of $3.7 billion. On a per share basis (112 million shares outstanding), backing out the $1.1 billion in debt, we're left with a target price of $23, for an upside of over 100%. Readers should note that the 100% figure is the gap between fair value of what the business is worth today compared to its current market cap. We also used historical earnings and lower valuation multiples - striving for conservationism. CVET is likely to continue growing as the legacy Animal Health business is exposed to the growing pet market in addition to the robust growth coming from the VFC business, causing management to project long-term double-digit earnings growth. Management also maintains that the VFC business will be contributing $100 million in EBITDA by end of year three (2021). This contribution alone should drive double-digit earnings growth even if the rest of the CVET business stagnates.1) Rising interest rates. CVET is meaningfully leveraged at 5.5x EBITDA ($1.1 billion in debt/$200 million in EBITDA). Covetrus pays LIBOR + 1.25%-2.25% on the debt. Management has committed to using the majority of FCF for debt retirement. They want to achieve investment grade (2.5x), which we view as likely considering the debt reduction coming from FCF, coupled with the growth in EBITDA forthcoming.2) New entrants/innovation. The animal health market is an acyclical, profitable, and growing market. Covetrus is not the only company privy to this information. Although we believe the combination of the industry-disrupting VFC platform with the global, market-leading supply chain animal health business makes CVET differentiated from competitors - the industry remains fragmented and highly competitive.The animal health industry at large is one that is acyclical (revenue grew right through the past recession), and is the beneficiary of secular growth trends (longer pet lives, 70% of households are pet owners and increased spending on domestic animals). Industry players should benefit from growth drivers including the continued growth in spending on pets as the animals live longer and the humanization of pets. CVET, in particular, is set to experience double-digit growth rates in earnings. Both of Covetrus' business segments are substantiated market leaders. The business is recession-resistant, should continue to grow revenue at GDP+ growth rates, and at an unlevered free cash flow yield of >7% at today's prices, CVET offers investors an extremely attractive risk/reward opportunity."
4264839,105040,2019-05-17T07:17:52-04:00,An update on Covetrus's Q1.Guidance in the long term is great.KPIs continue to soar upwards.,"In March, we wrote an article outlining why Covetrus (CVET) may be severely unappreciated and undervalued by the market. Since then, it has delayed an earnings report, which caused the stock to plummet. We were worried at that time that the delayed reporting was a sign of something bad to come, but our fears were allayed after seeing the report, which shows continued execution and increases our conviction.At first glance, Covetrus's results aren't impressive - it reported a slight revenue decline YOY. However, this includes several strong one-time headwinds that depressed results. Most notably, FX affected overall growth by 4%. Overall organic growth on a constant-currency basis would've been 3%.In North America, rebate classification reduced growth by 1%; in APAC, a lost manufacturer relationship reduced growth by 10%; and many other region-specific headwinds further depressed results. Without these one-time items, growth would likely be much higher.Despite the disappointing revenue growth, other KPIs performed very well. Enrollments on Covetrus's prescription management technology increased by 18% YOY, and comparable store partner sales increased 22% YOY. This is great for the company. If its customers are doing well and increasing in numbers, Covetrus stands to benefit significantly as it collects fees from its customers.Vets First Choice revenues increased over 51% YOY when normalized. Although Vets First Choice is currently unprofitable, its growth is quite impressive and will likely be a huge driver of the company's future revenue growth.Q1 slidesProfitability also looked very underwhelming. Adjusted net income was only $13mil for Q1. However, the profitability of the main business was dragged down due to Vets First Choice, which is a fast growing but unprofitable company. It did not help that synergy capture projected by management is expected to be mostly in the back half of the year due to seasonality.Overall, although earnings were disappointing, we are hopeful about future earnings growth as management was very optimistic regarding future earnings growth, which we'll discuss below.Covetrus's future looks quite bright. Management mentioned that it plans to expand Vets First Choice to multiple new geographies, which it believes is a huge opportunity.Another highlight is that Covetrus plans to enroll 3,000 new veterinarian practices this year. This is twice the growth rate that it experienced in 2018, and we believe this is a sign that management is extremely optimistic about long-term revenue growth.Profitability is likely to improve substantially as well going forward.Management expects adjusted EBITDA of $250-300mil in 2019, or 10% growth from 2018 levels. Future adjusted EBITDA growth is likely to be driven by synergy capture, which management believes could reach $100mil in three years. Doing the calculations, that would mean Covetrus could get up to $320mil in adjusted EBITDA by 2022, which would represent over 10% growth YOY assuming there is zero revenue growth.Covetrus's balance sheet and liquidity continue to be quite strong after the spinoff, as most of its long-term debt isn't due for five more years. The current ratio remains around 2, and management has stated plans to deleverage over the long term by using over $50mil of non-GAAP free cash flow generated this year. Overall, the balance sheet should be strong enough to help support growth plans.Q1 10-QAlthough the company looks like it's valued highly for a business with little earnings and little revenue growth, both of these items are slated to increase significantly going forward.Seeing that Covetrus has a subscription type offering, we believe it should trade at multiples of peers like Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN). Its long-run revenue growth is likely to be greater than Cerner's due to its small size, but to be conservative, we'll use Cerner's multiple. If Covetrus trades at Cerner's P/S multiple, it should trade at around 4x sales, or $3.6bil.An investment in Covetrus doesn't have many risks. The company's high switching costs and economies of scale mean that most customers are likely to stick with Covetrus, especially as it is the market leader in the US and is extremely beneficial to its customers (As shown from 22% same-store sales increase mentioned earlier).We believe the main risk for Covetrus is bad execution. With bad execution, a lot of shareholder value can be destroyed, especially since CVET is still a small company with such a large market to tap.Covetrus is executing well so far. Management has given fairly optimistic guidance, and we're confident that revenue growth should accelerate in the next few years as Covetrus upsells to customers and continues to build the customer base. As it moves towards maturity, CVET should get more profitable as well. Overall, Covetrus seems undervalued now."
4254445,105040,2019-04-15T07:22:39-04:00,"Covetrus is a dominant company in the pet health market.Despite slow growth in the past, management has laid out growth initiatives that should accelerate growth in the next few years.The merger that created Covetrus may allow the company to reap substantial synergies.Covetrus has a lot of potential ahead of it, yet doesn't trade at an outrageous valuation.","Covetrus Inc. (CVET), like most spinoffs, has fallen substantially since it started trading. Despite its high P/E and P/B, however, we believe the company is significantly undervalued. Covetrus is a secular grower that has massive potential and a long growth runway ahead of it.Covetrus is an animal health technology and services company that serves veterinarian practices by providing them with everything from distribution to management software to prescriptions management. It has operations globally but mainly operates in North America, where 90% of local practices are customers.The company is a spinoff of Henry Schein merged with Vets First Choice. It started trading on February 6, 2019.(Source: Google Images)A veterinarian practice is a very complex business. The owner needs to manage everything from prescriptions to quality of care to finances. Vets manage an incredible array of medical services across different species of patients. It gets more complex as technology introduces new layers of complexity on top of the existing business. Client expectations are also changing, with pet parents expecting higher-quality care for a lower cost. Prescriptions are especially complex, with many needing refrigeration, many being controlled substances, and with each having its own manufacturer and applicable discounts.(Source: Covetrus Capital Markets presentation)That's where Covetrus comes in.The company allows the owner of the practice to run it more efficiently and profitably by providing distribution and software services. Practices can streamline their operations, improve their working capital or cash flow, and use software to automate prescriptions. This allows the practice owner to more efficiently serve patients and earn more revenues and profits by refilling their inventory faster, as described below. Management gave an example - if a vet forgets to prescribe a medicine, Covetrus's system will email the customer to remind him/her to collect the medicine.Covetrus operates in the $150 billion pet health market. This market is benefiting from several secular growth mega-trends - the increasing longevity of pets and the humanization of pets. People are now willing to spend substantial sums of money to increase the longevity of their pets and to give them better care.This is great for veterinarian practices, which can generate larger amounts of revenues. It's also great for Covetrus, which gets a substantial performance-based fee from its customers.Interestingly, just by using Covetrus, practices can generate more revenues by refilling faster and more efficiently. As an example, one Equine product refill rate doubled from 41% to 82% after using the Vets First Choice platform (owned by Covetrus). This grew revenues by 39% for the practice.(Source: Covetrus Capital Markets presentation)Management stated that revenues from most practices increase YOY and that its 2012 customers recently grew 20% in 2018. Most notably, management stated that a mature practice usually pays Covetrus from $500k to $1 million per year, which means that at maturity, the company's current client base of 20000 practices may generate up to $20 billion in revenues, or 5x its current revenues.(Source: Covetrus Capital Markets presentation)According to management, Covetrus has recurring subscription-like revenues that increase in visibility. Revenues from most practices improve YOY - for example, the 2012 cohort grew 20% last year.Management believes that the company is far from maxing out revenues from existing customers. They believe that Covetrus can earn extra revenues from up-selling and cross-selling existing customers.In the 10-K, management outlined several other strategies the company could use to accelerate revenue growth in the next few years:(Source: 2018 10-K)Covetrus not only has strong growth drivers but also some extremely wide moats, which should allow it to maintain an edge over the competition.The most significant one, of course, is switching costs. It may take a while to setup and learn how to use Covetrus's system. For a veterinarian practice that sees patients every day and deals with life or death situations, taking time to switch to a new system is costly both to the practice and to the customer. Veterinarian practices are therefore incentivised to stick with Covetrus.The company also has low costs as it is the largest operator in this industry and can reap substantial economies of scale. After the spin-off, Covetrus is likely to reduce costs even further as a result of synergies from the merger with Vets First Choice.(Source: 2018 10-K)Covetrus has a healthy balance sheet, with over $1.4 billion of shareholders' equity out of $2.2 billion in assets. Management has stated that it plans to deleverage further using $50 million of FCF the company plans to generate in the next 12 months, which seems quite prudent.Revenues have grown over the past 4 years, from ~$3 billion to ~$3.8 billion. Removing restructuring charges and normalizing taxes to 21% gives us $115 million of adjusted net income in 2018, up from $88 million in 2015.Covetrus currently trades at a market cap of $3.6 billion, which may seem excessive given its low net income. However, with significant synergies waiting to be exploited and an extremely large market to conquer, we believe this price is more than fair. In Warren Buffett terms, Covetrus is a ""wonderful company at a fair price"".Interestingly, a similar company, McKesson Corp. (MCK), which offers similar services except for human pharmacies, trades at a market cap exceeding $20 billion. If people are really beginning to humanize pets, this means that Covetrus has a much greater opportunity than most people think.Covetrus is a top-of-the-line animal health technology and service provider that has only exploited a small portion of its total opportunity. As management executes on growth and achieves promised synergies, we fully expect the multiple to expand and Covetrus to be revalued."
4296828,43681,2019-10-24T08:00:00-04:00,"Based on the implied valuation for VFC from the merger, the distribution business is being valued substantially below peers (~5X EBITDA), multiples not seen even in the financial crisis.VFC is still operating on all cylinders with 46% topline growth (y/y) and vast white space on international growth opportunities.Headwinds on the distribution business are manageable, and year-over-year comps should improve substantially in 2020, versus very difficult '18->'19 comps.Optically, this is a growth business that just had a negative four percent top-line quarter. However, if one can look past the noise created by the merger, this is a business that has underlying organic growth in the +2-3% range this year, and in 2020 and beyond, a sales growth profile in the mid to high-single digits with corresponding double-digit EBITDA growth.","Covetrus (NASDAQ:CVET) is a newly-created entity through a Reverse Morris Trust (""RMT"") transaction from the spin-off of Henry Schein's ((NASDAQ:HSIC); 63% ownership) Animal Health distribution business (HSAH) combined with Vets First Choice (VFC; 37%) in a non-taxable spin. Covetrus exhibits many of the typical spin dynamics that investors find in special situations, including a parent spin-off size mismatch, vastly different growth and perceived risk profiles, and a reclassification from S&P 500 to the S&P MidCap 400. It is likely that the existing investor base in Henry Schein preferred the more diversified distribution business (dental and animal health) versus the more levered and higher-growth profile of Covetrus, which includes a significant software component. The situation to us has many similarities to Chemours (CC) after the spin-off from DuPont (NYSE:DD), where the narrative was that the parent company had saddled Chemours with an overwhelming amount of debt. It was clear most investors did not understand the quality of the business or its industry-leading position, as investors voted with their feet and sold the stock down ~80% within seven months, similar to what happened at Covetrus. Just over a year and a half later, the stock rose over fifteen-fold off the lows in early 2016. While we don't necessarily think the short-term upside exists to that degree at Covetrus, we think, in a couple years, Covetrus could easily be worth 3-5x its current valuation.For example, if one gives a reasonably conservative valuation for Vets First Choice (growing 46% y/y), at 4x sales, the animal health distribution business is being valued at roughly 4x EBITDA. At 4x EBITDA, that is half the valuation of a lower quality distribution comp, Patterson (PDCO). At no point have any of the distribution peers ever traded at those multiples, not even during the height of the financial crisis.Since hitting an all-time high of $50 back in February, the stock has essentially been on a straight line down, falling around 78% off its peak. Optically, the most recent quarter looked like a disaster, as pro forma sales were down 4%, but if one adjusts for foreign exchange headwinds, North American and Brexit weakness, and the previously announced customer losses, organic growth in the quarter would have been +2%.Given the initial hiccups at Covetrus, we think many investors who are not familiar with the long-term story essentially tapped out in the past few months. While management is not innocent, we think many of the issues affecting Covetrus have to do with external forces out of its control. Our view is the sell-off is due to a combination of factors, including: investor base turnover after the HSIC spin-off, index fund selling/repositioning, slowing U.S. Veterinarian visits, Brexit, lack of sell-side coverage, lost customers, complexities/delays with CVET filing its first 10-Q, large FX headwinds, high debt levels post-RMT dividend, noisy financials resulting from one-time integration costs, and heavy merger-related investments. Given some of the positive secular trends in the animal health space, investors had high hopes, with a compelling combination and IPO isolating the faster-growing animal health segment from HSIC. To summarize, management totally underestimated the complexity of all the integration challenges, accounting changes, and one-time costs needed to unify the platform under one entity. All these items in some way have masked what we believe is a great business that has significant long-term competitive advantages over peers, none of which are being valued today.""Covetrus is the only global ecosystem for Veterinarians…. we're the operating system of Veterinary practitioners."" - Brian Shaw, CNBC, 02/08/2019""The category has wanted this for twenty years"" - Brian Shaw, Stifel CCThe combination of legacy Vets First Choice and legacy Henry Schein Animal Health was a thoughtful combination, resulting in a highly synergistic combination that offers the deepest global ecosystem of support services for veterinarians. The RMT merger created the largest global animal healthcare platform with a presence in 100 countries and leadership positions in 26 markets.Legacy VFC is the high-growth prescription management business that has grown at a 50%+ CAGR (2014-2018); VFC should do 40%+ topline growth for FY 2019 and 35%+ for FY 2020. Legacy Vets First Choice created a software solution to help boost low prescription refill rates. This data-based integrated SaaS platform is used to identify gaps in care and subsequently contact pet owners to improve compliance (refill rates) and improve patient outcomes. Vets that adopt the VFC platform from Covetrus get convenient patient reminders, white-label online ordering, multi-channel ordering capabilities, home delivery, and more efficient prescription inventory management. Furthermore, VFC helps vets address structural headwinds from online suppliers (Chewy (CHWY), 1-800-PetMeds (NASDAQ:PETS)) by keeping prescription leakage within the practice, thereby increasing practice revenues and profitability. Not only does it help the customer save time with its on-premise solution, but VFC helps Veterinarians organize their practice and maximize efficiency so they can focus less on administrative tasks and more on patient care.""Covetrus saves Vets an hour per day per Vet."" - Brian ShawSource: 10-KThe Legacy Henry Schein Animal Health is a distribution business comprising pharmaceuticals, nutritional products, consumables, diagnostic equipment, and surgical equipment, while also boasting a best in-class Practice Information Management Systems (PIMS) with controlling market share within the U.S. HSAH has an operating history of over 65 years within parent Henry Schein and serves approximately 100,000 customers. Within PIMS, legacy HSAH has a commanding lead with over 60% of the U.S. market, roughly 3 times the market share of the #2 provider IDEXX's (NASDAQ:IDXX)'s Cornerstone. Source: Sell-side estimates, company data, proprietary dataMany investors view the distribution business as simply a business that moves items from location A to location B. Contrary to these commonly held views, the animal health distribution market is a highly complex and consultative business, many times managing more than 150,000 SKUs on behalf of a practice. Not only is the scope of the HSAH product catalog extremely wide, but there are hundreds of new products and diagnostic devices every year on which the Henry Schein sales reps educate and consult with veterinarians at the practice level.While HSAH in itself is a high-quality low single-digit growth distribution business, the real value comes from the customer relationships formed through one of HSAH's 80+ animal health organizations with direct business ties at the practice level (supporting 90% of U.S. vets), in combination with a sales force of over 1,200 reps. Combine these 100,000 captive customers with the VFC offering, and the synergies between the two businesses become quite apparent. HSAH's legacy customer base primarily consists of animal health practices and clinics in the companion and equine markets in North America, Europe, and Australasia. HSAH is also a market leader globally in providing veterinary practice-management software, software that runs the practice, for medical records, inventory management, and billing. Combining Practice Information Management Systems (PIMS) with VFC's cloud-based software offering gives veterinarians a complete software platform (operating system) that helps with prescription compliance, inventory management, appointment management, billing, and overall practice management.Source: Raymond James NAECThe global animal health market can be categorized as an attractive non-cyclical market with an estimated $150bn in sales and growing at mid-single digits rates. The animal healthcare market exhibits strong secular tailwinds due to the global growth of the middle class and, within developed markets, the ""humanization"" of pets. Unlike the human healthcare market, the animal healthcare market is predominately a cash pay system, with very little insurance reimbursement risk. This structural benefit gives good visibility on price increases, which are typically in the low-single-digits annually, while avoiding most of the regulatory/political dynamics and insurance reimbursement issues of the human healthcare market.Source: Bureau of Labor and Statistics, Bayer Veterinary Care Usage Study.To give an example of this market's non-cyclical characteristics: if one looks at the most recent recession '08-09, total Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) declined by 1.3% in 2009 (source: Raymond James); Vet spending during that same time frame, however, went up 1.0%.Source: IDEXX Investor presentationFrom 1959 to 2017, Veterinary and Related Services long-term CAGR has outpaced general Total Personal Consumption Expenditure by approximately 3.6% per annum. What's fascinating about these figures is that, even after this long duration of above-average growth, Veterinary, Pets, and Related Products together still only comprise roughly 1% of total U.S. consumption expenditure. Overall pet-related spending since 1990 has been increasing at a 6.8% CAGR, as tracked by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.Source: IDEXX Investor presentationSource: IDEXX Investor presentation Per IBISWorld, pet ownership in the United States is expected to increase at a compound annual rate of 3.9% from 2017 to 2023. One of the largest drivers of this trend is the fact that millennials are more prone to delay the start of a family, given the high costs of children; many millenniums are opting for the alternative in becoming ""pet parents."" Source: Grandview ResearchHenry Schein was looking for a way to unlock the embedded value within its combined dental distribution and animal health distribution business in a tax-efficient manner. Management realized that Henry Schein could garner a premium multiple, becoming a pure-play animal health company. Given that HSAH was growing faster than the dental distribution business, it made sense to make a separation between the two; thus, came into play several different potential transactions to add value. Given the extremely low-cost basis of the business, an outright sale was not tax-efficient for investors. One transaction that made a lot of sense strategically was a vertical integration of Vets First Choice's fast growth prescription management platform with Henry Schein's Animal Health distribution business. The combination would give VFC the opportunity to tap the 100,000 global customer points while fully integrating with HSAH's market-leading practice information management systems, thereby becoming a one-stop shop for all software and distribution-related solutions for veterinarians.As a stand-alone company Vets First Choice had been growing rapidly as an independent cloud-based software platform; we think, however, that with the combination of the HSAH's distribution business that growth can re-accelerate, especially once introduced globally in 2020. On top of that, we think there are further synergies in VFC's ability to drive volumes through the Veterinarian channel. So, as Vets become more successful driving revenues through their practices with higher compliance and better care/convenience, Covetrus benefits by higher distribution revenue share through VFC, but also by more distribution volumes flowing through the legacy HSAH network. Finally, as veterinarians and their customers get more comfort around using Covetrus prescription management solutions, these early cohort sales trends get better over time, as there is a significant time lag on adoption levels.Source: Covetrus Capital Markets DayIn speaking with Covetrus management, we learned that another overlooked aspect of Vets First Choice is that the entire field sales team was under 50 people nationwide, what they termed a ""hunting party;"" combining with Henry Schein Animal Health's distribution business, there will be over 1,200 dedicated sales professionals who can cross sell Covetrus' VFC products. Not only will VFC have significantly more coverage, but the 1,200+ sales reps within HSAH have built long-term trusted relationships that are significant value-adds, given vets' hesitation to implement new complex PIMS software systems or try a new prescription management system.Based on information from our call, there are also some material overlaps between the sales staff at HSAH and that at VFC with the potential to optimize the cost structure. Additionally, there appears to be some long-term cost savings with the on-premise PIMS system migrating to the cloud. The legacy on-premise solution has many legacy versions of the software platform that Covetrus (HSAH) continues to support. Eventually, however, as more customers convert to the cloud, the on-premise systems will require less support, as the oldest on-premise systems get deactivated/converted. Cloud-based PIMS as of Q2 '19 represent 8.2% of the global installed base, which is growing 20% y/y and up significantly from Q1 2018 of 5.4%. The Practice Information Management System is like other sticky Enterprise Resource Planning platforms that have large switching costs, which makes it difficult to have large shifts in market share among peers.Key Points to the Covetrus Strategy:Source: Covetrus Investor PresentationAfter speaking with management and going over some of the events that transpired during the first 7 months of being public, it was clear that the management team had bitten off more than they could chew operationally. While clearly this is not the gold standard with which investors are used to working with the Shaw family, there are justifiable reasons for most of the early hiccups.Q1 Issues:Q2 issues:From Q2 Call:From Q2 Call:High Leverage:Given the high debt-load (>5x EBITDA) due to the $1.1bn dividend to Henry Schein, investors with a more risk-averse disposition likely sold Covetrus at just the hint of more bad news to come. Leverage is certainly a concern, but there is some comfort in the fact that the secured first liens are trading ~ 99 cents on the dollar up from ~ 96 cents on the dollar when Covetrus IPOed, and the $960mn tranche does not mature until 2024.Goldman initiated at Sell:After a 70% decline inside of seven months, Goldman does the unthinkable and pours more gas on the fire with a sell initiation on September 9th. Goldman's catalyst for the sell initiation was supposed to be price-related disadvantages versus online retailers. What the analysts at Goldman did was compare pricing on the top 50 medications (40 prescriptions, 10 OTC). Of the 35 products that overlapped peers, Goldman found that the basket was priced at a 17% premium. Based on our questions with management and analysis, Goldman forgot to include the manufacturer instant rebates and sale items from Covetrus in the analysis. These are prescription items that are on sale (auto-ship or basic discount) or have a manufacturers rebate that is applicable to all online pharmacy customers. When you factor the rebates, discounts, and auto-ship savings into the analysis, the prices are more or less on par with online competitors and in some cases even below online prices.Raising even more suspicion at Goldman's analysis was a piece out of Raymond James that mentions minimum advertised pricing (MAP) being enforced on alternative channels like Chewy and 1-800-PetMeds. It appears Boehringer and Elanco (NYSE:ELAN), two of the largest animal health pharmaceutical manufacturers, have implemented a form of MAP pricing with large price increases on common companion animal health drugs to treat flea, tick, and heartworm preventatives (see below).Enforcement of this by more manufacturers would benefit Covetrus by having more price parity with online retailers. If MAP pricing puts all participants on a level playing field, Covetrus would have an even better competitive edge, given the convenience advantage. As physically mailing scripts or uploading scripts to online pharmacies is clunky, the easiest pathway for a customer is purchasing from their trusted vet. Vets really have no incentive to approve scripts for online prescriptions, since every prescription filled outside their pharmacy is lost revenue. Prescription drugs on average are about 30% of a clinic's sales, so vets have a big incentive to use Covetrus to prevent prescription leakage to other less trustworthy channels that occasionally use gray market inventory. Furthermore, the fact that online retailers contact vets via fax and over the phone to confirm prescriptions takes away from other essential duties in the clinic while adding nothing to a vet's bottom line.Chairman:On September 4th, Covetrus announced David Shaw's board chair succession, which caused a few concerns about the trajectory of the business. David Shaw was a one-term director and was instrumental in the strategic combination of HSAH and VFC. However, based on some of the TSAs with Henry Schein being completed sooner than anticipated and some of the milestones achieved, David thought now was a good time to bring in Benjamin Wolin with deep expertise in digital healthcare, pharmacy, and technology. David also didn't want any appearance of conflicts with his son Ben Shaw as standing CEO. David Shaw will remain on the board indefinitely.While, in aggregate, all these headwinds have hurt the short-term profitability of Covetrus, we believe the long-term outlook is quite compelling, as management didn't change its 3-year synergy target of $100mn. Even if one estimates only 50% capture of the synergy target, the stock is still very compelling, given the size of the sell-off and organic growth opportunities longer term.In cloud-based prescription management, VetSource is the closest direct competitor to legacy Vets First Choice, and there are a few differentiating factors between the two products. Legacy VFC differentiates itself by providing complete analytics, including client retention analysis, compliance measurements, gaps in care analysis, and treatment statistics. While VetSource offers some similar capabilities, it is more of an online ordering solution that integrates with the various Practice Information Management Systems, sends email reminders, and does prescription-compounding and electronic scripts. VFC has a more comprehensive solution and integrates seamlessly with the industry-leading HSAH PIMS solution, while providing an industry-leading distribution catalog. Legacy Henry Schein has accumulated details on what veterinarians test, diagnose, treat, prescribe, buy, and sell, as well as on pet owner demographics. All this proprietary information gives Vets First Choice a tremendous data-driven edge over VetSource.According to website analytics firm Similarweb, legacy Vets First Choice has approximately 12x VetSource's website traffic. VetSource since its founding date in 2008 has raised total funding of $60mn, whereas Vets First Choice since its founding date in 2010 has raised $293mn. VFC prescription management platform has a commanding lead in the animal health prescription management business, and, based on our research, has at least 2.5x the sales of VetSource. Vets First Choice has also had notable early backers, including leads from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, and Hillhouse Capital Group and significant investments from Viking Global. To summarize, VFC is the category-leading platform within the U.S. with over 1/3 (EOY) U.S. market share, 6x the initial funding, 12x the website traffic, and 2.5x+ the sales of VetSource, and significantly higher growth rates than VetSource.Regarding distribution, there are three major players that control the vast majority of market share in the Animal Health distribution space, particularly in the U.S. (see below). Legacy HSAH also maintains roughly 30% market share in the U.K., over 20% market share in key markets such as Europe and Australia/NZ, and approximately 5% share in emerging markets.Source: William Blair, Raymond James, and proprietary industry estimates.The animal health products and service market are highly competitive. Many animal health products are available to customers from many suppliers, including directly from manufacturers and through a variety of distributions.Competitors:The Henry Schein Animal Health Business offers a broad range of products and services, including a wide portfolio of pharmaceuticals, pet nutrition products, and consumable supplies and equipment. The combination of Henry Schein Animal Health Business's product portfolio with its value-added solutions differentiates the Henry Schein Animal Health Business from several of its competitors.Competitive Advantages:Covetrus is led by experienced capital allocators. The Shaw family founded and led Vets First Choice through an exponential period of growth, while also making strategic acquisitions to build out its ecosystem with the purchase of Road Runner and Atlas Pharmaceuticals, both specialty compounding pharmacies.David Shaw was the founder of IDEXX in 1983 and was CEO and Chairman for nearly 20 years, starting out in a small warehouse in Portland, Maine. David early on had convinced Peter Crisp of Venrock Associates to start funding IDEXX to satiate David's global aspirations.David also successfully founded Ikaria, which was subsequently sold in 2015 to Mallinckrodt (NYSE:MNK) for $2.3bn. Additionally, he was a founding director and investor of Cytyc Corp., which was sold to Hologic for $6.2bn in 2007.After David left IDEXX in February of 2002, he started up Black Point Group LLC, a venture that enables his family to invest in a portfolio of different growth companies. Black Point's strategy is essentially to look for interesting opportunities where you can create value by ""riding big waves,"" such as revolutionary technology like medical devices or the software platform businesses. For more on David's investment philosophy, see the piece by Lori Valigra for MaineBiz.David Shaw was instrumental in the deal between HSAH and VFC, having the foresight to see significant long-term synergies and competitive advantages by combining the two businesses.Ben Shaw, Covetrus' current CEO, and David remain on the Board of Directors; Ben and David each own approximately 3% of the shares outstanding.Valuation:Since Covetrus was spun out of Henry Schein on February 5th, 2019, its relative underperformance has been quite spectacular: -78%, versus the S&P MidCap 400 return of +4.96%, and the Bloomberg Spins Index return of -13.25%.Source: BloombergWhile Covetrus does not have any direct comps given the unique combination of assets, we think it matches well with the Patterson Companies Animal Health segment, both in scope and size (LTM sales of $3,354mn in animal health; ~ 61% of sales). However, there are a few notable differences between the two companies that investors should be aware of: Patterson Animal Health division is more focused on the slower-growing production animal side, which includes the beef, dairy, and swine markets, whereas legacy HSAH is more focused on the faster-growing companion and equine market. Secondarily, as mentioned earlier, legacy HSAH has a commanding leadership position within Practice Information Management Systems (PIMS) with over 60% market share (18,000/30,000 practices) in the U.S. While Patterson doesn't break out PIMS market share for NaVetor, we've heard they are substantially smaller than the #2 solutions provider IDEXX (Cornerstone; ~20% share). Anecdotally, we've heard from a couple sources that Patterson's NaVetor is also inferior in terms of quality and capabilities.Patterson also has a large dental distribution business which has a slightly higher margin profile than the animal health distribution business. Patterson's dental distribution business, however, has been experiencing declining organic sales (LTM -12%), while the animal health division is still growing at a low to mid-single digit pace. Juxtapose this with Covetrus, which consensus has growing topline organically in the mid-single range next year versus Patterson's growth of only 1%. Furthermore, Covetrus is still incubating the high-growth VFC prescription management software, and gross margins would be more comparable to Patterson at present if not for cloud-based accounting rules, integration costs, and other one-time items depressing current margins. If one considers that VFC is still running at a net adjusted EBITDA loss of -$7.2mn (FY 2018), the value within Covetrus is being masked by heavy reinvestment, costly one-time integrations, and an international expansion. Plus, VFC has a commanding lead in the animal health prescription management business, and based on our conversations, has at least 2.5x the sales of its number two competitor, VetSource. VFC has also expanded gross margins from 37% in 2016 to over 44% in 2018, all while growing sales at a 50% CAGR (2014-2018). As VFC makes up more of the overall Covetrus revenue base the gross margins should continue to expand over time, as the higher-margin software solutions, PIMS and VFC, continue to grow rapidly and take market share. Given that VFC has continued to perform post-RMT, we think every bit of the initial $1,250mn valuation placed on the business by Henry Schein (04/23/2018) is accurate; it is likely worth considerably more given the relevant comps. Comparable high growth predictable SaaS businesses are easily valued at 5x+ sales. When taking into consideration all the individual components and quality of Covetrus, the relative valuation spread is remarkable.Source: Bloomberg, Sell-side, and proprietary estimatesCovetrus CEO Brian Shaw believes that more accurate comps for Covetrus (specifically for VFC) are athenahealth (NASDAQ:ATHN) and HealthEquity (NASDAQ:HQY), which have significantly disrupted the office practitioner market for human healthcare. athenahealth was taken out at 4.15x EV/Sales and HealthEquity is currently trading at 7.7x EV/Sales. Today, at current multiples, there is tremendous skepticism being priced into Covetrus. If one were to take the estimated valuation on VFC at 4x sales, the market is saying that the legacy HSAH distribution business as a standalone entity is worth 4.05x EBITDA, a multiple that none of the distribution peers have ever traded at, even during the height of the GFC.Source: Bloomberg, Sell-side, and proprietary estimatesAt first glance, this is a growth business that just had a negative four percent sales quarter. However, if one can look past the noise created by the merger, this is a business that has underlying organic growth in the +2-3% range this year, and in 2020 and beyond, a top-line growth profile in the mid to high-single digits with corresponding double-digit EBITDA growth.While management has clearly underestimated the complexity of the combination of HSAH and VFC, we think the bad news has been exacerbated by turnover in the shareholder base. Covetrus has gone from a mid-cap to essentially a small cap, while coming out of a S&P 500 parent, Henry Schein. Investors that wanted a diversified dental and animal health distribution business listed on the S&P 500 all of a sudden were holding an animal health technology stub with a distribution business listed on the S&P MidCap 400.Despite these missteps, we believe long-term there are significant competitive advantages to a fully integrated Practice Management System with inventory management, customer communication/marketing, specialty compounding, and distribution. This unique value-additive offering differentiates Covetrus from other distribution platforms and gives it a firm foothold in the veterinary software ecosystem, unlike any other provider. Furthermore, we don't think investors are paying attention to the long-term quality of the business with market leadership in three different verticals and what is one of the highest EBITDA growth profiles in the animal health market - not to mention it is trading at a substantial discount to a lower-quality and smaller distribution peer, Patterson. Covetrus is cheap on an absolute basis as well as on a relative basis, and we think that as the year-over-year comps get better in 2020, optically, Covetrus will look more like a growth business and multiples will re-rate accordingly."

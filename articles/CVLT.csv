4383069,105757,2020-10-30T09:17:45-04:00,"Commvault reported another solid quarter and guided up 3Q (December). Management continues to exude confidence in its growth prospects and position within the industry with its cloud-delivered portfolio.Commvault CEO noted that its modern platform, deployment (public cloud, hybrid, and on-prem) options continue to elicit interest as its customers are moving to the cloud, driven by digital transformation.Due to the pandemic and the impending election, hackers have been aggressively targeting corporations with ransomware attacks. CVLT's cloud solutions have been an effective antidote to tackle the threat.The company continues to add new customers at a rapid clip, driven by new pricing models, simplified deployment, and new product offerings such as Metallic and HyperScale X.Given improving execution, reasonable valuation, and opportunity to gain share, we believe CVLT has favorable risk/reward and is, therefore, a buy.","Commvault (NASDAQ:CVLT) reported results that exceeded expectations on both the revenue and EPS lines and provided guidance ahead of estimates. Revenue was about $171 million and was ahead of the consensus estimate of about $165 million. Overall revenue was up 2% Y/Y. Interestingly, the company reported software revenue of $72.3 million, and this was up 5% Y/Y, while services revenue was $98.8 million or flat Y/Y. Commvault historically sold its software using a perpetual revenue model. Commvault now mainly sells revenue on a subscription basis. Therefore, the company's transition to subscription is understating revenue growth. Commvault reported an EPS of $0.45, which is ahead of the consensus estimate of $0.35. EPS outperformance was driven by higher than expected revenue and lower than anticipated Opex.Commvault guided F3Q21 revenue in the range of $174-176 million versus the prior consensus estimate of $173 million. The company guided F3Q21 software revenue in the $77-79 million range. At the midpoint, software revenue implies 1.8% Y/Y growth. We believe the software revenue guide is conservative, and we expect the company to beat its guidance. December quarter revenue is driven by federal year-end and corporate year-end budget flush. Given our confidence in the company's product portfolio, execution, and new licensing options, we believe Commvault is a buy. We expect the company to beat estimates as it had done the prior two quarters, driven by large deals, upsell during the subscription renewal, and new customer additions. The following chart illustrates the Commvault reported results versus consensus estimates.Commvault's Metallic SaaS offering is currently available only on the Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT) platform. Metallic is receiving excellent reviews from the users, and the company has been pleased with the progress so far. CEO Sanjay Mirchandani noted,We believe Metallic is driving growth in the mid-market segment. Commvault is expected to launch Metallic in 3x more countries by the end of the year. According to our industry sources, Commvault is also expected to launch Metallic on other public cloud venues such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) GCP and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS. Based on our understanding, we believe Commvault is likely to launch Metallic on other public clouds later this quarter or in earlier 2021.Since the pandemic began, according to the FBI, ransomware attacks have gone up 400% pre-pandemic levels. Commvault noted that it had restored data for more than 1,000 customers, just in September. To address the demand for its services and products, the CEO Sanjay Mirchandani noted,We believe many of these customers Commvault serviced in their time of need will likely come back to buy additional products from the company.Given that the company and its board believe its shares are undervalued, given the growth prospects, Commvault's board increased the share repurchase authorization amount to $200 million. The board also extended the program till March 31st, 2022. Company CFO Brian Carolan noted the following,Currently, Commvault has 47.5 million shares outstanding. At the current price of around $45, Commvault can lower the share count by about 4.4 million shares if it uses the whole $200 million to buy back shares. We believe Commvault will likely front-load the share buyback to have maximum impact.Despite beating estimates two consecutive quarters and evidence that the company has re-invented itself, the stock continues to languish. Commvault is profitable and is generating cash. Also, the company's products are considered the best in the industry. Yet, newer companies with limited capabilities are given higher valuation by the VCs. We believe there is a lot of value in the company, especially since it has more than 12,000 customers (adding more customers and the customers are loyal) and is gaining share in the enterprise. Please see our previous work on SA for more details.The company's stock was up only about 8% over the last two quarters when it had handily beaten estimates in both the quarters.While the stock is up only marginally over the last two quarters, the stock is down over the previous 12 months. Commvault is down 14%, while S&P is up 9%, and Nasdaq is up 35%.The company has made enormous strides re-inventing itself. Commvault's business is driven by multiple growth drivers. It has taken its industry-leading products and simplified them. It has made its products easier to use, easier to buy, and the company is now easier to do business with. The company acquired new technologies such as Hedvig and created unique products that address primary storage use cases. Commvault is now a credible alternative to hot-shot emerging growth companies such as Rubrik and Cohesity. With estimates conservative and the company gaining new customers, expanding renewals, and a reasonable valuation, we believe the risk/reward for owning the shares was never better. Therefore, we recommend investors to own the name. We believe patient investors will be amply rewarded.As we had previously outlined in our previous writeup on SA, Commvault faces risks ranging from potential macro slowdown to execution issues. Please refer to our previous article for further details.We recommend investors take a position now, given that the company's share buyback is likely to support the stock. As previously mentioned, Commvault noted that it expects to be active in buying shares during the quarter. Commvault is also planning to hold an analyst day shortly. At the analyst day, Commvault is expected to lay out its product strategy, road map, and financial outlook for F2022 and beyond. The company is scheduled to report earnings around January 27th. We expect the company to report results that will be in line to ahead, and the company will provide guidance, which is also likely to be ahead of estimates. The December quarter is driven by federal year-end, as well as the calendar year-end budget flush. If the stock sells off for any reason, we would recommend investors back up the truck and add to their positions."
4379529,105757,2020-10-17T00:46:11-04:00,"Commvault is rated the best backup software in the industry by multiple third-parties as well as its customers; stock underperformed significantly over the past year.Commvault software was complex and was hard to install, allowing less robust solutions such as Veeam, Cohesity, and Rubrik an opportunity to gain a foothold.Commvault reworked its products, making them easier to buy and easier to consume. The company also acquired cutting-edge solutions such as Hedvig and launched newer products.Hedvig plus Commvault is perhaps one of the best solutions in the industry today, and we expect the company to gain share in the next few quarters.Given improving execution, reasonable valuation, and opportunity to gain share, we believe CVLT has favorable risk/reward and is, therefore, a buy.","Commvault (NASDAQ:CVLT), a data backup and recovery solution, has made impressive strides in reinventing its business over the last few years. The company is known for its backup and recovery software, and independent analysts such as Forrester, Gartner, and IDC consider Commvault the best solution in the market. Despite having the best product in the market in terms of capabilities, Commvault lost momentum in the market, leading to the CEO being fired and activist investors taking a position in the name. Over the last few years, IT architectures have gone through a significant transformation, with enterprises deploying applications both on-prem and in the cloud in what is called hybrid architecture. On top of this, newer technologies such as containers and microservices are being used to build applications. To address these developments, the company re-architected its product line, launched new products (Hyperscale) based on its flagship software, acquired Hedvig, a software-defined storage company, and launched simplified licensing models. Aided by the changes mentioned above, driven by solid execution, new go-to-market products, and strategies, we expect Commvault to increase growth rates north of 10% in C2021 and beyond. On top of this, we believe the estimates are reasonable and the valuation compelling. Given our confidence in the management team and the product portfolio, we believe Commvault is set to exceed expectations. Therefore Commvault is a buy.Commvault's backup and recovery software is extensible, full-featured, and is the most robust anywhere. However, newer entrants such as Veeam, Rubrik, and Cohesity attacked the market with simpler products that addressed one or two most critical needs. These newer entrants began attacking Commvault at the mid-market segment and have had enormous success in stalling Commvault's growth. Veeam, for instance, vaulted from having a market share that is around 3% in 2011 to over 14% market share in 2019, in a span of eight years. Despite the enormous competition and trouble in the mid-market, which we mentioned before, Commvault managed to gain 417 basis points of share, mostly focusing on the higher end of the market. Commvault's market share gains despite enormous challenges give us confidence that customers appreciate the strength of Commvault's offerings. With product and pricing simplification, in addition to newer product bundles, we believe Commvault is set on gaining momentum in the mid-market.Commvault historically had one of the best backup and recovery solutions in the market. Third-party vendors such as Gartner, Forrester, etc., usually consider CVLT's offerings best in class. Despite this stellar rating, Commvault has ONLY the fourth largest market share beyond Veritas Software, IBM (NYSE:IBM) Tivoli Storage Manager, and Dell/EMC (NYSE:DELL) Networker. The ranking has not changed for many years, given that share gains/losses are very slow to materialize. Commvault's main problem is that its offerings are too complex, and the pricing is opaque. Nimbler vendors such as Veeam architected their offerings so that a customer can install and configure the product easily without needing expensive services engagement. More importantly, customers can download the software and try it for free before purchasing it. This led to rapid adoption in the SMB market at the expense of Commvault and other large vendors in the market. The following table illustrates the Backup and Recovery market shares.Back and Recovery Market share gainsSource: Author, based on Gartner dataSource: GartnerCommvault's Metallic SaaS offering is currently available only on the Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT) platform. Metallic is receiving excellent reviews from the users, and the company has been pleased with the progress so far. We believe Metallic is driving growth in the mid-market segment.

Based on our understanding, we believe Commvault is likely to launch Metallic later this quarter or in earlier 2021.According to MarketsandMarkets, the data backup and recovery market is projected to grow from about $6.58 billion in 2016 to about $11.59 billion by 2022 or growing at 10.2% CAGR in the time period. According to MarketsandMarkets, ""major drivers of the data backup and recovery market include rapidly growing data and an increasing focus on operational excellence and data quality management. The increasing adoption of cloud data backup solutions is also a major factor driving the market"". Layering on top of this, the primary storage market which the company has now entered, we believe Commvault's TAM is growing at least 10% from the current levels. We believe there is no reason why Commvault cannot grow at 10%, especially after the recent launch of Hyperscale X, Hedvig, and the Metallic product lines.After analyzing consensus estimates, we believe Commvault estimates are conservative. The Street is forecasting revenue to decline by 1% in C2020 and grow only 3% in C2021 and 5% in C2022. While we understand that software revenue is under-duress due to the model transition, we believe the estimates may be too conservative, mainly because the Backup and Recovery market is growing around 10% and the subscription renewal cycle that is currently underway. We believe Commvault now has multiple products (Metallic, Hedvig, Hyperscale X), all that can be sold on a subscription basis. These newer products, such as Hyperscale X and Hedvig, did not exist before the arrival of the CEO, and will drive growth over next two years. The following chart illustrates consensus estimates.Source: Authors estimates based on Refinitiv dataSince the company reported results on July 28th, Commvault stock is only up 1.54% when compared to Nasdaq that is up 13.14% and S&P up 8.39%. The following graph illustrates the underperformance since the report.Over the last one year, Commvault significantly underperformed both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices. CVLT is down 4%, while Nasdaq is up 46%, and S&P is up 17%. The following chart illustrates the underperformance.We believe the worst is behind for the company, and now it has multiple growth drivers to aid the stock recovery. The drivers include simplification of the product line, unbundling of the product into various individual solutions, newer product to address the growth areas such as hybrid cloud and software-defined storage. Commvault is now a credible alternative to hot-shot emerging growth companies such as Rubrik and Cohesity. In addition, we expect tailwinds from the renewals and reasonable valuation to drive the stock higher.We recommend investors take a position ahead of its earnings on October 27th. We expect the company to report results that will be in line, and the company will provide guidance, which is likely to be ahead of estimates given that federal year end, as well as calendar year-end budget flush. If the stock sells off for any reason, we would recommend investors back up the truck and add to their positions."

At the time of the initial report, the stock received a Very Unattractive rating. Our short thesis noted the firm's lack of profitability, subpar corporate governance, and overvalued stock price.During the 592-day holding period, CVLT outperformed as a short position, declining 17% compared to a 15% gain for the S&P 500.We upgraded CVLT's Overall Risk/Reward Rating to Unattractive in October 2017 and, then, to Neutral, on 5/3/19.

4111326,24157,2017-10-03T10:15:09-04:00,"CommVault's late transition to the cloud based software market has left it with falling profits, lagging margins, and a significantly overvalued stock.Since 2014, CVLT's after-tax profit (NOPAT) has fallen from $65 million in 2014 to -$1 million over the last twelve months.The expectations baked into CommVault’s stock price imply that the firm will reverse years of issues, immediately achieve profitability, and significantly grow profits.","Failing to adapt in a timely fashion can send a business into a downward spiral. This firm’s late transition to the cloud based software market has left it with falling profits, lagging margins, and a significantly overvalued stock. CommVault Systems, Inc. (CVLT) is this week’s Danger Zone pick.Per Figure 1, CVLT’s revenue has grown 4% compounded annually since 2014 while its after-tax profit (NOPAT) has fallen from $65 million in 2014 to -$1 million over the last twelve months. The disconnect between revenue and profits comes from rapidly declining margins. The company’s NOPAT margin fell from 11% in 2014 to 0% TTM.Figure 1: CVLT’s NOPAT & Revenue Since 2014Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsDeclining margins have sent CommVault’s return on invested capital (ROIC) into negative territory (-1% TTM). Further, the company has burned through a $25 million (1% of market cap) in cumulative free cash flow since 2014. The firm’s -$39 million in FCF over the last twelve months equates to a -2% FCF yield, which is well below the 2% average of the stocks in the S&P 500.CommVault’s executive compensation plan fails to properly align executives’ interests with shareholders’ interests. The misalignment drives the profit losses shown in Figure 1. Worse, the current compensation plan allows executives to earn large bonuses while shareholder value is destroyed.Executives’ cash bonuses are tied to the achievement of revenue and non-GAAP operating income goals. Non-GAAP operating income conveniently removes real operating costs such as stock-based compensation and tax expenses on stock options and restricted stock awards.The performance measures used for equity awards include total shareholder return, revenue and non-GAAP operating income.We’ve demonstrated through numerous case studies that ROIC, not revenue or non-GAAP metrics, is the primary driver of shareholder value creation. A recent white paper published by Ernst & Young also validates the importance of ROIC (see here: Getting ROIC Right) and the superiority of our data analytics. Without major changes to this compensation plan (e.g. emphasizing ROIC), investors should expect further value destruction. In addition, we suggest the board of directors, especially the compensation committee, consider their culpability and responsibility for the misalignment of interests.CommVault uses non-GAAP metrics such as non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income to overstate its true profitability. Our research digs deeper so our clients see through the illusory numbers. Below are some of the items CommVault removes to calculate its non-GAAP net income:These adjustments have a large impact on the disparity between GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, and economic earnings. In 2017 and 2016, CommVault removed over $74 million (11% of revenue) and $64 million (11% of revenue), respectively, in expenses related to stock-based compensation to calculate non-GAAP net income. When added with the other adjustments, CommVault reported 2017 non-GAAP net income of $48 million. Per Figure 2, GAAP net income was $1 million and economic earnings were -$5 million in 2017.Figure 2: CVLT’s Misleading Non-GAAP MetricsSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsCommVault’s business covers a wide-range of products and services, largely grouped into the data and information software application market. More specifically, CVLT provides software solutions that provide data protection, backup, and recovery, cloud infrastructure management, and data indexing/archiving. The data management market is highly competitive, with firms ranging from small one-off solutions to industry leaders with a suite of products able to meet the many needs of customers. The proliferation of cloud computing in recent years has also increased the competition in the market. Competitors include firms such as Oracle (ORCL), VMware (VMW), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Dell EMC, International Business Machines (IBM), and Veritas (recently spun out of Symantec (SYMC), among others.Per Figure 3, CVLT’s ROIC and NOPAT margin fall well below nearly all competitors/peers. In fact, the only firm with a lower margin is prior Danger Zone pick Carbonite (NASDAQ:CARB). Success in the information software market is largely dependent on product functionality, scalability, and price. The firms with the highest profitability have greater flexibility to invest in product enhancement, new offerings, increased integration across data management, and ultimately undercut competitors' pricing if necessary. Firms with lower profitability, such as CommVault, face consistent margin pressure and limited resources to build industry leading technologies.Figure 3: CommVault Systems’ Lagging ProfitabilitySources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings Prior to 2014, CommVault was consistently growing revenue and profits while selling its Simpana branded software platform. However, the shift to cloud based solutions, one-off software offerings (one piece of the data management “puzzle), and even a shift from license to subscription based arrangements left CVLT behind in a rapidly changing industry. Since then, the firm has been unable to stop the downward trend in profitability. To buy into the bull case now requires belief that years of struggles are suddenly coming to an end, despite a more competitive market.Beginning in 2014, CommVault began transitioning its business to address the changing landscape. The firm looked to build on its existing platform, move solutions to cloud-based services, and target standalone software solutions. Management was upfront about the struggles the company would face, but the results have not been as positive as expected. As early as fiscal 3Q15, management noted that the transformation of CVLT was designed to “bring the firm back to historical financial performance in the second half of fiscal 2016.” However, profitability continued its decline, as NOPAT margin fell from 4% in 2015, to 0.3% in 2016, and then 0% in 2017.The side effects of this business transformation have been rising costs that are eating away at profitability. Per Figure 4, research & development, sales & marketing, and general & administrative costs have risen 15%, 11%, and 8% compounded annually, respectively, since 2014. Meanwhile, revenues have grown only 4% compounded annually over the same time.Figure 4: CommVault’s Expenses Outpacing Revenue GrowthSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings The growth in expenses presents a troubling situation for CommVault. The company must spend heavily in development and advertising to introduce new products and/or move into different pricing strategies. However, continued expense growth limits the firm’s ability to achieve profitability. Further compounding the issue, creating new products always brings uncertainty and the firm must execute to perfection to ensure the market uptake.Despite the execution risk, the expectations baked into CommVault’s stock price imply that the firm will reverse years of issues, immediately achieve profitability, and significantly grow profits, as we’ll show below.CVLT has risen 76% over the past two years and 24% year-to-date while the S&P 500 has risen 29% and 12% over the same time frames. This performance has occurred despite NOPAT and ROIC declining. This move in the stock has widened the chasm between the company’s current financial performance and the significantly higher profits implied by the stock’s market value.Figure 5 shows CVLT and its peers compared on the basis of ROIC and enterprise value divided by invested capital (a cleaner version of price to book). As you can see, ROIC explains 59% of the changes in valuation for the peer group.Figure 5: ROIC Explains 59% of Valuation for the Systems Software MarketSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsCVLT stands out as an outlier in Figure 5 and trades at a significant premium to its peers. If the stock were to trade at parity with the peer group, it would be $19/share – 70% below the current stock price. Given the firm’s deteriorating fundamentals, it should be clear CVLT does not deserve such a premium valuation.Our discounted cash flow model quantifies the expectations baked into that premium valuation. To justify its current price of $61/share, CVLT must immediately achieve 8% NOPAT margins (average of 2007-2014, before competitive advantage eroded, compared to 0% TTM) and grow revenue by 12% compounded annually for the next 14 years. This scenario would imply NOPAT growth of 138% compounded annually. The large NOPAT CAGR is a result of the immediate assumption of profitability after NOPAT was -$1 million over the last twelve months. This scenario seems overly optimistic given the firm’s struggles improving profitability since transitioning its business.Even if we assume CVLT can achieve 4% NOPAT margins and grow revenue by 10% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is still worth only $27/share today – a 56% downside risk. This scenario implies NOPAT growth of 198% compounded annually. Again, the large NOPAT CAGR is a result of the immediate assumption of profitability.Each of these scenarios also assumes CVLT is able to grow revenue, NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or investing in fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create optimistic scenarios that demonstrate just how high expectations embedded in the current valuation really are. For reference, CVLT’s invested capital has grown on average $29 million (5% of revenue) each year since 2014.The largest risk to any bear thesis is what we call “stupid money risk”, which means an acquirer comes in and pays for CVLT at the current, or higher, share price despite the stock being overvalued. With large, more profitable competitors in the market make an acquisition less likely. Competitors would be better suited to out compete CVLT rather than ignore prudent stewardship of capital and destroy substantial shareholder value in an acquisition. We show below how expensive CVLT remains even after assuming an acquirer can achieve significant synergies.To begin, CommVault has liabilities of which investors may not be aware that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest.After adjusting for these liabilities, we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, CommVault is worth less than its current share price.Figures 6 and 7 show what we think IBM should pay for CVLT to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. IBM could integrate CVLT into its enterprise offerings and immediately increase its exposure in the information software market. However, there are limits on how much IBM would pay for CVLT to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT and free cash flows (or lack thereof) being acquired.Each implied price is based on a ‘goal ROIC’ assuming different levels of revenue growth. In both scenarios, the estimated revenue growth rate is 9% in year one and 10% in year two, which is the consensus estimate of revenue growth for the next two years. For the subsequent years, we use 10% in scenario one because it represents a continuation of next year’s expectations. We use 15% in scenario two because it assumes a merger with IBM would create revenue synergies thorough increased exposure to IBM’s larger enterprise customer base.We conservatively assume that IBM can grow CVLT’s revenue and NOPAT without spending anything on working capital or fixed assets beyond the original purchase price. We also assume CVLT immediately achieves a 7% NOPAT margin, which is the average of IBM’s and CommVault’s current NOPAT margin. For reference, CVLT’s TTM NOPAT margin is 0%, so this assumption implies immediate improvement and allows the creation of a truly best-case scenario.Figure 6: Implied Acquisition Prices for IBM To Achieve 5% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings. Figure 6 shows the ‘goal ROIC’ for IBM as its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) or 5%. Even if CVLT can grow revenue by 13% compounded annually with a 7% NOPAT margin for the next five years, the firm is worth less than its current price of $61/share. It’s worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 5% ROIC would be only value neutral and not accretive, as the return on the deal would equal IBM’s WACC.Figure 7: Implied Acquisition Prices for IBM To Achieve 9% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings. Figure 7 shows the next ‘goal ROIC’ of 9%, which is IBM’s current ROIC. Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to IBM shareholders. Even in the best-case growth scenario, the most IBM should pay for CVLT is $27/share (55% downside to current valuation). Even assuming this best-case scenario, IBM would destroy over $1.2 billion by purchasing CVLT at its current valuation. Any scenario assuming less than 13% compound annual growth in revenue would result in further capital destruction for IBM.Despite the deteriorating fundamentals and inherent risks in the turnaround story, expectations for CVLT are rising. Over the past 12 months, the consensus 2017 EPS estimate has risen 5% while the consensus 2018 EPS estimate has risen over 15%.The rising expectations create a scenario where any revenue or earnings miss could send shares falling. We’ve already highlighted the optimistic expectations baked into the stock price and essentially the stock is priced for perfection. Anything less could bring to light that the transformation has not returned the firm to its prior profitability.While we don’t attempt to predict exactly when the market will recognize the disconnect between expectations and reality, we know the impact of failing to meet expectations can be highly negative.Over the past 12 months, 60 thousand insider shares have been purchased and 468 thousand have been sold for a net effect of 408 thousand insider shares sold. These sales represent 1% of shares outstanding.Short interest is currently 1 million shares, equating to 2% of shares outstanding and nearly 5 days to cover. There has been a significant jump in short interest this year, as the number of shares sold short has nearly doubled from the end of 2016. Growing short interest would seem to imply we’re not the only ones who recognize the issues facing CVLT and its lofty valuation.Our Robo-Analyst technology enables us to perform forensic accounting with scale and provide the research needed to fulfill fiduciary duties. In order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and an accurate shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to CommVault’s 2017 10-K:Income Statement: We made $5 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing $1 million in non-operating income (<1% of revenue). We removed $2 million related to non-operating expenses and $3 million related to non-operating income. See all the adjustments made to CVLT’s income statement here.Balance Sheet: We made $523 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $434 million. Apart from $418 million in excess cash, the most notable adjustment was $61 million (12% of reported net assets) related to deferred tax assets. See all adjustments to CVLT’s balance sheet here.Valuation: We made $576 million of adjustments with a net effect of increasing shareholder value by $320 million. Apart from the excess cash noted above, the largest adjustment to shareholder value was $97 million in outstanding employee stock options. This adjustment represents 4% of CVLT’s market cap. Despite the net increase in shareholder value, CVLT remains significantly overvalued.The following funds receive our Unattractive-or-worse rating and allocate significantly to CommVault Systems.This article originally published on September 25, 2017.Disclosure: David Trainer, Kyle Guske II, and Kenneth James receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme."
4117816,98236,2017-10-28T15:25:59-04:00,"CommVault announced the results of its fiscal Q2 earlier this week.The results were disappointing, with the company missing license revenue expectations and EPS forecasts by noticeable amounts.The company maintained that the results were entirely the result of ""screw ups"" on the part of several sales teams, primarily in the US.The company has maintained its full-year guidance despite the miss and forecast license revenue growth in the mid-teens by Q4.The company has made several significant product announcements and has announced a significant and far ranging new alliance with Cisco.","CommVault (CVLT) reported the results of its fiscal quarter Tuesday morning. During the midst of a strong earnings season in tech and elsewhere, the results were singularly disappointing. On the other hand, particularly for this company, its guidance was uniquely specific and upbeat. I have followed CVLT for some years - during periods when investors couldn’t pay enough for the shares, and during periods when investors and many analysts thought the company was doomed to extinction. I have expressed my sentiment, in prior articles, that the company had developed a successful strategy and had transitioned into a sustainable recovery. The results this quarter certainly appear to challenge that thesis. After several quarters of consistently improving license revenue growth, that metric took a tumble - not to negative territory, but to levels that disappointed just about all stakeholders, including the CEO.Needless to say, the earnings release precipitated a significant share price reaction. The shares have fallen by 17% in the last 10 days while the IGV has risen 2.7% over that same spanShortly before the earnings release, the company and its shares were pilloried in an article on this site which took the company to task for not changing with the times. The article surprised me by its lack of informed judgement regarding this company. Of course, the writer looks prescient at this point - but I think the logic of the article was deeply flawed. Whatever else is true, CommVault has adapted about as well as any other vendor in the storage back-up and recovery space. Just looking at the results of this company in a rear-view mirror, and trying to make those results a proxy for understanding the business dynamics of this space, does potential investors a disservice.About two years ago, it looked as though NetApp (NTAP) was road kill. NetApp had not adapted to the changing tides in storage and its results suffered accordingly. But a new CEO and a new management team changed the company’s direction and results improved. Essentially, the same scenario has recently played out at VMware (VMW). Despite the stumble this past quarter, I think that CommVault is heading in the right direction with more tailwinds than headwinds. It has long had the best technology and the highest levels of user satisfaction and it's more than a bit off-putting to see the company described as ""doomed"" because of its inability to adapt.There is nothing in either the company’s outlook or even in measures such as Gartner’s MQ analysis that suggests that the company’s product strategy is flawed. Even its use of stock-based comp, which apparently formed much of the basis for the article published on Seeking Alpha, is not a particular outlier in the IT space.CommVault operates in a space whose prospects were initially challenged by the cloud. Adaptation is really in the eyes of the beholder. CommVault has and has had a variety of solutions for cloud back-up and disaster recovery for some years now and those innovations have latterly started to produce revenue and margin improvement. Users have changed their spending priorities and are now focused on acquiring cloud based storage as well as transitioning on-prem storage to all-flash arrays.Not terribly surprisingly, back-up and recovery solutions have become readily available from AWS and its competitors. I have linked here with the AWS offering. Gartner says that users will see rapidly rising adoption continue to shift more of their storage to the cloud. In addition, Gartner says that about 20% of storage systems will be self-protecting, up from 5% today. At the least, those are considered by some to be headwinds for vendors selling back-up and recovery storage solutions.But that said, CommVault continues to be the absolute leader for back-up and recovery solutions according to Gartner and was reaffirmed in its leadership position in the survey published by Gartner in late July. Its overall solution set and user satisfaction scores continue to outclass well known competitors such as Dell/EMC and Veritas. According to Gartner, CommVault has ""comprehensive and leading public cloud support as well as protection for O365 and Salesforce (CRM) data."" Gartner goes on to write about some of the other products and services that CVLT offers, but most telling for investors is that, ""Customers report a very high likelihood to repurchase CVLT solutions."" Gartner says that CommVault solutions are complex and some perceive its solutions as expensive. On the other hand, Gartner believes that the complexity is a product of the company’s market leading capabilities. Forrester’s Wave Data Resilience report echoes these themes and can be found on CommVault's own website in addition to this link. Some brokerage analysts who do their own surveys have reached similar conclusions with regards to CVLT's technology and competitive positioning. CommVault, based on the evaluations made by the leading market research analysts and brokerage analysts, has been and should remain the leader in the space and is more likely than not to gain market share over time.I think many investors who experienced the two-year trough through which this company went have yet to recognize that CVLT actually leads in this space in terms of its technology and that the company has positioned itself to enjoy burgeoning growth opportunities. I believe that a more balanced view of data back up and recovery business segment is that while the space has headwinds, there are certainly growth opportunities as well. CommVault can protect more exotic and newer technologies and its coverage of on-prem solutions is considered by Gartner to be ""end to end and complete."" The company has added what is called orchestration to its machine conversion capabilities to enable migration of entire applications to the cloud. If none of this seems to reflect any inability or unwillingness or inability to adapt, that proposition is very wide off the mark.The IT world continues to evolve at a rapid pace and hybrid-cloud configurations become accepted as a compelling paradigm. This in turn has led to new opportunities and use cases for enterprise backup and recovery. Indeed, as this article will explore, despite the disappointing sales performance this past quarter, the company has introduced a variety of innovative solutions that extend its market presence and are likely to afford it a set of new sales opportunities.The shares have been a disappointing holding of mine over the past few quarters. They are essentially unchanged year to date in the wake of the pullback due to the earnings disappointment and that is lots of negative alpha given just how strong the tech sector has been so far this year.It has become obvious that in the last several months, as valuations in tech have escalated, it has been more difficult to find names that have both decent prospects and a reasonable valuation. There are those who believe that tech sector valuations are on a bubble. I won't attempt to discuss the merits of that argument here. But I do believe that when a company with a reasonably positive business outlook goes through a quarter of mis-execution and its valuation contracts significantly, it is more reasonable in this environment to try to dive deeper rather than simply to write off the name as road kill. I think a little bit of due diligence will be repaid with a decent investment opportunity that is currently on sale at a reasonable valuation.A lot of things are context. CommVault’s quarter cannot be characterized as anything other than ugly. That is particularly true given that the storage space in general seems to be having a bit of a recovery in terms of at least achieving a positive growth rate. And it is especially true as well in the context of the company’s results in the prior quarter which were far more auspicious.Some of the salient highlights reported by CommVault included the following: Revenues grew by 6% and were $2 million or about 1.5% below the prior consensus. Earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $.21 compared to prior expectations of $.26. License revenue growth of 2% for the quarter was anemic and license revenues came in about 10% less than prior expectations.A miss on license revenues, and a miss on EPS. It is almost surprising that the shares did not fall more than they did, although CVLT shares had been flat the past 3 months prior to the earnings release and had only increased by 19% over the year to date before the sell-off in the wake of this earnings release.The company was able to increase service revenues by about 7% year over year and about 6% sequentially, noticeably above prior expectations and prior company guidance. Some of this was the result of prior pricing changes that had negatively impacted service revenue growth but whose year-on-year effects are starting to diminish. The company’s deferred revenue balance has continued to increase year over year at a modest rate, but that is primarily a function of prior license sales that lead to deferred maintenance revenue.The company’s GAAP gross margins were consistent with the levels of the prior year. While the company had a greater mix of lower margin services revenues this past quarter compared to its results a year ago, it did achieve some gross margin gains on the service revenue line, mainly related to higher volumes.The company’s operating expenses increased by 8% year over year but was flat sequentially. Sales productivity has often been an issue for this company on and off for a long time and that remains the case. Last quarter, it actually reduced both general and administrative costs and research and development expense sequentially while holding sales and marketing at levels consistent with the prior quarter. Part of the increase in opex related to the introduction of new product and marketing initiatives at rates not seen by this company in the recent past. Overall, GAAP operating margins were -2.7% compared to break even the year before and -2.6% the prior quarter.There is substantial operating leverage in this model - or put another away, the company does not yet have an appropriate level of sales productivity and it certainly could reduce its general and administrative expense ratio. I might speculate that the company’s high level of sales and marketing expense - it was 60% of revenues last quarter compared to 59% of revenues the same quarter the prior year on a GAAP basis - relates to the company’s overall, whale-hunting, sales strategy which can consume lots of resources and which can often produce lumpy business flows.I can’t think of any good reason why this company, at its current size, needs to spend 13.6% of revenues on general and administrative costs - again on a GAAP basis. That is a level several hundred basis points above what might be considered normal for a company of this size which has a long operating history.Operating cash flow (CFFO) fell sharply compared to cash generation in the same quarter the prior year. The decline in CFFO was mainly a product of balance sheet items that are likely to reverse going forward and reflected no real change in the company’s business model.Stock-based comp fell a bit sequentially, although it was more than 100% of the company’s CFFO last quarter. In addition, stock-based comp remained at more than 100% of the company’s non-GAAP operating income. The dilution from stock based comp has essentially been offset by share repurchases. That is expected to be the case going forward.The company saw weak revenue performance in the Americas, much stronger performance in EMEA and modestly positive sales performance in its APAC region. It suggested that its performance stemmed from sales execution miscues on the part of several sales teams in the US and a couple in APAC. These results seemingly support that explanation for the company’s sales performance.What is a reasonable growth rate to forecast for CommVault. Is it the 18% license revenue growth achieved in the company’s fiscal Q1 (ended 6/30) or the 2% the company reported this time around. Is the software revenue growth of 22% achieved in EMEA this quarter a better representation of the future, or is the 7% decline seen in that metric this last quarter in the Americas a better indicator of future revenue trends?For what it is worth, Gartner has reported that the market for on-premise back-up and recovery solutions grew about 7% last year. But in addition to that market, CommVault also is a leader in what is called the global cloud backup and recovery market. While that market is far smaller today in revenue, it is expected to become more significant over the coming years because of its CAGR of 26% shown in the report linked here. Finally, there is a market for what is described as disaster recovery. In that market, many solutions are sold as a service so the current revenue is relatively small, but the percentage growth rate is very high. And there are many different vendors competing for a piece of the market beyond the well-known participants in the back-up and recovery market. CommVault is actually a leader in all the different phases of this combined market and has had different specific offering in each market segment as well as a unified platform for several years. Overall, the market for what CommVault is selling is probably expanding in the low-mid double digits and is likely to continue that kind of growth with some potential for rising CAGRs due to the explosive growth in the disaster recovery space.I have linked here to CommVault’s Unified Cloud Data Protection literature. CommVault, in terms of adaptation, was an early entrant into the cloud market compared to most of its competitors, and because of its range of capabilities, the migration of workloads to the cloud has been and is likely to continue to be a factor in the company’s market share gains over the next several years.Management guidance in the wake of the miss is somewhat controversial as can be seen from looking at the conference call transcript. The company reaffirmed its expectations for 10% top-line growth for the full year which implies a material reacceleration of license growth over the next two quarters. License revenues are expected to rise in the low double digits over the balance of the year with sequential reacceleration. Historically, because CommVault lived or died based on a relative handful of larger deals, forecasting specific quarterly performance of license revenues has been a bootless enterprise. But the advent of the companies newest set of solutions can be reasonably expected to diminish the overall weighting of large deals in CommVault's license revenue mix. Further, the company has taken significant steps to broaden its distribution channels and to cut back on its reliance on high close rates for large deals. The set-up is now such that it is entirely plausible to anticipate a much stronger bounce-back in Q3 license revenue growth than has been forecasted.The company made what appears to be a significant partnership announcement with Cisco (CSCO) that is expected to produce noticeable revenues in this current fiscal year. The offering with Cisco, called Scale Protect for Cisco UCS, is now a formal component of Cisco’s data center offering. I confess that I am often dubious about partnerships and alliances and have seen more than a few promising relationships, including some developed with several software vendors and Cisco, fall to the ground. But more lately, Cisco’s own strategic issues have led to a focus on these kinds of solutions, and a similar initiative with Nutanix (NTNX) has achieved promising results.The company has announced a new iteration of what it calls its HyperScale Appliance. The company announced it has already seen success with the new product. This isn’t the place to review the specific potentials for the HyperScale technology other than to suggest it is likely to be a major factor in the company’s growth and market share gains going forward. The appliance is touted as a disruptive technology in the mid-market and as part of a sales tactic that will serve as an entry point to larger scale enterprises. As I have written on other occasions, too many tech vendors like the sound of disruptive - when I read about a new product being disruptive, I am always inclined to believe it is being over-hyped, but I have no reason to disbelieve the company’s claim that its new offering is setting a new level of price/performance in its category.HyperScale is both a hardware and a software offering, and the software can be used with hardware from all of the major storage hardware vendors in a model similar to that used by Nutanix in its goals to sell software more than commodity hardware. The architecture and implementation of HyperScale is self-evidently aimed at user workloads in the hybrid cloud. Did the pending announcement of this new product with its dramatic price/performance improvements impact sales of its older technologies last quarter? The company says that was not the case, but it would not be surprising if there were some deals that were postponed or reconsidered given the significant price/performance advantages of the new technology.Another factor that should be a positive demand driver going forward is CommVault’s disaster recovery technology. Cyber-attacks, as almost everyone realizes, do occasionally win through. That typically requires some kind of disaster recovery strategy to deal with corrupted data. These kinds of attacks, if not remediated, can have noticeable impacts on the operation of an enterprise-just look at the results that Nuance (NUAN) is reporting to see how much a cyber-attack can impact the operations of a business. CommVault solutions are designed as one component of a multi-tiered response to these kinds of threats and as mentioned earlier, the on-demand solutions for disaster recovery have the fastest percentage growth (a CAGR of over 40%) in the data protection universe.The track record of this management with regards to guidance is mainly that it has been conservative. Management claimed during the conference call that the miss last quarter was not due to competition and provided some details to substantiate that claim. Most of the issues that were spoken about looked to be ones of basic sales execution. The term of art used was “they (the sales teams) screwed up.”Management was queried regarding its willingness to maintain full year revenue guidance after the Q2 miss. The answer to the query came from multiple sources in the management team and was more than a bit convoluted. But the net is that the company has an exceptional pipeline, that the take-up of its new products is faster than assumed, and that while the external forecast has been maintained, the internal forecast has been lowered. In other words, CommVault had planned to do much better than its current forecast, even if that current forecast remains consistent with prior external guidance.The CEO's script said that the “vast majority of all those accounts that pushed should close by the end of the fiscal year and many of them will close in this current quarter.” In addition, the CEO also stated that some of these missed large deals have already closed, although quantitative specifics were not provided. Should that be the case, then most likely, the company will exceed its product sales forecast in the coming quarters. Management said that many of the Americas teams hit their numbers-the issue was one of isolated execution. The CEO also suggested that ""there was no theme or rhyme on the large deals that didn’t close.""I would also point out that the CEO was willing to say that because of the introduction of new products to address the mid-market, and because of the deepened alliance with Cisco, that close rates on large deals would be less important, particularly in Q4. The comment made by the CEO to the effect that close rates in Q4 really do not need to be particularly strong to deliver on the forecast is definitely not vintage CommVault. The comment about Q3 close rates, and the need to execute on sales opportunities in this current quarter, is far more consistent with management's past commentary.Management, when asked, stoutly maintained that competition wasn’t a factor in the pushed deals. The CEO and the head of sales said it not once or twice but on several occasions and in several ways. I simply do not think that Bob Hammer (CEO) or even Al Bunte (head of sales) has much to gain at this point by suggesting that black is white. Needless to say, there are very few companies who acknowledge that they are losing to competitors, and fewer still, who are going to get that kind of feedback from their field sales force. In my experience, one can always blame customer procrastination or approval cycles without too much fear of recrimination. Losing to competitors is a different matter. But, again, there is no real reason for this company to lose to competitors-particularly since it changed its pricing and packaging a year or more ago. CommVault's solutions, as pointed out by Gartner and other industry commentaros, are no longer expensive for almost any workload. Further, with the pricing introduced 18 months ago, the company offers users tremendous flexibility in terms of consumption models and it has had the most effective and feature rich solutions for many years.Again, I have listened to CEO Bob Hammer on conference calls for a decade or more now - a bit of an accomplishment given the man's diction and gravelly New York accent. I am not sure I have ever in the past heard him speak specifically about something like the fast take-up of a new product such as HyperScale. It is usually the other way around in that he is prone to talking about relatively lengthy ramps for new products. So again, and based solely on past form, or pattern recognition, I have to give the current forecast the benefit of the doubt and believe that it is a forecast that is designed to be exceeded.At the end of the day, investors have to decide themselves as to whether this management is credible or not. The management providing these projections that has been running this company in both times of hyper-growth, in times of business stress and most recently in times of recovery. Overall, I am more inclined than not to believe their explanations for the miss this past quarter and I think the odds of a noticeable and above guidance bounce-back are good.Catching falling knives can be a difficult strategy for investors. Often companies never recover their form once they have started down a slippery slope. I confessedly have had plenty of those experiences. In the case of CommVault, the company does not have such an elevated valuation that it isn’t prudent to take a chance in terms of taking a look at the company and its prospects.The company very forcefully forecast that it will do $708 million in revenue this fiscal year. Analysts forecast 10% growth the following year, but that kind of forecast suggests that almost all of the comments made by management about growth and execution on this last call are invalid. But in any event, for this valuation exercise, I will use $750 million in revenue for the next 12 months with some expectation that the number is more likely than not to be exceeded.Management has forecast diluted weighted average share count of 48.5 million, a bit higher than the outstanding share count at the end of Q2. The company is buying back shares at a modest rate and is expected to continue to do so, but the CFO pointed out that there are several hundred thousand options that are expected to be exercised prior to their scheduled expiration. With 48.5 million shares expected on average for the full year, the company has a market capitalization $2.47 billion. With cash and equivalents close to $500 million, the enterprise value is under $2 billion and the EV/S calculation comes to 2.6X, a number that is fairly close to deep value range and certainly is far below other names in the IT space that are profitable and have double-digit growth.The company’s EPS forecast for this year comes to about $1.10 in EPS after it reduced its expected margin improvement significantly. The consensus expectation as published on First Call calls for EPS next year of $1.31. I think the consensus is not really consistent with the qualitative comments made by the company on several occasions as detailed in this article. But at that level, the P/E on a forward 12-month basis is 39X. Yes, the P/E is based on non-GAAP earnings and at current projections, the company’s GAAP earnings will be little better than break-even this year and just modestly profitable in fiscal 2019. But most investors do look at non-GAAP EPS and a 39X P/E for a company likely to achieve low double-digit growth is a relative bargain.The company has forecast that full-year free cash flow will exceed non-GAAP EBIT in a pattern that has been consistent for several years. This last quarter, free cash flow was down significantly year over year, but that was the result of balance sheet anomalies that tend to correct over the course of a full year. The company is forecasting a non-GAAP EBIT margin of about 12% this year or about $85 million in EBIT. Based on company guidance, I would expect free cash flow in the range of $90-$95 million in the current fiscal year and about $110 million over the next 12 months. That would be a free cash flow yield of 5.6%, a decent level for a company with CommVault’s prospects.At this point, and understandably in the wake of the distressing miss just reported, CommVault’s valuation metrics are more reasonable than they have been in a long time. If investors place any credibility on management commentary during the conference call, the valuation is a strong reason to buy the shares.Share price performance has been more than a bit disappointing this year. Of course, it might be fairly said, that the company has performed sub-optimally as well. I think that this pattern presents a good set-up for anticipating future positive alpha given how compressed relative valuation has become. I think the plethora of significant product and alliance initiatives presents an even better reason for expecting positive alpha going forward."
3842846,98236,2016-01-28T11:24:31-05:00,CommVault reported a strong upside to both EPS and revenues for its fiscal Q3.CommVault management explicitly endorsed current analyst estimates for Q4 and fiscal year 2017 and then suggested the potential for significant upside.Management indicated it is seeing strong tailwinds from internal turmoil at major competitors and from its own Simpana 11 product cycle.Management maintained that the cloud was helping rather than hindering sales - certainly not the consensus opinion.Management suggested that it has strong operating margin leverage with as much as an 1100 bps opportunity just on the sales and marketing line.,"Introduction/Financial Summary-Laissez Le Bon Temps Rouler:CommVault (NASDAQ:CVLT) reported the results for its December quarter. Simply put, the results were far above expectations and suggested that the company's strategy to restore its growth in the midst of what have been some pretty significant headwinds has made significant progress. Just to briefly reprise the numbers, EPS was $0.28 compared to consensus expectations of $0.20, total revenues were $156 million, a $7 million beat, and software revenue reached $71 million, flat with the prior year but up by 24% sequentially. In essence, almost all of the revenue beat was the result of stronger than anticipated software sales.Just to drill down a bit, the company continued to spend heavily on sales and marketing although sequential growth in that category was minimal in the quarter. Sales and marketing spend certainly continues to represent the largest single opportunity for margin expansion. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was about 53% of non-GAAP revenues. At its prior peak, the company had reported non-GAAP S&M expense of about 43%. The company achieved non-GAAP operating income of about $21 million or a bit more than 13% of non-GAAP revenues. Cash flow from operations was just shy of $16 million or about 10% of revenues. The company has a bit over $400 mil of cash and equivalents equal to about $8.62 per diluted share or a bit less than 24% of the company's current market capitalization.Some companies give precise guidance, some give hints and some try to do all things at the same time. With PTC (NASDAQ:PTC) for example, it would be hard to miss company expectations with some level of detail. On the other hand, it is often hard to figure out what PEGA's (NASDAQ:PEGA) guidance actually is from their press releases and conference call comments.And then there's CommVault. The specifics of the statement management made about expectations was that it was comfortable with analyst expectations which would imply little or no sequential growth in software licenses. But management also went on to say that the (sales) funnel had grown significantly during the quarter and that close rates also were climbing and were expected to continue to climb and that there were some enormous deals in its forecast for fiscal Q4 that would move the needle. Most analysts are going to take the first statement and leave their published estimates as they had been. Someone less tied to the conventions of brokerage house research would reasonably be expecting a significant sequential increase in software revenues for the March quarter in the range of 10%-20%. At the mid-point that would boost revenues by $11 million and given the incremental margins on software revenues, it would be reasonable to anticipate that with that kind of revenue beat that the company would earn $0.35-$0.40 per share non-GAAP.Essentially the same kind of analysis would hold true for expectations for fiscal 2017. Analysts are forecasting 8% growth next year although that is from a current year base estimate that seems likely to be exceeded. Again, if I were looking at the most probable set of expectations based on everything regarding the future that was said on the call, I would probably expect something like $650-$660 million of total revenues compared to current consensus expectations of $628 million, and at that level, I would anticipate that non-GAAP would most probably be expected to reach at least $1.30/share compared to the current consensus EPS forecast of $1.06 with some potential for higher margins that would further increase EPS expectations.A deeper dive into some interesting waters:I reviewed some background data regarding CommVault's solutions, its history and its competitive position in a report that was published on this site little more than a week ago and most of what I wrote would not seem in need of emendation. In the wake of this quarter, I will, however, make a couple of comments that seem salient to me in light of what management shared with investors during the course of the conference call.In particular, management suggested that a significant part of the company's higher than anticipated close rates had to do with turmoil among three of the company's largest competitors namely IBM (NYSE:IBM), Veritas and EMC (NYSE:EMC). As I have recently written regarding IBM and its problems with sales execution, I think I will leave it at that. Veritas is a very troubled company these days. It will soon be private and the PE firm that bought it was able to renegotiate a $1 billion reduction in the purchase price from parent Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) just days before the time for the transaction to close. I think one would be surprised if Veritas, under new ownership, didn't make some decisions to maximize short-term profitability and cash flow at the expense of product development and sales capacity. As to EMC, potentially the largest competitor in this space, anecdotal sources have already told me that it is laying off significant sales and support capability even prior to the merger with Dell and it would hardly shock me to hear that Dell itself was laying off individuals it considers to be duplicative. These things are neither surprising or unexpected - the fact that three major competitors are going through internal turmoil simultaneously is a bit of an anomaly and it will not be surprising to see CVLT do better than would otherwise be the case over the next several quarters until its rivals right their ships.Management talked at some length regarding the cloud and pricing. I don't want to waste time and space for readers by reprising any of the details, but it appears apparent that the company is emerging from the worst of the pricing pressures brought on by its capacity model that was a major headwind as storage efficiency kept a lid on growth in storage capacity. The improvement in pricing is going to be gradual, but it has started, as the percentage of revenue coming from capacity-based contracts dropped 400 basis points this past quarter.Company management talked about how the expansion of cloud deployments was acting to increase demand for the CVLT Simpana solution due to indexing capabilities that allow users to better locate data as they migrate it into all kinds of clouds. This is not the conventional wisdom and it will be a while, if ever before it is accepted by most analysts.And the company talked about the GA release of Simpana 11 and continued feature releases serving to boost sales of the prior generation last quarter and to produce very large potential enterprise sales this quarter. Companies like this do rise and fall with product cycles. Revenue growth engendered by a new product cycle will almost surely have a positive impact on software sales for CVLT in FY 2017 and will probably have some impact on sales in the company's fourth quarter.Valuation/Conclusion - The falling knife has started to reverse directions:Despite the general ragged market conditions that were experienced today, particularly in the tech area, CVLT shares had a nice pop, rising 16%. But in some ways, they are cheaper now than they were before the earnings release. For one thing, the shares are still 10% below the price they were to start 2016 even with the significant beat in revenues and EPS. And while valuation metrics based on published consensus may be higher than they were when I published my original article last week, I think it's fair to believe that realistically the outlook for the sales of this company, taking into account all that was said on the call, is probably greater by between 5%-10% and the outlook for FY 2017 EPS is at least 20% greater than heretofore based on any kind of reasonable interpretation of management commentary. The company's EV/S is until now around or less than 2X and given the potential operating margin leverage that would readily turn into operating cash flow, it's apparent P/E is far more of a bargain than meets the eye.Enterprise software companies, in the nature of things, can be lumpy. I have no way of foretelling how the coming quarter will come out for this company. But I think the odds of upside are pretty good and I like the risk reward afforded by this company even in the wake of the stock's pop."
2729335,66493,2014-12-05T01:23:52-05:00,"CommVault has been growing rapidly over the last several years. Yet in fiscal 2015, the company's growth has slowed to the mid-single digits.The company's slower growth is being caused by several internal issues. Management has been working hard to fix these issues but still hasn't figured out a solution.Management's inability to fix the company's issues has resulted in an exodus of top sales personnel. The loss of these sales people will continue to impact the company's future growth.The company's continued slow growth combined with an overvalued stock should result in the continued underperformance of the stock.","CommVault Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CVLT) is developer of data and information management solutions and services. Over the last several years, the company has performed well. From fiscal 2010-2014, revenue grew at a CAGR of 21.3%. Additionally, net income grew at a CAGR of 36.6% during the same period. Yet in fiscal 2015, the company's growth rate has slowed significantly. In the first half, revenue grew 10% and 6.5% in Q2. Net income actually declined 37.6% in the first half and 62.8% in Q2. CommVault's subpar performance has resulted in their stock declining 37.9% year-to-date. Over the last several quarters, management has been making several major chances to address the company's growth issue. Yet, can CommVault's management re-accelerate revenue growth and reverse the stock's decline?CommVault's rapid growth over the last several years has been driven by its quality products. These products are ranked highly by industry analysts and customers. Yet despite their top quality products, management has failed to adapt their pricing and packaging to meet changing demands. The company's pricing and packaging issue should be a short-term problem. However until fixed, the company will continue to lose top sales personnel. The loss of these top sales people will take a very long time to fix. Especially considering, the company is already suffering from a lack of sales personnel. Management needs to quickly fix their pricing and packaging issue. Unfortunately in Q2 fiscal 2015, management still hasn't fixed the issue. The lack of properly priced and packaged solutions will continue to put CommVault at a competitive disadvantage and slow growth. As a result, CommVault's growth issues should continue for several more quarters. The company's continued slow growth should result in the continued underperformance of the stock. Especially since, the stock is currently overvalued compare to top industry competitors.Top Quality ProductsIn fiscal 2015, CommVault has experienced a significant slowdown in growth. The company's slower growth is being caused by several factors. Yet, the company's product quality and competitiveness isn't one such factor. On the Q2 fiscal 2015 conference call, CEO Robert Hammer discussed the company's subpar sales execution ""The low close rate was not due to competitive losses. The low close rate was deal specific with no consistent theme..."" Management claims their products are very competitive and industry analysts agree. In 2014, Gartner ranked CommVault as a leader in the backup and recovery market for the 4th consecutive year. Additionally, CommVault is considered a leader by Forrester Research. These two independent research firms' leadership ranking of CommVault demonstrate the company's product quality. Yet, how do these research reports demonstrate Commvault's product quality?Forrester Research and Gartner use customer surveys and internal analysis to generate their rankings. The customer survey helps these research firms rank service, maintenance, and product quality. In order to rank as a leader, companies need to have top quality products, services, and very satisfied customers. This is because customers aren't going to give high marks to a company with inferior products and services.Ultimately, CommVault's products are still very competitive. Their products are ranked high by industry analysts and customers. Additionally, management hasn't noticed any significant change in the competitive win rate of their products. However, CommVault is still struggling to close deals. Assuming product quality isn't an issue, the company is suffering from other issues. These other issues are product pricing and packaging. These issues should be relatively easy to fix and short-term problems. Yet unfortunately, these short-term issues are causing longer term problems which are much harder to fix.Separate Solutions NeededCommVault used to only offer a comprehensive data and information management solution. Over the last several years, the company's comprehensive solution has sold very well which can be seen by the company's rapid growth. Yet recently, the lack of standalone solutions has impacted CommVault's growth especially in the mid-market. The company's mid-market sales have suffered due to a shift in demand.In the enterprise market, customers still rely more on comprehensive solutions. Enterprise organizations have large complex systems which require many management solutions. In order to simplify data and information management, enterprise organizations favor purchasing comprehensive solutions rather than standalone solutions. As a result, CommVault has and is still performing well in the enterprise market. However, midsized organizations tend to favor standalone solutions. Why is the mid-market so different? Midsized organizations have less complex management needs. These midsized organizations may only require one or two data management solutions. Due to only offering a comprehensive solution, CommVault drastically limited their total addressable market.In order to address the issue, management began pricing and packaging several different standalone solutions. Management's efforts should help the company's competitiveness in the mid-market which represents 40% of total revenue. However, management is still struggling with pricing and packaging. On the Q4 fiscal 2014 conference call, Robert Hammer discussed the company's packaging and pricing issue ""our packaging and pricing for that - those distribution channels in the mid-market has not been exactly optimal"" The company's pricing and packaging issues have continued in Q2 fiscal 2015. On the Q2 fiscal 2015 conference call, Robert Hammer talked about the slow roll out of mid-market solutions ""It has just taken us a long time to get these products to market, change our pricing, change our packaging, build our appliances and get all that out to market which is rolling out this quarter."" Management's inability to adjust their pricing and packaging for the mid-market should be a short-term issue. Yet unfortunately, the pricing and packaging issue is causing a longer term problem.Not Enough Personnel And Losing Top TalentCommVault's management will eventually figure out the proper pricing and packaging for the mid-market. However in the meantime, top sales personnel are leaving the company. The departure of these sales people is worsening the company's sales personnel shortage. On the Q2 fiscal 2015 conference call, Robert Hammer discussed the reason top sales people are leaving the company:The major issue for CommVault is replacing and stopping the departure of top sales people. Unlike normal turnover in the sales department, the loss of top talent will significantly impact the company's sales efforts. Especially since, the company is already suffering from a lack of sales personnel. On the Q4 fiscal 2014 conference call, Robert Hammer discussed the reason for subpar sales in America ""The Americas team has suffered from sales team understaffing throughout FY 2014."" CommVault's management needs to quickly fix the pricing and packaging issue or they will continue to lose top talent.Unfortunately, management still hasn't been able to properly price and package their products for the mid-market. The mid-market represents a significant portion of revenue. As management continues to try and figure out the right strategy, top sales personnel will continue to leave the company. The loss of these top sales people will hinder the company's turnaround efforts. This is because new sales people take around 12 months to fully ramp up and meet their sales quota. Additionally, top sales people weren't just meeting but exceeding their sales quota. This issue will take a very long time to fix.Management is Too OptimisticYet despite the company's major issues, management still believes the company is on track to accelerate revenue growth to over 20% annually by fiscal 2016. On the Q2 fiscal 2015 conference call, Robert Hammer discussed growth expectations:Despite management's optimism, the continued departure of top sales personnel will significantly impact the company's ability to sell their products even after fixing the pricing and packaging issue. This should result in slower than expected revenue acceleration. Additionally, competitors will continue to gain ground which will hurt the company's sales efforts. On the Q2 fiscal 2015 conference call, Robert Hammer discussed mid-market competition ""And I'm not going to go through them all but there are a number of smaller competitors that have done pretty well in the mid-market..."" CommVault's continued slow growth combined with their stock's current high valuation doesn't offer a compelling reason to buy.ValuationYear to date, CommVault's stock has declined 37.9%. Despite the recent decline, the stock is still trading at a premium compared to top industry competitors. The company's premium valuation is warranted based on IBM and Symantec. CommVault is growing much faster than these two companies and should trade at a premium. However, CommVault is also trading at a significant premium to EMC. CommVault shouldn't be trading at a premium compared to the faster growing EMC. Especially considering, CommVault's major near-term growth issues. Ultimately based on IBM and Symantec, CommVault can't be considered undervalued or overvalued. As a result, CommVault can be considered fairly value compared to these two companies. However compared to EMC, CommVault is significantly overvalued based on P/E, P/S, and EV/Revenue. Based on the above peer group, CommVault's stock is currently overvalued. The stock's overvalued status combined with the company's continued growth issues will result in the continued underperformance of the stock.Losing Top TalentOver the last several years, CommVault has grown rapidly. Yet in fiscal 2015, revenue growth has slowed to the mid-single digits. The company's slower growth is being driven by lackluster sales in the mid-market. The mid-market sales team is struggling due to the loss of top talent and a poorly positioned product. In Q2 fiscal 2015, management has been unable to properly price and package for the mid-market. The mid-market represents a significant portion of total revenue (40%). As a result, the company's inability to properly target the mid-market is severely impacting total revenue growth. Ultimately, management should be able to fix the product pricing and packaging issue. Yet, the pricing and packaging issue has resulted in many top sales people leaving the company. The continued exodus of top talent will significantly prolong the company's growth issues. Especially since, the company was already suffering from a sales personnel shortage.CommVault has top quality products and services. Unfortunately, management wasn't able to quickly adapt to the changing demands of customers. Management's missteps have resulted in much slower revenue growth. The company's slower revenue growth has caused the stock to decline 37.9% year-to-date. Yet despite the decline, the stock is still overvalued. The stock's overvalued status combined with the company's continued growth issues should result in the continued underperformance of the stock."

This drove the stock to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Although shares of CommVault have taken a beating so far this year, it still does not look cheap with a forward P/E of 48x and an EV/EBITDA multiple of 18.CommVault Systems provides data and information management software applications and related services. The company develops, markets, and sells a suite of software applications under the Simpana brand that provides its customers with various functions, such as data protection, data migration and archiving, and enterprise-wide search capabilities. It is headquartered in Oceanport, New Jersey.Second Quarter ResultsCommVault reported disappointing results for its fiscal 2015 second quarter on October 28. Earnings per share (not adjusted for stock-based compensation expense) came in at 14 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents.Revenue rose 7% year-over-year but declined 1% from the previous quarter to $151.1 million. This was below the consensus of $157.0 million. Software revenue declined 4% from the prior quarter while Services revenue slipped 1%.Despite the relatively modest year-over-year increase in revenue, operating expenses soared 23%. This was driven in large part by a 25% increase in Sales & Marketing expenses as the company increased its sales force. Meanwhile, operating income plunged 59% year-over-year as the operating margin fell from 18.6% to 7.2%.Estimates PlummetingFollowing the Q2 report, analysts revised their estimates significantly lower for both fiscal 2015 and 2016. The negative revisions were strong enough to send CommVault to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), placing in the bottom 5% of all companies that we rank based on earnings momentum.The 2015 Zacks Consensus Estimate is now $0.75, down from $1.30 before the report. The 2016 consensus is currently $1.15, down from $1.74 over the same period.You can see the dramatic drop in consensus estimates in the company's ""Price & Consensus"" chart:Premium ValuationAlthough shares of CommVault are down significantly so far this year, the valuation picture does not look attractive. The stock trades at a lofty 48x 12-month forward earnings, well above the industry median of 19x. And its enterprise value to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiple of 18 is well above the industry median of 9.The Bottom LineWith declining profit margins, declining earnings estimates, and premium valuation, investors should consider avoiding CommVault for now.Todd Bunton, CFA is a Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research and Editor of the Income Plus Investor and Surprise Trader services.COMMVAULT SYSTM (CVLT): Free Stock Analysis Report (email registration required)"
4087916,98236,2017-07-16T12:53:25-04:00,"Commvault will be announcing its fiscal Q1 results in another couple of weeks.While it has produced a relatively muted set of expectations for the current quarter, the company seems poised to return to strong growth status.The company's share price has been stuck in neutral for some months creating a decent set-up for share price performance.The company's product offerings have been augmented both by solutions in ancillary spaces as well as significant levels of product refresh.At current valuation levels, the company presents a significant value to potential strategic acquirers.","Commvault - Revisiting an old friend after a mid-life crisisI have spent the last few days going through the few remaining publicly traded companies in the enterprise storage space. Commvault (CVLT) is not a storage vendor per se, but it is a company that provides a software solution to provide back-up and recovery solutions for storage users and storage vendors. If the storage space does well, the odds are pretty high that Commvault will do well.Commvault has recently signed a partnership with Pure (PSTG) and Cisco (CSCO) that certainly has the potential to be significant in terms of extending the company’s footprint. The partnership has been seemingly ignored by investors, although the ability to use hyper-converged technology as part of its solution set could produce meaningful incremental revenues for CVLT. A few years ago, the company ran into a buzz-saw as its business was substantially impacted by the emergence of cloud storage service offerings and its growth grounded to a halt and for a time revenue growth was negative. The company’s revenues reached a nadir toward the back-half of 2015 and results have improved steadily and significantly since the trough. At the time of the trough, according to the Gartner survey linked here, many users felt that Commvault had lost its technological differentiation, had become difficult to use and it had the reputation as an expensive vendor. Most of those specific issues are apparently behind the company - at least according to Gartner's latest survey - although the financial impact of the adoption of different maintenance pricing models continues to retard the company’s growth potential in terms of headline numbers. That said, in the latest Gartner survey, users report positive experiences and high levels of satisfaction using Commvault's back-up and recovery tools.I last wrote about Commvault almost 9 months ago and the company hasn’t elicited a great deal of interest either back at that time or more recently. The shares have barely budged since my last article (they are up about 6%), a period which has seen the iShares North American Tech-Software ETF (BATS:IGV) appreciate by 25%. And yet the company has quietly over-attained its articulated forecasts during that period and has seen its revenue growth, and particularly its license revenue growth, accelerate as well. Simply put, Commvault’s house has gotten better, its neighborhood has continued to improve and yet the price of its dwelling has barely risen. It presents a good opportunity and one that has been overlooked by many despite First Call consensus expectations for significant top-line and EPS growth over the next couple of years.The company’s cash flow from operations exceeds non-GAAP net income consistently, primarily because of steady increases in deferred revenues. Since reaching the nadir of the company’s operational performance, the company has consistently increased its guidance, although, as mentioned earlier, its share price has not reflected that trend. It has been consistently able to surpass consensus expectations over that span, by amounts ranging from 25% to 8%, and I have no reason to believe that the current quarter will not continue that kind of performance. The company has announced that it will be reporting earnings toward the end of this month and I think it might well be an appropriate time for readers/investors to re-acquaint themselves with the investment case for the sharesThe company CEO said on the last conference call that the partnership with Pure and Cisco would enable customers to achieve greater scale when compared to what most perceive to be mainline solutions from the likes of Oracle (ORCL), VMware (VMW), SAP (SAP) and Microsoft (MSFT). As is often typical with these kind of announcements, the business opportunity is probably surpassed by the press release hype, but this announcement certainly expands the available use cases for CVLT and support the company’s growth opportunity.In another offering announced in January 2017, the company has launched a service that allows its products to be used as part of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud for backup and recovery and additionally announced a zero-cost migration option for current CVLT users to port their software to AWS. Part of the investment case for CVLT is that it has, apparently, successfully pivoted its offerings to focus on the opportunities it has working as part of an overall cloud solution. It was the failure to anticipate just how much it needed to pivot its solutions to this space, and to allow its users to achieve equivalent functionality in both the cloud and on-prem, that led to the downfall of the company several years ago.The company early-adopted ASC 606 at the start of the current fiscal year (April 1, 2017) and has restated the last 2 fiscal years in conformance with the new accounting standards. Unlike the results of many other companies adopting 606, in this case, the adjustments reduced reported results for the year ending 3/31/17 and increased results for the year ending 3/31/16. Management said that ultimately, the capitalization of 15%-20% of sales commissions and their amortization over 5 years will add 30-40 basis points to EBIT margins.For many years, CVLT has had a history of giving less than transparent guidance, both on conference calls and in investor presentations. Many conference calls have been studded with references to a variety of sales execution risks. For this company, the comment from the CEO that, ""our new solutions and enhancements should begin to impact revenues from Q2 of fiscal 2018 and help accelerate growth through the balance of fiscal 2018. Our new pricing could have a positive impact on growth as soon as Q1 of fiscal 21018. We believe our revenue outlook for Q1 2018 and full year has improved slightly as compared to current Street consensus estimates”, is decidedly positive - and probably more so than might be implied by the words themselves. Surprising, perhaps, the shares have simply not reacted to either the beat in terms of earnings and revenues or to the guidance increase. Given the extent to which many IT vendors have seen substantial share price appreciation, the share price history, or should I say lack of any material positive trend, ought to be part of the case for looking at these shares at this time.Commvault’s growth - How well is it really doing?As mentioned, looking at Commvault guidance historically had been more of an art than a science. The company now does provide somewhat specific guidance that can be evaluated. The company is forecasting that total revenues are expected to grow by 7%+ this year, 100 bps greater than prior expectations. This is an apples to apples comparison not related to the adoption of ASC 606. That might sound pretty modest, but digging down suggests that overall expectations are sitting at very substantial levels. The company’s aspirational goal is to return to greater than 20% license revenue growth with services eventually reaching comparable growth levels, although at a slower cadence because of aforementioned new pricing model. As detailed below, the company has a current set of initiatives in terms of product launches that is more likely than not to get the company to its aspirational goals in terms of revenue growth within the next 2-3 years. Indeed, the numbers as presented that Commvault is expecting to reach 20% license revenue growth by the end of the current fiscal year. Commvault is starting to do quite well; the disconnect is that its shares have been stuck in neutral, reflecting profound investor skepticism that it will be able to achieve its aspirational objectives.When looking at recent results, I think it is worthwhile commenting that the company's bookings proxy number was particularly strong. While bookings numbers for this company and many other IT vendors reflect a variety of factors, their strength is usually a good leading indicator regarding future headline numbers. The strength of Commvault's bookings proxy reflected longer-term contracts and multiyear maintenance agreements. Overall, the increase in the deferred revenues grew by 58% year on year which drove bookings growth for the period to 13%.It is, I think, also important to note that Commvault’s product revenues are expected to rise by “strong double digits.” The company’s service revenues have been constrained by a new pricing model that ultimately will be revenue neutral, but which is currently causing services revenue growth to be nil. That should start to reverse at the end of the current fiscal year. Software product revenues for Commvault were just 45% of the total in fiscal 2017 and are expected to be 49% of total revenues this year. The current forecast made by the company would represent a 19% increase in software license revenues and would, I think, qualify Commvault as a company in high growth status.Management claims that it is in the process of introducing its largest new product cycle in its history, one that will provide it with significant differentiation compared to both legacy competitors and new entrants in this space. The new products are focused on hyper converged solutions for secondary storage infrastructure along with new offerings for endpoints and for service providers. The company is also introducing new subscription based pricing models for its core technology, the Commvault Data Platform. I haven’t seen any formal announcements of the new pricing or the new set of functionality so I can’t evaluate just how significant they might be. I assume that many of the announcements will be part of the upcoming earnings release That said, I suspect that the company's 19% software revenue growth forecast, a cadence noticeably greater than the results of the prior fiscal year, it almost certainly a function of both a strong pipeline for its newest offerings and pretty fair visibility in terms of close rates as well.Commvault has been evolving to offering business analytics based on its data platform. This offering is going to noticeably increase the size of its TAM - 15%-25% is probably a reasonable expectation. The announcement of these solutions should not be interpreted as some revolutionary change in the company’s focus. Commvault is not becoming the umpteenth BI/Big Data vendor which would be a bootless undertaking. Most of the specifics of the product announcement are going to be formally announced in November, at the company’s customer summit. Commvault has been moving toward subscription based pricing for some years now, although it still derives most of its product revenues from sales of perpetual licenses. With the adoption of ASC 606, Commvault will be able to recognize subscription revenues before all of the related transaction is invoiced and before cash is received - the revenue recognition standard will be the signing of a committed contract. During the conference call, the CEO mentioned that he thought that viewed holistically, the increased proportion of revenues coming from multi-year subscriptions would be a tailwind and not a headwind as is most often the case in these kinds of transitions for IT vendors. Basically, the company will not see a negative revenue impact from signing a greater proportion of subscription revenue arrangements. This should be, I think, a factor that figures in positively in evaluating CVLT shares, although so far investors have not looked at it that way.Commvault’s market position and competitionData protection and back-up is a huge space and it has seen significant growth for many years and in different pockets. CVLT has been said by Gartner to be the leader in the space for 6 years running, and when the next report comes out later this month, I doubt that there will be many significant changes in the ratings.Sometimes when I write articles readers suggest that I lean too heavily on Gartner in terms of some of the conclusions that I draw. I am well aware that at times, Gartner has been accused of slanting its research based on who is paying it. But given the other players in this space, it is very unlikely that Gartner has ranked Commvault higher than it should. And I do not expect to find any ground-breaking insights in a Gartner MQ analysis. I try to look at everything that is available. But Gartner isn’t reporting “fake news” the way mainstream media have done. It takes a survey that is pretty broadbased, and has market analysts who add their own input. It is not perfect but it is likely to be better than any other 3rd party research that is available about some of the major trends in this space. Overall, I think it is a reasonably objective source.Just for the record, while the overall backup and recovery space is mainly served by traditional vendors including IBM (IBM), EMC, Veritas and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), there are a couple of emerging vendors of note. One of those is Actifio which is said to offer significant differentiation compared to traditional vendors. Its unique technology has meant it can offer much faster speeds for back-up and recovery compared to the current generation of both software and hardware back-up and recovery solutions. Another emerging vendor is Veeam. Veeam is a Swiss company with revenues comparable to Commvault. It is best known for backing up VMware environments. In recent years, one significant development direction for CVLT has been the development of more solutions in this area and it has recently announced additional back-up and recovery solutions for use with VMW. It will be interesting to see if CVLT can crack into what is a very substantial market - it is, as yet, an unrealized opportunity.Looked at holistically, the major competitor in this space has been EMC, primarily through its decade old acquisition of Data Domain. For the most part, Data Domain is used with other EMC storage offerings. Like many other EMC acquisitions, after a honeymoon period, Data Domain has been starved of resources and that is likely still the case, particularly after the combination with Dell given all of the other priorities facing the new enterprise. It seems likely to me, that Data Domain will continue to be a share donor in this space with some share points accruing to companies such as CVLT that make their living as best of breed vendors.There are some nascent trends in the space that over time might represent a threat to the growth of revenues - most notably integrated backup and recovery solutions offered by the storage vendors themselves. But for now, most market research analysts believe that the space is likely to grow at double-digit rates through 2020. Given Commvault’s market position, and the faults of its competitors, aspiring to 20% growth seems quite a reasonable goal.ProfitabilityBack in its day, when Commvault shares were valued as a hyper-growth name, the company was not particularly profitable - but at least it had GAAP EBIT margins in the low double digits. Of course, truth be told, it wasn’t all that “growthy” back then when compared to other IT vendors of its size - but the share valuations at that point reflected investor romance with a software solution for storage back-up and recovery technology. Revenues have grown a bit more than 100% over the last 6 years, but non-GAAP operating earnings have increased by just 50% and GAAP operating earnings have all but disappeared. Six years ago the shares sold for a P/E of more than 50X, while the EV/S was 5.4X. Valuations marched higher over the next couple of years before the bottom fell out of the story.The company has forecast that its non-GAAP operating margins will reach 13% this year, up from 11.5% in the year recently reported. The increase is really apples to apples - there is no significant year-over-year impact from the adoption of ASC 606. The current published First Call consensus for fiscal year ’18 does not quite reflect those assumptions. It shows a growth in EPS of 15% and management has guided to 7%+ revenue growth and 10% growth in EBIT margins. The fact that some estimates do not reflect guidance is most likely due to the way many analysts prefer to model. Management is suggesting that there will be a steeper ramp in margins this year than is comfortable for some analysts to use when making their projections. But for some reason, that kind of modelling is less of a factor in fiscal year ’19 when expectations call for 10% top-line growth and 20% growth in EPS.The expected improvements in profitability were not in evidence last quarter, nor had that been expected. Overall, the company’s gross margin did grow about 50 basis points to over 87%. That was primarily a function of rising product revenue which have gross margins in the high 90% range and limited growth in services revenue. But overall, most operating expense categories grew faster than reported revenues and operating expenses, rose to 86.6% of revenues in the quarter compared to 81.1% of revenues in Q4 of fiscal 2016.On a non-GAAP basis, the company had Q4 operating margins of 12%. That compares to non-GAAP margins in Q4 2016 of 16%. In particular, sales and marketing was 59% of revenues this past year on a GAAP basis and had been 56% of revenues in the prior year. I think it is fair to say, that at this scale and with this growth cadence in product revenues, the ramp the company has forecast for margin growth is quite modest and could be readily over-attained. In particular, the company should be able to enhance sales productivity significantly - most other mid-sized enterprise software vendors, who are not facing headwinds from a transition to subscription revenues, have far lower sales and marketing expense ratios.The company may be said to be a serial practitioner in terms of its use of stock-based comp awards. Looking at the full year of fiscal 2017, stock-based comp expense was essentially all of reported non-GAAP earnings. That is comparable to the ratio for the prior fiscal year, but hardly desirable. Looked at another way, stock-based comp rose by 15% last year and was 74% of cash flow from operations compared to 76% of operating cash flow the prior year. These levels are, perhaps, not totally outliers in terms of the SBC ratio for companies of this size, but it is one factor that will likely put a lid on valuation.Interestingly, the stock-based comp ratios have grown noticeably through the years; the metric was 80% of non-GAAP earnings 6 years ago and at that time was just 30% of cash flow from operations. While the issue of stock-based comp is one of those “half full” stories, I think it suggests that the company has huge, as yet to be realized, margin opportunities that are likely to be realized if revenue growth achieves planned levels.ValuationCommvault is a relatively small business playing in a land mainly populated by giants. That has usually been one component of handicapping a potential consolidation transaction. At various times through the years, this company was rumored to have been for sale. Obviously, none of the rumored transactions ever advanced beyond that the stage of rumors. There are many larger hardware vendors particularly including, IBM, Microsoft, Hewlett and Cisco who might be potential buyers. A couple of years ago, Symantec sold its Veritas unit, a very troubled business at the time, to the Carlyle Group for 3.5X EV/S. Given the multiple woes of Veritas at the time, that was probably a reasonably generous valuation and it would be interesting to see how the transaction has worked out for the buyers… but there have been no press release detailing the operational performance of Veritas since the transaction was finalized. One thing is likely; the Carlyle Group is going to be running Veritas to generate cash and not to maximize market share which is likely one factor in the success of Commvault in terms of growing its product revenues.Commvault currently has 46.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding, and despite the level of stock-based compensation, its share count is within 2% of year-earlier levels. The company has a market cap of $2.7 billion and an enterprise value of $2.25 billion. So, Commvault shares have an EV/S of 3.1X. That represents a relatively compressed valuation, particularly if the company has a reasonable prospect of achieving 20% growth over the next couple of years.CVLT is forecast to achieve non-GAAP EPS of about $1.24 over the next 12 months as the quarter to be reported in a couple of weeks has been forecast by the CFO to produce the lowest level of earnings in the fiscal year. At the consensus level of forecast earnings, the company has a P/E of 47X. That is not a bargain P/E, but the issue for investors, as pointed out earlier in this article, is the ability the company has to develop and maintain a steady improvement in sales productivity and operating margins. As well, investors need to consider and weigh the level of stock-based comp against the rising level of deferred revenues the company has been able to book.As mentioned earlier, because of the rather robust level of deferred revenue growth, Commvault seems likely to continue to achieve CFFO significantly above the level it reports for non-GAAP earnings. That was the case in fiscal year 2017, despite the substantial growth in receivables which limited reported CFFO to a significant extent. The company’s capex is minor and, excluding a real estate investment that was made a couple of years ago, is less than 1% of revenues. The company doesn’t provide a free cash flow forecast, but looking at earnings, the likely reversal of the accounts receivable build-up and expecting deferred revenue growth to moderate a bit, I am inclined to think that free cash flow is likely to reach $115-$120 million over the next 12 months. At that level, free cash flow yield would be greater than 5%, again a level that would likely to prove very attractive should the company obtain its aspirational growth rate and achieve the kind of profitability that would be normal for a company in its position.At this point, the consensus of analysis recommendations is relatively strong, although the shares are only followed by 13 analysts. 11 of the analysts who do follow this name rate it either a buy or a strong buy. I think it is a worthwhile purchase both as a potential acquisition candidate but also because it seems to have righted the ship without the shares reflecting the potential for what is a leading company in a high growth space. Just to conclude, there is no rational process that might suggest how Commvault shares ought to sell for a lower valuation than was the case when Veritas was sold to the Carlyle Group."
3826926,98236,2016-01-22T07:18:32-05:00,"CommVault shares have fallen about 30% in two months, reflecting both the market pullback and investor concerns about enterprise storage spending.The company's competitive position should benefit significantly from the current  turmoil enveloping principle competitors such as Veritas, EMC/Dell and even IBM.For the first time in years, with an EV/S around 1.7X the company represents value to investors.CommVault's new platform introduced last month has the potential to improve pricing and to extend its footprint.The company has many of the characteristics that one looks to see in a possible acquisition including valuation, technology and size.","Introduction:CommVault (NASDAQ:CVLT) is a leading provider of software-based solutions that allow its users to maximize their storage efficiency and to back up and recover their physical storage using software technology. CommVault's shares peaked more than two years ago at a price just shy of $90/share. Since that time, the shares have gone through 3 distinct downward legs. Initially the absurd valuation that was reached at the peak was undone. That was followed shortly thereafter by investor concerns about the longer term growth of the storage space and has most recently been followed by investor alarm that almost all companies in the enterprise storage world were likely to either miss estimates or significantly revise short-term guidance.CommVault had missed its operating targets significantly for two quarters before finally printing respectable results for the quarter that ended 9/30/15. Despite achieving a reasonable quarter vis-à-vis expectations, CommVault shares, because of overall market conditions and because they are lumped as part of the enterprise storage space, have declined about 30% in less than 2 months. And lots of that damage was done in just the last few days in the wake of a downgrade by a brokerage who had recommended the name going back several years. As the company has announced an earnings release date for January 27, 2016, I have to assume that the results to be reported for the December quarter are not the ones in jeopardy but rather the expectations investors have for the company's fiscal 2017 year and beyond.At current levels, CommVault shares are reasonably valued for the first time in several years with an EV/S of around 1.7X although the company's depressed margins have led to a P/E that is still close to 30X. But the issue that investors and commentators need to consider is whether or not making a commitment to these shares at this time is akin to ""catching a falling knife"" or if it is reasonable to attempt to call a bottom in share valuation. While the malaise amongst the legacy vendors in the storage space may last for a while as spinning discs are supplanted by solid state drives, that malaise certainly does not mean that users aren't going to continue to need back-up and recovery products for their data. And almost all large users will continue to adopt a variety of strategies to maximize storage efficiency. CommVault has been and is likely to remain a favored solution in its space dramatically outpacing competitors including most significantly the Veritas component of Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) that is soon to be spun off. As I have no particular insight into what management might speak about during its call later this month, and I imagine that investor concerns are running at a fever pitch after the Sterne, Agee downgrade, and in the wake of overall investor concerns regarding the state of the environment, I think that the most appropriate investment strategy would be to initiate half of a normal position at current levels with the idea of revisiting and enlarging a commitment depending on management comments during the conference call.Background:As CommVault may be a company not terribly familiar to many Seeking Alpha readers, I thought that I ought to provide this audience with a bit of background about this mid-sized software vendor. While 17 analysts provide estimates for the company, I haven't found any Seeking Alpha articles that have been printed in the recent past. CommVault is an enterprise software vendor whose products are used to back up, recover and manage data in software as opposed to hardware. There have been and will continue to be much written about the benefits that users can achieve using either hardware or software solutions for back-up and for dedupe. (Dedupe or deduplication, to use the formal name, is a method in which all data that is duplicated in multiple records is stripped from all but the initial record. Coupled with data compression, dedupe can save users as much as 75% of the capacity they would otherwise need to store a quantity of information.) I think the basic consensus these days is that software solutions are significantly cheaper and far more flexible and standards-based while hardware solutions provide the maximum level of scalability and performance. There are other issues that are frequently cited as distinctions including something called ""rehydration' which simply refers to how long it takes to recover the data from its target location and return it to its primary location. Most people would feel that rehydration is a significant advantage of software-based solutions.I am sure if you looked you would find outliers who suggested that either software or hardware is the only way to go but most mainstream industry consultants such as IDC and Gartner appear to be relatively neutral and to recommend both kinds of solutions depending on the problems that need to be solved and the particular environment.Like many enterprise software vendors, CommVault had a difficult time during the great recession and its aftermath. To the extent that readers and investors are concerned that the economic outlook is deteriorating, CommVault would not be unaffected. The growth in the volume of data being stored is definitely correlated to the economy and perhaps more so now than in the past. Every time a consumer buys something online he or she creates numerous records that are almost invariably stored and backed up. One of the largest consumers of storage are not surprisingly residential mortgages. Fewer mortgages, less growth in data to be stored. The wave of data that is part of our economy is rising inexorably. But it rises more rapidly during times of economic expansion than in times of slow growth or recession.At one time in the not too distant past, CommVault was a significant OEM supplier to Dell. The relationship atrophied over the years as Dell purchased other vendors who had back-up and recovery capabilities. The company has developed a relationship with NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP). It provides NTAP with dedupe capability that can be sold as an integral component of that company's filers. There have been rumors for years that NetApp would buy CommVault and such a consolidation would probably have made sense. At this point, with NetApp trying to focus on its pending acquisition of SolidFire, it would seem highly unlikely that NetApp would be in a position to purchase CommVault. In my opinion, the agreement between NetApp and CommVault has never been effectively promoted by either party to this day. NetApp is perceived by many customers to be down-market when it comes to effective dedupe solutions. I believe that there remains significant unrealized potential in the relationship.The company's largest direct competitor is Veritas which has been one of Symantec's more misguided acquisitions for many years. Veritas has struggled greatly during the time it has been owned by Symantec, but that's a different story. The company is now being sold to the Carlyle Group and the transaction which was recently renegotiated with a billion dollar haircut is expected to close before the end of this month. The company also competes with the Data Domain component of EMC (NYSE:EMC). Data Domain has a hardware appliance that provides dedupe and back-up and recovery and when it was independent it was a sales machine of the highest repute and execution. Needless to say, as part of EMC, that is all history now. At the current time, Veeam, which is a private company that specializes in VMware environments, probably gives CommVault the most trouble in technical bake offs although the Veeam product is apparently far more expensive (sticker shock is what some users describe as their reaction to the pricing) as it was purpose designed to operate in virtual environments.To a certain extent, and despite CVLT's rapid growth of recent years, there are some observers who believe that the company has never achieved its maximum potential and that its sales and marketing efforts are weaker than might be expected for a best of breed survivor.Investment Thesis:I don't think that it will be a surprise to many readers to hear that the volume of data needing to be stored continues to rise at prodigious rates. At one time, it would have been straightforward enough, therefore, to simply buy shares in the leading hardware vendors such as EMC and NetApp. But in the last several years, industry trends have turned strongly against legacy vendors of primary storage as the world is in the process of migrating to solid state drives and as storage efficiency technology has put a huge disconnect in the relationship between data to be stored and the storage capacity needed to store that data. Further, with the advent of cloud storage service providers, there has been a further demand headwind. The cloud storage service providers will use proportionately less disc to store data and because of their immense size, they will get better prices from their hardware suppliers.CommVault has not been totally immune from these trends and its revenue growth which had been averaging more than 25%/year has stopped and gone negative in the past several quarters. CommVault had moved much of its pricing to a capacity-based model. When the growth in hardware data capacity slowed significantly from the 60%/year range to the range of 35%-40%/year that put a huge headwind blowing against the company's revenue growth.But through it all, CommVault has remained the technology leader in the market for enterprise class, software driven storage back-up and recovery solutions. And while the legacy vendors of spinning disc have continued to struggle against the inroads of flash and what that means to the overall economics of the storage business, there are signs that the worst impacts of the transition for CommVault are at or near an end. While last quarter still showed a significant decline in product revenues, the percentage decline started to abate and management spoke about a return to growth during the March 2016 quarter. The company, after losing much of its sales force during the worst of the contraction has been able to retool and bring its sales capacity back up to normal levels.Late last year CommVault launched a new iteration of its storage solutions that it claims brings revolutionary technology to the back-up/recovery and data efficiency markets. I am not going to try to evaluate the specifics of the company's marketing material but I do think that the new generation of solutions is likely to cause a spike in user demand and to further enhance the company's technology lead. I also believe that the pricing of the new modules and solutions will to some extent break the link between physical storage capacity and the amount that CommVault is able to realize for its solutions. Breaking the link is not going to happen overnight and the CFO has forecast just modest swings within the product revenue mix in terms of the pricing model. On the other hand, growth expectations for this company are still less than 8%/year for fiscal 2017 in terms of total revenue - and that means something like 3-4% growth for product revenue. Not that long ago the company had been able to achieve operating margins in the mid-20% range and with the return of some level of growth and with the stabilization of the sales force, it seems to me that operating margins can readily climb from current trough levels as was the case this last quarter.And CommVault's competitive position is going to be helped substantially by the overall turmoil in the industry. With Veritas to belong to a VC in just a few days, it seems almost certain that in order to realize a return on the just reduced purchase price that there will be significant cost cuts at the company leading to sales force disruption and some level of user dissatisfaction. A similar phenomenon is already at work within the EMC/Dell Organization. EMC has been trying to rationalize costs in advance of its formal merger into Dell and this has already led to significant layoffs of both sales and support personnel.In sum, while I think that the days of the company enjoying rapid growth simply through the shipment to customers of additional storage capacity are behind it, I think that the company has probably reached or come close to reaching a bottom in terms of the further negative impact of storage capacity pricing on its future revenue growth. The company is now selling a new platform that seems to further enhance its technology lead and two of its principle competitors are in turmoil. Storage backup and recovery, while not perhaps as dynamic a market as might have been the case a couple of years ago is still a market with strong growth potential and this is the leading company in that space. And for the first time in many years at an EV/S of 1.7X it is at a valuation level that will make sense to many potential investors.I further believe that this company has the kind of profile that makes it attractive to potential acquirers. With the recent share price decline, the EV/S is near just 1.7X., far lower than historical levels and far below levels of most other software vendors. Its size, in terms of enterprise value which is currently just above $1 billion, is at a level affordable to a wide range of bidders. It is known as having one of, if not the single best solution in its space and most industry analysts think that overall backup/recovery space within the storage market is an attractive high growth component with high long-term growth potential. Two of its major competitors, Veritas and EMC, are in the midst of significant internal turmoil that is likely leading to lessening competitive pressure. Another major competitor, IBM, reported very disappointing results in its storage business and can reasonably be expected to attempt to manage costs in that business segment aggressively. Rumors have abounded for years that this company is going to be bought. It is my view that all that has stood between a transaction and the continued independent existence of a company like this has been the presence of a CEO who has enjoyed his position for more than 15 years now and is far older at 73 than most CEOs of software vendors. I have no idea as to when Mr. Hammer might retire. It isn't the kind of thing that would be easy to ask and the man is irascible as can be heard on the quarterly conference calls. But I suspect the set-up for a potential takeover or a leveraged buyout is quite strong and I would not be surprised to see such a transaction at some point along the way.Conclusion:CommVault shares have lost more than 30% of their value in less than 2 months. The chart is ugly and I am only too aware that there is really little technical support even at these levels. Some of the share price loss is clearly a function of the meltdown the market has experienced since the turn of the year. But at least as important, I think, are investor concerns about any company having some correlation with the enterprise storage market. The enterprise storage business is in some level of disarray to say the least, with large industry participants such as EMC, NTAP and EMC reporting declines in revenue as the world transitions from what are now legacy spinning disc solutions to products based on flash. That transition is more or less benign for CVLT regardless of its impact on company's selling legacy solutions. But on the other hand, the other major trends in the storage space, which include dramatic improvements in storage efficiency and some trend toward users adopting cloud storage solutions, do have and have had some impact on CVLT's ability to grow revenues. I believe that we are at or near to the apogee of the effect of those trends on CVLT's business model. While I have no belief that the trends toward storage efficiency are going to reverse, I do believe that the major technologies that are involved such as dedupe, Snapshot technology,thin provisioning and Storage virtualization have already been adopted by the preponderance of users to a greater or lesser degree which means to me that the ability of users to avoid buying additional amounts of physical storage in the future is going to be more limited. As physical storage shipments resume their correlation with the amount of storage that is actually consumed, the ability that CVLT should have to sell large enterprise contracts is going to be augmented.At current valuations of significantly around 1.7X EV/S, CVLT shares for the first time in many years make potential sense to wide array of acquisitions who would be able to achieve revenue and cost synergies of significant magnitude enabling them to pay a substantial premium compared to current valuations. In addition, the CVLT's CEO has been in his position since 1998 and is now 73. These are outlier metrics in the enterprise software space and might suggest to some that Mr. Hammer might either retire or would be willing to sell the business as he looks to move on.Finally, the turmoil within the enterprise storage industry has almost inevitably created competitive opportunities for CVLT. The Dell/EMC merger is going to create an enormous amount of friction and lots of sales and support muscle is going to get trimmed along with some fat. My contacts tell me that it is already happening. The pending acquisition of Veritas by private equity investor, the Carlyle Group, is almost inevitably going to mean that Veritas will be going through rounds of layoffs. And of course IBM, reporting what can charitably be called disappointing results in its storage segment is going to have to keep a tight handle on costs in order to maintain profitability, creating still more opportunities for CVLT.The company is in the unique position of recently launching a new major platform and hiring sales people at a significant clip suggesting that it sees the same market opportunity that I do. Analyst expectations for revenue growth for CVLT are quite modest indeed and while a major brokerage recently downgraded the shares based on concern regarding revenue guidance, the valuation already reflects in whole or in part, investor concerns with the outlook.Catching falling knives is always a perilous investor exercise and one that can be scary to recommend and scarier still to accept as a recommendation. That being said, I think the combination of an important technology franchise, a great customer base and significant competitive opportunities coupled with the possibility of consolidation make the risk/rewards of the name favorable to investors at the current time."
1786792,24046,2013-10-30T09:55:28-04:00,,"There you have it, Commvault (NASDAQ:CVLT) just delivered your typical enterprise software red flag quarter. We got in line revenue growth which came in at half the typical q2/q1 seasonal trend (3% vs 6%). In of itself this number was quite a disappointment because of the CVLT's well established history of low balling the street, but it was even more surprising when you coupled it with the huge bottom line surprise. As I and everyone else were expecting a slight year over year drop in EBIT margins; the 200 bps expansion and 8c beat was of course a big shocker when coupled with the lackluster topline. This phenomena is not unusual in the software space, and is actually quite typical of a companies that over manage the street. To reconcile this you simply need to look at the deferred revenue balance and cash flow statement.So what happened?Well, to be clear Commvault missed their sales targets this quarter. Bookings were a major disappointment, and to hit the low bar they ended up recognizing an unusual amount of deferred software license revenue that was still on balance sheet at the end of the June quarter. The net result is a 20% sequential increase in NON-GAAP EBIT despite a slight sequential decline in operating cash flow. This pure profit deferred software license revenue is what produced the beat on eps, and allowed CVLT to hit the consensus revenue number. Without it we get big headline misses on both fronts.Is this a disaster?Well, if you are running a enterprise software company you are invariably going to have quarters were large deals in the pipeline don't close. So, in that respect it is no big deal. However, when your stock is trading at a PEG of 4.5x based on consensus forward estimates, and your forward GAAPE EPS p/e is 70x+, this is supposed to be a disaster. But CVLT's CEO goes to great lengths manage this part of the game. He has become a master of playing the street.Here is the closing sentence from his opening remarks on the the Conference Call:""We expect to continue to significantly outpace the growth of the market and pick up market share. However, on a relative basis, since last quarter's earnings call, we do believe revenue and earnings risk has marginally increased due to big deal demand and strategic execution risk."" -CVLT CEOThis is usually what you would interpret as a warning. The message to the sell-side here is take your numbers down a bit, and I assure you they will take them down. But how do you reconcile this comment, with the following remark later on the call.""Well, the funnel has improved very significantly. The key is translating that funnel into deals. So yes, the opportunity in a number of deals is up, I'd say pretty dramatically. But we still -- we understand we're in a weak environment and also lumpy. So when you start getting into physically 7-figure and multi-7-figure deals which makes a difference in our performance, we're just issuing a concern. I think the positive is that the opportunities are there and the negative is we're in an environment and those deals get pushed out, there could be some future problems.""- CVLT CEOSo, now we temper the warning by saying we have an amazing pipeline and the 'opportunity' is up dramatically. See, this is called trying to have it both ways. Reality is in software closing deals is the measuring stick, and based on the deferred revenue line, CVLT FAILED to close in q2. The CEO has been playing this game with the street for three straight quarters now, and you would think some of them would pick up on it.Instead, we get this…CommVault weakness creates good entry point, says Piper Jaffray""After CommVault reported stronger than expected Q2 results and the company endorsed current consensus estimates for FY14, Piper notes that bears are pointing to the company's decelerating software revenue growth. However, the firm thinks the deceleration was entirely due to timing and software revenue growth is expected to rebound next quarter. The firm reiterates an Overweight rating.""Is this guy serious? Momo's are rolling over left and right, and he is telling you to a good entry point is 10% off an all-time high. I wonder what he considers distressed, 20% down from a record close?I also like how the analyst with the highest target on the street got to ask the first question.Joel P. Fishbein - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division""I have 2 -- 1 question and a follow-up for Brian. I'm getting a lot of questions, Bob, from investors on the deferred line. It was up 24%, looks like a good number to me, but because I guess it's not what The Street was expecting. It caused some confusion. How meaningful is this metric, and if you could give some color on that, that will be helpful?""If I had bought the stock based on Joel's $115 target, I too would be asking you a lot of questions. Deferred revenue was flat versus up 8.1% Q2 last year, so 'looks like a good number to me' doesn't cut it Joel. At for your target, CVLT would be trading at about 90x 2014 consensus GAAP EPS. Do you really think 'looks good' is a sufficient bar?Honestly, I try to not get irritated by the 'game' that is sell-side coverage at times, but extreme stuff like this makes it hard. Yes, CVLT is without a doubt executing better than everyone else. And yes, there is going to be quarterly noise, and I have no issue with the CEO pointing that out or some analyst covering his bad advice by saying they will make it up next quarter. What I have a problem with is the bar set for this stock is ridiculously low to the point of it being outright negligence for anyone with anything but a sell rating on it. CVLT is not IBM, SYMC, or EMC. They are trading at a ridiculously high multiple compared to their now price cutting peers. This by definition means they have NO MARGIN FOR ERROR. Numbers shouldn't 'look good', they should 'be amazing'. Not only should they be closing large deals no problem, but they should be closing more and more of them. Basically, the stock is completely divorced from its operating performance, and that my friends is why I have parked my bear view here for the past 2.5 quarters.(fyi- I was once quite long the name circa dell-hp/3par)To put that in perspective, if it was trading at $50 I'd be buying this 'disappointment'. But where it is trading at today, these results make it nothing but a SCREAMING SHORT. And I will bet all the guys with a BUY rating here that this is without a doubt an underperformer/show me stock from now until its next quarter. Of course we already know the outcome of that quarter. It will be another beat because the bar will come down again. I am also pretty sure that the buyback mystically appeared yesterday to put a bid under what was fast becoming a falling knife. Which btw I welcome, as this just makes the risk/reward here even better.Disclosure: I am short CVLT. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
4015404,98236,2016-10-26T17:54:52-04:00,"Commvault reported another strong quarter yesterday that handily beat all revenue and earnings expectations.The acceleration in sequential license revenue growth apparently marked an inflection point for the company.The company doubled its cash flow year over year.The company is now achieving massive growth from protecting data in the cloud, a marked change from a few quarters ago.Because of the rapid improvement in the outlook, valuation metrics have remained reasonable, despite the significant share price appreciation this year.","Commvault: Growth Stock For Sale?The lead in to this section comes from a less well-known Cole Porter song called ""Love for Sale"" that was included in a show called ""the New Yorkers"" that opened in 1930. Hard as it may seem to believe these days, the song was considered in bad taste and it was banned from the radio - really! It is, I suppose, the same kind of censorship that is apparently imposed on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Difference is that back in 1930 there was no Mark Zuckerberg to resolve those kinds of issues.And because, as the title suggests, the song is about what were then called streetwalkers, its performance had to be transferred from a white singer to a black performer - really! We've come a long way!The title of this article - well, it comes from many places although it specifically comes from a song by Nat King Cole. But I like the Winston Churchill quote on the same subject which goes, ""If you are going through Hell, keep going.""Commvault (NASDAQ:CVLT) has been going through hell over the past couple of years and it has certainly kept going. And I do not think that too many observers are going to think that the Commvault earnings report that was released earlier this morning, October 25, was in bad taste. I'm pretty sure the release would pass muster for radio transmission even back then and the conference call recording is suitable for all ages and genders. The question, really, is whether the shares are extended in terms of valuation, as some may believe, or whether the company is still a growth stock on sale.Investors and readers may best know Commvault as the leader in what is classified as data protection and backup software. Despite its vast size differential with its principle competitors in the space, Symantec/Veritas, (SYMC) and Dell/EMC (DVMT), Commvault is the highest rated vendor in its space and has been so for many years now.But to a certain extent, being No. 1 in data back-up and recovery is perhaps akin to being a leading manufacturer of buggies and their parts around the turn of the 20th Century. OK, that is a gross exaggeration, but the environment for back-up and recovery solutions has changed substantially with the advent of the cloud. Lots of data is now stored in the cloud and more will be stored there over the next few years. About 10% of storage systems are forecast to be self-protecting. By 2020, about 40% of organizations will supplant long-term back-up with archiving, up from 20% today. Commvault has been able to turn some of these trends to its advantage, which may surprise some readers.So being a leader in back-up and recovery is simply no longer an effective foundation on which to build a growth company. A few years ago, investors bid shares of CVLT up to extreme valuations and the shares actually reached $89/shares back in 2013 before investors realized the challenges that the company faced. The company's shares troughed earlier this year at $31/share as investors lost patience with the company's turnaround.I first wrote about Commvault on this site way back in January shortly after the shares reached trough valuation. January was an eon past, or so it seems. In any event, the shares have appreciated by a bit more than 50% from that time till this writing.That is pretty decent share price appreciation especially compared to the IGV, which has appreciated just 20% over the same time span. Do the results and the outlook support the share price move? Is there any further positive alpha available? We will be focusing on those questions in the balance of this report.The report from the other side of the mountainThe specifics of yesterday's release were another significant beat. Overall, the company reported non-GAAP EPS of $.25 compared to prior expectations of $.20. Revenues for the quarter were $159 million, about $6 million above prior expectations and up by 13% from the prior year although roughly comparable to the results from two years ago. Software revenues, the most important metric for this company, rose by more than 22% year on year and rose a strong 9.4% sequentially. Nonetheless, at $79 million for the quarter, software revenues are at the same level they were 2.5 years ago. Presumably record funnels mean that software revenues will now rise to new levels. Last year, in the September quarter, the company's license revenue rose less than 2% sequentially. Much of the over-attainment was a function of closing larger deals. Overall, enterprise deals in excess of $100k reached 57% of total license revenue, up 44% from the year earlier period.Gross margins rose from 85% to 86%. Despite the strong increase in license sales, sales and marketing costs fell as a ratio from just shy of 61% to 59.6% Most observers, including this writer, think sales productivity at this company is woeful for a variety of reasons, some having to do with sales management turnover. The opportunities to improve cost ratios, both from scale economies and from productivity improvements, on this line are extraordinary.Research and development costs increased by about 100 bps to 13.4% simply reflecting a greater cadence in product development. General and administrative costs fell from 14% to 13%. Overall, GAAP operating income was essentially nil, including depreciation and amortization compared to a loss last year of 3% of revenues.Cash flow from operations more than doubled in the quarter. Much of the increase in cash flow was the result of the improvement in GAAP profitability and the growth in deferred revenue. Still, the CFFO margin of 12.6% leaves an enormous amount of runway for improvement. Capex for the company was essentially nil, leaving free cash flow for the quarter at $21 million and at $46 million for the first half of the year.Stock-based comp is at moderate levels and declined net of the provision for taxes on the benefits that were provided in the last quarter.Commvault is not the most transparent company in the software universe when it comes to providing forward guidance regarding revenue expectations. In fact, to a certain extent, particularly for those unfamiliar with its practices, the company's customary statement that it is comfortable with analyst consensus is simply misleading. And the company's cautionary language is changeless from quarter to quarter. For example, ""Our ability to achieve our growth objectives is dependent on a steady flow of… (large) deals. These deals have quarterly revenue and earnings risk due to their complexity and timing. Even with improved fundamentals, large deal closure rates may remain lumpy."" So, I guess is that if the company doesn't close large deals it will not make its revenue objectives. Management, and in particular, the CEO claim that they do not want to be held to some particular number in terms of their guidance and seek to avoid making a commitment to a number by the use of phraseology that really means nothing.Almost surely, given the over-attainment in the quarter, which follows prior quarters that saw results above the consensus, expectations will rise. Company CEO Bob Hammer said in his prepared remarks that ""sales funnels are now at record levels. We believe, given our strong funnel, we are positioned to achieve our Q3 objectives, (that we) are making good progress in building our funnel for Q4 of this fiscal year… Our progress for the business during the first half of FY 2017 provides a good foundation for the second half of FY 2017 and positions us to continue to accelerate revenue and earnings growth in FT 2018.""I think that a reasonable inference that can be drawn from the remarks in the script is that management is expecting accelerating growth during the back half of the year. I think it is also fair to believe that this company's pivot to add a significant business capabilities in software defined storage and eventually in data analytics carries with them the typical risks of entering new markets.Valuations for this company have not increased significantly from levels at which I first wrote about Commvault, although the share price has. The company has now had several quarters in a row of significantly beating estimates. After each estimate beat there have been the inevitable round of estimate revisions. Current estimates reflect expectations for mid-single digit growth. Valuations based on those expectations might seem elevated. But since the company started to show improving sales execution a year ago estimates have risen most quarters. Company CFO Brian Carolan also spoke to declining growth in maintenance revenue in coming quarters because of a different pricing model that has been partially implemented. It is not precisely clear to this writer as to why the company might have adopted a different maintenance pricing model that will lead to lower revenues, and I am not really sure how much credence I would put in the comment and indeed later on in the course of the call Mr. Carolan seemed to walk back the comments he made when reciting his script. Services revenues are 55% of total revenues and they were only up 6% last quarter, so overall reported revenue growth will probably decelerate a bit in the next two quarters while license revenue growth accelerates.It is also worth noting that the company plans to be an early adopter of the new accounting standards regarding the revenue recognition of multi-year license agreements (see Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as to how that affects reported revenues) which will allow mixing and matching of different license revenue models. So, as best as can be gleaned from the commentary on the call, the company will be getting more of its ""business"" from the cloud and from subscription models, but will report that business as though it were up-front. Everyone clear on that? But what I think is going to happen is that the company will be selling a greater proportion of its products using time-based subscription models, but it will report those sales based on the discounted present value of the guaranteed payments.In order to develop some kind of a reasonable valuation construct one has to decide what management meant in its commentary and how much credence ought to be placed on what was said. We know for certain that management thinks that the current revenue consensus is too low because the CVLT CFO said exactly that in answer to a specific query.Unlike many other companies that I follow that provide analysts some elements of specific guidance and then see estimates cluster around a mean point of that guidance, that simply will not happen here. I have put together my own thoughts on the subject and I am sure that other analysts will reach different conclusions. But there is no other practical way to value the shares other than for readers and investors to develop their own range of expectations.Trying to distill all the elements I heard on the call, I think a new reasonable estimate for total revenues for the company this year is probably in the range of $660 million and that management actually expects to see revenues in the following fiscal year of $730-750 million, which is growth in the low double-digit range. To what extent the analyst consensus may change to mirror my expectations is more or less unknowable.With regards to margins, management was singularly unforthcoming, at least with regards to specific expectations. It appears that the margin growth for the balance of the year may be less than the margin growth that was achieved in the quarter just reported. This relates to the projected decline in maintenance revenue in Q4. But with sequential revenues increasing overall and with high margin license sales showing substantial increases, I think that non-GAAP EPS ought to reach a range of $1.05-1.10 this year and to reach $1.25-1.30 next year.The company currently has a market capitalization of $2.6 billion. It has an enterprise value of $2.15 billion. So the current EV/S is 3.3X and the EV/S based on my expectations for fiscal '17 revenues is 2.9X. The current P/E is relatively elevated at 52X mainly as a function of still depressed margins. It is hard to know how fast margins will rise and I tried to be prudent in my projections. But based on what I expect, the P/E for fiscal 2018 earnings is 44X - still elevated but I think that as visibility gets better the P/E I'm projecting will turn out to be higher than the actual results.I think that CFFO for this company will continue to exceed non-GAAP income by a wide margin. I think the difference is likely to increase because of the growing level of deferred revenues that I anticipate and some modest increase in stock-based comp. CFFO for the first half of the year was $44 million, compared to non-GAAP income from operations of $33 million and non-GAAP net income of $21 million in the same period. I think that non-GAAP net income for the full year is likely to be about $50 million. Overall, based on $50 million of net income, I expect to see CFFO at $100 million with a comparable level of free cash flow. That produces a free cash flow yield of 4.65% this year and a yield of 7.3% based on expectations for fiscal year 2018.As I will discuss below, based on what was said on the call, the results that were achieved in the past quarter and the trends in the industry, I think that Commvault can and will return to mid-teens revenue growth on a consistent basis. Not everyone is going to agree with that level of attainment - at least not at this point in the evolution of the company's return to growth, and so I will try to make a reasonable case for my expectations below.The path to the Elysian FieldsCommvault may have found the other side of the mountain in terms of current operating performance compared to the hell through which it went. It is nowhere close to having reached the Elysian Fields of 20% operating margins and consistent mid-teens revenue growth.At this point, despite the headwinds that are blowing in the storage industry for many providers, CVLT appears to have evolved its portfolio to where it has been able to achieve meaningful growth. Ironically, one of the meaningful drivers for the company has been the same cloud storage trends that interrupted the company's success. According to Alan Bunte, the company's VP of sales, ""we are seeing those guys come back now and want real protection or real DR (data recovery) or being able to preserve some of those data sets out there in a cost-effective matter."" The CEO talked about the cloud being a major accelerator for the company's growth. Again, while it may seem counter-intuitive to some readers, the CEO on the call said that ""the cloud has become the major driver of our business in what we would call modern data management. And in doing so, we partner heavily with the big cloud providers like Microsoft and AWS (Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)). The numbers, what we said is that the number of petabytes stored in the cloud in the first nine months of the calendar year (by Commvault) more than doubled, and I can tell you the cloud is a significant, material part of our revenue and of our revenue growth.""I am not sure just how large the market opportunity is for CVLT to manage data in the cloud - primarily the hybrid cloud at this point. The quarter just passed would seem to be an inflection point as I mentioned above regarding the company's primary market. But the fact is that there are so many issues that consultants such as Gartner cite in terms of headwinds in the space that I think it is important to at least recognize the company's strategy to grow beyond its core competency.The company's strategy is based on what is called the Commvault Data Platform. The platform was released about a year ago and it is probably a significant factor in the acceleration of license revenue growth. Many readers have probably heard all and more than all about data platforms and data fabrics. I read and listen to lots of pronouncements and trying to distinguish the wheat from the chaff is not an easy task. Whether or not the Commvault Data Platform is ""the only platform available in the market with the openness, the ease of use, scalability, orchestration and technology to meet customers' needs to address the increasing complexity of managing data whether the data is in the cloud, on-premise, mobile or as part of the Internet of Things"" is not something that I really can prove. It is also something that is probably not central in any discussion of a price target for the company's shares.The company intends it says, to introduce specific products in the areas of SaaS recovery, applications management and software-defined storage solutions. It also intends to establish itself more deeply within the healthcare vertical.By the second half of next year the company says that it will be in the market with a leading business analytics and business process automation platform that is supposed to accelerate growth.Like any other author writing these kinds of blogs I would prefer to be able to cite TAMs, market shares, competitors and product specifics in evaluating the probability of the company achieving its objective. But that is simply not the kind of transparency that Commvault provides.The company's transition has taken about 2.5 years at this point. Before that time, growth had consistently been greater than 20%. The company seems to have at the least articulated a strategy that can work and it has executed in this past quarter and it has a long-term history of execution.There is, of course, another path for this company to enter the sun-filled uplands of the Elysian Fields and that is consolidation. Commvault remains a small vendor in what remains a very large market. Gartner commented that in most regions in EMEA and APAC that customers may face substandard pre-sales experiences because CVLT has yet to partner with tier 1 distributors. Its sales and marketing effort even in the US is rough around the edges and it doesn't have the most stable sales organization in the enterprise IT space.In short, great technology, flawed and immature distribution. So, there are substantial synergies that are available to a potential acquirer and far more reasonable valuation than many other growth businesses. About the only potential acquirer I would rule out at this point is EMC/Dell but that leaves a huge number of potential candidates who have both the strategic and financial capability to buy CVLT. In the past, rumors of consolidation abounded. It would not surprise me all that much to see something similar now that the company appears to have found new footing.At the start of this article, I mused about whether CVLT's strong share price performance so far this year has shut off the potential for positive alpha. So far as I can tell, there is plenty of runway for further relative appreciation. The company has loads of new solutions that it is introducing, it has made the pivot to supplying back-up in the cloud, it continues to significantly outperform its competitors and the initial headwinds the company faced from the cloud have abated. I see plenty of positive alpha over the next several quarters."
2007651,21848,2014-02-10T08:49:20-05:00,,"Listed at #22 in Forbes Best Small Companies for 2013, today's specimen to examine is CommVault Systems (NASDAQ:CVLT).CommVault made it to the list based on the following criteria defined by Forbes.According to CommVault's website, the company is a information management software company. I have no idea what that means. The problem with a lot of public companies is that they don't know how to explain who they are and what they do. The company has a software called Simpana, but again, the description is simply ""A Single Platform to Protect, Manage, and Access all Your Company's Information"".Again, that is just gibberish. 10 minutes later, I find a video that explains what it's about. Normally, if I have to work this hard just to figure out what the company does, it's a pass. But I want to go through how I'm thinking about this company from beginning to end.Right away, you can tell that these are not cheap stats. Although sales growth of 20% the past 5 years is impressive, a low ROE makes me think how long it can keep up the expected growth.Before getting too far into this analysis, here's a stock report for CVLT so that you can follow along with all the numbers. This report contains all the data from the fundamental stock valuation models. (.pdf)CommVault has no debt and capex is also very low for software companies. That's the benefit of having no inventory. It also positively affects the cash conversion cycle because the inventory factor is disregarded.CommVault Low CapexAnother benefit with B2B software companies is that prices can be passed along to customers. These types of solutions can easily cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Include yearly maintenance and support packages and a few thousand bucks is nothing.One characteristic to look for in stocks, as mentioned by Warren Buffett, is that you want to find the ones that can increase prices. Although there are competitors who offer similar products like CommVault's Simpana, once a client has invested time, money and training into a particular software, it is very difficult to change. Example: there are free word processors and office programs on the market but people still pay to use Microsoft Office. Software that is deeply integrated into the IT infrastructure of a company and at the very core of controlling important processes is difficult to switch.Possibly why FCF has been growing and gross margins is very consistent as recurring revenues kick in.CommVault Solid FCF and Margins ChartOn a quality scale, CommVault scores well. Piotroski score is 8, Altman Z score doesn't show any distress signals and the Beneish M score used to detect earnings manipulation is green.Fundamentally, there isn't anything wrong with the company. Strong growth, pricing power, fat and profitable margins and strong quality scores. The only negative aspect of CommVault is the stock price. At the current price of $66.52, it's trading at an EV/EBITDA of 27.3, P/FCF of 28.6 and P/E of 50. In the IT infrastructure and security software space, competition is intense and these multiples are pretty much industry averages.Here are some multi year averages. The way I calculate growth and performance numbers is by taking the CAGR of multiple periods and then calculating the median to smooth out irregular data. It's a technique I got from F Wall Street.Let me go through it quickly.CommVault FCF and ROE growthThe idea is that instead of calculating a straight line CAGR from year 1 to year 5, you calculate year 1 to 3, year 2 to 4, year 3 to 5 etc and continue mixing up the years. An example of why I do it like this is the 2008+ recession. Of course during the recession, you think that it will never get better. But looking back, the economy and stock market has rebounded back stronger than ever.So how much do you have to factor in 2008 into the long term performance of the company? Obviously, it wasn't a normal year. As a comparison if you were to calculate the CAGR from 2008 to 2013, it comes out to 28.36%.From the table above, by smoothing the years out, the growth comes out to 32.2%. I don't use the 32% in this case because the ROE is much lower. In the stock valuation models, I've capped the default growth rate to be the ROE because a company can't grow faster than its rate of return. (This is a topic I'll have to go over another time for sure.) But capping the growth at 11% is too harsh in CommVault's case. Fundamentals are strong and with the rapid growth of data, more companies relying on securing data and controlling their infrastructure, growth should exceed 11%.I admit that I'm no expert on CommVault, and in this case, the best way to value a stock is to use the reverse DCF. If you are unsure of what a company is worth, then don't do blind discounted cash flows because the chance that you are wrong will be high. It is much easier to do a reverse valuation first and then decide whether it makes sense before plowing ahead and changing assumptions.For CommVault, it's a toss up between using a 9% and 12% discount rate. Although profitable, CommVault is in a competitive landscape and new technologies can uproot its position anytime. So I'm going with a 12% discount rate. Starting TTM FCF is $116 and with this, the implied growth rate in the stock is 19%.CommVault reverse DCF If you have your own DCF model, apply the same concept. Start off with the TTM FCF and then adjust the growth rate until the fair value matches the current price.Is continued 19% growth achievable? My max is 20% when I look at companies. But to buy a company with high growth expectations, it must have a super strong moat and CommVault doesn't have that. It's difficult to quantity the strength of a moat, but one way to help you is to interpret the financial statements like Warren Buffett. The important question is whether CommVault is a buy at current prices. The answer is quite simple too. If there is hesitation or you find yourself trying too hard to make the numbers work, don't buy.For this stock analysis exercise, CommVault is not a buy.Disclosure: No positions"
1732462,25025,2013-10-07T13:05:09-04:00,,"If the current price of CommVault (CVLT) continues to climb, many short investors will find themselves in the middle of a major short squeeze. On September 25, I wrote an article telling shorts that they should be prepared to cover their positions. Actually the shares do not even have to continue to climb in value. There are open puts as low as $40 a share. Here are all of the puts for CVLT according to Yahoo Finance, as of Friday October 4. Since the current price is floating between $80 and $90 a share, the market is teasing the bulk of the shorts that are in that range. Most are hoping for some sort of macro dip due to the current government shutdown. However, at the time of this writing, that has not happened.There are currently 1.81 million shares that have been shorted. Even though this is less than 5% of the float, it would take at least 8 trading days to cover all of the positions. If a dip does not come in time, there will be a high price to pay for the shorts that gambled and waited. Analysts are all over the board as to what that price will be. Recent ratings range from $75 a share to a high of $115. But even if the price did hit the low target of $75, there are a lot of shorts that will get burned.The company offers ""cloud"" software to protect the data of large corporations worldwide. The new Simpana 10 product has many other functions compared to other similar software. According to a press release on Friday:CVLT also announced that earnings results will be released October 29 on a Company Conference Call (PR link above). There were a couple of comments on my last article saying that CommVault's growth may be slowing down, and that this will be apparent when earnings are released. The shorts are betting everything on that. However, when CommVault is compared to industry leaders, it ranks very high for a Small Cap. Even its revenue growth is in the top third. As far as earnings growth CommVault ranks number 11 out of 155.CVLT vs. Industry LeadersMany shorts are also looking at the relatively high Price to Earnings Ratio of 76. However this is very low compared to the other leaders in the industry according to Yahoo. And the forward P/E is only 45. A lot is riding on the revenue and earnings results from this past quarter. The success of Simpana 10 may be the catalyst that CommVault needs to send it out of Small Cap status. Until then, a lot of shorts may have some sleepless nights.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1778502,24046,2013-10-28T10:39:01-04:00,,"""Their analysts don't know preferred stock from livestock""- GekkoCommvault (NASDAQ:CVLT) reports tomorrow morning. I will be short into earnings. This will be a repeat of a repricing trade that started post Q4 CC and continued into pre-Q1. I am one for two so far and the stock has effectively barely budged while the evidence has continued to mount in favor of my thesis. Anyway, if they prove me wrong I will be more than happy to shut-up.But what you may ask is considered proving me wrong?This is a question I want to deal with today because frankly speaking it is more important than the actual results we will get tomorrow. So, if you want my take on Commvault, go read what I have written already as I believe the major news material to the stock and this thesis is already out there. The aim of this piece is to call out the street.Yes, any sell-sider covering this stock, this note is meant for you.Commvault's Consensus Con has to EndFor those of you not familiar with their outlook, Commvault doesn't provide exact revenue/eps guidance numbers. What management does instead is manage the street. They hold their hand model wise to 'get to' consensus numbers, and then when they report they comment on how they see themselves doing against consensus projections. This approach allows them to always be 'comfortable' with consensus. Because the minute the public conference call ends, they start talking consensus numbers down again. This btw is fact. I have spoken to some unfortunate analysts who have had to go through this. The net result of all of this is that it is virtually IMPOSSIBLE for them to miss their guidance. When this goes on long enough, the headline numbers as a benchmark for the stock price are rendered useless.For those not familiar with this game, it is nothing new. CEO's who know how to play sell-side analysts are just doing their job well, but over-managing is a major red flag if you ask me. Also, CEO's who cut you out coverage wise if you don't play along are in my opinion effectively doing nothing more than manipulating what is supposed to be an 'objective' coverage of their stock. (we can leave the debate on that for another day) Anyway, Commvault's CEO is without a doubt 'managing' the street to an extreme.Just look at consensus projections for the next 3 quarters and two full years….Honestly, I have never seen anything like this. In my last note, I mentioned just how far into boring old blue chip land you have to go to find a bar this low. This low bar is the distorted by-product of excessively managing the street. The consensus numbers are so low that you start to wonder how anyone of these analysts has anything other than a sell rating on the stock. I mean if I wanted to demonstrate gross negligence, I'd ask anyone of these guys to show me how a generous growth assumption driven DCF model doesn't get them to a CVLT intrinsic value share price that is 40% lower. (You know what I am talking about here guys) And when I say generous, I mean generous, because what they are modeling would seem to imply 75% downside if they are going to make use of those CFA Charters.But honestly can we really accuse the street of gross negligence here?There are tons of on-premise enterprise software stocks out there that trade at PEG's north of 4.5x on forward earnings to forward growth rate basis. (Actually no there are not!)Anyway, I know why they are doing this. I know if they don't play along, they don't get a post CC call back. And I can see the 'hidden message' in many of their ratings.Take a look….What stands out here is the amount of analysts who are basically indifferent on the name. If a stock is trading at 50x forward NON-GAAP eps estimates and 70x forward GAAP estimates, how are you forecasting 15% and 12% eps growth over the next two years? Is CVLT a social network? Are they experimenting with a new monetization model? Are their competitors about to go out of business? I really would like to hear some answers to some of these questions.Now, in all of this nonsense, is opportunity.By low-balling the street, CVLT is continually diluting the value of their 'headline beats'. I personally have no problem with that. Effectively speaking what ends up happening is momo's who don't read between the lines end up exposed to a catastrophic repricing which those individuals willing to short the stock can become increasingly more confident about. When the sell-side is effectively sedated, you know they won't act until the stock gives them cover to bring in their price targets. Basically, the market needs to provide a jolt to help get them off their quarterly lithium dosage.So what could spark this?1) Operating Margin Headline DeclineWell, last quarter I focused on margins. CVLT's Q2 will be the first non massive expansion EBIT margin quarter in 9 quarters (last two quarters were up 300bps and 400+ bps yr/yr). In fact, it should be the first negative comping quarter in three years. Based on under investment in q1 and a tough comp against last years record margin quarter of 24.4%, CVLT EBIT margin could be down 100+bps yr/yr. This is of course telegraphed news, but as far as markets go it seems some people need a headline slap with a negative yr/yr comp to sell a stock.2) Continued CC Tone Drag CapitulationI started shorting this stock post the Q4 call because of the CC tone downshift. On that call we started to hear more about investment headwinds on margins, and macro risks tempering upside. Then on the subsequent Q1 call we got comments on a more complicated competitive environment as well as increased deal size risk to go with the macro headwinds. I expect based on what we have seen out of Asia/Europe numbers for many tech enterprise software players, the macro concern comments should only elevate on this call. I also believe thanks to the government shutdown and continued US Federal uncertainty that we will get more cautious comments on risks to Q3. Put this all against a weakening momo backdrop, and that might be enough crack the stock tomorrow even though the last CC was the real tipoff.3) An Actual Headline MissAs I expect revenues of $144 million and eps of 42c (that would be my version of the low bar), this is not something I really am looking for here. Missing the low-low-low bar would be nothing short of a disaster. But with the news out of Europe and US federal q2 close coinciding with this quarter, I'd like to think there is elevated headline risk. I am sure the shut down didn't help. I also would say this is the first full quarter post dell commission changes, so that could provide some unexpected noise too.Final ThoughtsBased on the way things are trading (take a look back at last week's earnings action), I think a combination of one and two will be more than enough to crack the stock at this level. Anyway, if this stock does sell-off, and you are long the name based on street targets/estimates/recommendations. I suggest you consider sounding off. And if you are one of the less doped buy-siders sleeping on this name, your complacency here is catching up to you.As for the headless chickens in this name, who seem to flock to me like flies to horse manure, if CVLT reports a gangbuster quarter, enjoy the wealth transfer. But this time I warn you that you are really going to need some amazing news to save your position.PS- I believe Simpana 10 is a great product. Read into that what you will.Disclosure: I am short CVLT. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

""Cloud"" storage saves companies money and frees   up valuable hardware storage space. One of these companies is CommVault   Systems (NASDAQ:CVLT). Its Simpana 9 streamlines data and manages both the bridge to the virtual data, the   virtual data storage, security and back-up for large companies   seamlessly.Investor's Business Daily has listed the company at #3 on its list of 10 New American Companies for   October 2011. This is based on CommVault's consistent increase in revenue over   the last several quarters. And CommVault has no debt.  Gartner's 2011 Analysis said:The price to earnings for CommVault is high at almost 80, but this is  typical for a growing tech stock. Analyst Robert Cotter said Saturday  in Earnings Lookback:The stock   closed Friday at $47.78, which is a little bit above the mid-range of most analysts, with a   high of $55. But looking at the charts, it will probably bust through   that top price soon. Since its IPO in 2006, the stock has been on a steady   incline.

1409041,24046,2013-05-07T12:03:13-04:00,,"I can spot a top when I see one and this stock just peaked. I've been circling this name for a while and scratching my head at its valuation. This is because CVLT (NASDAQ:CVLT) is a good old-fashioned enterprise software company and not some crazy, impossible to value SAAS name. It sells back-up/recovery focused data information management products into the enterprise space where it competes directly with the likes of Symantec's (SYMC) Netbackup and EMC's (EMC) Avamar. This is a very crowded space with all the usual suspects, and CommVault has been doing a great job over the last two years taking share. Now while I would like to get a lot more into detail this is an ACTIONABLE idea so getting this out in time is key as I believe the conference call just rang the bell. So I will give you an abridged thesis...Short this because...1) Takeover Bid Fizzling - This stock has had a takeover bid under it ever since big data got rolling, but that bid is fizzling fast. Dell (DELL-OLD) buying AppAssure and Quest means a 20% revenue OEM partner just became a competitor. Furthermore, the name tossed around to buy them is usually IBM (NYSE:IBM), which I think will never happen. CommVault is the old AT&T (NYSE:T) Networks division, and its product is thus built on legacy architecture, though it does have a single source code advantage over competitors. At its core it pre-dates cloud/virtualization, and thus would make little sense from a technology perspective for IBM. If IBM wants to buy something to boost its portfolio it will be cutting edge or native to virtual. Think VEEAM or Actifio. Furthermore, even if it were to want to grab a nice share with a CVLT takeover, the current price is ridiculous. At $4 billion market cap this company is trading 50x trailing EBIT or an EV/EBIT of 43x. Sorry, but even 25x would be pricey for this company in this very crowded space.2) Fiscal 2013 Was a Leverage Year/ 2014 is an Investment Year- CVLT generated 64% EBIT growth in fiscal 2013 on the back of 23% revenue growth. How did it do this? Huge margin expansion. What has management stated won't happen this year? If you guessed margin improvement, you are a genius. 2014 is being dubbed an 'investment year' which if you've traded enough momentum stocks in your life is code for GET THE HELL OUT. With 2/3 EBIT growth coming from margin expansion last year and revenues only expected to increase 15% this year you are looking at one expensive plain vanilla software stock (56x forward as of now).There you go. It doesn't get easier than that. I can also add that the tone on the conference call was clearly more cautious with management emphasizing greater execution risk, and a base forecast that is contingent on 2nd half pickup in enterprise spending. (I would strongly recommend listening to the CC replay or reading the transcript once available as listening to this is the best way to understand what got me so excited to go after this name.) All this to hit consensus numbers, which call for 15% revenue growth and 10% EPS growth. But what stood out even more, which is my impetus for shorting right now, was their very clear message on margins. And that message was, ""don't expect any help here as we invest for 2015 and beyond over the next twelve months."" Which brings me back to the simple point that the market, which is infinitely stupid when margins are expanding for tech stocks and extrapolates many years forward, will now have to look at what was 70% earnings growth in the rearview mirror, and realize that something close to 10-15% is a best case scenario for the next year. Not the end of the world, but for investors who have been riding this wave for the past two years that is tantamount to the fasten seatbelt sign being turned off once a plane has come to a complete stop. ......See Ya!Disclosure: I am short CVLT.

Two years ago I wrote an article about CommVault, questioning the fact that the stock had been going up in value since its IPO September 22, 2006 for $16.00 a share.

Many analysts and investors are trying to get in some vacation time before school starts. But it is a perfect time to find stocks that have some upside potential. I agree with Mr. Zibelli (mentioned above). Companies that have good products and are exhibiting growth in earnings and revenue will make the best investments for the long term. I think that CommVault fits this category. The biggest variable is the earnings report on Tuesday. If it's a ""miss"", it would be a great time to buy. But if it beats expectations, the shares could jump up very fast. Judging by its past history, I do not think it will miss.

And that’s caused a bump up again in the number of folks chasing anything with a patina of “virtualization,” a term used for the separation via software of files and documents from the physical hardware on which those assets are processed. 
Such a piece of software exists at CommVault (NASDAQ:CVLT), a company whose bread and butter has been archiving and securing data on collections of corporate disk drives.
The company’s new “Simpana” software supposedly makes it more of a “virtualization” company, in the sense that you can have your data copied to various collections of drives, so your data could be anywhere. Kind of like how VMware lets you run multiple operating systems irrespective of the underlying hardware (kinda, but not really the same thing).
At any rate, in a note Thursday morning, C.E. Unterberg Towbin analyst Gabriel Lowy, who has identified CommVault as a “virtualization” company in recent reports, says that his research shows strong interest in the Simpana product:
Arrow [Electronics (NYSE:ARW), one of CommVault’s distributors] and inside sales both indicate that existing customers are rapidly looking to upgrade to the broader functionality and that there are “many, many evals” out in field. We continue to believe that with Simpana, CommVault can take this market.
He goes on to describe how the product is a “virtualization” product: “The Simpana 7.0 suite creates a virtual pool of searchable content from files, emails and attachments stored across separate backup using a web-based interface.” That’s important when companies get hauled into court and have to find their files in “discovery” phase of a case, no matter where the e-mail or document in question may be located.
Lowy also says that his checks indicate relatively good capital spending trends among CommVault’s customers in the current quarter: “Several sales calls, including one each

to Dell (NYSE:DELL) (~20% of CommVault’s sales) and Hitachi (~7% of sales) suggest good linearity with no signs of spending slowdown.
Lowy has a $27 price target on shares of CommVault.
Next Wednesday, CommVault will host its shareholder meeting, details here."

With a name that neatly encapsulates the company's twin philosophy of solving enterprise data management and interface problems now and for the future, while locking the information on which it depends into an unassailable virtual strong room, CommVault Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CVLT) has come a long way since its 1996 founding based upon a single backup software product. Its 13,500+ data management customers now include large companies like Newell Rubbermaid (NASDAQ:NWL), Rooms to Go, and Raymond James Financial (NYSE:RJF), as well as international organizations, government agencies and small-to-medium size businesses.The company's Simpana software modules include backup, archive, replication, search and resource management capabilities, sharing a single code and common function set. The aim is to reduce costs, increase operational efficiency, promote data recoverability and mitigate risk, in not only physical but also virtual and cloud storage environments, whatever the applications, networks and protocols a customer may be using. CommVault has formed strategic partnerships for joint solutions with Dell (DELL), HP (HPQ), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), and Japanese-owned Hitachi Data Systems, among others. (Corporate Brochure - pdf) According to its website, CommVault remains the only company to offer this seamlessly-integrated single-platform solution for not only current but also future methods of data and information management. This achievement was the result of forward thinking and an aggressive product shift that began years ago, in anticipation of today's data center transformation. This unique product architecture, which has been recognized by significant industry awards, is the company's key differentiation point from its competitors, which include CA Technologies (CA), EMC (EMC), HP, IBM (IBM) and Symantec (SYMC).CommVault's major competitors have been around for much longer and generally have a more recognizable brand and a larger customer base, and many are able to bundle software products with hardware systems, which CommVault does not do. As a global business, the company is subjected to the risk of international economic downturns and fluctuating foreign exchange rates. Its North American commercial and government sales are largely conducted through a distribution agreement with Arrow Enterprise Computing Solutions, a private company, accounting for 25% of CommVault's fiscal 2011 revenue and 32% of accounts receivable at year end. Sales through reseller and original equipment manufacturer agreements with Dell were responsible for a further 23% of revenue and 25% of accounts receivable. That's a lot of eggs in just two baskets.Customers may buy directly from CommVault, although evidently they are more likely to work with one of the company's resellers or strategic partners. Software sales are backed up by global assessment, design, implementation, training and support services, with main bases in Oceanport NJ, as well as in India, Germany, Australia and China. The company has around 1,300 employees servicing customers not only in the Americas but also in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Australia and Asia. Over 300 employees are involved in research and development, and CommVault spent $37 million on R&D in 2011. At the end of fiscal 2011 the company held 173 issued patents and 250 pending patent applications. They mitigate but do not eliminate the risk of unauthorized copying of intellectual property by customers or employees. (2011 Form 10-K)Revenues have grown every year since 2003 - not even stalling in 2008-2009 - to reach $315 million in fiscal 2011 (year ended March 31 2011), a 16% increase over the previous year. Software revenue, a high gross margin contributor, accounted for $150 million of the total, service revenue for the remaining $165 million. Net income was $21 million ($0.45 per diluted share), a 14% increase on 2010. (Fact Sheet - pdf), (Q4 2011 Earnings News Release)Fiscal 2012 is already three-quarters complete, and Q3 results were announced on February 1. Record quarterly revenue of $103.6 million brought the year-to-date total to $293 million ($143 million software, $150 million services), a 30% increase over comparable 2010. Operating margin improved to 12.1% (10.4% in 2010). Net income for the nine months was $22 million ($0.47 per diluted share), $2 million more than the entire previous year. (Q3 2012 Earnings News Release)CommVault president and CEO Robert Hammer offered some further insights during the Q3 earnings conference call. There had been strong growth during the quarter in the Americas, Europe and China, but, in spite of past limited negative impact from the macroeconomic climate, the company is now cautious about the weakness of the Eurozone and the uncertainty in customers' IT budgets for calendar 2012 and beyond. However, the company has at present no plans to curtail its intended spending to achieve FY12 targets and further growth in revenue and market share in FY13, while continuing to aim for more improvement in operating margin. Recent focus on reorganizing the sales team to concentrate on the large enterprise market sector (customers spending $100,000+ on software) appears to be paying off, with average enterprise deal value now standing at $269,000 compared with $219,000 a year ago. (Q3 2012 earnings call webcast )CommVault does not disclose its revenue by geographic region, other than distinguishing between United States revenue (about 60% in 2011) and ""Other."" Clearly there is some concern about the immediate future of Europe, even though the company actually increased its revenue during the 2008-2009 global financial downturn.CommVault's stock has increased significantly over the last six months and has recently pulled back and appears to be forming a base for a potential next leg up as shown below:CommVault's trailing Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio and forward P/E, 86 and 44, respectively, are at a premium.

(NASDAQ:CVLT) delivered a 38.1% positive surprise in its fiscal second quarter,  which convinced most analysts to raise their estimates. This Zacks No. 1  Rank (Strong Buy)  provider of Enterprise Backup/Recovery software has a  long-term projected growth rate of 25.0%.Strong Second QuarterOn Oct. 29, CommVault Systems reported that fiscal second-quarter  earnings per share surged 70.6% year over year to 29 cents, which  exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 38.1%. The strong growth was  primarily driven by the improving operating margin in the quarter.Revenue jumped 21.2% from the prior-year quarter to $118.2 million,  slightly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $115.0 million. The  better-than-expected growth was driven by solid performances from  software (up 23.8%) and services (up 18.8%).Higher revenues and stringent cost controls helped the operating margin  to expand 550 basis points to 18.9% in the reported quarter.Outlook Remains PositiveCommVault Systems expects the positive first-half momentum to continue  in the second half of fiscal 2013. Despite an uncertain macro  environment, the company is confident that it will deliver strong second-half results on the basis of increasing demand from enterprise and  federal sectors, as well as continuous cost control efforts.Earnings Estimates Move HigherIt is noteworthy that most analysts raised their forward estimates for  both 2013 and 2014 over the last 30 days. For 2013, the Zacks Consensus  Estimate increased 4.4% to 94 cents as four out of six estimates were revised  upward. For 2014, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 improved 3.8% as three estimates out of five moved higher.Reasonable ValuationCurrently, CommVault Systems is trading at a premium to most of its  peers based on P/E, P/S, and P/B. The premium valuation seems justified  given the company’s solid earnings growth prospects. Its earnings growth  expectation of 25.0% over the next five years compares favorably with  the industry average of 17.8%, indicating room for further significant  expansion. Moreover, its return on equity of 17.1% is higher than  the industry average of 11.5%.Chart Shows Growth PotentialThe 12-month earnings per share chart clearly shows that share  prices have increased at a higher pace than earnings over the last few  years.Currently, its share price is hovering around $63.00. The consensus  estimates for 2013 and 2014 are trending upward. The estimate revision  graph indicates a slow but steady upward trend through fiscal 2015. As  illustrated in the chart below, share prices should increase at a  similar or faster pace than the estimate revision trend.Incorporated in 1996, CommVault Systems Inc. develops software that  primarily helps enterprises to manage data and information. Through its  flagship Simpana brand, the company delivers different data management  activities including backup and recovery capabilities for both onsite  and cloud environments.

1593292,24046,2013-08-02T09:30:00-04:00,,"""You're a funny guy""- Ray Liotta, GoodfellasWhen a company reports results that surprise you, all you can do is swallow them and move on. Reality in this business is you are going to be right and actually wrong, wrong and luckily proven right, just plain wrong, and from time to time spot on. But sometimes a company will report exactly what you expected, and the stock will still surprise you. Commvault (NASDAQ:CVLT) on Tuesday did precisely that. After reading the report and listening to the call, I fully expected the stock to be down 10%. At best maybe down 5%. Instead it finished up 10%.How does that happen?Let's take a look at the numbers.As you can see, Commvault has been throwing up solid numbers for the last two years. Revenues grew 22% last year, and significant margin expansion translated that into 61% EPS growth. Now if you look at the stock, it was trading at 73.5x net earnings when they reported 4th quarter fiscal 2012 full results. Over the following year, the stock climbed 70%, and thus boosted that multiple slightly to 77x. That's fine and dandy except during those four quarters, margins expanded by 370bps. That's a sharp contrast to ttm number which is at negative 110 bps. And this is where you have to start wondering about Commvault.Going into earnings, Street consensus was calling for 12% non-GAAP EPS growth and 16% revenue growth. Margin guidance from management was at 23% full year non-GAAP EBIT. The EPS growth breakdown for fiscal 2014 was 16%, 10%, 12%, 10%. Now Q1 came in at 38%, but it also was carrying 300bps of year-over-year margin improvement. Of course this begs the question why was consensus so low considering the fact that revenues came in-line, but I am not going to bother with that right now. What I am going to show is that for the next 3 quarters if CVLT simply hits its numbers, the current implied PEG would be just under 5 versus an actual PEG of 1.28 for those who bought at the end of fiscal 2012 at $50 a share. To put this in perspective, Commvault needs to beat consensus by an average of 22c a quarter for the next three quarters if it's going to get back to last year's PEG by the end of fiscal 2014. That is not happening, but who ever said a stock needs to maintain some arbitrary ratio. Anyway, the purpose of this rant is not to get into what people are willing to pay for growth, but rather to point out just how unlikely it is that Commvault comes anywhere close to what is actually being expected by investors. For the stock to remain around $70 by the end of the fiscal 2014, they need about 40% bottom line growth. That way a year from now you are holding a 50 P/E stock that is following more of a linear declining growth trajectory. To achieve that, they need to beat consensus numbers by an average of 30% for the next three quarters. That means assuming a 23% non-GAAP EBIT margin, which by the way looks a little bit on the optimistic side right now, they need 38% revenue growth to get there. Now considering they grew 22% all of last year and 21% in the most recent quarter with, by the way, the most notable sequential drop in new software license sales in recent memory, this is not happening.So what might be realistic?Seeing as Wall Street doesn't seem to feel the need to offer anything worthy of reasonable estimates, I will provide a realistic forecast. Taking into account current margin trends, ramping investment plans, solid visibility, and an assumed second half pickup, I think Commvault will grow revenues at least 18% this year. That should translate into about $1.27 in fully diluted GAAP EPS (about $1.75 non-GAAP) or roughly 17% growth. This means the stock has a forward P/E of 67x and a PEG of 4.5. If I was as bullish on the company's prospects as the entire Street is, I'd assume they would manage to maintain last year's growth rate and clock in at 22% again. This would get me to a non-GAAP EPS consensus of $1.81 or 10% above current estimates. That would at least bring us to a non-GAAP PEG closer to 3. Beat this number by 20% and you can start making a more compelling case for the stock to trade around where it is currently trading based on future potential. Talking about beating current consensus numbers for a growth stock like this is an insult to the word beating. I mean Disney (NYSE:DIS) has the same forecasted consensus EPS growth rate. So, when I see revenue growth numbers that work out to 18%, 16%, and 12% for the remaining three quarters, I can't help but laugh. Which brings me to the conference call...According to management:You don't need a PHD in finance to understand that they underinvested this quarter to hit numbers because they were already struggling to make Wall Street's very low revenue bar. Again this was possible in Q1 because of the giant y/y margin improvement, but next quarter CVLT is comping against a record EBIT margin quarter. And for the rest of the year, the EBIT margin comp works out to a 23.6% average. Considering their guidance they are forecasting a 22.9% EBIT margin for the next 3 quarters. That's a 70bps annual drag they are looking at right now.And this wasn't exactly a rosy CC:See, Commvault the company is doing fine, but the one thing nobody on this call wanted to come out and say is that the pace of growth is obviously slowing. I mean if they have to do all this funnel work and delay investment simply to hit the ridiculously low consensus bar, what else should you conclude? And for management to comment on competition for the first time was interesting if you ask me. This is a competitive space, and when you grow from upstart to arguable leader, everyone starts gunning for you. Commvault is now facing much more complicated sales pitches as their large enterprise competitors use all their resources (bundling, discounting, etc.) to close deals.Conclusion:The stock should be trading in the 60s until the company can show that it is on track to deliver at least 22% revenue growth for the fiscal year. And missing the joke consensus numbers at these levels would be nothing short of a disaster in my mind, and would warrant a near 50% repricing of the shares.Disclosure: I am short CVLT.

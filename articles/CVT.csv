Headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia, Cvent also has corporate offices in India, Canada and England. It employs 1,900 workers and generated $187 million in revenue in fiscal 2015.Acquiring PartyVista Equity Partners is a US-based private equity firm focused on investing in software and technology-enabled companies. It has a proven track record of successful acquisitions. Some of the recently closed deals include insurance technology provider Solera Holdings Inc. (NYSE:SLH) ($3.8 billion) and engagement marketing software company Marketo Inc. (NASDAQ:MKTO) ($1.8 billion). A list of Vista's portfolio can be seen at Vista's website.Purchase Price and FinancingBased on the $36 per share offer, the deal is valued at $1.65 billion. Given Vista's record with closing acquisitions having similar purchase value, I feel comfortable with Vista securing financing for Cvent.Closing HurdlesAs a friendly merger supported by management of Cvent, the deal was welcomed by its shareholders. As expressed in the recent 10-Q, the US DOJ has requested additional information and documenting material regarding the merger, commonly referred to as a ""second request."" Also stated in the recently 10-Q is the fact that both companies expect the merger to be completed in the third or fourth quarter of this year.Because of the small size of the deal, there is relatively minimal antitrust risk associated with the merger. Also, Cvent being a software company that does not deal with sensitive data, there should be little risk for the deal being rejected by the DOJ. Since Vista is a veteran in closing similar deals, I have strong belief that the deal should complete relatively smoothly.Spread and ReturnThe offer price of the merger is $36. Based on August 26's closing price of $32.7, the spread is a rich $3.30. If this deal were to close on Dec. 31, 2016, we can expect an annualized rate of return of:If we allow a two-month cushion for any potential delay (which I highly doubt), then the annualized return would be lowered to:Either scenario would provide a nice annualized return that beats a high interest savings account or CD.While it is unlikely, an unsuccessful close of the deal would mean the price could fall back to the price prior to the merger announcement.Since the stock has falter in the last couple months, this will be a good time to take advantage of the recent decline and add some Cvent shares to your portfolio.In the case that you have no previous experience buying stocks undergoing mergers: because there is no sell transaction, no SEC fees will be charged once the merger completes. Your broker should not charge a commission of the share delisting either. Although you still have to take your buy side commission into consideration.Institutional PurchasesEven though I do not generate my buy/sell conclusion solely on institutional purchases, it is always great to see some famous investors lining up on the same side of my trade:These are very tiny positions relative to the portfolios Mario Gabelli, Prem Watsa, and Joel Greenblatt manage. However, considering the size of this merger, any significant purchase could move the price of the stock and therefore narrow the spread.ConclusionCvent is a solid merger play that is relatively low risk, with a high probability of closing that offers a 20-29% annualized rate of return. We can take advantage of the recent weak price action to get in before the spread narrows."
4004522,96386,2016-09-07T02:15:40-04:00,"Event SaaS business is prepared for more growth.
        Shareholders have approved the merger.
        Vista equity partners has a successful track record in event tech acquisitions.
        Double digit annualized returns available to investors today.","Cvent inc. (NYSE:CVT) is a merger deal ready for new investors. Vista equity partners, a notable tech-focused PE firm, announced an all-cash deal for $1.65 billion or $36 per share for Cvent inc. earlier this year.Last week, Geoffrey W did a great job covering the details of the acquisition and the recent shareholder approval. My article will focus more on why Cvent inc. is a great business and that investors can feel safe putting money behind. The company has a very interesting story with a resilient CEO only focused on success and creating value for shareholders.Company BackgroundCvent is a leading cloud-based event management company for corporations, hotels and large venues. With 16,000 customers there is a good chance you have attended an event in the U.S. that was managed with Cvent's technology. Why? Because event management is a big business. Companies like TicketMaster and Eventbrite focus mostly on consumers ticketing transactions. This game is completely different for corporate business events. Cvent inc. can be viewed as the Priceline (PCLN) for corporate event management.The company offers a variety of services that assist event organizers run events seamlessly and connect attendees through mobile apps. The cloud software offers solutions for several challenges event planners face: expense management, venue sourcing, attendee registration and logistics. For large corporate buyers, events and tradeshows is equivalent to having a wedding and reception every quarter. Cvent solves these problems by automating logistical efforts and saving money when sourcing tasks. Below is a snapshot of Cvent's network; very similar to an online travel site with vertical and horizontal reach.Source: Cvent 2015 Q4 Investor presentationSince 2008 the company has increased group booking value from $50 million to $9.8 billion. In the chart below, you can see the company has quadrupled revenue in the last six years. While investors shouldn't expected +30% in growth forever, Cvent is certainly taking over market share in this competitive industry. The second chart has a list of the top customers and industries Cvent has been successful in servicing, a strong testament for the company's software solution.Strong revenue momentumSource: Cvent 2015 Q4 Investor presentationHigh quality customer baseSource: Cvent 2015 Q4 Investor presentationLike many other dot-com businesses, Cvent started in 1999 and was on the brink of bankruptcy shortly after the internet bubble burst. Co-founder and current CEO, Reggie Aggarwal, was a 31-year old former lawyer who had burned through most of the $17 million raised from notable investors. After downsizing his entire operation, Reggie and his team were forced to build great products instead of spending money on marketing.Buyout teamVista Equity Partners is one of the best tech-focused private equity firms. The company's primary focus is to buy and build tech-enabled and software businesses. Uncommon in the PE space, Vista keeps technology innovation on the top of its investment criteria list. Many reporters and industry experts have suggested that Vista will merge Cvent with one of its portfolio companies, Lanyon Solutions inc., another corporate event management business. If you want to read more about event tech space and Vista's plans for the future I would suggest reading this article about Vista's Marketo acquisition.Since Lanyon is a private company, it is difficult to calculate the value of synergies but we can be assured that the Vista team would find a favorable outcome post-deal close. It should be noted that Vista was successful in merging Active Network Business Solutions Group with Lanyon in 2014, increasing the likelihood Vista will create value with the Cvent deal. Vista was also able to close the $1 billion Active Network deal within two months of the announcement.Merger ArbitrageFor those unfamiliar, mergers arbitrage was the secret sauce for opportunistic investors like Warren Buffett. As a cash deal the likelihood of closing quickly increases. Buffett-like investors could purchase a great amount of Cvent stock in the short term to significantly enhance annualized returns. This was his favorite investment strategy which you can read more about in the Art of Stock Arbitrage, by Mary Buffett, Warren Buffett's former daughter-in-law.Below is a quick breakdown of what investors can expect from this acquisition. The deal is expected to close in the third or fourth quarter of this year. As of this writing, the stock trades at $32.5 and will close at $36. Investors will be given $36 in cash in exchange for owning CVT. A spread of $3.5 equates to a 10.7% return. If the stock was purchased today and the deal closed on December 31, 2016, this would produce an annualized return of ~32% (this is slightly higher than Geoffrey's return calculation because I have a lower buy-in price and shorter window).Given that this is a cash deal and Vista's exceptional track record, investors are given a high certainty that this deal will close in the near term. The probability of closing makes this scenario less risky than many speculative other stock buys."
3842376,56112,2016-01-29T08:50:36-05:00,"As a value investor, I usually find it hard to stomach stocks with sky-high valuations, but I think the value proposition at Cvent is pretty strong.If the company executes, they may be able to lock up the event vertical - on both the hospitality and demand side - and increase pricing over time.I can't call Cvent a buy even after the sell-off, but it's less of a stretch than most of its SaaS peers that I've looked at.I think this is a name that growth investors should do due diligence on.","High quality SaaS stories are rarely cheap in the absolute sense, but in many cases, valuations have come in pretty significantly since the froth of a few years ago, as investors' attention has turned to other categories. With many SaaS companies down significantly from IPO or post-IPO prices, I've been digging through the sector to figure out which, if any, may be worth a look.Despite trading at a valuation that is hardly ""cheap,"" event-management software vendor Cvent (NYSE:CVT) is one of the few SaaS stories that I think may be worth paying up for. The current valuation is steep, and to be clear, I'm not recommending a buy here - but the price I'd be willing to pay for Cvent is significantly higher than the price I'd be willing to pay for many SaaS peers. I'll explain why.Software With Network EffectsEveryone knows that marketplaces/network effects models are great, but more people claim to have them than actually do. As I discussed in my Opower (OTC:OPWR) write-up, for example, given the intensely local nature of electricity consumption, it's hard for me to see how having scale is particularly valuable in the utility-software market above and beyond the usual G&A efficiencies. In general, while there are lots of things to like about SaaS businesses, it doesn't get more valuable for user N when user N + 1000 joins the platform.Cvent, on the other hand, is unique in that it has clear network effects. The company does have some competitors. MeetMax, owned by The Wall Street Transcript, is used for a lot of investor conferences, and there are a number of companies like Regpack. Cvent seems to be a scale leader, and its reach spans both the ""Event Cloud"" (focusing on meeting planners) and the ""Hospitality Cloud"" (focusing on group and meeting business for hotels). The magic happens when these two intersect in the form of electronic RFPs; as CEO Reggie Aggarwal explains:Data from each side helps the other, similar to the interplay between data and listing sites at CoStar (NASDAQ:CSGP), an interesting company in its own right which I've discussed previously here. In the case of Cvent, hotels are better able to price (and pursue) group business when they have more visibility into various events. Meeting planners are able to spend more time on what matters rather than trying to find venues.Moreover, the value proposition is strong not just for planners, but also for corporate finance and compliance departments - Cvent is aiming to be the Concur (owned by SAP (NYSE:SAP)) of meetings. They believe event planning is one of the few remaining areas of uncontrolled corporate spend; in many instances, their clients weren't even shopping around for quotes, just going with the same venue year after year. This sounds surprising but really shouldn't be, and provides a pretty compelling value proposition for corporate adoption of the software - it not only enables time savings, but potentially significant monetary savings as well.TAM: While There Are Questions, It Should Be Big EnoughI've felt for a while that trying to figure out the size of a SaaS company's TAM is more art than science. While there's always some way to back into estimates - say, number of total potential seats times ARPU - there's a lot of wiggle room around potential additional applications on the upside, and potential ceilings from penetration and eventual ""good-enough"" competition on the downside. Cvent sees a $5 billion TAM on the event management side, with an additional $2 billion from the hospitality side, and potentially a billion more from mobile apps for events.One of the potential bearish arguments here deals with the frequency of events - in a world rapidly moving towards technology, do physical, face-to-face events have a long-term future? Let's take the investor relations world as an example: will investor conferences continue to exist in ten years the way they do today? It's an open question. Indeed, even once I'm not running my fund on a shoestring budget, I think I'd be hard pressed to spend money flying out to a conference when I could just watch the webcasts or read the transcripts online. That said, I find 1x1s quite valuable, and I do believe there is an additional element to face-to-face communication that WebEx meetings and the like leave behind.Moreover, at many conferences, you go less for the speakers and more for the networking (which is difficult to replicate online, at least for now). And even bleeding-edge technology companies host their own conferences that attract tons of people - Dreamforce comes to mind. While I do believe that the growth rate of events may moderate due to increasing utilization of technology - similar to how I would expect more and more corporate consulting to be done remotely, reducing wasteful T&E - I think this is more like a point or two off the future growth rather than an existential question. However you choose to size the market, Cvent seems to have a fairly long runway of growth.This is especially the case because I believe they're not pushing price nearly as hard as they could. As I'll cover in the next section, the company is focused on revenue growth rather than profitability right now - but the reason for this is because they believe they already have a significant lead, and they want to cement it by winning the market as fast as they can. In the words of Billy Newman, Cvent's VP of Financial Planning and Analysis, ""we want the volume from the planners to hotels to become so strong that we provide so much value that unlike the OTAs, they are afraid of creating another OTA.""The company is also going both up and downmarket to solidify its position. The new Cvent Express product requires minimal to no training and can be used by anyone - good for simple events, in other words. And on the other end, the company has added capabilities for ""complex events"" of up to 25,000 attendees.Proven History Of Profitability… And More Could ComeTo investors for whom companies are just blinking numbers on a Bloomberg terminal or Excel spreadsheet, the ""story"" may not matter much - but I always like digging into how companies got to be the way they are, as I think it says something about where they're going and why.Within that framework, Cvent's history - which they lay bare for anyone to see - is quite interesting. The company raised capital amidst the tech bubble and were encouraged to spend it all; when things imploded, they had to cut headcount by 80%. Most of the founding executives stayed, though - founder-CEO Reggie Aggarwal lived with his parents to conserve costs and personally signed the lease for the company's office despite the risk of bankruptcy permanently impairing his backup option (going back to practicing law).The company survived, though - and more than that, by focusing on customers, Cvent grew organically over time. What's more, they were actually profitable. Some lessons, you never forget.As I referenced, since the IPO, they are reinvesting heavily into sales and marketing, but they're still posting double-digit EBITDA margins despite posting >30% revenue growth. This is obviously an impressive combination. The company may also be able to push pricing over time once it's the dominant market leader - I wouldn't necessarily build this into my model, but it's a potential source of future upside.While there's a lot to like here, the problem is valuation. Even after the dramatic sell-off this month, though, it's hard to argue shares are cheap at over 5x trailing EV/revenues. Even if you ""grossed up"" EBITDA to the target model - i.e. what it would be if they were only growing at, say, 20%/yr - you'd still be trading at ~25x trailing adjusted EBITDA.If you believe in the long-term growth story, there could be room for upside here - Concur famously ended up being acquired for a nosebleed 11x revenues with a similar growth rate and lower gross margin. That said, betting on a higher public-markets multiple (or M&A) doesn't seem like a very good strategy, and I think an investment in Cvent at this price has to be based on the premise of future execution rather than multiple expansion.Wrapping It UpRelative to most value investors, I take a much more favorable view of software and ""growth"" companies. I'm just not willing to pay up the usual multiples for them. If Cvent's multiple got unreasonably clobbered on a few quarters of weak sales execution and I believed the long-term value proposition was still intact, I would find it to be an interesting proposition, but it's not right for me at this price.Relative to the rest of the small SaaS company landscape, though, Cvent seems to have fewer questions along with a clearer path to target profitability. I think that makes it one that's worth keeping on your radar - the current sell-off isn't deep enough to call it compelling, but at a turn or so lower on the multiple, I think it would be worth a look for risk-tolerant growth investors.Disclaimer: Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions.

3454876,48411,2015-08-20T10:48:52-04:00,Cvent is finally getting some notice from a market that had ignored it since its IPO.The event management platform provider posted a very strong quarter which included positively revised guidance.I expect this coupled with a technical breakout to new levels should bring out analyst upgrades - these should further move the stock higher.Continue to be long Cvent.,"Cvnet (NYSE:CVT) is out with a great quarter, one that finally took the stock out of its long locked range into new all-time highs. I'm not quite sure what took the market so long to recognize the disruptive potential of this player, but finally it has. Even into what has been a hugely negative beta ,Cvent shares have held the highs nicely. I'm of the belief that institutions should begin watching Cvent for quarterly buys on good news and soon that overall volume in the name will pick up, further driving shares of this overlooked stock higher. I continue to recommend a long position in Cvent.Cvent continues to build out its core and ancillary platforms in becoming a comprehensive event management solution for both the demand and supply side of the event planning equation. Cvnet now adds to its platform Lead Scoring, SocialWall, CrowdCompass - its event mobile app, OnArrival - an addition to itss onsite solutions suite, and Inquisium - its enterprise feedback tool. In doing this, consistently adding to its product portfolio, it has been able to consistently drive usage and monetization of its platform.As part of its overall growth strategy and as a way to pull growth forward, Cvent has been aggressive with acquisitions. While these acquisitions have effectively been used to ""purchase R&D"" they have been immediate-term headwinds to margins and to the broader financials as they have associated one-time acquisition costs that have to be marked in the current period. That said, I still thought Cvent reported a very nice quarter and I believe the long-term net benefits of the smart acquisitions executed will far outweigh immediate term risk introduced into the model (integration risk, execution risk, etc.).Cvent reported Q2/15 revenue of $47.3 million, a 39% increase Y/Y with platform revenue as a subset increasing 35% Y/Y. Revenue from the hospitality cloud, which includes what Cvent previously referred to as ""marketing solutions,"" was $14.6 million (up 48% Y/Y). Revenue growth was driven by overall scale-up but also increased ARPU. Again, as Cvent has grown its product portfolio so too has it grown its overall volume take rate with existing and new customers. Of course, this is a very bullish long-term development.Still, as alluded to above, this revenue produced adjusted EBITDA of just $4.6 million, or 9.7% of revenue, which was flat Y/Y in dollars but down from 13.6% margin last year. The margin decline, as noted, was due to the Decision Street and Elite acquisitions as well as the dilutive effect of the SignUp4 acquisition in the Q2/15. All of these events have been covered in research notes at Seeking Alpha. I think after a review of the events investors will see that the acquisitions were done with a long-term outlook in mind and should more than offset in time.In saying that, Cvent is well positioned fundamentally to realize the long-term benefits of its hard work during Q2. The company ended the period with C&CE of ~$163 million AND increased full-year guidance aggressively. Looking at the year as a whole, Cvent expects revenue ""to be in the range of $185 million to $186 million or growth of 30% to 31% from 2014. This represents an increase of $3.5 million at the midpoint from our prior guidance, which is a combination of the second quarter upside from our core products and a higher outlook for the remainder of the year compared to our previous assumptions (SOURCE: CVT Q2/15 investor call)."" The company also made aggressive increases to adjusted EBITDA which speaks well to the overall growing health of the underlying model.I continue to recommend a long position in Cvent and I continue to believe that this stock will be an excellent, low volatility performer for a long time to come.Good luck everybody."

I've recently opined that Cvent perfectly blends the ""Facebook and salesforce.com"" models in creating its Hospitality Cloud, a platform that brings hoteliers and special events venues together with event planners in a centralized marketplace. It appears that Cvent is wanting to take things a step further.Cvent has introduced its 2014 SocialWall product, which is now available for hoteliers and special event venue proprietors - prior it was only available to event planners. SocialWall is exactly what it sounds like. SocialWall is substantially similar to Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) News Feed but importantly SocialWall is a ""News Feed""-like product with 100% verified members and a highly silo-based vertical usage.What's exciting about SocialWall?Well, first, I should start with the fact that SocialWall has been one of the more talked about products under the total Cvent product umbrella since launch. Event planners have done nothing but applaud it since its 2014 debut. While anecdotal, and while event planners really have no Hospitality Cloud to turn to even if they were unhappy or unsatisfied, I feel like SocialWall has contributed to high levels of retention and further platform capture. Now, with the expansion to the other side of the supply/demand ecosystem, I anticipate even more total transactions being executed and higher levels of total Hospitality Cloud engagement. Both will do well for Cvent's key metrics and with that market share dominance.Cvent lists the following benefits in its press release detailing the announcement:Again, I anticipate this being a core functionality that is leveraged by both sides of the Cloud Hospitality aisle and a move that will see Cvent driving key metrics. I also could see this unique, differentiated product creating somewhat of a viral loop and network effect, which could pull forward revenue growth - that's a good thing for shareholders.I just don't know of another platform that 1) is even close to the scale and servicing ability of the Hospitality Cloud (something I've detailed in past coverage of this name) and 2) has a product like this. I cover a huge amount of tech companies both private and public, both domestic and international and again I have to underline Cvent's platform and problem solving ability is unique.Because of this, I continue to recommend Cvent.Good luck everybody."

Differentiation creates so much flexibility. Flexibility to take chances, to be aggressive, to be defensive. Cvent (NYSE:CVT) is definitely differentiated and it's continuing to build out this quality.CVT reported an excellent Q1/15 in which it grew revenues 31% Y/Y, beat on Adjusted EBITDA (which it showed a growth to 7.8% of revenues), and finished the quarter with $175.6 million in C&CE (up from $167.6 sequentially). Yes, all of this is good and I'm definitely not sweeping it under the rug. But the real story of the quarter came on the Q1/15 investor call.CEO Reggie Aggarwal, who is always excellent with color and detail, was his usual brilliant self. Aggarwal outlined the following key takeaways.SignUp4 Acquisition …The SignUp4 acquisition was predictable, actually an analyst on the last conference call did predict it, and makes sense but for what other than to acquire a competitor with an OK client roster? Apparently, according to Aggarwal, SignUp4 brings a few easily integrated new capabilities for CVT's customers - especially on the spend management and travel management side. Also, Aggarwal was clear that CVT really liked the talent that worked at SignUp4.This, to me at least, might be the real reason for the buyout. Talent is so hard to come by in the SMB/enterprise space right now and CVT has a really unique niche that it's covering which makes getting the right people even harder to do. It did that with the SignUp4 acquisition and that has to be looked at positively as CVT looks to grow to the next level of scale.Continued Momentum …CVT gave an excellent update as to the market penetration it's seeing, especially when it comes to the upper enterprise market (SOURCE: CVT Q1/15 investor call):As CVT continues to scale and continues to fragment customer concentration across size, regional presence, industry, specialty, etc., it also fragments its risk of a book-wide downturn in activity. With CVT's entire model build on hotel activity you can imagine being concentrated to on industry would expose it to quite a bit of risk. But, for example, energy and pharma have (reasonably) little correlation to each other from a macro standpoint which does CVT well from a risk management standpoint.New customer wins, big wins, and risk fragmentation are all good things.Beacon Marketing …Beacon Marketing is a function that I'm really, really hot on lately. I think it's the eventual next step in mobile advertising and the step that's most lucrative in that it eliminates ""cookie slip"". That said, CVT has expressed in interest in deploying this to an extent if its partners see value in it. I can see this gaining traction as most hotels have plenty of areas to place beacons that wouldn't alter the aesthetics of the building. While just something to consider for the future this could be huge. I love Aggarwal's innovative and fearless thinking in this, so for me this also speaks to management.Mobile …Finally, Aggarwal was very colorful in his explanation of how the team at CVT uses mobile as a sticky product that leads to cross and upselling:How powerful is that? Yes, the biggest competition that CVT faces in this niche is ""home built"" solutions but often times these solutions have been around for a long, long time. These incumbent platforms either don't have the capacity to integrate mobile (that's the least of their problems) or the hotelier doesn't have the access to the old system manager to make this happen. In steps CVT.CVT positioning its mobile services is an immediately value-add and allows for an opportunity to bring the relationship further into the product umbrella. Again, these are things that my mind should have already put together, because this is a fairly obvious though, but it didn't. Aggarwal making sure that The Street knows how this process works is a value-add to investors. I happen to be one and I like that.Q1/15 …All told I think that CVT gave us a glimpse of the future with its Beacon Marketing intro and its mobile positioning. It acquired some new capacity via SignUp4 and its core products continue to win and win big as a result of its differentiation.Buy CVT guys. You'll be happy you did as time goes on. This is a fairly young, fairly immature operation that participates in a massive space. I think it outclasses the competition in a highly visible way.Good luck everybody."

CVT's ""Portals & Dashboards"" release should increase usage and engagement metrics meaningfully, metrics that have shown Y/Y/Y healthy growth and are what drove the value of the company at its IPO. This move should help position the company's platform to be more comprehensive. This solution addition should be able to capture client time spent using outside survey and data visualization platforms and should further position its defensiveness atop the niche. This is important for obvious reasons but most importantly for the fact that CVT believes hotel clients aren't willing to learn to use and deploy multiple event planning and enterprise management systems. The more comprehensive a solution, the greater the level of defensiveness the system has.CVT's Portals & Dashboards allows clients on both sides of the value-prop (supply side and demand side - essentially hotels and event planners) to collect data, consolidate data, and analyze data. Three mission critical needs that prior to this addition CVT offered little in the way of. Now, CVT's platform offers a near open-architecture solution for addressing this need. CVT's addition will allow for importing of externally launched surveys to its portal, complete user management and access management, the ability to send invitations to view published content and notifications to updates, the ability to create custom widgets, data filters, and the ability to aggregate data from multiple surveys. Again, this moves forward the platform capabilities in a big way.Back in early-March CVT CEO Reggie Aggarwal talked to analyst at the Pacific Crest Emerging Technology summit about the fact that hotels, as a result of wanting to be efficient were in the process of or had already decided to use limited event management platforms. This is good for CVT for several reasons, namely in that it's the leader in the niche and that positions it defensively, but in regards to the Portals & Dashboards launch this positions it for a new advantage that it didn't have before. With hotels and event planners now, presumably, using CVT for data collection and analytics CVT stands to be able to monetize this channel as well. I believe CVT could blind the massive amount of survey data it's going to collect in the near and mid-terms and initiate a consulting and analytics segment if it so chooses. Those familiar with the consulting and analytics business know that margins often range from the mi-80% to the mid-90%. This could be the first step in a new, very high margin, no CAPEX, ""over the top"" revenue segment that CVT can run alongside its current platform. This should be considered total speculation at this point but how would CVT be able to justify to shareholders not using this data to drive further value? Especially when blinded? It just makes sense.All told the bottom line with this announcement is that CVT has become more comprehensive and should be able to capture further key metric growth, which is already outstanding. This upgrade should be good enough to drive shares higher into the balance of 2015 and I really don't think the actual impact of this will be fully understood by the broader market for quite some time. This announcement, while largely look past by the markets, is bigger than it seems.I continue to recommend a long position in CVT. Shares are up 10.7% since initiation.Good luck everybody."

        CVT's has slowly but sure grown its top-line each of the last 5 years while also growing market share in a very lucrative industry.
        CVT shares should continue higher and higher with little volatility. I like CVT to provide risk fragmentation and diversity to my portfolio.","I came across what turned out to be a great investment story the other day when running a screener that was looking for companies that were showing a net loss for full year 2013 but wouldn't have shown a loss if share based comp had been excluded. What I was looking for in particular was a company that might be undervalued based on algorithmic trading and based on surface level analysis of income statement results. One investment in particular, based on its prior history of operating at profitability, caught my eye - Cvent, Inc. (CVT).When I looked further into CVT I found a company with a great balance sheet including recent cash raises via an IPO and a secondary, a history of profitability inclusive of share based comp with obviously the full year 2013 results posting a net loss, improving cash flows, and that was serving a very needy market.This article will detail my analysis of CVT and make a recommendation for buying shares of the company. I think the company is fairly valued at this point but should continue to create value for shareholders with a mid to long-term time horizon. Shares should move steadily higher as results continue to reflect a healthy business and as the company can further entrench itself as the go to source for its industry.Cvent Planning and MarketingCVT is ""engaged in providing a cloud-based enterprise event management platform with solutions for both sides of the events and meetings value chain, event & meeting planners and hotels & venues (SOURCE: SA CVT Profile)"". CVT operates a cloud-based SAAS platform that acts as a watering hole for all parties involved in event planning, event executing, and event marketing. Imagine a quasi-social network but strictly for hotels/venues and event/meeting planners, a great place for the different parties to meet up, find out who's available, when they're available, and for how much. Believe it or not this is an incredibly valuable tool, and growing more valuable, that is filling a large gap in a big market. Prior to CVT's platform gaining traction in the size that it has the event planning and marketing life cycle was almost entirely handled with paper sources and paper based tools. What CVT's platform has done has made the overall life cycle more efficient, by way of that cheaper, and overall more effective.CVT's platform also allows the company to help market for both sides of the value chain and because of the method of delivery, SAAS/in-app/online delivery, the company can also provide analytics to customers on both sides. A huge amount of data can be captured as the event progresses through the life cycle stages because of the capabilities offered when executing the process via online sources thanks to advances in technology. Data in regards to engagement, overall satisfaction, delivery of goal, etc. can all be stored and studied in an effort to create larger returns on investments for customers. This positions CVT as a go to source for these type of needs and CVT's operations have reflected as much.OperationsWithout spending too much time on this you can see a few trends have been well established as the model has scaled up. What CVT has found out is that as its network has grown it has been able to control the variables surrounding investing into the network with greater clarity and effect. The actual model is really simple and at this stage can be explained pretty conveniently. CVT has found that the more inventory it can provide, the more ""shoppers"" it can attract - speaking here of the buy side or the demand side. As more demand has been attracted to the platform that has made the platform more attractive to the supply side. As both sides have grown this has created the need for a priority sorting mechanism, similar to paying a search engine for priority placement and search optimization, that has helped CVT sell premier ""memberships"" to its platform.Now, the growth in overall usage of the platform when combined with the capturing of the above noted data has helped CVT create more and more efficient and effective platforms that it auto updates for participants. As the platform has grown more effective, CVT notes this by pointing to its key metric growth which is outlined later in the article, so has the return on investment for both sides. How is CVT growing platform ROI? By having more and more participants be active on the platform. At this point CVT has a platform that is helping create its own organic growth (I can further evidence this later in the article by showing a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue as the platform is doing more with less), ""learning"" to be more efficient by collecting large amounts of data, showing verifiable, measurable increased levels of ROI for users, and allowing CVT to price premium memberships into the model. With the large amount of the total Event Planning and Marketing Ecosystem model remaining unchanged, outside of becoming more technologically based, the platform is growing more and more dialed in to the exact needs of the user base. All of this is contributing to the consistency of the financials that we'll discuss for the remainder of this article.The big takeaway from the model that is going to show to drive operations is that the model to this point is highly self-sustaining. With smaller and smaller amounts of spending, excluding share based comp, the company is able to drive substantially the same amount of revenue growth on a percentage basis but larger and larger amounts of absolute dollars Y/Y. Until this relationship changes you're going to want to own this.Quickly, I think it's worth taking a look at the operations that triggered my scanner:Revenue has progressively grown and recently crossed the $100 million mark. Traditionally CVT has scaled up expenses behind its modeled revenue growth in an effort to manage its accumulated deficit which sits just north of $20 million. This has done well to help the company avoid debt and has allowed its income statements to perform without pressure from financing vehicles. I think this is one of the most overlooked positives in finance. I'm almost always OK with debt being used to drive a scale-up but the ability to accomplish this without leverage pays huge dividends in the long run from an operational flexibility standpoint and from a profitability acceleration standpoint. Now with that in mind you'll see that every year since 2009 CVT has posted a positive operating income figure. What caused the ~$10 million drop from FY12-FY13? Small contributions from natural growth of expenses for scale-up but mostly share based comp. Share based comp has nothing to do with underlying operations by the way. It's also because of this share based comp, with a little help from the tax man, that CVT posted a net loss in 2013 which triggered my scanner. I mean just take a look at those net income figures and add back share based comp. What you see is a company that ex. share based comp would have ~$6 million in accumulated deficit and net margins that would have The Street considering this a diamond in the rough. I'm not saying that CVT hasn't received any of the attention that it's due because it does have a nice valuation and as I said in the introduction I think the past performances have been baked into the current share price but this is exactly the scenario I was looking for when running the scan in the first place only I wasn't expecting to find such a solid set of operations and such a consistent industry.Moving to more current data we see more of the same as it's been business as usual for CVT:Every single trend remains in place and growing like clockwork. This type of consistency is really hard to find in any industry which could lead to aggressive multiples being used to value the shares in the future. If this happens clearly this would be good for the share price.Revenue has continued to grow on the 1H and is on pace for yet another record year. You can see that with a ~33% drop in share based comp Y/Y for the 1H that operating expenses have come down to levels that more closely reflect the actual scale up expenses (which drive revenues, meaning that when share based comp skews the overall expense line too far the revenues which aren't driven by share based comp have a hard time of making of the extra expense gap) and that has led to a ~$3 million positive Y/Y swing in operating income. Again, the scanner did its job in finding an income statement that was artificially pressed down one year prior. Finally, CVT was able to post a ~$4.6 million positive swing in net income Y/Y which I think CVT should post ~$4 million in FY net income which would have it in trend with its best years since 2009.Should I be concerned that net income has fallen in the range of ~$4 million in the years that CVT has had a net income regardless of the overall top-line (indicating falling net margins)? I think the answer is no because I see the net income falling in a predictable print rage being more a factor of CVT's being able to manage the bottom line (ex. increases in share based comp) with predictability than anything else. As CVT has scaled up, prior to seeing the historical income statement, the best I could have asked for would have been to see the bottom line managed to breakeven. That's usually what I would consider a best case scenario for a growth stage company. Luckily for those who have been long CVT this company's ""breakeven"" happens to be ~$4 million. What this also shows investors is that as huge line items like G&A and S&M begin to slow as the line items reach full economies of scale (meaning shrink as a percentage of revenue) assuming share based comp isn't on the moon the net income line modeling for full years should start at ~$4 million. I really like the idea that CVT will be able to grow profitability in size and with speed if it decides to grow into any number of the next stages of growth rather than just plowing ahead to the next scale.Contributing to this expectation and furthering the idea of stability and consistency with CVT are the revenue segment breakouts provided by the company, overall metric performance as a percentage of revenue, and consistency in key metric growth:Revenue when broken down by segments has grown at exactly the same paces per segment Y/Y for each comparable period, this goes a long way into being able to model growth with accuracy and being able to meet guidance given. I think this has contributed to management's ability to manage the income statement to CVT's ""breakeven"" of ~$4 million. It's also important to note that the actual dollar growth of the segments from a percentage standpoint has been within 100 basis points of each over during the first two quarters of the year for both comparable periods.The one line item I don't like to see on this graphic is that gross profit has fallen 200 basis points Y/Y for the 1H as a percentage of revenue. Management has guided that this downtick is short term in nature and was caused by a one-time uptick in technology maintenance expense that was expensed as incurred to the cost of revenues line. Without this expense recurring the gross profit line should be back at 74% of revenue going forward. Even with the downtick in gross profit with a 700 basis point reduction in total operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, most of it coming from a reduction of G&A expenses - this is a clear example of what I noted above about growing into the current level of scale up and allowing economies of scale to take place, both the operating and net income lines made positive advances. To be clear I'm not saying CVT needs to take a break at this level of scale up and allow itself to close out the accumulated deficit in its entirely, mostly because the company has no debt worth mentioning, but that it could. That's the general bull thesis with CVT, that its history of operating excellence has allowed it flexibility and with flexibility comes variable control. I like to own both of those in my portfolio.Unfortunately CVT only updates key metrics in its 10-K's but as of full year 2013 key metric growth is excellent across the board and indicative of the health of the underlying business. Specifically, take a look at the tight range of Y/Y revenue percentage increase. What a marvelous display of control of operations by management.Cash FlowsFinally, and I just wanted to leave the graphic for viewing because I think the key metric graphic does a good job at showing the historic trend line, but the cash flow statement for the 1H is showing increased operational cash flow that's on pace for a record year. Even if you were to back out the cash flows provided by a reduction in Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets the 1H would have still shown an operating cash flow increase. I guess what I'm saying is that the build isn't coming from any padded line items or short term manipulations. This is a really impressive development:Where's the trade?CVT adds a level of diversity to my portfolio that I don't currently own. I own some hotels, my largest position is in La Quinta, but no event planning/marketing. I really like the CVT model, management's execution, the consistency of operations, and the fact that I think I can buy shares and never look at them again. Those are the types of diversity providers you want to own.One of the core principles that I operate my book by is Risk Fragmentation. I'm always looking for ways to fragment risk via diversification and via downward pressure on volatility. I mean the ideal portfolio would be one that goes up every day by the exact same amount of percentage points, right? We know this isn't possible but this should always be the goal. I like the idea that CVT can add to both for me and I'm longing shares into the weekend for an indefinite hold.I look forward to providing continuing coverage in the future. Good luck to all."

Cvent is out with news of a new lead scoring mechanism as a tool within its broader Hospitality Cloud - a platform I recently called a blend between a social network and a CRM. The new mechanism is aptly called Lead Scoring.Obviously bottom funnel focus has been a priority for any SMB or enterprise involved in any part of the sales ecosystem but this focus has come under an even more granular microscope as the combination of increased technology and slow GDP have magnified the importance of every customer win. With Cvent looking to establish itself as the Goliath, best of breed provider for its space - the event management space, if you will - of course this is an area it would like to have an effective and unique offering for. It appears with its Lead Scoring system it will have just that.Cvent now has a tool that will silo leads in its Hospitality Cloud into a scoring system that will give the hotelier a defined, measurable benchmark for prioritizing leads. The Lead Scoring system will take into account several moving, real-time variables that will slide the leads score in real-time as information changes. This is an incredibly defensive, retention driving announcment by Cvent and I believe an immediate reason to buy. I'll explain why.According to Cvent (and other third party data is readily available for this industry) hoteliers manage up to 15 million inbound lead per year. Lead management can become an extreme burden, and a costly one, because of the above noted constantly shifting variables on both the lead side and the hotel inventory side - things like meeting room availability, food and beverage spend, etc. Tracking the leads let alone scoring them is an endeavor that requires constant attention and with that constant overhead. Still, this tracking and spend doesn't guarantee success or accurate scoring.Cvent's system, however, will automate this process based on parameters set by the hotelier and it will provide a data trail that can be audited, analyzed for improvements, and used in general BI. This will allow the hotelier to migrate overhead and increase lead conversion. Obviously, that's good for the hotelier's bottom line.What's maybe most bullish about this announcement is that it further underlines the need for the hotelier to use the Hospitality Cloud as the foundation platform for the entire sales lifecycle of each location. Now Cvent has a clearly defined value-prop for even micro layers within the general sales spectrum - Lead Scoring is only as effective as the data within the broader CRM arm of the Hospitality Cloud. Of course this means if you're using any other platform you can't score leads which creates the defensiveness alluded to above. I believe this creates a considerable switching cost when trying to exit the Cvent platform and should increase retention levels for the company.Also consider that as Cvent can further increase its overall social network presence, the quasi-marketplace it hosts for event planners and venues to meet and create transactions, AND increases the amount of data each hotelier feeds into its CRM platform the data gathered from both and the analysis potential that provides creates other barriers to exit. Should a hotelier switch platforms, largely Cvent is the only industry-built platform available, it would lose the ability to use data from periods past to measure real-time strategies being deployed.Again, I'm more than optimistic that Cvent trades much, much higher in time despite not currently being rewarded for my holding.I continue to recommend a long position in Cvent.Good luck everybody."

Still, this is a big deal and will be going forward.Up until now Cvent has been trying to be the central platform that attracts venues (largely hotel) and event planners - think a social network for the two. Pairing the two parties and collecting a ""toll"" on the transactional traffic has been lucrative as stated above. But now, it appears, Cvent is looking to simply be the platform to be used for pairing the two parties even if it isn't the company doing the pairing itself. This, in the opinion of this author, will be even more lucrative longer term and much more defensible.I guess the best analogy I could make would be if Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), instead of trying to be the central social media attraction, decided it was best to provide the tools to launch a social media platform - to manage the actual facilitation of social media rather than being the meeting place itself. If that makes any sense.Cvent has borrowed a bit from the Facebook model and borrowed from the salesforce.com model. Cvent currently runs a substantially similar model to salesforce.com in that it facilitates the lead nurturing and/or counter party management of the venue/meeting planner ecosystem. Think CRM but supremely dialed-in for this niche. We've already outlined that Cvent also has a ""toll"" model in which it leverages a ""social network"" to create supply and demand of inventory. Between the two Cvent has created a blended model that is entirely unique to the space. A space that it absolutely owns.I think that Cvent is now the absolute ideal platform for both sides of the enterprise event management transaction and has now started down the road of optimizing what should eventually be the salesforce.com of its space. As we learn more about the platform Cvent is deploying, it's set to be launched in ""early 2016"", I'll update readers to the more granular findings but in the early going and early analysis how can you not be bulled up Cvent?Cvent, by way of acting as a salesforce.com-like platform and not exclusively as a transactional company - although it will still run a stand-alone transactional business as well, has now shortened its path to a much higher market cap. This strategic shift will allow it to scale up much quicker, with much less risk (read: less M&A risk, integration risk, etc.), and will allow it to be an even more important fixture in the event management process for the space. Mission critical some would say.Cvent has shown the ability to consistently drive revenues higher (growing at roughly a 30% pace T36M) on attractive ~70% gross margins. It's also been able to grow cash generated from operations at a healthy clip consistently. All of its key metrics T36M have healthy growth slope lines as well.This is a name that if you can be patient with should continue to increase in fundamental health over time. How quickly its market cap increases is a matter of market awareness but this story won't stay hidden for too much longer if you're asking me.I continue to recommend a long position in Cvent. I've been long since late-October 2014 and have captured minimal gains for my efforts but I get the feeling that will soon change.Good luck everybody."

CVT, however, lost money on Q1 '13 and estimates a bigger loss in Q2 '13, using the 'going IPO' excuse.ValuationGlossaryConclusionEven though recent financials are not that promising, investors want to buy subscription-based cloud companies on their IPO: buy CVT on the IPO.To put the conclusions and observations in context, the following is reorganized, edited, and summarized from the full S-1 referenced above:Q2 '13 lossThe net income decrease reflects an increase in general and administrative costs that were primarily related to increases in headcount for administrative operations necessary to prepare for an initial public offering and operate as a public company, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, foreign currency losses and acquisition costs.CVT expects general and administrative costs to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as CVT continue to expand operations, hire additional personnel and transition from being a private company to a public company.BusinessCVT is a leading cloud-based enterprise event management platform, providing solutions for both sides of the events and meetings value chain: (i) event and meeting planners, and (ii) hotels and venues.Event and meeting planner customers include enterprises such as corporations, associations, not-for-profits, government agencies and universities.These customers enter into annual and multi-year subscription contracts to utilize part or all of CVT's cloud-based software solutions to plan, manage and execute enterprise events and meetings including external events, such as conferences, tradeshows, and customer events, as well as internal events, such as sales meetings, training seminars and team-building events.As of December 31, 2012, CVT had more than 6,200 event and meeting planner customers. CVT's event and meeting planner customers used event management solutions to execute more than 139,000 events and meetings and managed 7.3 million registrations during the year ended December 31, 2012. CVT's generally recognize revenue from these contracts ratably over the term of the contract.Hotels and venuesOn the other side of the event value chain, hotels and venues utilize CVT's online marketing solutions to generate more visibility with ready-to-transact event and meeting planners.CVT's online marketplace, the Cvent Supplier Network, or CSN, connects tens of thousands of event and meeting planners seeking the best venue for their event with more than 200,000 venues in CVT's proprietary database.CVT believes that its CSN contains the world's largest, most accurate and searchable database of detailed meeting venue information with listings of hotels, conference centers, convention centers, resorts, restaurants, museums, country clubs, wineries, castles and other special event venues in more than 175 countries.Hotels and venues enter into annual and multi-year advertising contracts with CVT for marketing solutions that increase the prominence of their properties in CVT's CSN; CVT recognizes the revenue from these marketing solutions over the term of the agreement based on the estimated selling prices of each solution.As of December 31, 2012, CVT had more than 30,000 active CSN event and meeting planner users. The CSN is available with the same functionality to users of the paid subscription event and meeting platform solutions as well as to event and meeting planners that simply visit the CSN site and establish a free user account.Competition• existing manual, paper and spreadsheet-based systems that corporate personnel employ to organize events by themselves in a fragmented manner.

Listerine convinced the world they had bad breath and needed to solve it in the 1920's. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) convinced us all that we needed a tablet to go with our laptop and smart phone in 2010. And right now, Cvent (NYSE:CVT) is convincing businesses that they need a meeting management platform, and customers are flocking in droves, generating Cvent's current market cap of just over $1 billion. However, this valuation is actually about 24% down from its IPO in August of 2013, and when one looks further under the hood, it becomes hard to even justify this value.Business overviewCvent's product is a cloud-based software platform used to plan, organize, and optimize all of your company's sizeable events and meetings. Not necessarily the ""let's go down into the conference room and discuss these pages quick"" meetings, but aimed more towards conferences, trade shows, and other emporiums. These meetings do have a sizeable cost impact on a business, as pointed out on the 4Q earnings call:The incumbent competitor to Cvent in this industry is a hodge-podge of word processors, emails and basic services a conference venue may offer, forcing the end-user to stitch several workstreams together, hoping the attendee does not notice the lack of cohesion. Cvent's business model also highlights the significant opportunity for the customer to focus more on its attendees, providing targeted analytics attendees to woo them into coming back next year, and maybe to a couple more events as well. It supplements this core offering with venue/event marketing services and ticketing capabilities, targeting smaller venues that TicketMaster passes over.FinancialsCvent booked $31.4M of revenue in 1Q 2014, good for 29% growth from prior year, accompanied by a gross margin of 70.7%, a good sign after a worrisome downward trend over the course of 2013 (explained as relating to increased customer service headcount).(Source: Cvent 2013 10K, 1Q 2014 10Q)Cvent bucks the trend of high-flying tech companies by actually demonstrating profitability, a milestone that many cloud-based firms have difficulty reaching without deep cost cuts that tamper with top-line growth.(Source: Cvent 2013 10K)The decrease in EBITDA margin from 2012 to 2013 of 11.8 points is attributed by management to a shift towards investing in sales & marketing hiring in the back half of 2013, with continued investment planned to continue through 2014. This is to be expected, as it comes on the heels of its August 2013 IPO. Cvent does not have any clear competitors in the meeting management domain, and has a huge runway for expansion of its product's audience. Management has a strong grasp on its cost footprint and is able to play with the operating expenses to a large degree due to a strong cash position, with $202M of cash and short term investments sitting in the coffers. CEO Reggie Aggarwal actively acknowledges this, as from the 1Q earnings:ValuationSo lots of cash on the books, no debt, profitable, no strong competitors and a lot of room to expand (Cvent booked 91% of its revenue in the U.S.! There's a whole world out there conducting meetings like cavemen!)… What's not to love?With all this comes a very pricey valuation. Cvent currently has a market capitalization of just over $1 billion, and an enterprise value of $800M. That EV is ~7x 2013's revenue, and 137x last year's EBITDA! That is a serious premium!One can see some operational levers Cvent can pull, as it has demonstrated an ability to run its business previously with EBITDA margins around 25%, and management is committed to be at that margin level, or greater, over the long term. Cvent also grew its customer base by 15% from 2012 to 2013, with revenue growing almost double that rate, up 29% year-over-year. This is due to its successful ""land and expand"" strategy of increasing revenue with its existing customer base, a good quality to exhibit. Really, Cvent shows great growth across the bevy of metrics it judges itself on:(Source: Cvent 2013 10K)An even better indicator of the business's health is when one focuses on dollars associated with each meeting that is managed, on a per-meeting basis. Cvent does not release hard customer numbers, but one can use ""events and meetings arranged"" as a high-level proxy for customer-related metrics, such as acquisition costs and lifetime value.(Source: Cvent 2013 10K)As one can see above, acquisition costs for a new meeting are falling over time, down 37% from 2012 to 2013, and are dwarfed by the revenue stream one can expect over the lifetime value of a meeting, expecting to receive almost 6 times as much value from a customer is acquires (this is assuming 70% of sales & marketing spend goes towards new customer acquisition, and uses an estimated 5% annual churn as gleamed from recent earnings calls). Lastly, Cvent has a great backlog of revenue already sitting on the balance sheet, with $70M in deferred revenue booked as of 1Q 2014, equaling to about 2/3rds of the expected 2014 revenue alone.However, taking all this into account, it is almost impossible to justify its billion dollar valuation. I arrive somewhere in the $825M range, about a $20 per-share price, down from the current value of $25.16 (as of June 10th), and I wouldn't even say my model is particularly conservative. To arrive at my current valuation, my assumptions are:Below is a snapshot of the output, modeled on my assumptions stated above. You can download my full model here.(Source: Cvent 2013 10K, 1Q 2014 10Q, model linked above - figures in millions except per/share counts)To get in the realm of its current market capitalization, Cvent will need to:Compared to those who are long-term holders on Cvent, I believe our key differences on the target share price center around Cvent's ability to sustain revenue growth greater than 25% over the long term. I chalk my revenue bearishness on my expectation for competition to enter in the near future, and expect it to be fierce. As a completely anecdotal data point, the pairing of ""offline data"" and ""online data"" has become a recent point of interest for marketers, and Cvent's product is a very logical offering for an enterprise-focused company to enter into, such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The Wall Street shorts have also taken notice, with the ""short percentage of float"" at 13.3% (though, in Cvent's defense, this is not atypical to see with cloud-based companies currently, with many sitting in the double digits on this metric).The stock has already seen a strong pullback in its short-lived existence since its August IPO, down 24%. One can see the strong decline beginning in early March with its share price, where it diverged from the rest of its NASDAQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) brethren. I can't find a seminal event that may have instigated this sell-off, but investors may have grown weary of good-but-not-amazing revenue growth in a sector with a lot of room to run, and Cvent continuing to sit on a treasure chest of cash.(Source: Google Finance)ConclusionCvent has seemingly convinced the market that an event management service needs to be in every CMO's toolkit, and are reaping the rewards for ingenuity. Cvent appears to be a well-oiled machine with great operations, demonstrated profitability, a ton of cash and no debt, providing ample room to invest and acquire. However, a $1 billion market capitalization is tough to wrap one's head around with its current financials. I would advise to wait for an even deeper pullback and continued demonstration of growth and margin expansion, as there is a great deal more downside than upside with this firm.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1628622,25120,2013-08-12T10:53:46-04:00,,"Cvent (NYSE:CVT) made its public debut on Friday, August the 9th. Shares of the cloud-based enterprise event management platform, ended their first day with gains of 56.8% at $32.92 per share.As investors in today's public offering market bid up shares of all companies which engage in ""cloud"" activities, the current valuation has become too expensive to me.The Public OfferingCvent has a mission to transform the events and meetings industry. With its cloud-based software platform it will disrupt the traditional planning system, creating more value for event planners. The cloud-based solutions address the entire lifecycle of the event, from agenda to venues. Event planners have access to a proprietary database of hotel and venue information, accessible online.Cvent sold 5.6 million shares for $21 apiece, thereby raising $118 million in gross proceeds. All shares will be sold by the company with no shares being offered by selling shareholders.The public offering values the equity of the firm at $813 million. The offering took place above the high end of the preliminary $17-$19 offer range.Some 14% of the total shares were offered in the public offering. At Friday's closing price of $32.92 per share, the firm is valued around $1.27 billion.The major banks that brought the company public were Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Stifel, Pacific Crest Securities and Needham & Company.ValuationWith it solutions, Cvent creates value for both event and meeting planners by making their lives a lot easier. Cvent makes it easier for hotels and other venues to advertise their capabilities to organize and host meetings or events.At the end of 2012, Cvent had some 6,200 event and meeting customers. In total some 7.3 million people subscribed for some 139,000 events through 2012 which were facilitated by the company.According to research company Frost & Sullivan, the events and meetings industry, totaled some $5.6 billion over the past year. This is according to a section within Cvent's S1-Filing. The traditional market for non-software event and meeting management was $22 billion, which Cvent hopes to make much more efficient with is proprietary platform.Key customers of Cvent include large companies like Visa (NYSE:V), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Hyatt Hotels (NYSE:H), among others.For the year 2012, Cvent generated annual revenues of $83.5 million, up 37.2% on the year before. Net income totaled $4.3 million compared to a $0.2 million loss in 2011.First quarter revenues were up by 33.5% to $24.4 million. Net income fell from $0.9 million to $0.3 million.Cvent operates with $40.9 million in cash and equivalents. The company operates without the assumption of debt, or preferred stock investments. Factoring in the $118 million in gross proceeds from the public offering and the company will operate with a net cash position of almost $150 million.As such operating assets of the firm are valued around $1.12 billion. This values the operations of Cvent at 13.4 times annual revenues and an incredible 260 times annual earnings.Investment ThesisAs noted above, the offering of Cvent has been a huge success. Shares were offered above the high end of the preliminary offering range. On top of that came opening day returns of almost 57%. At Friday's close, shares are trading some 83% above the midpoint of the preliminary offering range.Cvent generates some 70% of its total revenues from its platform solutions, through licenses generated from planner customers. Some 30% of revenues are generated through marketing solutions, predominantly as hotels and other venues advertise to end up high on the search list of CVT's online market place. The market place hosts some 200,000 venues at the moment across 175 countries.The company, which has been founded back in 1999, has shown steady growth in recent yeas. Yet there are some risks to Cvent's operations. This includes the lack of current profitability, the vulnerability to a deterioration of general economic conditions, technological changes, and the fact that over half of its employees are based in India.I remain a bit skeptic. Cvent guides for second quarter revenues of $26.7-$26.9 million, implying revenues will be up 35-36% compared to last year. Net losses are expected to come in between $2.0 and $2.5 million as the company is preparing for its public offering. At this pace full year revenues of $110-$120 million are possible, while the company will most likely roughly break-even. After the successful debut, shares are way too expensive on sales multiples, even accounting for 35% growth in revenues.I remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Of that amount, Frost & Sullivan estimated that the global event management software market was $5.6 billion in 2012, which we view as an immediately addressable opportunity.

2983456,48411,2015-03-09T00:10:30-04:00,"CVT put on an impressive performance at the Pacific Crest Emerging Technology Summit.This should go a long way into adding analyst coverage, something that should help increase CVT's liquidity and pricing.CVT CEO Reggie Aggarwal also detailed with confidence the competitive landscape and the long-term plans of the company.I remain bullish CVT.","Cvent, Inc. (NYSE:CVT) put on an excellent showing at the Pacific Crest Emerging Technology Summit just a few days ago. The Summit gave CVT an opportunity to talk candidly with an analyst community that still doesn't cover this name in size:I believe that its presentation and the clarity with which it provided answers to the two largest outstanding and generally misunderstood questions about the company should bring new analyst coverage, upgrades and price target increases prior to Q1/15 earnings. CVT shares have risen 15.2% since initiating coverage in late October:The first question CVT addressed was the question of competition:CVT CEO Reggie Aggarwal detailed how the real competitive advantage that CVT has is that it was a first mover in the space. The CVT platform integration into the daily activities at the hotels (and with the meeting planner community) is the real barrier to entry in that hotels and planners aren't going to learn multiple platforms. This was equated to how it wouldn't make sense for other businesses to learn multiple CRM platforms, which to me was pointed, calculated and made perfect sense to the crowd that Aggarwal was speaking to.Aggarwal went on to detail that hotels, which are fighting for these meetings and event dollars like their top-lines depend on them (meeting and event revenues generally comprise ~33% of total revenues at hotels), are actively referring meeting planners to CVT. Why are they doing this? Several reasons:Even with the potential of introducing the lead to other hotel competition, which is also being promoted via the CVT platform, the fact that the leads have such a higher close rate and rate of being higher in profitability continues to allow the hotel to justify the risk. CVT finds these reasons to be a major differentiator and a major reason that market share will continue to be aggregated. CVT management is convinced this is a space that only one or two participants can be successful in and expressed their confidence in CVT.The second question was what the CVT model down the road eventually looks like. This was something that hadn't been discussed by CVT prior as the company has been in such a high growth mode with so many moving pieces still in development:Aggarwal detailed that he believes eventually CVT could be the default platform that becomes mandated by hotels for event planners, even ones coming from strictly niche avenues. Again, this is the first I've heard of this and I've covered this name since its IPO.The idea that CVT is working to eventually position itself to be the Google/Salesforce.com of meeting and event planning is one that actually isn't that far-fetched if you believe management in that only a few major players will be successful in the space. If CVT management is right and this is eventually what CVT can become, and it has recently been aggressive in contributing to this longer term picture with acquisitions, that would essentially turn anybody not named the single other major player in the space into a quasi-roll-up acquisition to CVT. Quasi-roll-up acquisitions that pass through revenues to CVT in the course of doing daily business. That's a bull case for a longer picture that I want to own.I think CVT management made a big impression on the analyst community at the Pacific Crest Emerging Technology Summit and that this confident and clear display will soon pay dividends. I remain long CVT and remain bullish the longer term story."

Regardless, CyberArk's improved capabilities in the IAM space will drive sustainable growth in the long term. Alongside Okta (OKTA), CyberArk has positioned itself as one of the top players with the resources to acquire market share in the IAM space. I expect revenue growth to rebound in 2021. The expense headwinds to CyberArk's margins from the acquisition of Idaptive is also expected to improve. I will be reiterating my bullish outlook as I find the current valuation attractive.Source: Gulf BusinessThe importance of privileged access management solutions is critical towards designing a robust security strategy across enterprises. CyberArk has acquired the right on-prem and cloud security capabilities to continue to dominate beyond the PAM space. Cloud security products like Alero, Privilege Cloud, and the SaaS deployment option of EPM (endpoint privilege management) and AAM (application access manager) will help enterprises migrating more workloads to the cloud. The recent acquisition of Idaptive extends CyberArk’s security capabilities into the identity management space. This will ensure CyberArk positions itself as one of the top vendors offering the best of breed platform that keys into the future of security, which is about Zero Trust (least privilege).The mix shift of renewals and new deals towards SaaS deployments will continue to impact revenue growth. The advantage of this shift is the sticky, recurring, and predictable nature of SaaS deals. CyberArk provided Q3 '20 guidance of $107-$115m, which represented a growth of approx. 3% at the midpoint. The market's unwillingness to gaze beyond the temporary headwinds to revenue growth has impacted CyberArk's momentum in recent quarters. Going forward, investors with the patience to stomach the volatility that comes with the shift to cloud bookings will find CyberArk attractive. This assumes CyberArk will maintain its leadership in the access management space by ramping its pace of innovation.CyberArk is expanding the capabilities of its platform to position itself for the future. Besides the growing demand for its SaaS solutions, Idaptive will significantly improve CYBR's positioning in the expanding IAM space. Idaptive was created from the divestiture of Centrify. Idaptive brings capabilities in AI-powered SSO, MFA, lifecycle management, and endpoint management. The added capabilities from Idaptive will help position CyberArk as a modern identity platform. This positioning is important as more customers migrate workloads to cloud platforms. Given that Idaptive is a SaaS platform, it will add to CyberArk’s recurring revenue.Compliance and governance licensing deals are still deployed on-prem. However, the natural trend as CyberArk expands its capabilities in the mid-market is geared towards the adoption of its SaaS solutions. This means gross margin will be temporarily impacted due to growing cloud hosting costs. Sales incentives have also been geared towards selling more SaaS deals. CyberArk has plans to expand its sales capacity to drive more growth in light of its added capabilities. This is expected to impact its operating margin going forward. Due to COVID-19 and the mix shift towards smaller SaaS bookings, billings and cash collection growth might be volatile. This will be temporary as cross-sell and usage expansion drive the average deal size and revenue growth heading into 2021. This explains analysts' growth expectations of 6.5% in 2020 and 18% in 2021.CyberArk is cash flow positive, and its recent debt issuance strengthens its balance sheet. Heading into the last quarter of the year, the major concern will be industry consolidation and competition.Source(s): Forrester, GartnerThe trend in the cybersecurity space points towards the consolidation of some security segments. The access management segment is broken into identity governance, privilege access management, and access management segments. Players in the AM space are acquiring capabilities beyond their niche to broaden their scope. This weakens the positioning of niche players. Going forward, there will be more consolidation as market participants rush to build robust identity management platforms. CyberArk continues to observe favorable competitive displacements, which is reassuring.CyberArk has diversified valuation factors. The weakness of its growth factor will be temporary due to the growing volume of SaaS deals. CYBR is profitable (non-GAAP) and cash-flow positive. Its valuation isn’t too frothy. It is acquiring new optionalities in access management to drive growth. In addition to these, CYBR recently extended the capabilities of its remote users solution (Alero) to mobile devices. This helped secure six new patents to protect its competitive positioning in the PAM space.Data by YChartsOverall, CyberArk has strengthened its competitive moat. To drive multiples expansion, it needs to cross-sell its acquired capabilities from Idaptive. Accelerating growth won't be hard given CyberArk's strong presence in the PAM space.Demand-side risk factors are favorable in the long term. CyberArk has sufficient cloud security capabilities to navigate the identity as a service (IDaaS) space. Margins are expected to contract in the short term. This might impact its EPS factor if revenue growth isn't above expectations. Lastly, competitive pressure will be a major concern as cybersecurity companies race to build a leading Zero Trust platform.CyberArk has improved its positioning and growth options via the acquisition of Idaptive. The trend towards more SaaS bookings is only a temporary headwind to revenue growth. CyebrArk has the facilities to manage the SaaS transition. I expect CYBR's valuation to rebound heading into 2021."
4364558,22148,2020-08-05T05:45:23-04:00,"CyberArk easily beat Q2 analyst estimates, but the company disappointed the market with guidance.The cybersecurity company continues to invest in future growth, while revenues face major headwinds.The SaaS security provider remains one of the few tech stocks trading at an EV/S of only 7.4x.","Following a solid quarter, CyberArk (CYBR) traded down nearly 7% to close at $112. The market continues to favor tech stocks growing during the virus shutdown, and the cybersecurity specialist hasn't been able to deliver that growth. Regardless, my investment thesis remains bullish as CyberArk continues to shift towards subscription services impacting revenue recognition at the exact time that COVID-19 has negatively skewed results.CyberArk moving to subscription services should be the highlight of the earnings call. The company highlighted deferred revenues jumping 30% in the quarter to $226 million, providing a strong funnel of future revenue growth.(Source: CyberArk Q2'20 presentation)The deferred revenue growth rate was only 27% in 2019, suggesting an acceleration in SaaS solutions and recurring license sales that the market will eventually reward the stock with a much higher price. In fact, recurring license revenue was a strong point, with quarterly revenues of $12.0 million, up from only $2.5 million last Q2. Unfortunately, CFO Josh Siegel was clear that the shift to subscriptions bookings provided a strong revenue headwind:For Q2, CyberArk reported revenues grew 6.3% to $106.5 million. The additional $9 million in revenues would've placed the quarterly revenues at ~$115.5 million for over 15% growth.Not too surprising, the market was disappointed with Q3 guidance due expectations that headline Twitter (TWTR) security attacks of privileged accounts would drive strong demand. While revenues of $111 million were solidly within analyst estimates, earnings estimates of only $0.26 were far below previous expectations.Regardless of some of the disappointment of not seeing the immediate financial benefits of the headline-leading hack like that on Twitter, the CFO highlighted strong momentum in the business:With all of the noise in the revenue line due to COVID-19 impacts and the shift to subscription revenues, investors should mostly ignore the bottom line metrics. CyberArk wisely continues to spend on R&D and S&M to expand SaaS services, and the addition of Idaptive led to a 2-percentage point hit to margins.As an example, the company spent 34% more on R&D in the quarter at $19.5 million. In order to compete for a global customer base and meet growing cybersecurity demands, CyberArk needs to aggressively invest in new technology.The cybersecurity company still generated $17 million in Q2 profits and forecasts up to $15 million in Q3 profits. Investing in the future while still generating solid profits is a solid position for a corporation, but the market doesn't always reward stocks on these initial transitions.While other tech stocks are trading at crazy EV/S multiple of 20x or more, CyberArk is now far cheaper than pre-virus multiples. The stock now trades at only 7.4x forward sales targets. Cloud cybersecurity stocks just don't trade much cheaper these days.Data by YChartsThe company even has a large cash balance of $1.1 billion. Once subtracting out the $485 million in convertible notes, the net cash balance is $0.6 billion.CyberArk is in a solid position to beat some reduced analyst estimates where analysts were up above $600 million in 2021 sales. The privileged account management specialist appears to have the position where the company will easily beat revenue estimates as the market normalizes and subscription services turn into a tailwind.The key investor takeaway is that the stock remains one of the few tech plays worthy of buying here. CyberArk continues to trade below pre-virus levels, due in part to a business model conversion in the middle of a virus-impacted quarter causing extra investor consternation.The recommendation is for investors to just use the weakness to buy a leading cybersecurity stock."
4372239,24361,2020-09-02T19:57:19-04:00,"CyberArk beat a lowered bar in the second quarter, with notably better operating margins and billings growth.The use case for Privileged Access Management is getting stronger as enterprises adopt Zero Trust architectures, and CyberArk remains the clear leader in PAM.CyberArk hardly trades at bargain multiples, but secular growth stories don't often get exceptionally cheap, and the long-term opportunity is appealing.","It’s a rough world out there, and companies are increasingly responding to IT threats with a “Zero Trust” approach that doesn’t rely upon location to establish access. That’s good news for a host of companies, including CyberArk (CYBR), Okta (OKTA), and Microsoft (MSFT), and I like CyberArk’s decision to embrace SaaS in a bigger way, as well as buy its way into Identity Management as a complement to its Privileged Access Management core.While I’ve long liked CyberArk, I’ve had issues with the valuation. When I last wrote about the company in June of 2019, I thought the valuation was “stretched”, and the shares have since fallen about 12% - significantly underperforming not only the NASDAQ, but both large security companies (Check Point (CHKP) and Palo Alto (PANW)) and small (Okta and Zscaler (ZS)). Even with concerns about COVID-19, the move toward SaaS, and competition, CyberArk still isn’t exactly cheap, but it’s at least cheap enough to be worth consideration.While CyberArk did beat expectations in the second quarter, it’s worth remembering that expectations have definitely come down this year (acceleration of the SaaS model, which hurts short-term reported revenue, COVID-19, and Idaptive’s impact on margins), and that management has a pattern of setting beatable bars with quarterly guidance. Even so, a 5% beat on revenue, with an 8% beat on license revenue, a 43% beat on operating income (over four points on margin), and a strong beat on billings are all positive relative to the alternatives.Revenue rose 6% year over year in the quarter and was basically flat with the March quarter. License revenue declined 8% yoy and 7% qoq, hurt by both the SaaS transition and weaker new customer adds tied to COVID-19 (and, perhaps, competitors making inroads). Maintenance revenue rose about 22%.Gross margin declined 230bp yoy and 140bp qoq, while operating income fell 36% yoy and 21% qoq, with operating margins down 1,050bp yoy and 430bp qoq. Margins were hurt at least in part by the revenue transition, as well as the Idaptive deal.With the switch toward a more SaaS-based model, billings are growing in importance. Billings rose 18% this quarter (against a Street expectation of a 2% decline) and declined 4% qoq, while deferred revenue rose 30% yoy and 7% qoq.Given the difference in accounting between SaaS business models and perpetual licenses, CyberArk’s move to accelerate SaaS has come at the cost of meaningful revenue headwinds – faster than expected progress in the transition created about $9 million of revenue headwinds this quarter, with SaaS plus Term now at 25% of revenue after really only three quarters of concerted effort.Recognizing that at least some enterprise customers in its core PAM market like perpetual licenses, they’re maintaining that option, but the core PAM offering for mid-market customers is SaaS and newer products like Alero and Endpoint Privilege Manager (and future new products) are SaaS-based.CyberArk is also going to take a margin hit from the decision to acquire Idaptive and invest R&D resources in the business. CyberArk acquired Idaptive earlier this year for $70 million, marking its first sizable acquisition since Conjur in 2017, and bought its way into the Identity Management space where Idaptive competes with companies like Okta and Microsoft with an Identity-as-a-Service offering.Idaptive is a small player (around $16M to $18M in ARR) in an addressable market worth approximately $7B, and I don’t believe CyberArk really intends to go head to head with Okta, or at least not right away. With the move toward Zero Trust architectures, there’s a growing convergence between offerings like Privileged Access Management and Identity Management, and it makes sense to me for CyberArk to broaden its capabilities in view of that convergence. Still, investing in the Idaptive platform is going to come with literal costs, and that has negative near-term implications for margins.Nothing I’ve seen lately has meaningfully altered my enthusiasm for CyberArk’s core market and product portfolio. Security remains a very high priority with corporate CIOs, and third-party CIO surveys have likewise indicated that Identity/Access Management and Privileged Access Management remain high priorities for spending – which makes a lot of sense in the context of similar surveys that indicate that the large majority of enterprises who aren’t operating Zero Trust architectures are intending to deploy/build them within the next two or three years.Sure, CyberArk faces competition, and I’m sure I’ll hear in the comments again about this or that small player who is going to “destroy” CyberArk; I’ve been hearing those comments for several years now, and last I checked, CyberArk is far from destroyed. And it certainly doesn’t help the bear argument that CyberArk’s license revenue shifted more towards existing customers signing up for add-on products (around 75%) than the typical norm (around 60%). Still, I think that dynamic had a lot more to do with the restraints created by COVID-19 in terms of sales and marketing efforts, and I believe new customer growth will re-accelerate as the COVID-19 burdens ease over the next year or so (hopefully…).Although COVID-19 and the conversion toward SaaS both disrupted my model on a short-term basis, not much has otherwise changed (2019 revenue and adjusted FCF were both about 5% ahead of my expectations), and I’m still looking for long-term revenue growth in the mid-teens, with improving scale eventually driving adjusted FCF margin into the 20%’s, which in turn should drive high-teens long-term annualized adjusted FCF growth.CyberArk still isn’t exactly cheap. I do believe the shares are priced for a high single-digit to low double-digit annualized return on the basis of discounted cash flow, while I think the company’s growth and margins merit a forward revenue multiple of around 8x. While the shares have absolutely lagged over the past year or so, I’m tempted to buy in – no, the valuation isn’t great, but you don’t often get a great buy-in price for good secular growth stories. CyberArk would definitely be vulnerable to a broader correction in tech, but with the shares having already underperformed, perhaps they’d be less vulnerable. In any case, while this is a borderline call, it’s a company I’ve liked for a long time and am tempted to buy relatively soon."
4369640,105757,2020-08-19T05:33:38-04:00,"CyberArk reported a solid quarter, but guidance was mixed. Management reiterated its confidence in CyberArk’s business prospects and market opportunity.Identity and the Privilege Access Management (PAM) are now at the top of CIO/CISO spending priorities. CyberArk stops the use of stolen credentials from accessing critical systems.When a breach occurs, CyberArk is usually the 2nd phone call made, while breach remediation companies such as Mandiant are the first, indicating the essential nature of CyberArk’s products.Valuation remains reasonable, especially when you consider that CyberArk is known for solid execution, including increasing the mix of subscription revenue, which provides revenue visibility.CyberArk is down about 10% after results, and the stock is down about 6% YTD. CyberArk has the best PAM solution in the market. Therefore, we would buy shares on weakness.","CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) reported solid results two weeks ago, but the stock has declined by about 11% since the report. CyberArk reported solid revenue with a beat of $5.3 million, or about 5% ahead of estimates, and an EPS beat of $0.15. Billings came in at $121.6 million, up 18% Y/Y, beating the consensus estimate of $105.4 million by about 15%. CyberArk guided F3Q revenue in the range of $107-115 million versus prior consensus of $111.4 million and EPS of $0.19-0.33, which was below consensus of $0.38. Given our confidence in CyberArk’s criticality within the security industry, best of breed products, ability to execute on its product roadmap and sales, we remain a buy.Combined with a decline in gross margin and increasing opex, the guidance seemed worse than it is. Revenue headwind due to the increasing mix of subscription revenue is affecting gross margins, operating margins, and EPS. During F2Q, subscription sales impacted revenue by about $9 million. In our opinion, the growing mix of subscription sales is a good thing, given that it improves visibility into the pipeline going forward. According to CyberArk CEO Udi Mokady, when a breach occurs, the company is usually the 2nd phone call, while breach remediation companies such as Mandiant are the first. Customers want to secure their critical systems following a breach, and this is where CyberArk comes in, implying the company’s crucial position in the security landscape. The company has a history of setting estimates that are conservative and beating them. We believe estimates are conservative, and a repeat beat is highly likely. The selloff since the report provides investors a great buying opportunity, in our view. Therefore, we would recommend investors take a long position in the name.The company was undoubtedly bullish on CyberArk’s prospects going forward. CyberArk noted that its pipeline is at record levels despite challenging economic times. The company noted the best-ever SaaS quarter and record pipelines for both new and existing customers. Recurring license revenue in the quarter contributed about 25% of license revenue, up from 5% a year ago. Customers continue to buy products outside the core PAM, such as Application Access Manager (AAM), Alero, and Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM).CEO Udi Mokady noted, “existing customers are increasingly turning to CyberArk as a trusted advisor to strengthen their security posture, given the heightened threat environment.” CFO Josh Siegel noted that “add-on business represented over 75% of license revenue”, which we believe is an indicator of the company’s success with existing customers. We expect revenue from existing customers to drive growth for the company, and the acceleration of SaaS revenue to provide greater visibility into future revenue opportunities. CyberArk remains the best solution for PAM as attested by multiple third-party analyst firms such as Gartner and Forrester.During F2Q20, gross margin declined 220 bps sequentially, impacting both operating margin and EPS. Gross margins were negatively affected by the increasing mix of SaaS revenue and decline in Average Selling Price (ASP). The SaaS bookings created a revenue headwind of about $9 million during the quarter. Many companies are cautious in spending due to the challenging macro environment, leading to a lower ASP. As we had anticipated in our note published previously on SA, CyberArk issued F3Q EPS guidance lower than the consensus, citing an increasing mix of subscriptions and increasing investments. CyberArk is accelerating investments into both R&D and SG&A following its acquisition of Idaptive. The company also noted that gaining new customers has been little challenging given the economic environment. During 2Q, the company acquired 170 new logos, up from 160 logos sequentially.In our opinion, while the near-term impact on gross margins is real, the increasing mix of SaaS is a good thing over the longer term, given that SaaS revenue increases visibility into revenue, given recurring nature of the SaaS model. Besides, gross margins will expand over time as scale improves as more customers sign up for SaaS offerings. We believe CyberArk’s investments are paying off, as we expect it to launch Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) based on Idaptive acquisition across all its products later this year. We also believe that investing in Idaptive will likely pay off many times over, as the company bundles Identity offerings (Single Sign-On) with its core PAM solutions. We also expect CyberArk to launch additional standalone products to supplement its core PAM solutions, providing new streams of revenue.Since it reported results on August 4th, CyberArk is down about 10%. Over the last 12 months, the stock has significantly underperformed both the S&P and Nasdaq indices. While Nasdaq is up about 42% and S&P is up 17%, CyberArk is down about 6%. The company is also down 25% from the previous high of about $145. The following chart illustrates CYBR’s underperformance relative to the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices.Source: Ycharts dataAll this underperformance has come while beating estimates consistently, quarter after quarter. The company beat revenue and EPS 14 consecutive quarters with an average revenue beat of 5% and an average EPS beat of about 36%, as the following chart illustrates.Source: Author from Thomson Reuters DataCyberArk currently trades at 6.2x EV/C2022 sales versus the peer group average of 8.3x, while growing 14% versus 19% for the peer group. This revenue underperformance can easily be attributed to an increasing mix of subscription revenue. Due to COVID-19, many customers are opting for subscriptions, even when the software is installed on-prem. During F2Q, subscriptions created a $9 million headwind to revenue. This increasing mix of subscriptions skews the revenue growth metric. The following chart illustrates CyberArk's valuation relative to the security peer group.Source: Author based on Thomson Reuters DataTypically, we don’t use EV/sales for profitable companies. Still, in the case of CyberArk and other small and mid-cap tech companies, EV/Sales is an excellent metric to view how a potential acquirer looks at the valuation. We consider all mid-cap tech companies as acquisition candidates. Since many companies in the tech peer group are not profitable and many do not generate operating cash flow consistently, EV/Sales is a useful metric for valuation. Hence, it makes sense to have a common framework to view them for valuation work, and EV/Sales is one of the best metrics to evaluate all mid-cap technology growth companies.CyberArk’s business model is changing due to the acquisition of several assets that are sold on a subscription basis such as EPM, AAM, Alero, and Idaptive. Given that the mix of subscription and perpetual revenue can change quarter-to-quarter, revenue, EPS, gross margins, and operating margins can vary significantly. Due to the variation, if operating metrics fall below consensus estimates, it could trigger a stock sell-off.Since the majority of CyberArk’s revenue is derived from the perpetual license model, the risk of deal slippage is high due to the back-end loaded nature of the business. A majority of revenue closes during the last two weeks of the quarter. In the event of deal slippage, revenue could miss consensus expectations, leading to a stock sell-off.For a more detailed look at the risks in owning CyberArk, please refer to our prior work on SA.Since we recommended the stock on June 24th, 2020, the stock is up about 12%, while S&P is up about 11%. Barring a major shock to the economy, we expect the sentiment on the stock to improve as the quarter progresses and into next year. We expect the mix of subscription revenue to increase for the remainder of the year. Given the estimates are reasonable and the company already guided EPS down, we expect the company to beat estimates when it reports results in November. Since the Street estimates have been appropriately reset, the magnitude of an estimate reset is less than last quarter. With 2020 being an election year, many of our security industry contacts indicate a higher threat environment. Many enterprises noted that they are bracing for more attacks from hackers. These enterprises are proactively securing their critical systems by securing their privilege credentials ahead of the upcoming election. Given our confidence in the CyberArk story and its position within the security landscape, we would be buying shares opportunistically."
4328301,22148,2020-02-28T14:06:37-05:00,CyberArk is down $40 from the all-time highs.The cybersecurity company should generate consistent revenue growth approaching 20%.The stock is priced at a reasonable 6x forward EV/S targets.,"Over two years ago, CyberArk (CYBR) was a pick to buy on dips below the then current price of $45. Within about 20 months, the cybersecurity stock soared from a low of $40 to nearly $150. After this dip, the stock doesn't have the same cheap value as the lows in 2017, but CyberArk isn't expensive at $110 after the market selloff. A big part of why CyberArk rallied in 2018 and early 2019 was the accelerating growth. The company turned in four consecutive quarters of growth in excess of 30%. The stock sank following disappointing Q1 guidance, with both revenues and earnings below consensus estimates. The company forecast robust full year revenues, but CyberArk is forecasting higher spending possibly in order to push the revenues higher for the year. The general analyst view is a company returning to more consistent revenue growth in the 17% range. CyberArk forecast 2020 revenues growing nearly 19% to $515 million, so analysts are generally forecasting slight deceleration in out years. Source: Seeking Alpha earnings estimatesThe best part of the CyberArk story is this combination of strong revenue growth and substantial profits. The cybersecurity industry and tech stocks in general were infiltrated by so many companies unable to generate profits, making this stock more attractive. The cybersecurity sector is only becoming more compelling with hackers in places such as China, Korea and Russia growing. An estimated $600 billion is lost annually to cybercrime, and the attacks are only growing more sophisticated with a prime focus of damage occurring with the leverage from gaining privileged access to an organization. CyberArk has a net cash balance of over $600 million after adding $142 million in cash from operations last year. With a market valuation of only $4.2 billion, the company has an enterprise value of just $3.6 billion. One of the best ways to make sizable gains is to find a cheap stock with the potential for multiple expansion - especially if one can find a stock such as CyberArk with consistent 20% revenue growth with the potential for stock gains via multiple expansion. My reason for picking the cybersecurity stock in the past was the cheap valuation of trading around 4x EV/S multiples back in 2017. The stock reached a peak multiple approaching 10x EV/S targets back in 2019 with the recent dip pushing the EV/S multiple down to 5.9x. Other cybersecurity stocks such as Proofpoint (PFPT) and Rapid7 (RPD) trade at slightly lower EV/S targets, but the sector trades in a similar value level for in demand software companies. Data by YChartsIn essence, investors buying CyberArk back in 2017 participated in a market willing to pay 50% more for each dollar of revenue the company generates now. All of this is on top of a company generating over 30% growth in 2018 and 26% growth in 2019. The company has limited revenues in Asia Pacific so investors shouldn't expect any major Q1 warning related directly to customer impacts from the coronavirus. For Q4, the sector only accounted for $12.6 million worth of quarterly revenues of $129.7 million. The biggest risk here is U.S. or European customers delaying purchase decisions while researching the impact to their business from the shutdown of operations in China or the reduction in product manufacturing during the quarter. The key investor takeaway is that CyberArk offers a decent value here at $110. Investors missed a large move the last couple of years and any further dip due to the coronavirus outbreak would provide a great entry point.Remember that companies tend to delay investment decisions around new applications such as cybersecurity when disruption exists in the marketplace. One shouldn't be too surprised with a warning from the company followed by a quick rebound as China returns to their hacking ways and the demand for cybersecurity remains high."
4337618,76115,2020-04-14T22:01:41-04:00,"CyberArk dropped after earnings, but dropped another 27% after the broad market priced in the coronavirus impact.Cybersecurity is not discretionary spending, it is needed and required - these budgets won't see cuts.The stock remains in the doldrums as analysts and the market expect terrible updates to guidance in a month.The stock will regain a footing; under $85 is a good buying opportunity.","CyberArk (CYBR) is a stock I've been following during the coronavirus story and have continued to look at thinking, ""There's no way it can be this cheap this long."" CyberArk was hit twice - first by its earnings in February and then by the pandemic outbreak in late February and most of March. But the market has CyberArk entirely and utterly wrong.The company does not sell discretionary products - quite the contrary, in fact. It sells products needed - required - for times like this when most of the nation and world are working from home. This massive stock decline since February is nothing but a buying opportunity better than many of the other stocks I have been following and letting my Tech Cache subscribers know about.(Source: AiThority.com)The earnings reaction was pretty typical for the stock, as management nine times out of ten guides very, very conservatively. So much so, you'd think the company was not in any shape to grow revenue more than a few percentage points. But come earnings, it blows out the numbers and lands where I typically estimate.But the coronavirus impact is the focus as the earnings drop was roughly 15%, whereas the coronavirus impact has now mounted to 27% - that's after the earnings drop. The 15% drop was expected from a technical chart perspective, but what has interested me is the market's claim that CyberArk should be worth over 27% less because of the economic impact on the US and other countries from containing the virus.But I don't think the market knows something I don't.From a technology perspective, security software, both in the cloud and on-prem (meaning it resides on the site of the customer), is not discretionary spending; it has become necessary and, I say, required. If you're big enough to have a cloud or server budget, you're big enough to be a target for network intruders. Now bring forth the remote work and play transition over the last several weeks, and there are many reasons to have security at the forefront. I've worked with CIOs to know it's essential, and a very recent Instinet survey confirms my thinking remains true.That higher priority was considered in the middle of March - as things started to get worse. The shift in priorities wasn't away from security and cloud. With hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of employees working from the comfort of their homes, it means companies don't have direct, physical control over their employees' behaviors. Companies must rely on technical solutions to prevent unintentional network intrusions. This means buying solutions for the first time or buying more of the solutions they already have.From CyberArk's perspective, sure, selling to customers is a little more difficult when you can't come on-site and show in-house demos or proof of concepts. Perhaps support is more difficult when engineers can't look over the client's shoulder. But as we all have adapted in the technology working world, remote work continues to drive businesses forward. For me, my contract continues to operate at 100%, and I continue to move forward on my tasked projects as if I were at the office. This includes integrating new solutions from third-party vendors I was in the process of before directives to stay at home came down the line. Those vendors continue to support and work with me virtually.Let's get into the numbers and what the market is telling us. The sell-off means CyberArk's revenue should be impacted by roughly $160 million over the course of the year, based on a trailing 7.9 price-to-sales ratio. Yikes! That's on a guided $515 million for 2020. Last year's full-year revenue was $434 million, so the market expects revenue to plummet. It's clear analysts are skeptical, as they have consensus estimates for $498 million for 2020 - well below the guidance range, a range I know to be conservative from the start.What I can tell you is this: even if CyberArk didn't gain any new customers in this quarter or the next, it doesn't have customers leaving en masse, or at all, as if it was some sort of optional security software. IT spending will be cut, according to 46% of the CIOs surveyed, but I wonder if they had enough time to think it through considering many businesses purchased thousands of laptops at a time to equip their new remote workforce. But as they and I already agree, the cuts that will happen won't be from the security bucket.But let me take it a step further. What you don't see are the attempts and the attacks happening right now. Hundreds a minute and up to three-quarters of a million attacks a day every day are happening. But factor in employees who used to be under one roof now scattered throughout their local regions. That's a magnitude more of potential entry points and attack vectors. While most, if not all, of these employees are using VPNs (virtual private networks) to connect as if they are at the office, the vulnerabilities have multiplied now using their private networks to connect. There are more incentives now than there were a month ago to hammer soft spots.What I'm getting at is headlines are being written today that you won't see until months and years from now. Cracking, hacking, and phishing attempts successfully being executed right now in the newly formed remote world won't be known until companies discover them months - and sometimes years - down the road. The worst part is, 92% of firms have no idea where they stand with regard to protecting themselves from intruders.That's today. Right now - years after seeing major companies make a debacle of themselves and get sued and forced to settle. This is complicated stuff. It requires intelligent people doing intelligent things with no mistakes to secure infrastructure. This is the cyber version of someone breaking into your storefront's backroom and taking your inventory. That inventory is data used to generate your revenue. The difference is, you don't know whether the door is locked and/or whether your employees are the only ones who have the key.This is forming a continual potential energy of sorts for companies like CyberArk. It will turn into kinetic energy and reinvigorate the ""Oh no, we need security, all the security"" cycle which occurs every time a high-profile breach is brought to us by company press releases. The difference between now and several years ago when Home Depot (HD) and Target (TGT) (to name a few) were breached is everyone is aware they aren't prepared - there's a lot less arrogance and a lot more ""I know I need to do something, but I don't know exactly what.""The products CyberArk sells have grown over the last few years, but the core of its business has been privileged access management. This means keeping the keys out of the hands of the user and instead creating a secure mechanism (a vault) to request elevated privileges. Once the elevated task is complete, the key is returned and changed for the next use. The user never knows the administrative password and doesn't have to handle it. If a user is compromised, the network and administrative privileges are not.But the more relevant product is CyberArk's Alero, which is its most practical product during this remote work environment. Instead of VPNs and passwords, Alero allows employees and vendors remote access to the privilege management system using two-factor authentication from smartphones. This means less overhead in installing agents on each laptop and setting up VPN servers. Customers of CyberArk can use it free until the end of May. This might be a two-pronged marketing approach to woo customers into more purchases later. I, for one, know remote work won't end when the stay-at-home orders end. This is only ushering in a sped-up remote work environment as we head deeper into the 2020s. Remote work will continue as companies realize they can do without overhead building costs and downsize offices. It's a longer-term plan, but don't think this forced environment isn't making execs think about how to cut fixed costs.CYBR's valuation has decreased dramatically through the coronavirus market drop.Data by YChartsWhile I understand revenue growth is tapering off after accelerating in 2018, the company is continuing to push as hard on marketing as it ever has. It has increased marketing in Q4 by over 31%, accounting for some of the drop in operating income in 2019's Q4 over 2018's Q4. With acquisitions being fully absorbed and the continued need for more security products both on-prem and in the cloud, the company will be able to sell further to its customer base and continue to acquire new logos. It has room to invest more heavily, as it is fantastically profitable and not hurting to keep cash flow and the bottom line afloat.The difference between the market and the business is reflected in analysts being well below the company's guidance, expecting a dramatic drop in year-over-year revenue growth. The market is even more pessimistic, expecting no growth. We'll know exactly how that pans out in another month when the company reports. But with the times being ever more uncertain in cyberspace, CyberArk isn't about to lose its business or growth.Under $85, the stock is a buy, and in the $70s, it is a huge buy based on the company merely meeting its guidance - which, as I've reiterated, is conservative. Perhaps this time, its conservative guidance pays off and is met, still beating analysts' expectations by a wide margin.This is a stock left for dead due to the coronavirus, but should be rallying like the rest that are critical in providing necessary services. If you're looking for a stock still in the depths of the bear market and it shouldn't be - this is it."
4338442,105176,2020-04-20T00:24:21-04:00,"Mr. Market is very bullish on technology stocks.CyberArk had already guided lower YoY revenue growth before COVID-19 came into the picture.Privileged Account Management solutions aren't the typical ""enable work from home software.""New customer adoption is going to be very difficult in 2020.Valuation is still high, and there appears to be very little upside from current levels.","With social distancing and increased adoption of remote work by organizations of all sizes, there is a lot of bullish sentiment on CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR). Through this article, I aim to explain my rationality around the risks to investors from this already pricey stock. To be clear, I am not bearish on CyberArk Software. Privileged Access Management is an important area within cybersecurity and is currently dealt with the seriousness it deserves only by very few organizations. With the growing number of organizations transforming their business digitally, the administrator access for these systems needs enhanced protection.CyberArk is clearly the leader in the PAM space, and there is large potential in a relatively untapped market.Competition is growing in the PAM space, but that is a story for another day.Recent standards indicate that many firms set aside about ten percent of the total IT budget for cybersecurity. This has been the trend despite security experts arguing against the practice.COVID-19 and the associated business disruption are causing organizations to introduce IT budget cuts to increase liquidity and survive during the pandemic.(Source: Enterprise Technology Research)There are investments being made by many organizations to enable their staff to work from home. But these are mostly in the lines of equipment and infrastructure:Mr. Market is not a subject matter expert in software technologies. As a result, the majority of technology stocks continue to trade at lofty valuations. It is important to understand the difference between what is essential to enable remote work and what is the best practice to sustain remote work in the long term.Cybersecurity is extremely important for organizations across industry types. Be it to reduce regulatory, reputational or financial impact, security by design is essential. However, the world we live in does not see it that way yet. Numerous reports reveal that security continues to be an afterthought in digital transformation. (Report from Bloomberg stating how cloud security is an afterthought despite large cloud adoption). Despite massive data breaches in 2018 and 2019, Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) continue to have to fight for their budget.Hence, with a lot of talks around IT budget cuts, the cybersecurity budget across organizations will also take a significant cut. In my opinion, this is unfortunate, but it is likely to be the reality.It is easy to make all software technologies sound like they enable remote work. CyberArk provides software products that protect and secure the access to enterprise platforms by privileged users.(Source)CyberArk suite aims to secure the keys to the IT kingdom. However, to deploy and make it functional in an enterprise, it needs to be integrated with all the domains of the IT kingdom.(Source: Investor Presentation)The deployment and operationalization require extensive planning and design. As the integration aims to protect existing infrastructure, it involves coordination with the associated infrastructure teams. Most often, professional services are engaged to assist with the implementation, and this incurs additional cost. Further, training campaigns are required for administrators of those infrastructure to get them familiar with the new login and access process with CyberArk. All this takes several months (if not years). Also, the organization deploying CyberArk will require resources to own and operate the tool (either new hires or through managed service offering from consultants).(Source)In my opinion, spending to deploy PAM technology will not be on the top of the priority list during this time of crisis. This is mainly because CyberArk does not directly enable employees to work remotely. Rather, it comes in the line of organizations establishing secure practices around their existing infrastructure, which will be the logical next step when the economy begins to stabilize.Large implementation projects that are being postponed indefinitely. CISOs will be looking to deploy tools that can be deployed and operationalized quickly, to fill the essential security gaps. CyberArk suite neither fits that description, nor fulfills that requirement. Technology infrastructure such as VPN, Multi-Factor Authentication, and Mobile Device Management would be prioritized at this time, with the budget that is available.CyberArk stock trades at approx. 8x sales.(Source: Seeking Alpha)(Source: Author’s calculations)(Data Source: Company 20F and Q4 conference call)Even with the guidance revenue for 2020 to be between $510 and $519 million, it is evident that the growth rate is reducing. This is normally expected for the market leaders in a specific technology domain, as is CyberArk for PAM.However, in my opinion, the company will not be able to meet this revenue guidance due to reasoning from the above sections. I decided to draw some rough calculations on the valuation (multiples of sales).(Source: Author’s calculations)If CyberArk continues to trade at 8x sales, then by meeting guidance, we can expect to see about 19% upside from current prices. But I believe this is unlikely, since the guidance was issued on February 12th, much before COVID-19. The business impact due to budget cuts was not accounted for in these calculations.With lowered growth rates, assuming 8x sales valuation, I see very small upside for investors. Normally, when the growth rate reduction is seen by Mr. Market, the price multiple also drops. I am not accounting this in my thesis, since there are many unknowns. My article only aims to outline the fact that the investment growth is very low in comparison to the potential risk ahead.I must add that I do not anticipate the scenario of no YoY growth. CyberArk’s product suite is difficult to implement. But once implemented, it is very difficult to sunset. I do not expect existing customers to scale down or replace the suite at this time. It is possible for existing customers to purchase additional licenses to enable more of their workforce to work remotely. Despite the importance of cybersecurity in the market, CISOs will face budget cuts during times of economic crisis. The longer the pandemic situation persists, the weaker the near-term growth story for CyberArk Software. I do not see new customer adoption to be along the lines of previous years. The stock is already carrying a high valuation multiple, and in my opinion, the upside is quite low. The risks outweigh the upside at this time. Hence, I choose to remain cautious and wait for a better entry point."
4355510,105757,2020-06-24T21:34:46-04:00,"CyberArk is considered the de facto standard in Privileged Access Management and is expanding to adjacent markets organically and via acquisitions.Well-positioned to grab and extend lead with a slew of new products that are making the product sticky in the enterprise; enterprises likely to standardize on a single identity stack.CyberArk balances revenue growth with profitability, making it a rarity amongst mid-cap growth companies.We believe estimates are conservative and that the company will likely beat and raise throughout the year.Buy a small position now, and in the event that the stock sells off due to conservative guidance or missed estimates, buy more.","Privileged Access Management (PAM) remains one of the most important areas of investments for organizations to prevent hackers and malicious insiders from stealing valuable data. CyberArk (CYBR) is the leader in PAM, and is therefore a buy, in our view.Business users accessing IT resources such as PCs, servers, network devices and email applications need to authenticate themselves with a user account and a password to that resource. Depending on the permissions granted on that resource, a user is only allowed to do tasks that they have been permissioned for. Administrators of the resource have special privileges, and their accounts are called Privileged Accounts. Privileged Accounts are special accounts that are often referred to as “keys to the kingdom”, granting the user the full access to the resource. For instance, they can create accounts for other users, delete accounts of others users, access other users accounts to reset password for instance, etc. Examples of some Privileged Accounts include Unix root, Windows and Database administrator accounts (DBAs), etc.In an organization that does not utilize a Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution, an administrator logs into an IT system directly using a Privileged Account login and password. If there are multiple administrators within an organization, they all share the same Privileged Account login and the password. If one of the administrators maliciously damages the resource (for example, deletes an important file), there is no way for the business to find out who deleted the file, since all the admins share the same credentials. On top of this, the logins and the passwords are typically saved in a spreadsheet or a word document and is made accessible to all those needing them. This creates a major risk for the organization if that file is compromised. Using privileged credentials, hackers or malicious insiders can take control of the organization’s infrastructure and applications, steal proprietary and confidential information such as trade secrets, customer lists and product plans, and commit financial fraud.According to Wallix, a European competitor of CyberArk, some of the biggest breaches in 2019, including at Capital One, Georgia Tech, and First American Financial, could have been stopped by a PAM solution. Therefore, PAM is fast becoming a must-have security technology within an enterprise. The following chart illustrates where privilege accounts are and why enterprises need to focus on securing them.(Source: CyberArk Investor Presentation, November 2016)As the saying goes in the security industry, “there are only two types of companies: those who have been hacked, and those who don’t yet know they have been hacked”. The former FBI Director Robert Mueller said it even better in 2012: “There are only two types of companies: those that have been hacked, and those that will be”. Given that over 40% of the biggest breaches were the result of stolen privileged credentials, it is fairly clear that CyberArk or one of its competitors is often the last line of defense before a hacker can get to the most important data on enterprise servers, storage devices, and within software applications. CyberArk pioneered the PAM market, and its technology is effective in stopping hackers from stealing valuable data or causing damage. The following chart illustrates some of the biggest breaches of the 21st century. Interestingly, many of these breached companies turned to CyberArk to provide a solution to remediate the attack and secure them against any future attacks.(Source: CyberArk Investor Presentation, June 2020)Based on data from both Gartner and Kuppingercole, CyberArk is the industry leader and continues to lead the market with new products and features. Some of other vendors in this space including BeyondTrust, Thycotic, Centrify, and CA Technologies (now owned by Broadcom (AVGO)), and Wallix. Thycotic focuses on the Small and Medium Business (SMB) market and is making rapid strides. Similarly, Wallix, based in Europe, is also making impressive strides, but it is still mainly relegated to SMB market and mainly focused on Europe. BeyondTrust is an amalgamation of three prior firms: Lieberman Software, Bomgar, and Avecto. BeyondTrust has made some meaningful strides in capturing the market, but needless to say, CyberArk is the industry leader and continues to pull away from its competitors through organic R&D investments and targeted acquisitions. The following chart illustrates the company’s position within the industry.(Source: Kuppingercole)The following proprietary table illustrates CyberArk's leadership position in PAM market, derived from data from both Kuppingercole and Gartner analysis.Legend: Excellent = ↑↑↑↑↑, Very Good = ↑↑↑↑, Good = ↑↑↑, OK = ↑↑, Needs work = ↑(Source: Author's proprietary analysis based on data available on company websites, Kuppingercole, and Gartner)In conjunction with its F1Q20 results, CyberArk announced that it had acquired idaptive, an Identity-as-a-Service platform. In our opinion, this is a game changer for the company in many ways, given that this acquisition puts it in competition with Okta (OKTA) and Ping Identity (PING). We expect CyberArk to monetize this business well given that many enterprises are looking for a single solution that can address single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and privileged access in a single solution. We expect CyberArk to sell idaptive into its user base first, before trying to find new customers outside its install base. According to Forrester, idaptive is the second-best asset in the SSO market.(Source: Forrester data from CyberArk website)Since the company went public in 2014, it expanded into Threat Detection (via the Cybertinel acquisition), Endpoint Security (via the Viewfinity acquisition), DevOps Security (via the Conjur acquisition), and now Identity-as-a-Service (via the idaptive acquisition). We believe these acquisitions and unified stack makes CyberArk a formidable player. The company has been fairly successful in integrating all its acquisitions into its product stack and upselling into its install base.Currently, CyberArk is the industry leader in Privileged Access Management. The company pioneered the PAM market and continues to the enjoy the first-mover advantage. Much of the PAM opportunity is still a greenfield opportunity, with the company replacing some home-grown solutions that have minimal capabilities. While there are number of competitors vying for the PAM market, we believe that CyberArk is frequently the first solution an enterprise is buying from a third-party vendor. Based on IDC and Gartner data, we believe that the PAM market is expanding in teens CAGR, with the market growing from $1.2 billion in 2017 to about $2.9 billion in 2023. However, the total addressable market for CyberArk could be around $15 billion, as the company continues to move into adjacent markets such as User Authentication, Endpoint Security, Access Management etc. The following table illustrates the Identity Access Market forecast.(Source: Created by Author with data from Gartner and IDC)Following the acquisition of idaptive, Cyber noted that the TAM is about $25 billion. We are not sure how the company came up with this TAM estimate, but suffice it to say that the market is fairly large and we expect CyberArk to grow at minimum mid-teens for an extended period of time.(Source: CyberArk idaptive presentation)CyberArk targets large enterprises which typically have complex IT environments. According to the company’s June 2020 presentation, CyberArk has about 5,500+ customers worldwide and counts 50% of the Fortune 500 and more than 35% of Global 2000 as its customers. Following the acquisition of idaptive, the company noted that it has about 6,000 customers. During F2019, CyberArk derived about 28% of its revenue from banking, 14% from government, 8% from manufacturing, and 7% from the healthcare segment. According to F1Q20 results transcript, the company derives about 15% of its revenue from the energy, retail, and transportation segments. We believe some revenue from the aforementioned segments is at risk due to COVID-19.CyberArk is within the striking distance of meeting the long-term operating margin targets it laid down at its 2018 Analyst Day. Due to the impact of COVID-19, 2020 operating estimates have been negatively impacted. In addition, revenue contribution from SaaS and Subscription offerings is also increasing faster than expected, driven by increasing sales of its subscription products such as Alero, EPM, and Cloud PAM. This increasing subscription mix will put pressure on the top line growth, given the revenue is recognized over a period of time, as opposed to perpetual license where the revenue is recognized upfront. However, we believe the increasing mix of subscription revenue is a good thing for the company and provides visibility into the revenue.(Source: Analyst Day Presentation)We believe CyberArk management was being conservative when issuing its 2Q20 guidance. The company guided revenue in the $95-105 million range. This implies -5% to +5% increase year over year, and at the midpoint, it implies revenue is essentially flat. CyberArk has a history of guiding conservatively and then beating the estimates. Given our belief that the estimates are overly conservative, we are forecasting estimates above consensus. The following chart illustrates our estimates versus consensus.(Source: Created by Author with data from Thomson Reuters)The following table illustrates CyberArk’s history of beating estimates. During the last 13 quarters, the company beat revenue estimate by an average of 5% and EPS by 36%. The following chart illustrates the estimates and the actuals the company reported.(Source: Author's analysis based on data from Thomson Reuters)Since it reported results on May 13th, CyberArk has significantly underperformed both the S&P and Nasdaq indices. While Nasdaq is up about 13% and S&P is up 15%, CyberArk is only up about 3%. The company is also down 32% from the previous high. CyberArk currently trades at 6.1x EV/C2021 sales versus the peer group average of 9.2x, while growing 19% in line with the peer security names. Normally, we don’t use EV/sales for profitable companies, but in case of CyberArk and other small and mid-cap tech, EV/Sales is a good metric to view how a potential acquirer looks at the valuation. More importantly, many companies in the tech peer group are not profitable, hence it makes sense to have a common framework to view them for valuation work. The following chart illustrates CyberArk valuation relative to the security peer group.(Source: Created by author using Thomson Reuters data)We do not see CyberArk as overly cheap. It is trading at 6.1x on an EV/C2021 sales basis. In the event of a sell-off in the market due to external factors such as macroeconomic weakness, the company could move down more than its peers. Any spending slowdown can lead to a revenue and earnings miss, triggering a violent sell-off. While CyberArk has never missed meeting and beating estimates, there could always be a first for everything.The majority of CyberArk revenue is derived from the perpetual license. Perpetual license models are inherently lumpy, given that sales people are expected to close business each quarter, putting revenue and earnings at risk. In times of economic uncertainty, to conserve cash, many businesses buy only what they need. A prudent customer could lower the average deal size, impacting revenue and EPS. Since most of the tech companies in our coverage universe close deals in the last two weeks of the quarter, any deal slippage can impact revenues, triggering a stock sell-off. On another note, if enterprises choose to buy CyberArk products on a subscription basis rather than a perpetual basis, revenue recognition in the quarter could be lower than expected. A higher mix of subscriptions could lead to lower upfront revenue and cash generation. Finally, there may be other risks that are less likely to occur, in our view, or which we may not be able to currently anticipate.Following F1Q20 results, citing COVID-19 uncertainty, CyberArk pulled its annual guidance and painted a fairly conservative picture on its business outlook for the remainder of the year. Since the company reported results on May 13th, it has significantly underperformed both the S&P and Nasdaq indices. While Nasdaq is up about 13% and S&P is up 15%, CyberArk is only up about 3%.CyberArk has history of setting low expectations and exceeding them. Given that the F2Q20 estimates are conservative (revenue growth is expected to be -5% to +5% year over year), we expect the company to beat the estimates as it had done every single quarter since its IPO some 23 quarters ago. During the last 13 quarters, the average revenue beat is about 5% and average EPS beat is about 36%, as we had previously noted.Given our belief that the expectations are priced in and CyberArk appropriately guided down, we recommend investors to take a small position ahead of its earnings. We believe CYBR would likely rally into the quarter, as other companies report decent results. While CyberArk will likely beat estimates for 2Q, in our view, we are a little uncertain how the company will guide 3Q EPS given its recent purchase of idaptive. Idaptive increases opex by about $3.5-4.5 million per quarter, given that it brings in about 130 new employees. We believe CyberArk will increase investment in R&D and perhaps even in sales and marketing, providing opex guidance that could be little conservative. This conservative guidance could trigger a sell off. If a sell-off happens, then investors should double down and buy more, given that the business should continue to improve throughout the year. More importantly, with 2020 being an election year, many enterprises that we spoke to expect hackers to cause chaos. Enterprises are proactively securing their critical systems ahead of the upcoming election. Net-net, we would be buyers of stock opportunistically and into the quarter."
4359264,22148,2020-07-19T19:58:49-04:00,"CyberArk to benefit from Twitter hack.The company recently pulled guidance due to COVID-19, providing upside to forward guidance after analysts have gotten too negative.The stock has upside back to 2019 highs near $150 with the tech sector remaining hot.","The one stock to possibly benefit from the cyber attack on Twitter (TWTR) is CyberArk (CYBR). The privileged access management, or PAM, security provider is a leader in the space. My investment thesis remains bullish on buying the stock on this dip after the company pulled guidance due to unknown impacts from the coronavirus.Image Source: CyberArk website Last week, Twitter saw its site breached, potentially from an inside job. The company believes 130 major accounts were targeted by hackers attempting to gain bitcoins from clueless followers of these accounts on Twitter.The key to the story is that hackers were able to gain privileged account access to control internal systems at Twitter allowing for access to the influential accounts. According to Twitter, a group of its employees with privileged access to internal systems granted access to the hackers for reasons suggested as ""social engineering"".The hackers were able to reset 45 passwords and download data on eight accounts due to this access to internal systems. Twitter has not provided an account list, but CNET documented Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Elon Musk and Mike Bloomberg amongst the list of accounts hijacked.Clearly, Twitter needs another level of security to determine whether an external source has breached an internal system regardless of having the proper access codes. Not only for internal systems, but whether somebody with a password to a Twitter account is the valid owner.The question is really whether CyberArk has the solution to prevent this problem at Twitter. The recent purchase of Idaptive presumably provides the AI-powered tools to escalate suspicious user interactions on privileged accounts. This fact should help the cybersecurity provider grab more urgency for customers to implement their security options versus the recent delayed action due to COVID-19.Source: CyberArk June 2020 presentation While a lot of technology companies benefited from the COVID-19 shift to work-from-home protocols, CyberArk found customers willing to delay purchases of their products not deemed urgent solutions. For Q2, CyberArk predicted an impact from customers delaying purchase decisions due to the coronavirus outbreak causing the company to pull guidance.While the 2020 results are in question, the need for PAM is further enhanced by the cybersecurity issue at Twitter. CyberArk was on a nearly 20% growth rate, and the projection is for a rebound to a 19% growth rate in 2021. The Twitter hack should help accelerate revenues.The stock traded up above $140 before the company lowered 2020 EPS targets to only $2.32 along with the Q4 results prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. Analysts had expected CyberArk to earn $2.79 for the year. The big cut was due in part to higher interest expenses for the year due to the convertible debt issuance, while the company was still maintaining 19% revenue growth targets for the year.Even with the company pulling guidance following Q1 due to COVID-19, EPS estimates for the year are still up at $1.86. CyberArk is likely to beat these estimates considering the demand for expanded tech service in a WFH and online retail world.With tech stocks remaining red-hot, CyberArk has the potential for a solid catch-up play in the rest of 2020. The stock was nearly $150 this time last year and is one of the worst-performing tech stocks with a 22.5% loss over the last year. With more and more business moving online, shoring up privileged account access is crucial, whether protecting customer social media access or crucial financial records.The stock isn't cheap at 46x 2021 EPS estimates, but those numbers are down substantially from pre-virus estimates. Analyst estimates were closer to $3 per share before the crisis, and CyberArk likely reaches the highs near $150 on the reestablishment of those estimates.The key investor takeaway is CyberArk is one beaten-down tech stock that should see some action here. The company provides privileged account access security tools, and the recent hijack of internal systems at Twitter should benefit the demand for its security offerings. Investors should use the weakness in CyberArk as a buying opportunity here."
4321401,35181,2020-02-04T18:03:35-05:00,CyberArk has strong revenue growth and free cash flow margin.The industry is predicted to grow at 32% annually for several years.The stock price has a reasonable valuation relative to its peers. It is time to be bullish.,"In my last article on CyberArk Software Ltd. (CYBR) six months ago, I gave the company a neutral rating strictly due to its valuation. Fundamentals were great and I feel somewhat lucky that I made the call just as the SaaS bear market was gearing up.After taking a huge dip, CyberArk is up 5% since publication and it is now time to have another look at this company. What I have found is that CyberArk has a very strong free cash flow margin combined with revenue growth, giving it one of the best scores on the Rule of 40 for all of the companies that I track.The company appears to be moderately overvalued base on the forward sales multiple but is actually fairly valued when gross profit is substituted for sales. I believe that this company has a solid future, and I am changing my rating from neutral to bullish. The only thing holding me back from a very bullish rating is the stock chart. This stock is not breaking new ground like other SaaS stocks are. In fact, there may be some resistance at ~$147.(Source: CyberArk)The market for PAM is expected to grow by 32% annually until 2023, making this an ideal industry for your investment dollars, provided you can get in at a reasonable price.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated Y-o-Y sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated Y-o-Y sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, CyberArk is modestly above the best-fit line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is slightly overvalued relative to its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate.The Sales/EV multiple tells me that the stock is a little overvalued, but my value assessment changes when I substitute next year's gross profit estimates for forward sales.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The results shown on this second scatter plot suggest that CyberArk is fairly valued based on next year's profit estimates.When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the software company ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation, a concept that I recently developed that compares forward sales multiple versus estimated sales growth.CyberArk's annual revenue growth is 31%, down from its 5-year growth rate of 39%.(Source: Portfolio123)CyberArk's free cash flow margin TTM is approximately 30% and has been above 20% since 2015.(Source: Portfolio123)One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40 - some analysts use EBITDA and others use free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin TTM.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows - If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the software company has growth and cash flow in balance and is considered financially healthy. In CyberArk's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 31% + 30% = 61%The calculation comes out well above 40%, indicating that CyberArk has a balance between growth and profits.While software stock valuations have come down in recent months, they are still high on a historical basis. Uncertainties, such as the rising tension in the Middle East, trade disputes, and the coronavirus, could cause a market downturn. Software stocks tend to get hit hard during any market turbulence.CyberArk has three major competitors and all three have recently been acquired, leading to restructuring and realignment of products, resulting in customer uncertainty. While this could be seen as a positive for CyberArk, one or more competitors could emerge stronger as a result of the acquisition and pose a threat.CyberArk is a leader in PAM, a strategy used to reduce risk against both external and internal threats by the use of privileged credentials and accounts. Expectations are for PAM to grow by 32% annually and with a 31% revenue growth rate CyberArk appears to be on course. This company has an exceptional free cash flow margin of 30%, giving an exceptional score of 61 on the Rule of 40.While CyberArk is modestly overvalued relative to its peers based on the forward sales multiple, when the exceptionally high gross margin is factored in, CyberArk is fairly valued, at least in my opinion. For all of these reasons, I am giving CyberArk a bullish rating."

It offers a balance of growth, a healthy balance sheet, and offerings with a strong product-market fit in its niche privilege access space. Demand for cloud security solutions remains a strong tailwind, and I expect its valuation to keep expanding from here.CyberArk remains one of the few cybersecurity plays that offer a decent balance of growth and value. While most investors don't care about value in the formative years of a SaaS business, I believe a SaaS business which can demonstrate value in the form of an identifiable competitive advantage, great management, healthy balance sheet and profitable P&L at a decent valuation shouldn't be passed up by investors.I've been following CyberArk for the past three years. Initially, I was skeptical about its ability to sustain its growth narrative. Like other skeptics, I've been proven wrong after watching its market cap triple within the past 36 months.Going forward, its clearer that CyberArk has a management team that can drive a successful go-to-market narrative to expand the TAM of its privilege identity space.The narrative has always been about protecting privileged accounts and securing access to the most critical security devices and agents. CyberArk is one of the few plays that's been able to sell the importance of securing both the man and the machine. While most network security vendors focus on securing the networks and the devices within it, CyberArk's narrative is more about securing the agents that build the networks and operate the devices within it. In reality, if these agents are up to speed on the best security practices and policies, we won't have data breaches and data loss at the current rate we are experiencing.To combat these, CyberArk has focused on tuning its marketing message to CISOs about the need to protect against sophisticated attacks like spear phishing, social engineering, and other attack vectors that play on the vulnerability of humans.Putting myself in the shoes of a typical CISO, I 100 percent buy this narrative, and I don't doubt the reason not to convince my CEO to increase my security budget to accommodate privileged access solutions.Given the growing volume of endpoints, apps, and privileged access solutions, CyberArk has recorded massive revenue growth. This was achieved by offering new products endpoint (endpoint privilege manager) and application access (application access manager) products in addition to its core revenue driver (core privileged access security).The company has recently rolled out new sales initiatives to target the mid-market as the large enterprise market becomes saturated. This is reflected in its growing headcount. A serious concern for me is the recent loss of its global head of sales. According to management, the transition is going to be well managed.Going forward, I expect CyberArk to continue to retain and win more security contracts with its privileged access playbook.Data by YChartsAt a market cap of $3.8 billion, 2019E revenue growth of 24%, and P/S ratio of 9.5, CyberArk remains a bargain compared to more frothy competitors. I see investors rotating out of these frothy names into cheaper plays like CyberArk. CyberArk has cash and short-term investment of $538 million with no debt on its balance sheet. Deferred revenue grew by 34% to $174 million last quarter. Cash flow from operations is positive at $21.5 million, while FCF stands at $19.2 million slightly offset by CAPEX of $0.9 million. CyberArk doesn't buy back its shares rather opting to invest its cash in marketable securities which generated cash flow of $12.2 million last quarter. My only concern is that CyberArk is getting into the matured phase as growth decelerates, which means investors will begin to care more about profitability metrics by focusing on ratios like its EV/EBITDA or EV/FCF. In that scenario, investors might be reluctant to buy CyberArk instead opting for other fast-growing cyber plays.Management isn't guiding for unforeseen headwinds in the near term. Therefore, I don't see a reason why CyberArk's valuation won't stretch beyond the $3.8 billion market cap. Though, I'm getting the sense that the lack of near-term optimism might be driven by lack of management's willingness to diversify into other growth generating initiatives either organically or via more acquisitions. The company appears to be content with selling its privileged access solutions.CyberArk is currently trading at a 30.5% discount to its average analysts' price target. The stock has one of the best gross margin and profitability ratios in the cybersecurity space. It is still growing in the double digits, and it isn't debt-laden. Though I would love to see management diversify a bit outside of its specialized niche.Regardless, CyberArk remains a BUY, and I believe a market cap of $3.8 billion doesn't reflect the stock's full worth."

There is hardly any company that has a similar go-to-market narrative in its league. In short, CyberArk is in a league of its own, and its marketing message to CISOs has consistently stood out. However, in the last quarter, it wasn't about convincing CISOs; it was about convincing Wall Street on three key issues which led to the sell-off.Analysts were excited to learn more about how CyberArk intends to grow the SaaS portion of its business. This is important because a transition from a perpetual licensing to a subscription-based revenue recognition model often comes with revenue modeling and recognition bumps. CyberArk's tone didn't impress during the earnings call. Though it was guiding for strong growth from products like Privilege cloud, Alero, and EPM; however, the SaaS portion of overall revenue was still expected to hover around 10%. This caused a mismatch in expectations as the Street was expecting a faster ramp in the SaaS business. The strong growth guidance is only due to the small revenue base comparison from last year.The macro weakness in EMEA comes at a time when the world is trying to eradicate a global epidemic. While management is guiding for a rebound in weak regions like France and Germany off the recent hiring and sales productivity ramp, the Street is still concerned if Asia can pick up the lapses in EMEA in light of the logistics headwind from the Coronavirus worries. Also, the guidance is for EMEA to rebound in the second half of the year. This means the first half of the year might be impacted by further weaknesses in EMEA. If the EMEA trend continues into 2Q'20, the sell-off might continue due to a mismatch in growth expectation.Operating margin guidance came below expectations. This was top-down as the assist from revenue growth weakened after management guided for 19% growth in 2020 below the observed industry growth of 20%. Gross margin is expected to come down slightly due to the investment in cloud assets to set up its growing cloud business.Operating margin will be impacted by growth in operating expenses majorly driven by sales costs. The net income margin is going to be affected by an increase in tax payment.The earnings call narrative capped the excitement from the growing SaaS products. This triggered a lack of optimism leading to the sell-off we've witnessed since CyberArk reported.Going forward, investors should watch out for the performance of its SaaS business. The commentary around the licensing business was positive and reassuring. Maintenance revenue is also expected to drive strong growth as it is responsible for a huge portion of the double-digit growth recorded last quarter.From my valuation, CyberArk has to maintain double-digit growth towards achieving its $1 billion in revenue guidance for the next five years. This is still within its reach due to its strong balance of growth (+19% revenue growth guidance), profitability, and leverage (current ratio of 5.95). I continue to find CyberArk to be an attractive investment. The current valuation is in line; therefore, investors should only accumulate more shares on further dips.I will be initiating a hold rating in the near term (I remain a long-term bull on the strong demand for privileged access solutions) due to CyberArk's strong growth factor (double-digit revenue growth), strong profitability factor (double-digit income margin), and niche leadership in the privileged access space. I’m mostly worried about the light guidance for the SaaS portion of the business and the weakness in EMEA, which could affect 1H'20 results. Due to the volatile nature of CyberArk, investors shouldn't hesitate to equally play it safe."

The market is expected to continue to grow at a rapid pace, with a CAGR of almost 19% for the period of 2016 to 2022. CyberArk is a market leader in the PAM space. CyberArk is enjoying double-digit revenue growth in the PAM niche. As a market leader, I expect CyberArk to continue to capitalize on its leadership in this space, which has been driven by rapid digital transformation activities across enterprises. As a result, I remain bullish on the demand for CyberArk's offerings in the near term.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)CyberArk delivered strong results last quarter. Revenue grew 28%, driven by strong licensing (+25% y/y) and maintenance (+30% y/y) business growth. The company continues to ride the wave of the digital transformation narrative as more enterprises transition to the cloud. The recent acquisition of the International Common Criteria NIAP certification improved its positioning in the Fed vertical, which improved significantly the last quarter. All regions came in strong, with EMEA performing good. CyberArk's SaaS solutions continue to drive strong revenue growth. New acquisitions are driving add-ons. The total deal size is expanding as more customers are buying other products such as application access manager, endpoint privilege manager, and Alero. As a result, management is guiding for a 25% revenue growth in FY'2019.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Gross margins declined slightly, driven by a decline in service gross margins due to investments in cloud infrastructure. Operating margins improved due to the growing average deal size.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Operating cash flow was driven by net income and stock-based compensation. This offset softer revenue collection as deferred revenue increased due to larger deal sizes.The company is about to raise $500 million in a convertible debt offering. Given its cash position of $555 with no debt, there is a high likelihood that the company is about to make an acquisition. If the company makes an acquisition that is accretive to revenue, this will keep the growth story alive. Given that investors are currently oversubscribed to fast-growth tech stocks, there is a high chance that CyberArk will enjoy multiples expansion in the near term if the company posts growth results above the Street's expectations. As a result, I am bullish on CyberArk's business and financials.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)CyberArk appears overvalued compared to its sector median. However, it is projected to grow at 3x the sector median. Analysts have an average price target of $143 and a revenue growth estimate of 18% in 2021.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)I expect margins to improve gradually over the years as CyberArk scales in the privileged access space.I expect more modest revenue growth of 20% in 2020 due to the small size of the PAM market, which CyberArk already dominates. The revenue growth will be driven by CyberArk's growth in the expanding PAM market coupled with growth in add-ons and expanding verticals and regions.FCF growth will be driven by improving margins and better revenue collection, driving changes in working capital. I expect capex to be modest as CyberArk scales its cloud business.My DCF assumption expects FCF % of revenue to remain around the 38% mark into 2024. I'm discounting this cashflow with a lofty WACC of 12%, given the oversubscription of SaaS stocks. Using a growth till perpetuity of 2%, this gives an enterprise value of $4.3 billion. Adding a net cash position of $555 million, this gives a market cap of $4.8 billion. Using shares outstanding of 39 million, we get a share price of $124. This is equivalent to a P/S (FWD) of 9x, which won't be attractive to value investors. However, when you consider the future growth projections will dilute multiples, CyberArk is worth giving a try. Though, it will be easier to make the case if CyberArk keeps diversifying to reduce sector risk.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Source: GartnerCyberArk is highly positioned in the PAM space, according to Gartner. Aside from BeyondTrust, most competitors are smaller. Here is management's commentary on the competitive landscape according to the last earnings call:Analyst, Joshua Tilton of Berenberg, highlighted new observations of IGAs like SailPoint (SAIL) bundling privileged access into their IGA functionalities. Besides this observation, management isn't worried about competitors encroaching its go-to-market value proposition in privileged account management.Source: everylifetechnologiesI have a BUY rating with a price target of $124.

This is an opportunity for CyberArk.CyberArk has strong revenue growth and free cash flow margin. The industry is predicted to grow at 32% annually for several years.According to my analysis, CyberArk is overvalued and investors should wait for a better price.Aggressive investors could scale in if they fear that the opportunity will get away from them.","There are many flavors of cybersecurity technology, including endpoint protection, zero trust, perimeter defense (firewall), and privileged access management (PAM). CyberArk Software Ltd. (CYBR) is a leader in PAM. PAM reduces the risk of both external and internal threats by use of privileged credentials and accounts.(Source: CyberArk)The market for PAM is expected to grow by 32% annually until 2023, making this an ideal industry for your investment dollars, provided you can get in at a reasonable price. This is the crux of the problem. CyberArk appears to be a solid company with solid fundamentals. Revenue growth is greater than 30% and free cash flow margin is 36%. But according to my relative valuation technique, the stock price is overvalued, and conservative investors should wait for a more opportune entry point. Aggressive investors could scale in so as to avoid missing the opportunity altogether.According to the 2019 Gartner Magic Quadrant for PAM, CyberArk has three major competitors: BeyondTrust, Centrify, and CA Technologies. Coincidentally, all three have recently been acquired providing uncertainty for their clients and potential customers. This is a great opportunity for CyberArk in its bid to capture market share.(Source: CyberArk)I determine stock valuation on a relative basis and on the belief that high-growth companies should be valued more highly than slow-growth companies. To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value (EV)/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 82 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate"" also provided by Portfolio123.The reason for using analysts' estimates as opposed to historical data is because SaaS stocks tend to make a lot of acquisitions which can muddy the results of the scatter plot. The analyst estimates account for these acquisitions, and the estimates are updated frequently. This makes for a cleaner chart. The sales estimates, unlike EPS estimates, are usually quite accurate for most SaaS companies, except that they tend to be a little on the conservative side.I use an exponential best-fit trendline as it appears to be more appropriate than a linear trend line for this application. As sales growth goes up, the valuation goes up exponentially. The trendline was calculated using MS Excel. I consider the stocks sitting above the trendline to be overvalued, while stocks lying under the trendline are undervalued.As can be seen from this scatter plot, CyberArk is sitting above the trendline, suggesting that its EV/forward sales are higher than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that CyberArk is overvalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the ""Rule of 40,"" free cash flow margin and cash burn.A rule of thumb often applied to software companies is the Rule of 40. This metric helps SaaS companies balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40:Growth: The standard growth metric is to use the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth rate. For my Rule of 40 calculation, I use percentage sales growth TTM. There are three reasons for this: (1) ARR is not always available; (2) most SaaS companies grow not only organically but also by acquisition; and (3) many companies are in the middle of a transformation to SaaS and have a significant amount of product sales.Profit: I have seen many variants for the profit metric. Some analysts use EBITDA margin, others use operational cash flow margin or free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor perspective.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus profit adds up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.CyberArk had trailing twelve months (TTM) revenue growth of more than 33.9%, increasing from approximately 20% one year ago.(Source: Portfolio123)CyberArk has a free cash flow margin TTM of 36.6%, rising from 20% in late 2016.(Source: Portfolio123)CyberArk's YoY revenue growth was 33.9%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing twelve months was 36.6%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 33.9% + 36.6% = 70.5%This Rule of 40 score is quite astounding as there are few companies that score higher than 70%. Since the Rule of 40 calculation comes out higher than 40%, I conclude that CyberArk has a good balance between growth and profits and financially healthy.When a company fulfills the Rule of 40, I don't need to analyze cash burn. But I am providing the SG&A expense here for reference. In the case of CyberArk, the SG&A expense is 70.3% of the total revenues. Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)I have developed a new scatterplot that shows forward annual sales growth estimate versus SG&A expense to sales for all of the stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The scatterplot shows that there is a reasonable correlation between the two parameters. Based on where CyberArk sits on the scatterplot, I conclude that the company's SG&A expense is quite normal given its expected future sales growth.I have added this section on gross margin because of several comments on Zscaler Is A Stock To Watch where readers indicated that gross margin is one of the most important fundamental parameters and should have been covered.The scatterplot below shows a very weak correlation between gross margin and EV/forward sales growth.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)Gross margin appears to only contribute a small amount in explaining why some stocks have such lofty valuations. In any case, CyberArk has a gross margin TTM of 89% which puts it in the top 10% of my stock universe.CyberArk is a leader in PAM, a strategy used to reduce risk against both external and internal threats by use of privileged credentials and accounts. CyberArk has three major competitors and all three have recently been acquired, leading to restructuring and realignment of products, resulting in customer uncertainty.For the most recent twelve months, CyberArk had an increase in revenue of almost 40%. The PAM market is expected to grow 32% annually until 2023. Therefore, I expect that CyberArk will have above-average growth for several years. Free cash flow TTM is an exceptional 36%, putting CyberArk on my watch list. The only negative I have for this stock is its valuation, significantly higher than its SaaS peers based on my relative valuation technique. For this reason, I give CyberArk a neutral rating. That being said, aggressive investors may wish to scale into a long position so that the opportunity doesn't get away."
4293107,103458,2019-09-23T16:27:17-04:00,"CYBR is well positioned to continue to capture large TAM as PAM is a top priority investment for companies.
        Mid Market investment is a catalyst to grow recurring SaaS revenue.
        Significant potential upside signals from Google Trends and Alexa Web Page data.","Business OverviewCYBR is the category leader in the privilege access management segment of security (PAM). This segment is still largely on-premise, but CYBR does offer cloud solutions. Revenues are broken out by licenses (SAAS), and maintenance and service. The license business is roughly ~55% of total revenue where maintenance and services accounts for the remaining ~45%. Due to recent privilege breaches in the past few years (Marriott, Equifax, Uber) breaches are inherently becoming a threat to businesses as companies acquire more sensitive customer data, positioning PAM well for growth. According to a Cowen survey, 25% of of CISO’s identified PAM as top #1 or #2 priorities in 2019. Security is going to remain a top priority for companies going forward and after a Q2 stock price pullback, CYBR is well positioned for growth based on continued financial health and strong alternative data trends.Additionally, PAM is positioned for growth because 1.) Most firms aren’t using a PAM solution 2.) Secular shifts to cloud will require companies to evaluate new security vendorsFrom quotes below you will see that there is still a tremendous amount of opportunity for growth in CYBR as most of their new business is from greenfield accounts.- DB Tech Conference 9/10/2019-MS TMT Conference 2/25/2019Revenue Breakdown​Source: K's and Q's CYBR has continued healthy top line growth as the business matures. Catalysts that will be discussed in quotes below are the expansion of cloud products, developing a mid market strategy, and continuing to invest in sales and marketing spend. In 2018 top line grew at 31%, which is an improvement upon 21% in 2017. For FY2019 consensus (IBES) is $423m. YTD Revenue is already at ~196 (~46% of goal), which leaves an additional $227 before reaching their goal. Historically, Q4 accounts for about 30% of total revenue for the year. If this trend holds true, Q3 they will need to do $102m to reach their goal, where as consensus is currently at $103m.As mentioned in business overview section, you will see that CYBR’s license revenue and Maintenance revenue are roughly 50-50, skewed toward licenses being the stronger business. In 2019, on average YTD, license revenue is 53% of revenue, whereas the last 5 year average is 58% of revenue. I would prefer to see a heavier proportion of sales move to licenses, as the recurring nature of the SaaS business model is compelling. The investment in mid market product and sales strategy could be a catalyst for the licenses segment to grow in 2020 onward. Part of the reason the maintenance part of their business is so prevalent is that their target market is apprehensive to move to the cloud and most security solutions are still on premise. The market will see a slow shift moving forward and CYBR is well positioned to satisfy the cloud migration appetite when it arrives because they already have products in place to address this need.Gross margins for both revenue streams are extremely strong with total gross margin being 85%. License gross margin is healthier, averaging 95%and maintenance business being at 75%.Deferred revenue in 2018 grew at >40%, which is greater than 31% of revenue growth, showing that there is upside for CYBR as billings come through for deals they closed int he second half of FY2018.​Source: Thomson Reuters, SentieoSource: Q2 Earnings Call Source: Q2 Earnings CallSource: Q2 Earnings CallUS Security CompsTo better understand the security landscape, you will see three scatter plots below including: EV/Sales v. Revenue Growth, EBITDA Growth v. EBITDA Margins, and FCF Margin v. FCF Per Share growth. The peer group used is both large incumbent enterprise security companies likely SYMC, and also growth security co’s like OKTA.For the chart below CYBR sits in the middle of the valuationv. growth scenario. From Companies that are growing their top line by less than 30% per year, CYBR is the “cheapest” company, similarly valued to the email security co’s MIME and PFPT.

OKTA and CRWD are the high growth SaaS centric security businesses trading at rich multiples of >20x Sales.​​Source: Thomson Reuters, Sentieo​Looking further down the income statement at EBITDA margins versus growth. CYBR is the company growing EBITDA the fastest that has EBITDA margins >20% and <30%. The companies that have higher EBITDA margins are growing at a slower rate and are significantly larger than CYBR’s $3.8B market cap, aside from QLYS (SYMC – $15B, AKAM – $15B, QLYS – $3.2B, CSCO – $209B, CHKP – $16B). From the graph above, QLYS is only growing revs at ~15% and trades at a 9x sales multiple,which makes their higher EBITDA margin more expensive and the overall business less attractive from a growth perspective.​​ ​Source: Thomson Reuters, Sentieo  Finally, the last metric I want to evaluate is the FCF Margin v. FCF per share growth. Similarly. CYBR is among the top of the peer group for FCF margin on an NTM basis at roughly 35%. QLYS and CHKP are slightly higher, but neither company has as strong of revenue growth as CYBR. All companies that are growing FCF per share at a faster YOY growth (in the chart below is FY2 over FY1 FCF per Share growth), FCF margins are not as high. The closest company to CYBR is PANW that is >25% FCF margin with similar growth. From the last two plots you will see that PANW’s revenue and EBITDA profile is not as attractive as CYBR.  ​Source: Thomson Reuters, Sentieo Q2 Earnings OverviewThe stock pulled back on Q2 earnings beat for revenue and EPS. Financials are healthy, however, the street likely reacted to the CRO, Ron Zoran announcing his succession plan over then course of 2019 and billings were lighter than what the street expected. This has resulted in a 24% stock price pull back since 8/2. You will see in the image below that stock has been following on revenue upgrades from sell side.I am viewing the pullback overdone because financials are still looking extremely strong, alternative data looks strong, which will be discussed further later in the article. The stock is starting to turn back and I think will gain momentum. See below for commentary on CRO succession. Hes remaining an adviser and will still be involved through EOY so I am not overly worried about this at the moment.​​​Source: Thomson Reuters, Sentieo-DB Technology Conference 9/10/2019Financial Overview​Top line revenue has been growing at a faster pace than S&M expense. From the excel output below, you will see for the aligned year, the sales efficiency ratio in FY2018 was strong (>.5 is generally the rule of thumb for good sales efficiency). The more revenue CYBR is able to generate from S&M to fuel growth, the better the company will perform. Staggered sales efficiency was .70 for FY2018. I expect that S&M growth may decrease in 2019 as at the TMT MS conference (quote below) they said they will be doubling down on S&M in 2019 (as they did in 2017) to fuel growth for 2020 and 2021.Breaking out just license revenue for sales efficiency ratio tells a different story. An aligned ratio of .33 and staggered ratio of .39 isn’t as attractive and doesn’t hit the goal of >.5 as a rule of thumb for a healthy sales and marketing engine. Per commentary below the correct metric to look is the staggered year as they state that marketing investment today, due to their long sales cycle and rep ramp time, generally takes 2-3 to generate strong ROI.​Source: K's and Q's- MS TMT Conference 2/25/2019​Source: Thomson Reuters, Sentieo EBITDA margins are healthy and expected to expand slightly based on IBES estimates. FY2018 adjusted EBITDA margins were ~27% where the peer group mean margin was ~25%. Expansion to 30% would be great, however, only Checkpoint (34%) and Symantec (~54%) have cleared that line. Margins are largely in line with peers, with slight upside. ​Source: Thomson Reuters, SentieoCYBR has been able to generate extremely strong FCF for a smid cap business that is still growing quickly.

Page views are at two year highs, and starting massively accelerating in August accordingly to Alexa data. From the Google Trends Stacked data, you will see an uncharacteristic increase in Search data starting in August and is still occurring, which breaks the seasonal trend in previous years in which Search traffic stays flat in September. Finally, the Sentieo Index is showing to be accelerating significantly faster than revenue estimates, which could be a signal of revenue upside for Q3 that is not priced into consensus estimates.​​Source: Alexa, Sentieo​​Source: Google, SentieoKey RisksBased on a report from Cowen, it seems as if CYBR has a wide moat. However, the image below is based on a Gartner report that outlines the PAM space, both public and private players. Key players that Cowen outlined were BeyondTrust (Acquired by PE owned Bomgar) , Centrify ($94m total funding – now PE owned), and Thycotic ($4.5m funding). According to Cowen report, both BeyondTrust and Thycotic are on-prem and cloud solutions.3. Budget Priority ChangesIf companies become complacent due to lack of breaches, or a recession hits, it is possible that since many of the accounts they are selling to are completely greenfield, conversations could be shut down. Alternatively, if companies suddenly view competing security categories as more important, budget could be reallocated. However, it is positive to see that based on Cowen surveys, PAM was in the top 3 most critical tasks for CISO’s to implement. It is also positive that since they are quickly growing net new accounts, they will have a larger account base to sell additional products to.4. Sales efficiency could be betterCYBR for staggered year total revenue sales efficiency is .7 which is very good, however, when breaking this metric out to just look at license revenue, the ratio falls to .39, which is not an attractive ratio. Hopefully this expands in the next ~3 years after a large S&M investment in 2019 to help grow their mid market SaaS focused business.5. CRO succession plan failsThe prior CRO said to have been with CYBR for 20 years. This means that he saw the company from 0- $400m in revenue. This always poses the risk of losing institutional knowledge, losing sales reps, and altering what could have been a comfortable sales environment. It is good however he will maintain a relationship with the company through advising and the succession plan is going to be happening over the course of the next ~6 months.ConclusionCYBR is well positioned for longs as the stock has unjustifiably pulled back 25%. Growth is great and profitability margins have the best balanced in the security space. Alternative data supports continued revenue growth and catalysts will be investment into the mid market, a large TAM, and PAM being a top priority for companies as risk of breach increases. ​ ​ ​"

4268305,24361,2019-06-04T17:38:06-04:00,"CyberArk continues to outperform expectations, leveraging growing interest in PAM and taking advantage of distracted competitors.Targeting middle-market clients is a logical next step, and CyberArk continues to target adjacent markets that can expand share-of-wallet with enterprise customers.CyberArk deserves a premium valuation as an early leader in a fast-growing market, but valuation still looks stretched both for CYBR and the sector overall.","I've written rather positively about the quality of CyberArk (CYBR) and its growth opportunity before, and that's not going to change here - I continue to believe that CyberArk is an early leader in an exciting growth sector within security (privileged access management) and that it has a large and growing addressable market in front of it. The hang-up I have today is that valuations in software overall, and security, in particular, are pretty high relative to long-term norms. I'd love to own CyberArk at the right price, and I admit that even I'm tempted to throw caution to the wind and just own it, but chasing elevated valuations carries more risk than I need in my portfolio.CyberArk's mid-May results left little for the nitpickers, as the company beat comfortably at the top line and all the way through to the EPS line, including a large operating margin beat. Sales in Europe were a little less impressive I'll grant, and many companies (outside tech) have warned about slowing trends in Europe, but there were also some more challenging comps in the year-ago quarter.Revenue rose 34% in the first quarter, propelled by 33% growth in licensing and 34% growth in maintenance. While new business wins seem to be holding more or less steady within the mix, deal size is starting to pick up. PAM continues to generate about 80% of the license revenue, while Application Access Manager (a unified product combining Conjur and Application Identity Manager) contributed 10%.Gross margin improved 150bp year over year (and shrank 160 bp qoq), beating expectations by more than a point. On the expense items, G&A spending came in lower than expected, while R&D and S&M were basically in line. Running better-than-expected revenue through lower-than-expected operating expenses had a very healthy impact on margin, with operating income more than doubling from the year-ago period (non-GAAP) and margin expanding by almost nine points; operating income beat expectations by 32%, while margin beat by almost six points.Better still, billings and deferred revenue both support the idea that the business continues to build. Using billings as a sort of book-to-bill proxy has its issues (but the Street does it anyway…), but 37% billings growth exceeded expectations, as did 43% deferred revenue growth.As I mentioned in my last piece on CyberArk, the company is benefiting not only from growing awareness of the importance of access/identity management and growing adoption but also distractions at many of its competitors.Broadcom (AVGO) is managing CA for growth and has been less active in the PAM market. Dell (DELL), too, has reportedly been showing up less on a head-to-head basis with CyberArk, while BeyondTrust is still in the process of integrating a series of deals. With less focused/committed rivals, CyberArk is making hay.Although larger enterprises will continue to be the prime addressable market for CyberArk for some time, the company is starting to push harder for middle-market business, including developing its own dedicated sales team for this market. This effort will put CyberArk into competition with Thycotic more often, but I certainly don't see that as a reason not to address that market opportunity more aggressively.While CyberArk is an early leader in the PAM space, the market is growing rapidly and is still significantly under-penetrated. The problem is in quantifying that. I've seen addressable market estimates ranging from $1.4 billion to over $5 billion (for 2018). Most sell-side analysts and third-party research firms estimate that CyberArk has market share somewhere in the mid-20%s to mid-30%s. If that's accurate, the actual market (that is, companies actually paying for PAM licenses) was somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 billion in 2018, growing more than 20% a year. I believe that is at least approximately right, and I think the real market opportunity if PAM catches on like other security offerings is less than 20% penetrated today.The biggest problem, other than the likelihood that CyberArk will someday have a sales execution stumble (pretty much everybody does, sooner or later, in this sector) is the level of expectations in the market. Software stocks, in general, and security stocks with them, are at historically high valuation levels. Average forward EV/sales multiples have expanded about 2.5x in the last 18 months, with only a couple of percentage points increase in growth and/or margin expectations (revenue growth and margins tend to drive software stock multiples). CyberArk is quite highly valued relative to historical norms, and only a very small handful of security software stocks trade below medium-term norms (SailPoint (SAIL), Symantec (SYMC), and Carbon Black (CBLK) are on that list).I'm reluctant to give full credit for CyberArk's margin beat in the first quarter; it was a great performance, but I'm not ready to just assume that's anything like the new normal. Still, it does point to potential longer-term upside in margins and FCF as the business scales up over time, particularly if offerings like Application Access Manager and Endpoint Privilege Manager can grow from here (expanding share-of-wallet with existing customers should be good for margins). For now, though, I continue to expect long-term revenue growth in the mid-teens (around 16%), and free cash flow growth above 20%, with near-term operating margins (non-GAAP) rising from the mid-20%'s to the mid-to-high 20%'s.Between discounted cash flow and growth/margin-driven EV/revenue, I believe fair value for CyberArk is a bit above $100 now. The shares, though, trade closer above $120 and have traded close to $140 recently. I'd likely let it ride if I already owned CyberArk shares, or at least would be inclined to use trailing stops, but I'm not going to chase the shares here - given what I believe to be an excessively high overall valuation for software in the market now, I'd rather wait in the hope of a pullback and take my chances with missing out."
4245440,76115,2019-02-28T17:48:29-05:00,"CyberArk continues to accelerate growth, repeating Q3's success.Much of the financial metrics I looked at in November are just as good if not better today.It appears CyberArk can shift to another gear in 2019 as valuation multiples continue to compress.","When I last wrote on CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) in November, I discussed how there was more to come - another gear, ready for torque to be applied. The stock had just come off doubling over the prior 12 months, and I was contending the stock had more room to run even after that kind of performance. It turned out to be correct as the company executed a beautifully profitable fourth quarter; expanding on many of the revenue metrics I discussed in my article.With the fourth quarter proving the company can repeat growth, the question becomes: can the company continue to execute at such a high level? Similarly, can the stock continue to run at the torrent pace it has?Data by YChartsTo help answer those questions of CyberArk going ""top gear,"" I compared last quarter's financials to this quarter's financials - particularly cost of revenue and expenses. If the company can continue on this path of rapid growth acceleration, then it's likely it can support the stock in the next two to three quarters. On the other hand, if it turns out we see a deceleration of this recent growth, then it's possible the stock will see a breather in the medium term.(Source: Company's Q4 2018 earnings release)Looking at the numbers above, it's clear even in its highest absolute dollars revenue quarter (the fourth quarter), it managed to spur growth beyond the prior quarter where I said another gear was grabbed. This is proving the acceleration has not slowed down.Will it next quarter, though?As we know, the company provides conservative guidance. Therefore, we can get an idea of this continuation of accelerated growth year over year. For Q1, the company expects revenue of $92M at the midpoint or 28.5% year-over-year growth. This compares to 2018's Q1 guidance of 17% year-over-year growth and actual reported growth of 22%. With nearly 29% revenue growth expected for 2019's Q1, combined with the company's historically conservative guidance, I expect Q1 to match Q4 in terms of this growth acceleration.Business climate-wise, nothing has fallen short in the cybersecurity arena, and spend only increased as 2018 progressed. With guidance from CyberArk above consensus and peers like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) issuing a beat and in-line guidance, it's clear the industry these companies serve is not deteriorating. Moreover, CyberArk's business model has proven to be effective in targeting the needs of businesses and governments in protecting their assets and networks. Naturally, this is one of the most important aspects for CyberArk, and it's showing in top line growth.As I analyzed last article, expenses are the second factor in understanding CyberArk's execution and ability to invest in the company continually. In Q4, expenses grew at a very reasonable level considering revenue grew at 36%.(Source: Company's Q4 2018 earnings release)This contributed to a growth of EBIT of 116% year over year and 181% quarter over quarter. This compares to EBIT growth of 1% in the year-ago quarter. It's clear the company has executed well throughout 2018.The company is guiding for a Q1 operating margin of 21% against 2017's Q1 reported 10%. While not Q4 levels - as Q1 is typically the lowest revenue quarter of the year - comparing margins quarter over quarter won't tell us much. It's clear management has continued to find an inflection in the business where the additional revenue compared to a year ago is dropping to the bottom line in a significant way.This is the ultimate question today, especially after the run-up over the last 16 months. What's interesting is even with the massive rise in share price, the stock's valuation has continued to compress.Data by YChartsMy estimate for 2019 puts GAAP EPS (the chart above is based on GAAP as well) at $1.90-2.00. This is a little under where the company has guided for on a non-GAAP basis. Using the current cybersecurity market together with management's recent execution ability, I see this as readily achievable. Even if the stock rose to $140 over the next six months, the multiple would continue to compress to 70 based on my estimate. At today's $109 share price, this is a forward multiple of 55. While this seems high in today's economic and business climate, CyberArk has accelerated growth while many other companies are struggling to maintain growth or slow the deceleration of it. Combine this with the fact CyberArk's net income grew 194% from 2017 to 2018 and you see a better context for the multiple. Continuing the exercise, based on my $1.95 in EPS, I expect net income to grow 59% in 2019 over 2018. This means CyberArk is still undervalued at $109 a share.Considering the strong momentum in the business specifically as the company delivers on cloud-based solutions, I expect it to deliver strong results in 2019 on the back of its record-setting 2018. Along with the growing demand for these kinds of products in the marketplace, what has given CyberArk an advantage is the consolidation in the sector. According to the CEO on the Q4 conference call, this was a factor in many of the company's wins over the course of the year:The risk is these competitors get absorbed, straighten their businesses out, and get back in the ring to compete. However, much of the damage has been done by CyberArk taking these large wins away from competitors who may have been in the running at the time but have now been erased from the email address book after losing to CyberArk's products. It's not very often there are rip and replaces in the IT world.It's clear the company has executed phenomenally while keeping the business lean and in check. On top of this, the business environment favors CyberArk in both a holistic sense and a competitive disruptive sense. These two major factors have allowed the cybersecurity industry to grow in terms of spend from a customer perspective and limit the scope of competitors. Additionally, CyberArk is taking advantage of these competitive issues at the right time, killing two birds with one stone - growing market share and riding the growing market. It's time for another gear, and I'd be a buyer on any weakness."
4222808,76115,2018-11-16T10:00:00-05:00,"It's been a year since I've written on CyberArk and in that year the bull thesis prevailed.
        It's time to take chips off the table right? Not quite.
        The company has reaccelerated revenue growth while keeping expenses in check.
        I see CyberArk grabbing another gear due to the cybersecurity market climate rewarding specialized players.","The last time I wrote on CyberArk (CYBR), it had just dealt with a rare blow - a negative preannouncement of guidance. This sent the stock tumbling as investors feared it was the beginning of weakness not only for the company but the cybersecurity market. I contended this was not the case and said this was the opportunity investors were waiting for. Others, including contributors, said I had it entirely backward and to sell or even short shares at that point.(Source: https://blog.v-comply.com)That was July of 2017.Since then the stock has doubled and nearly precisely to my thesis - a thesis which stated it was indeed timing issues with deals closing for the relatively small company ($330M in annual revenue) and the market was not in trouble. Not only has CyberArk gone from $41 per share to a recent high of $84 but the company has found another gear and my bullish thesis was just given additional points via Q3 earnings. When some might say to take chips off the table on a comfortable double in 12 months, I see reasons to stay in and even buy as growth has reaccelerated.After reporting Q3 2018 earnings with blowout numbers along with Q4 guidance which exceeded the company's typical less-than-inline-to-consensus routine, I had to take another look as I was somewhat surprised by the strength this quarter. A quick cruising altitude view shows us the company beat expectations by 7% on the top line and 77% on a non-GAAP basis and 266% on a GAAP basis for the bottom line.Net income numbers are where I'm intrigued though there's nothing to walk past on the revenue numbers, so let's start there. The company initially guided for 21% growth for Q3 but delivered 30% growth. This compares to revenue growth of 18% for the year-ago quarter. Not wanting investors to think this quarter was a fluke, the company guided for 19% growth which was slightly above consensus but more importantly compares to last year's Q4 guidance of 17.5% growth. As we know, the company ultimately reported 25% revenue growth for Q4. If you've followed the company for any length of time you know management is exceptionally conservative and - save for the one hiccup last year - comfortably exceeds guidance regularly.Now, what caused such a vast increase in profits and cash flow is my real interest. It appears CyberArk has found an inflection point in its business where revenue now drops more easily to the bottom line. Let's start with what revenue is costing the company by comparing it year-over-year to Q3 of 2017, quarter-over-quarter to Q2 2018, and finally, the growth Q3 2017 saw year-over-year (to 2016's Q3).(Source: Company's Q3 2018 earnings release)What I see is the more the company brings to the top line the more leverage they have against the business. More revenue has not meant the same amount of cost for producing its products this year. As revenue has grown, gross profit has increased more. It's clear the company has found an inflection point in the business.Moreover, since last year revenue growth has accelerated to levels it once saw back in 2016. The stock opportunity presented itself when growth slowed in 2017, but the well-executing management team found where its focus needed to be and has brought life back to the top line, rewarding shareholders in the process.This is where I became the most interested. Clearly, the company needed to increase expenses to market and sell its products to bring in all that revenue.Right?(Source: Company's Q3 2018 earnings release)Not exactly it seems. Expenses grew 22% year-over-year compared with 31% revenue growth. What's even more interesting is sales and marketing increased only 15% year-over-year where in 2017 it rose 38% year-over-year. It's pretty clear selling more products has not put a strain on the company's operations. From what I see, management has refocused where and how it sells its products. It also doesn't hurt it has more products today than it did just two years ago.One of the more critical expenses is R&D which grew 31.7%, nearly in-line with revenue. I'm perfectly fine with this as long as revenue growth matches, as the development of new products and the improvement of current products are what will keep CyberArk competitive.This all led to the bottom line being met with an exceptional beat. Guidance for roughly $0.26 non-GAAP earnings per share was well under as earnings were reported at $0.48 per share. Consensus of $0.06 in GAAP earnings was blown out by the $0.22 the company reported.It's clear the company is executing well not only by bringing in new and supplemental business but also by executing well operationally. So it's great revenue growth has accelerated from where it was headed (down) but what's to say there's still more growth ahead?When investors look at CyberArk and read an executive summary of the company's business they conclude it provides niche products for a niche market. This is erroneous thinking. The thought usually is: it's not a firewall company nor a network security (in the typical sense) company so therefore it must be some niche segment of cybersecurity. Continuing to think this way will keep you from investing in the segments of the market CyberArk caters to and is expanding further into - segments where the money is, for both attacker and defender.Many folks think of firewalls, virus scanners, and malware blockers as the major markets of cybersecurity. And while they are large segments of the network and internet security market, they are commoditized. While everyone needs a firewall, it's not where the money is being made. If you look at companies like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT), for example, they primarily sell firewall and anti-virus type of products. You'll also notice their profitability is shakey or even non-existent - on a GAAP basis. Sure, the $1.28 in non-GAAP earnings last quarter looks good for PANW, but the real profitability of ($0.42) is what sticks out to me. The ability to produce, market, and sell a product cost-effectively is essential, and CyberArk has been executing to this end.A better way of thinking about cybersecurity starts when firewalls and virus scanners are considered commodities and privileged access, dev ops protection, and network containment are considered specialized and lucrative. There's a difference between specialized and niche. Niche implies small; meaning the market is only so big. Specialized doesn't contain market size, necessarily. Specialized means focusing on the attack vectors the enemy is hitting and evolving toward. It's no longer the era of firewall and virus-scanning - yes, you need them because you can't reopen an attack vector - but instead moving to where the nefarious actors are finding openings - in soft spots. Those openings are the employee in the company or the nurse at the bedside computer or the college student on the lab workstation. Yes, I'm talking about phishing - this is where the breaches are happening.And no company is immune or left out from these attacks.CyberArk has specialized in defending these new-era attack vectors. These vectors are where the money is for hackers because having the keys to the kingdom as one of the royal guards is way better than being the network intruder who shows up under some alias and can be unmasked. And, by following the hackers, you follow the money to defend against it.Companies in 2018 have figured out defending the front gate is not enough, they must protect the inner courtyard as well. Some of it has been driven by incidents (which have not stopped, by the way) and some of it has been driven by compliance for new regulations. Businesses are also figuring out companies like CyberArk are the ones who already have the mature products to handle it. Not just the products available today, mind you, as CyberArk has made an acquisition to the tune of at least one a year since and including 2015. This means the company continues to grow its technology, IP, and portfolio to cross-sell and up-sell its clients. This is where I'm seeing the acceleration of growth coming from as deals are getting larger and as the customer base has grown 37% in the first nine months over last year's same nine months.There's no denying the company has found what companies are requiring to secure themselves, but they've also found the point in which its business has crossed over to dropping new wins and new revenue straight to the bottom line. It's clear CyberArk has found its place in the market and has not only put the throttle to the firewall but has also found another gear. I'd be a buyer of shares on any weakness, particularly in the gap it created at earnings which will be closed with a dip below $72 per share.If you'd like to be made aware of my opinion and analysis in the future on CyberArk and other tech companies, then I encourage you to follow me by clicking the ""Follow"" link at the top of this page next to my name."
4242242,24361,2019-02-19T18:03:30-05:00,"CyberArk delivered a much better than expected fourth quarter and raised guidance for the first quarter, as the company benefits from growing adoption of Privileged Access Management.Between distracted and/or less competitively-focused rivals, growing awareness of the value/need for PAM, and tailwinds for new offerings, CyberArk looks well-placed for 20%-plus revenue growth.CyberArk is a high-quality growth story trading a little beyond my fair value range; it's a tempting candidate for an exception to my normal price/value discipline.","I did give CyberArk (CYBR) one of my rare, “I don’t care so much about the valuation, I like the opportunity” calls back in December, and the shares have shot up by about a third since then. Granted, picking almost anything in late December was a good way to make your stock-picking skill look better, but CyberArk helped its own cause with a very strong fourth-quarter result and guidance that, even with CyberArk’s customary conservatism, looks pretty good.Yeah, the valuation is still a sticking point for me, as the shares are above my view of fair value, but I also know that valuation alone rarely stops a growth stock from going up, and I won’t be slightly surprised if CyberArk has another beat-and-raise in its pocket. Given the long-term potential of Privileged Access Management (or PAM) and CyberArk’s strong position in that market, I can sympathize with a “buy it anyway” attitude, but I’ll probably wait in the hope of a better price.I’m not much into the typical investment hyperbole you see, but “trounce” seems like a fitting word to describe CyberArk’s performance relative to sell-side expectations in the fourth quarter.Revenue rose 36% in the quarter, beating expectations by more than 13%, with license revenue growing 38% and beating expectations by 20%. Within the license figure, about 40% was new business, and it looks as though average deal prices were up about 10% from last year. Maintenance revenue was also strong, with 33% growth in the quarter. Deferred revenue rose 42% and billings rose 23%, beating expectations by 10%. If you want to pick nits about the quarter, I suppose you could complain that billings “only” beat by 10%, and that the percentage of long-term deferred revenue continues to rise (up from 36% last year to a little over 38%).Software businesses are highly leverageable, and it should be no surprise that a strong revenue beat led to an even stronger earnings performance. Gross margin improved more than two points from the prior year (non-GAAP, of course), and 150 bps from the prior quarter. Operating income more than doubled from the year-ago quarter, with a 1,200 bp improvement in operating revenue and a 42% beat relative to the sell-side average estimate.While CyberArk's management tends to play it conservatively with guidance, there was still positive news here. The midpoint of management’s first-quarter guidance was about 8% above the prior expectation, and although management did guide to lower operating margin in 2018, this was not a big surprise to me given the likely need to do some “catch-up spending” in sales and marketing. Given the “sales execution” issues at companies like Check Point (CHKP), Palo Alto (PANW), and other software companies from time to time, I think proper care and feeding of the sales force is an underrated (and apparently surprisingly difficult) task for senior management in the software sector.There’s a lot I like about CyberArk, and it starts with the strength of the underlying market. PAM is only just starting to get widespread acknowledgement as an important part of the enterprise security puzzle, and I believe growing recognition and adoption of its importance will lead to wider adoption across end-markets. CyberArk was recently getting about 30% of its revenue from the banking vertical (and another 10% from insurance), and I think there’s a lot of room for this to grow. To that end, I’d note that Gartner is forecasting nearly 20% annual growth in the PAM market through 2022.I also believe CyberArk is well-positioned within its industry. Most of the company’s big rivals, enough to make up about 30% of the market by revenue, have been acquired within the last year or so and those moves have disrupted the businesses of BeyondTrust, Lieberman, Avecto, Centrify, and CA. In the case of Centrify, the company is also undergoing a significant restructuring that has seen meaningful headcount reduction and a split of the IDaaS and PAM businesses.CA is an interesting case, too. Broadcom (AVGO) bought this business for its margin and cash flow potential, and management has said that they’re restructuring the business to focus on top 500 accounts. While that may not fully apply to CA’s PAM business, I believe CA is less likely to invest in SG&A and go “elephant hunting”, possibly putting one of CyberArk’s chief rivals at a disadvantage.These disruptions won’t last forever, but I do think it helps lay the groundwork for a few more strong quarters at CyberArk and it may give the company an early head start that proves difficult to surmount.In addition to a healthy security spending environment and a growing prioritization (or at least recognition of) toward PAM spending, CyberArk has some company-specific factors in play too. The company’s bundled approach is still relatively new, as is its cloud portfolio, and both can still grow well from here. I’d also note that CyberArk enjoys the upper right-most position in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for the PAM space. Say what you will about Gartner’s methodology, but CyberArk has shown that they can innovate ahead of the market (skating to where the puck is going to be, to borrow that overused Gretzky quote) and the fact remains that a lot of company’s use that Magic Quadrant as a starting point for their purchasing decisions (CyberArk shares the upper right square with BeyondTrust, Centrify, and CA).The more I dig into CyberArk and PAM, the more bullish I get on the opportunity. With that, I’m looking for 20% annualized revenue growth over the next five years versus 19% before (with a starting point that is now 30% higher) and long-term revenue growth of around 16%. Relative to Gartner’s forecast for PAM market growth, then, I am expecting CyberArk to be a share-gainer from what already appears to be a leadership position (sizing the PAM market is frustratingly difficult).I also expect further margin and FCF leverage from the business, with long-term adjusted FCF margins in the mid-to-high 20%’s. With the additional margin/FCF leverage, I expect FCF growth of over 20% on a long-term annualized basis.Between discounted cash flow and a modeling algorithm I created for software companies that factors in both growth and margins, I think a credible fair value range for CyberArk today is $85 to $95.Clearly, the market is at least temporarily more bullish on CyberArk than I am, as the shares are currently over $100. Although I’ve made the case before for investors to show some flexibility on valuation when it comes to CyberArk, and I still believe that to some extent, I’m not as keen to chase the shares now. Security stocks usually give you second chances (albeit sometimes from much higher levels), and CyberArk will likely follow that pattern. Accordingly, I’m inclined to wait now in the hopes of a better price."

        CyberArk's standalone fair value range extends into the $80's, though a buyout could drive the stock even higher.","As far as I’m concerned, CyberArk (CYBR) is delivering the sort of results that a young company leading a growing (if not emerging) market ought to be delivering. Improved pricing and product positioning, better sales execution, and increasing customer awareness of the importance of privileged access management (or PAM) and secure DevOps (a software development methodology) all seem to be coming together as a strong tailwind for CyberArk going into 2019.I liked the CyberArk story back in mid-2018, but was less excited about the valuation. The shares are up since then, but not so much that I’m really kicking myself and particularly relative to what I see as stronger underlying improvement in the business. I do worry about the risk of further market de-rating (in other words, lower multiples for stocks in general and tech stocks in particular), but CyberArk does seem undervalued and I’m reluctant to get too fussy about valuation with a strong operating story that still has room to deliver meaningful growth in the coming years.Over the past year or so, CyberArk management has made a few adjustments to its basic sales model that seem to be paying off. Earlier in 2018, the company started using a bundled pricing approach that combined four products (including Enterprise Password Vault and Privileged Session Manager) into a unified offering priced on a per-user basis. As part of an overall simplification of the pricing model that made the cost of CyberArk’s offerings more transparent to end-users, it seems to have improved customer acquisition – the new customer count was up 37% on a year-to-date basis through the third quarter, with the company adding another 200 customers in the third quarter, bringing the total to over 4,200. CyberArk has also been strengthening its system integrator partnerships. Management doesn’t seem to talk about this as much as some of its other efforts, but in doing some due diligence calls this came up fairly often. Bringing on new enterprise software systems is never easy, but CyberArk seems to be doing what it can to make deployment easier and I believe that’s an important “blocking and tackling” function.CyberArk also seems to be doing a good job of leveraging past investments in sales and marketing. Sales and marketing spending jumped in 2017 to almost 45% of revenue from around 40% in the two prior years (and 40% in the third quarter of this year) and management increased the sales headcount by about 30% in 2017. Those additions seem to be helping drive sales acceleration, particularly as it often takes more feet on the ground when you expand from targeting mostly large enterprises to more small-to-medium-sized businesses. All things considered, I like where CyberArk is situated going into 2019. There are some concerns of slowing growth in 2019, but I don’t believe it’s going to translate into meaningful slowdowns in security spending unless the bottom unexpectedly drops out. To that end, a Gartner survey released back in October suggests cybersecurity remains a high priority among corporate CIOs. CyberArk has been reporting broad strength across its end-market verticals, and even those verticals that have been seeing some signs of a slowdown in their own end-markets don’t seem to be slowing their spending on security. Likewise, I think businesses are well aware of the need to protect newer vectors like cloud and mobile (let alone IoT).In addition to growing awareness of the value and important of privileged access management, which helps users protect themselves from internal threats (in contrast to vendors like Palo Alto (PANW) and Check Point (CHKP) that are generally more focused on external threats to users), CyberArk is expanding the functionality of its offerings.The company introduced Privilege Cloud back in the summer of 2018, allowing customers to get Privileged Access Security as a subscription-based cloud service (which can be a more affordable option for smaller customers). CyberArk’s Endpoint Privilege Manager is also getting more notice as system administrators are seeing more sophisticated attempts to steal administrator credentials from employee systems (which are often put there for diagnostic or troubleshooting tasks). CyberArk is also seeing more interest in its Conjur and Application Identification Manager products as securing the DevOps process becomes increasingly important to customers.I also believe that CyberArk is benefitting, and will continue to benefit in 2019, from disruption among its competitors. Several of CyberArk’s leading competitors have seen M&A activity in 2018. CA was acquired by Broadcom (AVGO), and Broadcom has already begun its post-close hack-and-slash large-scale firings, and it’s unclear to me how much that will impact the relevant security business (Xceedium). Bomgar acquired both Lieberman and BeyondTrust (one of CyberArk’s prime competitors), and while Bomgar may well emerge as a more formidable competitor down the road, integrating those operations is going to be disruptive. Likewise with Centrify which has seen a significant restructuring and a sale of the company (to Thoma Bravo) in 2018.As these companies work through the process of integration – including employee redundancies, reprioritization of development efforts, and product integration – I expect CyberArk to have an opportunity to pick off talented employees and take advantage of any missteps in the sales process. It won’t give CyberArk any sort of insurmountable lead, but it should pave the way for some incremental sales wins that might otherwise have gone to competitors (or at least been more competitive).With two very strong quarters of 30%-plus revenue growth, my revenue estimate for 2018 is almost 5% higher than it was at midyear, and I’ve likewise boosted my revenue expectations in the coming years. In addition to healthy overall development of the PAM market, I believe CyberArk can win some incremental business in 2019 from competitor disruption, and my 2019 estimate is now also about 5% higher. Overall, my long-term growth rate has gone up about 1% from these near-term improvements as well as a slightly more bullish outlook on the long-term demand for PAM and DevOps security.CyberArk has also impressed me in terms of its margin leverage and operational execution, with non-GAAP operating margin leverage accelerating and delivering a 20%-plus number in the second quarter and a mid-20%’s number in the third quarter. I’m reluctant to fully assume that this is a new normal, though, and I do think operating margin could retreat modestly in 2019 (by a point or so) as CyberArk needs to once again recharge its sales and marketing budget. Real acceleration in operating margin may not be apparent until late in 2020 or 2021, then, though I consider that more of a perception/sentiment risk.I’ve modestly boosted my margin assumptions over the next five years (by around two points), but I’ve increased them more significantly on a long-term basis, as I think there’s more inherent margin leverage potential here than I previously expected, and I think that will emerge more strongly as revenues grow toward $750 million to $1 billion.CyberArk isn’t markedly undervalued on a discounted cash flow basis (I see a high single-digit long-term annualized return from here), but that’s actually pretty compelling considering that growth software stories often trade well above apparent “fair value” on a cash flow basis. CyberArk shares do look more undervalued on an EV/revenue basis, with a fair value around $80. For this calculation I’m using long-term data on what the market has normally paid for given levels of growth and margin from software companies; until fairly recently the sector was trading at a double-digit premium to historical valuation norms, and CyberArk looks undervalued even if that premium vanishes entirely.I do believe the attractive characteristics of the PAM market will attract more competition, but I believe CyberArk has a strong initial leadership position that should prove durable. There are other, competitive, mousetraps out there, but they’re often marketed on the basis of “good enough, but cheaper”. In much the way that Palo Alto built itself on a sales message of operational superiority, I believe CyberArk can continue to grow and defend its leadership by offering stronger performance if not the best performance at a given price point. I also believe CyberArk’s market position could attract buyout interest and I’d be very surprised if the acquisition price wasn’t above $90.Buying a high-growth software company in a wobbly, nervous market is not my favorite thing to do. I do see a risk of a broader market sell-off continuing into 2019, and I can’t make any promises that CyberArk won’t get hit in the process. That said, you can always come up with reasons not to buy a stock and I think the growth, valuation, and risk/reward opportunity here are pretty attractive today, making this at least a consideration for a watch list if not a buyable idea today."

Hoping for an acquisition is still a speculative move for the shareholders.,"CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) is unique compared to other fast-growing IT security vendors. Thanks to high gross margins and rational R&D and marketing expenses, the company operates at a profit.The most attractive aspect, though, is the potential for the company to be acquired, thanks to its business in a niche security market. CyberArk's products don't overlap with the other IT security vendors' solutions. Also, the small size, the net cash position, and the profits favor a potential acquisition.But the market valuation of the company is not cheap. Relying on an acquisition to realize value is a speculative proposition for the shareholders.Image source: TBIT via PixabayCyberArk can be compared with a group of IT security companies that have been growing revenue at a fast pace: Fortinet (FTNT), Palo Alto (PANW), Splunk (SPLK), and Proofpoint (PFPT). The graph below shows revenue grew by about 80% over the last three years.CYBR Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsCyberArk's revenue size is smaller, though. But the company differentiates from the others with its margins. Despite the lack of scale, gross margin stays around 85%. The other security vendors realize a gross margin between approximately 70% and 80%.CYBR Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe higher gross margins are due to the nature of the business. CyberArk generates revenue from licenses, consulting, and maintenance. The company doesn't sell hardware.And thanks to reasonable R&D and marketing expenses, CyberArk operates at a profit, with a net margin at about 8%. By contrast, except for Fortinet, other fast-growing IT security companies are still generating losses.CYBR Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsFor instance, during Q3 2018, CyberArk's R&D and marketing represented 15% and 40% of revenue. Even with the small scale, the company is already leveraging its operations as revenue grew faster than the expenses.The company realized a high 38% cash flow margin. The high cash flow margin is comparable with the other IT security companies. These companies recognize the revenue from contracts over time, while they receive the payments at the beginning of these contracts.CyberArk is an IT security company. The business is different from the vendors I listed above, though. The company proposes solutions to manage privileged accounts. It is a niche market, and none of the other vendors above compete in this area. While the solution adds value to a security framework, it is considered complementary. Companies buy firewalls, endpoint solutions, and proxies before considering solutions to manage privileged accounts. It's not necessarily a correct mindset, but it's my observation based on my 15 years' experience as IT engineer.In any case, there are many reasons for CyberArk to be an ideal candidate for acquisition:Besides the high-growth publicly traded companies I have listed above, some other companies like Cisco (CSCO) and Check Point (CHKP) are also potential acquirers.Also, Francisco Partners showed interest in the privileged access area. The private equity firm recently acquired BeyondTrust, Bomgar, Lieberman, and Avecto.Thus, considering CyberArk's profile and the current M&A activities, the potential to be acquired exists. Also, the ownership of the company wouldn't block such a transaction. The two main shareholders own less than 10% and 6% of the shares.Source: Annual report 2017Besides the acquisition potential, let's have a look at the valuation. From an EV/Sales perspective, the company is in the top range of the valuations, excluding Splunk.CYBR EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsThis valuation makes sense as most of the other vendors in this graph don't operate at a profit yet.The PE and the EV/EBITDA ratios at 106 and 58 are high, even when considering the expected 2018 revenue growth of about 26%. But the EV/FCF valuation is less elevated due to the high cash generation potential I described above.CYBR PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsIn any case, the market currently doesn't value CyberArk at a cheap price. An acquisition would represent an opportunity for the shareholders. But waiting for an acquirer to show interest at these prices is a speculative strategy.CyberArk is part of the fast-growing IT security companies. But its profile is different. The company generates profits thanks to high gross margins and reasonable R&D and marketing expenses.Due to its business in a niche security market, the company is an ideal target for an acquisition. By acquiring CyberArk, a more generic IT security vendor will enhance its portfolio. The acquirer can also scale CyberArk's solutions without having to deal with overlapping products.Considering the high valuation, an acquisition represents an attractive short-term catalyst for the shareholders. But hoping for an acquisition is still a speculative strategy."

The mucking makes FB shares a dicey investment for small investors. Don't worry about the financial technicals because the mess at FB is all about fundamentals. Talking with, engaging or acquiring CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ: CYBR) might help FB management, for instance, wend its way out of the copse, thorns, and thickets.On Seeking Alpha during the month of November ’18, the site will have hosted some four-dozen articles, news reports and comments from investment houses about FB, its prospects for deeper losses, drifting customers and security challenges. My undergraduate university students laugh when I tell them I saw something of interest on FB. This generation does not open it. “FB’s for old people” one of them blurted out. I didn’t take offense, but should FB?Yet, FB maintains gigantic numbers of daily users and advertisers (in the broadest definition of the term).CEO Mark Zuckerberg built FB selling himself like the phalanx of business heroes who built their start-ups. His sidekick is COO Sheryl Kara Sandberg. She is a celebrity in her own right and hero to women for her lofty place in the misogynist world of high tech. She garnered sympathy and attention for unfortunately becoming a young widow, young single mother and a political and social policy activist.I want to focus on the data crisis consuming managements’ time and diverting their attention from problems like turned-off millennials. Critics pin the crisis directly on Zuckerberg and Sandberg for not having more secure procedures in place and worse, mismanaging the crisis into a public relations scandal. The crisis is a function of the obsession government analysts and corporate marketers have with BIG Data. The crisis for FB morphed into a personal hit with social activists, Congresspeople and disgruntled investors calling for the resignations of the CEO and COO. Both have adamantly refused to date.To underpin my point, an article in Variety offers one the most understandable explanations of the cause and mishandling of the crisis: The scandal in a nutshell:Tech is the problem portal, so the solution to the crisis must be a tech solution, according to Zuckerberg. The solution might be found at CyberArk I’ve covered before on S.A.Forbes reports Facebook is reportedly on the acquisition hunt for a cybersecurity firm with the right software to protect the company’s billions of users from a compromise of their information. “A splash acquisition of a reputable cybersecurity firm could be another huge stride toward improving its credibility and silencing critics” of FB management. Engaging CYBR will make the splash FB needs.CYBR is one of the stocks I prefer investors hold in their portfolios. I intend to buy it again on the share price dip from a 52-week high of $84.21 to +$66. The company has several attractive features, among them CyberArk's new CyberArk Privileged Session Manager for Cloud. The new service supports major cloud (IaaS and PaaS) platforms, SaaS applications and social media for major name brand companies and ""leading social media applications - Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram."" Also, the new cloud service offersFirst, CYBR is a stable growing company in what has become one of the world’s essential industries. Cybersecurity is as much a part of the economic fabric as automakers, housing, financial services, retailing, and healthcare. Every major military hardware company like General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) is heavily investing in information technology services, and all are searching for ways to protect against hacking.CYBR based in Israel is at the intersection of total commitment to cyber-tech and the burgeoning field of Privileged Identity Management.I have previously written about Israeli-based tech companies as good investments. Israel built a powerful industry from scratch in its arsenal wizard weapons. Israel relies on cybersecurity for protection against attacks from lone wolf terrorists, international aerospace rocket attacks, as well as for offense against other nations developing existential threats to Israel. There is a healthy and lively web of cooperation and admiration between Israel’s cybersecurity-military-espionage complex, all supported with cover and investment money from the government.BlueStar TA-BIGITech Israel Technology ETF (NASDAQ: ITEQ) that I recommended has done well for investors, capitalizing on the cybersecurity business in Israel. It remains a strong Buy on my radar if investing in individual companies is not settling to an investor. The share price is down in November to under $33 from a September high of $36.75. Overall, the Israel cyber industry product exports have been exponentially swelling annually. CYBR continues to benefit from cumulative growth and relationships.My second reason for recommending CYBR is its new cloud service and redoubtable leadership position in Privileged Information Management or PIM. It is “the monitoring and protection of superuser accounts in an organization’s IT environments. Oversight is necessary so that the greater access abilities of super control accounts are not misused or abused. Unmanaged superuser data accounts can lead to loss or theft of sensitive corporate information or malware that can compromise the network.”SourceCYBR is a leading vendor in the PIM sector. It ranks highest in two divisions. Its software offers strong password safety, session management, and privileged threat analytics. CYBR scores highest among eleven top PIM vendors in customer satisfaction, privileged threat/behavior analytics, privileged delegation, and escalation, privileged session monitoring plans, and container support plans. According to analyst Matthew McLaughlin, PIM is used by “less than half of large enterprises currently; however, estimates are that this figure will increase to 75% by 2020.” That gives CYBR plenty of market growth potential.CyberArk's clients are primarily in financial services, energy, retail, and healthcare markets. With the expanding innovation and new service, there is more opportunity to work with companies in all realms of Internet users. For instance, CYBR can be a resource with proactive defense strategies for targets like FB in mitigating Pass-the-Hash attacks. CYBR already is working with a global communications company in this realm.CYBR is ranked in no particular order among the ten best companies in the field for 2018. ""Over 80% of external cyber attacks involved weak or stolen privileged credentials. Furthermore, if the privileged users have access to assets outside their job responsibilities, the consequences of a stolen password could be even more disastrous. These concerns don’t even cover insider threats, which can be magnified by privileged users.""Then there are rumors CEO Zuckerberg believes he’s been too long away from Israel. Other tech executives are here regularly from countries all over the world looking for corporate acquisition targets and partnerships. Bolstering Zuckerberg's suspected interest is news he recently joined the Secret Tel Aviv group. in November 2018.Source Foreign Investors' Activity in Israel is Expanding, According to a New IVC Research Center ReportThird, I like CYBR because it is a solid company with strong management. It has momentum. It beat all expectations as reported by Seeking Alpha: gains 13.7% on Q3 results that beat EPS and revenue estimates. Q4 guidance has in-line revenue of $94.75M to $96.25M (consensus: $94.92M) and upside EPS of $0.58 to $0.60 (consensus: $0.51). Revenue: License, $46.1M (+29% Y/Y; consensus: $42M); Maintenance and Professional Services, $38.5M (+33%; consensus: $36.7M). Upside FY18 guidance has revenue of $328.9M to $330.4M (consensus: $323M) and EPS of $1.75 to $1.77 (consensus: $1.47).Oppenheimer raised its CYBR target price originally at $75 to $89 after earnings were recently reported. Oppenheimer holds an Outperform rating. After earnings were reported the share price jumped to +$79. The shares thus have an upside for investors moving quickly. CYBR is expecting to have annual gross revenues of $320M to $324M, nearing a growth rate of 24%. Efforts and resources at CYBR are focused on customer acquisition with spending on marketing +20%. CYBR hasCYBR management regularly surveys cyber professionals from companies. 2018 is their 11th report taken from 1300 respondents. Among the results of this year’s survey, CYBR concludes “46% of organizations fail to change security strategy after a cyber attack.” Without a change to privileged accounts and securing credentials and secrets, nothing in the system is fully protected. Security inertia dominates far too many companies, lending gravitas to predictions for growth at CYBR.According to CYBR, the new service broadly expands the company's reach. It supports ""customers’ defense in depth strategies, it’s vitally important to balance easy access to cloud platforms and web applications with policy-driven access controls, security workflows, and a consistent strategy across on-premises and cloud environments.” FB again, as an example, does not have a great deal of time to engage with a security firm, because ardent social media are exasperated. If Zuckerberg hasn’t spoken to CYBR he ought to put it high on his agenda. Even if FB does not do a deal with CYBR, investors getting in now will make money in the long term from this important and growing company that is rightly managed and well-received in the investment marketplace."
4121345,22148,2017-11-06T15:54:28-05:00,CyberArk rebounded from a big Q2 miss to report solid Q3 numbers.The company faces limited license revenue growth that will likely cause the stock to trade weak into year end.The stock has generally provided opportunities to own on dips.,"The cybersecurity software space is always difficult to analyze. Just about every stock in the sector eventually encounters a quarter of missing estimates due to deals not closing as expected.My investment thesis on CyberArk (CYBR) has constantly warned about paying up for the stock due to this risk. Now that the stock dip following disappointing Q4 guidance is out of the way is CyberArk finally worth buying at $40?After the 3% dip on Friday, CyberArk now trades for about $1.5 billion. The company has cash of $297 million placing the enterprise value around $1.2 billion.The privileged account protectors trade at levels not seen much since the initial IPO pop. Basically, investors have done well buying the stock below $45 on multiple occasions.The biggest question remains as to whether CyberArk truly had issues closing deals specifically Europe or some sort of competitive threat that caused the big Q2 miss. Considering the return to strong growth in EMEA during Q3 one has to consider that issue resolved, but the weak license revenue growth of only 7.5% in Q3 will keep investors lingering questions. The company did forecast improved license growth in 2018 providing a reason to own the stock on dips.As mentioned at the time of the warning, Imperva (IMPV) had a similar issue Q2 last year that crushed the stock. The company has seen a strong rebound in business, but the stock hasn't held the bounces in the last year.This is a prime example how CyberArk can solve the sales cycle issues and potentially government impact to grow the business long term. The stock though depends on buying at the right price at the right time.As mentioned above, the stock has consistently seen some support below $45. The key though is that the valuation multiple is a lot more appealing now after the company has produced years of revenue growth without the stock price moving. The EV to Revenue multiple now sits below 5 and only dipped this low at the start of 2016.CYBR EV to Revenues (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe stronger profits and cash flows justify a higher multiple for CyberArk. The big miss for Imperva led to a large quarterly loss. The big Q2 miss for CyberArk left the company still generating net income of $8.9 million in the next quarter and positive cash flows YTD of $44.6 million.The key investor takeaway is that CyberArk remains a stock to own on dips. The ups and downs in the quarterly results of cybersecurity stocks are difficult to predict, but the value exists when the opportunity regularly presents itself."

As technology advances, data has become incredibly valuable not only to the businesses but also to outside invaders and malicious insiders. CyberArk protects the privileged accounts what it calls ""the keys to the IT kingdom.""There are countless examples of hackers taking control of privileged accounts.SourceBut perhaps the most high profile attack was revealed in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the Russian interference of the 2016 presidential election. Delving into the market that CyberArk satisfies and the strength of the business reveals that the company is a strong buy and hold for the long term.The Mueller Report was in the news for some time following accusations of Donald Trump's campaign conspiring with the Russians to rig the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. While no coordination between Trump's campaign and the Russian government was found, it was clear there were indeed Russian entities that sought to influence the election. One of the most well-known intrusions is the hacking of networks tied to the Clinton campaign, DCCC, and DNC. The most intriguing aspect is just how these hackers gained access to secure networks.This is one example of the far-reaching effects of compromised privileged accounts. While this is clearly election interference, there is no way to point to these events as affecting the outcome of the election. But even the fact that this reality is remotely possible speaks volumes for the importance of protecting privileged accounts. Whether or not the outcome in this hypothetical scenario was for better or for worse is a matter of opinion. The overarching idea is that a United States election quite possibly could have been altered by a breach of privileged accounts.These revelations should sound the alarms for governments, businesses, and other entities that have valuable digital assets. I'm assuming that groups associated with a prominent political party in the United States would have numerous data safeguards. The fact that hackers compromised privileged accounts leads me to believe this is a vulnerable area of cybersecurity.Incidents like these lead me to believe the smart people in charge of large powerful entities must be considering additional ways to protect privileged accounts to prevent situations with disastrous consequences. Cyber attacks have become commonplace in the digital landscape, and compromised privileged accounts gives hackers the keys to the kingdom. Breaches like this must churn the stomachs of officials and executives. They will continue to turn to companies like CyberArk to reduce the risk of attacks on their networks.CyberArk is structurally very strong, an important component of what I look for from my investments. While a company's valuation can be debated on the strength of its story, there is no debating about strong cash flows. CyberArk has no debt and its capital-light software business is highly scalable. I love companies that are not only innovative but also have proven to be self-sustaining and profitable. CyberArk checks these boxes.According to this market forecast, the privileged identity management segment is expected to grow by a stunning 32% through 2023. CyberArk is well positioned to take advantage of these trends and I modeled the company matching the growth rate of the industry. CyberArk has posted 86% gross margins consistently. I expect that to continue as it retains pricing power as the leader in privileged access management, according to Gartner's magic quadrant below.SourceI have R&D expenses continuing to grow at 30%, in line with revenue as the company will have to continue to spend to maintain that advantage. I also expect SG&A to increase by 20% per year as the company gains advantages of scale. This will result in operating margins of 36% in 2023. I modeled a 21% tax rate, which the company paid in 2018. I used a terminal multiple of 19.3x based on projections of the forward P/E ratio of the S&P 500 information technology sector. I think this is reasonable because I expect growth beyond the forecasted period. Discounting these cash flows by 7% results in a fair value of $151 per share. This neglects the approximately $8 per share in cash, so I believe the stock is presently worth about $160, which is on the higher end of Wall Street's price targets.Several analysts on the most recent call questioned the company's guidance and got an oblique response:The company expects just 20% growth in the medium term. This analyst was bringing up a potential slowdown in the back half of 2018, if the company exceeded that targeted growth in the subsequent quarter. I think guidance is conservative, and I don't think investors should read too much into short-term results, and the logic is simple.SourceRevenue growth was not linear in the past, and it may not be linear in the future. Revenue has grown by 39% compounded annually over the past five years. In 2017, revenue only grew by 21%, but that accelerated to 31% over 2018. Had an investor been scared away by slowing revenue growth, they would have missed out on a huge run.Data by YChartsCyberArk has quality fundamentals and will continue to grow into its valuation. Application software stocks in the S&P 500 are valued at an average of 35x forward earnings while CyberArk sits at 51x forward earnings. While this is expensive, the group of software stocks as a whole is expensive. Software stocks trade for seemingly stretched valuation because of the quality of the businesses and clear path towards high cash flow generation. CyberArk's compelling position is in a high growth segment in which we can see clear demand.The risk is that CyberArk fails to maintain its advantages over the competition. Should the competition close in, it will be tough for CyberArk to continue to grow at a rapid pace. I will be keeping a close eye on figures like Gartner's Magic Quadrant to understand CyberArk's competitive threat. This gives the company a huge advantage moving forward. As long as the company continues to innovate and stay ahead of the pack, growth will come. More businesses and entities will recognize the importance of protecting the privileged accounts.While my model only assumes about 23% upside, I believe in the CyberArk story. We pay to protect and insure our most valuable assets. As these valuable assets increasingly become digitized, there must be new sophisticated methods of protecting these assets.My cost basis is $117, and I would not hesitate to add below that level. CyberArk investors are buying a strong business that is a leader in a valuable, emerging market. The only reasonable argument to not owning the stock is valuation. I believe there is still significant runway for share appreciation over the long term. The increase in cybercrime is a secular tailwind for CyberArk. As long as there are bad guys seeking to disrupt by taking advantage of privileged accounts, there will be demand for companies like CyberArk to stop them."

The annual cost of cyber-security attacks in the United States alone is estimated at approximately $100 billion, and that figure will only grow with the increase in technology use across all platforms. However, with such an increase in the use of technology and the growing issue of cyber-security threats, the number of companies competing to protect the networks of Fortune 500 companies has become intensely competitive. CyberArk (CYBR) provides cyber-security solutions that many other companies do, but its core product occupies a niche space that it has positioned itself as the industry leader in, privileged account management. This security solution, along with diversification in its offerings from recent strategic acquisitions, and the general tailwinds in the industry provide a nice setup for CyberArk to trend higher in the near future.Privileged account management, to put it simply, restricts unauthorized users from accessing a company's most confidential and important data and information. Privileged account management is used by less than half of large enterprises currently; however, estimates are that this figure will increase to 75% by 2020. As cyber-security attacks continue to grow, it will be increasingly essential for security managers of large firms to protect its most critical information, and this is where solutions developed by CyberArk come into the equation.A privileged account is how administrators access database servers, firewalls, application management systems, and other tools. Privileged accounts are pretty broad and cover a range of technology tools that are used every single day by almost every company. Yet despite the fact that less than half of companies used PAM security solutions, the majority of cyber-security attacks and successful breaches involve privileged accounts. According to Forrester Research, a stunning 80% of security breaches involved privileged credentials and privileged accounts. Of security breaches involving privileged accounts, 82% took over a week to even detect. PAM solutions from CyberArk provide continuous, real-time support and detection services that prevent these breaches.CyberArk Investor Presentation, November 2017.CyberArk has seen rapid revenue growth in light of increased privileged account data breaches. Revenue has grown at a CAGR of 43% in the past 5 years, increasing from just $47 million in 2012 to over $250 million today. Their customers include 50% of the Fortune 500 and approximately 25% of the Global 2000.Despite competition from several large and smaller players, the International Data Corporation recognized CyberArk as the forefront of the industry with both leading capabilities and strategies as well as the largest revenue base and customer base in the PAM security space.IDC MarketScapeQuarter 1 revenues for CyberArk in 2018 came in at $71.8 million, up 21% from last year's Q1 revenues. Q1 revenue figures beat management's guidance of $69.5 million. Q1 free cash flow reported at $31 million, significantly up from last year's $15 million in free cash flow. CyberArk faced increased operational expenses in Q1 2018; however, most of this can be attributed to an increase in employee headcount as the company begins to expand. As bookings continue to increase, earnings should reflect this.CyberArk rolled out the CyberArk Marketplace at the 2018 RSA Conference, offering a platform for IT and security professionals to use its industry leading privileged access security with seamless integrative applications. The Marketplace provides plug-ins and tools created by CyberArk as well as other software companies that create a simplistic and efficient security management system for its clients. CyberArk has taken the lead to partner with leading software companies to use their technology and integrate it into their proprietary PAM security solution. Business Wire, 2018.Providing access for clients to create an individualized system for their companies allows CyberArk to further differentiate their niche privileged access business. It allows for companies to simply go onto the CyberArk Marketplace and install integrations with just a few clicks.With the growth of CyberArk's PAM business, it is beginning to utilize an acquisition made last May that helped CyberArk build out its DevOps technology. CyberArk acquired Conjur, which provides DevOps security software. Though DevOps is increasing efficiency and speed for organizations, the unification of software development and operation has also increased the different areas and ways in which security attacks and breaches can occur. The acquisition of Conjur allows CyberArk to now protect companies who utilize DevOps and increases their potential clients. Approximately 50% of companies use DevOps in some way, so integrating Conjur's technology into the CyberArk PAM platform will provide increased utilization by CIOs who manage the solutions that CyberArk offers.More recently, in March 2018, CyberArk acquired Vaultive, Inc, a cloud security company. CyberArk plans to build upon Vaultive's cloud technology and incorporate it into its privileged account management offering by providing its clients a cloud-native and mobile experience. It will also allow CyberArk to protect its clients from cyber attacks in the cloud. The International Data Corporation estimates that spending on cloud services and infrastructure will reach $277 billion by 2021, and the sales operations and financial applications that CyberArk's clients use require monitoring and continuous control. The acquisition will allow CyberArk to bring its privileged access management solution to modern applications for the foreseeable future.Despite the recent M&A activity with CyberArk, they have not had to significantly lever up to complete these acquisitions. Vaultive and Conjur were purchased almost entirely in cash, and CyberArk maintains a very conservative debt-equity of 0.42 with total liabilities of $161 million and total equity of $381 million. CyberArk as of March 2018 retains $227 million in cash, significantly more than its total liabilities, so it's a reasonable prediction that they may be keeping cash reserves in order to make another acquisition in the near future.The cyber-security market has faced heavy demand in recent years, and companies' requirement for efficient and capable solutions to protect their data is only expected to increase in coming years. Cyber-security spending by companies is growing at approximately 11% CAGR and is estimated to reach a market value of $232 billion by 2022. Because of CyberArk's unique position as being the industry leader in the privileged access management space within the cyber-security industry, CyberArk is well positioned in the cyber-secuirty space. Though CyberArk's stock is not cheap by any means, it is currently trading about 23% below its all-time high of $73 in June 2015 and has made a number of moves to give it a good probability of trending higher in the second half of 2018.It's important to keep in mind that although CyberArk maintains a strong moat over its competitors with its privileged access management solutions, smaller competitors including Thycotic are making strides and attempting to catch up even though they are much smaller. While CyberArk was really the first security firm to establish itself in this space, other firms are taking advantage of the growing demand for this service and have grown exponentially in recent shares, edging out slivers of market share. It will be important for CyberArk to not only use its market dominance but to continue to innovate in the space as innovation is what the younger and more nimble competitors thrive on to gain market share."

A lot of pundits called upsides, extracting bullish narratives from multiple angles. A lot was said to convince investors about the potentials of CyberArk. Sadly, this cyber play didn’t move an inch. Now that it has crashed, I hope we can perform a forensic analysis.How did we get here?CyberArk derives a huge portion of its revenue from sales of its Privileged Account Security Solution. This consists of an Enterprise Password Vault, SSH Key Manager, Session manager, App ID and Privileged Threat Analytics. The solutions are deployed to prevent privileged accounts on a network from attacks that have penetrated the perimeter defense. The assumption, of course, is that such attack was not blocked by a network firewall or detected by an IDS.Essentially, they are meant to complement other network security solutions, which means they are not sufficient to defend a network by themselves. More like security add-ons, they ensure zero exfiltration and contamination of data and devices on the network.This means organizations will mostly consider CyberArk only after deciding not to go ahead with add-ons offered by network security vendors.This strategy has proven successful for CyberArk as it has been able to secure market leadership in a niche portion of the cyber security market. However, as expected, a small niche only leads to a capped TAM. Some may argue that the proliferation of network devices and endpoints invalidates the capped TAM narrative, which is somewhat true; however, it doesn’t erase vulnerability to demand softness in seasons when buying is not on the high end.This has led to the shift from an organic growth strategy to an acquisition-driven strategy. It’s as if management understands the PAS gun is running out of ammo. Though, it is also interesting to know that technological shifts and a changing I.T. landscape mean CyberArk has to adapt to the latest trends regardless.This has spurred a series of acquisitions including names like Viewfinity and Conjur. By expanding from storing passwords and protecting privileged accounts, adapting to trends in cloud security means more opportunity to tweak and expand product features to rake in more revenue. Easily, the acquisition of Conjur exposes CyberArk to the growing DevOps market.According to Gartner:I project that trend ramping up while forming a baseline of support for growth in 2018 as CyberArk absorbs Conjur into its security portfolio. Though, layering acquisitions on top of its PAS solutions means CyberArk has compartmentalized key revenue drivers that are capable of standing alone via a strategy revision either in product design, marketing or sales. This will prevent a scenario in which TAM-expanding acquisitions end up falling into the market saturation fever.Going by its EV/Revenue and EV/EBITDA ratios, we can derive a clear view of CyberArk’s valuation compared to the competition which incorporates elements of growth and earnings.CYBR Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsThis factors in the idea that CyberArk plays in an industry which is still in a rapid growth mode with room for innovation at every level of the value chain. The chart above highlights CyberArk’s slumping growth. Given that the cyber security industry is expected to maintain low double-digit growth till 2020, this further highlights the low demand for CyberArk’s key revenue drivers.Therefore, I expect CyberArk to attract a modest EV/Sales multiple compared to fast-growth peers. However, the chart above depicts more optimism as the Street values CyberArk at a ratio slightly above its peers'. Given CyberArk’s cash position, it's not hard to fathom that the Street will expect more growth from acquisitions, hence the somewhat lofty expectations.Therefore, to test for overvaluation, we should expect the Street to value CYBR at a highly modest EV/EBITDA ratio, given the expense buckets that will be required to sustain the new growth cycle.CYBR EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YChartsInterestingly, CyberArk comes in reasonably valued as depicted in the chart above. It only dwarfs Barracuda (NYSE:CUDA) which is also battling growth issues.Clearly, the current valuation doesn’t provide ample opportunity to derive significant gains. I believe CyberArk has settled to its fair value after the recent sell-off, based on the soft Q2 guidance announced by management. I believe this gives a clearer picture of the cracks that are forming in the PAS market while highlighting the urgent need to onboard more products to sustain growth.2016 Gross & Profit Margin: Cyber Security Pure PlaysGoing forward, the only catalyst for more upside will be its profit ratios and balance sheet which are healthier compared to competition. In the absence of that, I believe CyberArk is a Hold at best and I see no rush to accumulate more positions."

Source: BloombergIn the article, 5 to Watch, CyberArk was suggested as a potential buy, given the ever increasing need for companies, governments, and individuals to ensure their data is robustly secured, in the face of a rising tide of cyber attacks. At the time of writing, CyberArk was valued at $49.72 a share, and with the exception of a brief part of March, the security solutions company was consistently up on this value, right up until May. Indeed, over the year to date, there were two strong sell opportunities, with shares climbing above the $55 mark in both February and May. A CYBR buy in January, with a February sale, could have seen you post 12% returns in just one month, whilst if you held on hoping for more, the same sell opportunity returned five months later. That said, CYBR never did hit the peaks some analysts forecast, and that potential $65 high, a forecast made by some analysts in the FT, seems a long way away. Furthermore, whilst there were some notable highs, CyberArk's overall week to week performance was a little sluggish, and certainly uneven.February highs were followed by a month long decline, albeit with some peaks as well as troughs, to $48.73, and the stock's recovery to $55.25 prove short-lived. CyberArk's stock fell 13% on the 12th of May, the day after its most recent earnings report was published. Despite this, yet again, CYBR recovered, but this time to the more modest level of $51 per share, a figure reached by the 13 th of July. The following day, after a reduction in the company's Q2 guidance, CYBR saw its shares plunge once more. On the 13th of July CyberArk was valued at $51 per share. By the end of trading on the 14th of July, this figure stood at $42.68, an almost 17% fall. As a result of this fall, CyberArk's year to date share price performance has slid heavily into the red, with the company's stock down 8.24% in value. In share price terms, it has been an uneven year, but not entirely a write-off. If you had invested in CYBR with a short term perspective, you likely made a significant profit, whilst if you were long on CyberArk, you likely still are and may see current lows as an opportunity to buy.CYBR income statement '12-'16. Source: FTThe fact remains that whilst CyberArk has taken a hit. But, it is by no means a poorly performing company. Had you been unaware of the company's previously stated forward guidance, and market expectations, CYBR's earning figures, despite reduced forecasts, might just have piqued your interest. Udi Mokady, CEO, was bullish about his company's prospects, and why not be? According to the company's last earning's report, quarterly revenue figures were up when compared with the previous year, with total revenues up 26%, licence revenues up 20%, and services revenues up 34%. Operating GAAP income was stable, whilst non-GAAP operating income rose by $2m year-over-year. Net income figures also revealed year-over-year increases, with GAAP net income almost doubling from $4.3m or $0.12 per share, to $7.5m and $0.21 per share. The company's cash reserves were up over $15m in the first six months of 2017, whilst the company's most recent forward guidance suggests third and fourth quarter total revenues of between $57-$57.5 million, figures which would mean yearly growth of upwards of 15%. Indeed, full yearly figures for 2017 are expected to show that CyberArk grew by more than 20%.CyberArk's CEO on the company's performance. Source: CyberArkThere are of course negatives surrounding the company, otherwise, investors would have had no reason to jump ship to the extent that they did. Forward guidance, when compared with early 2017 projections is disappointing. Q2 EPS figures are now expected to come in lower than originally thought, at around $0.23, as against $0.28, and with the company also trading at a large multiple of sales, investors feel entitled to expect better. Additionally, forward guidance for the remainder of the year, whilst by no means poor in real terms, if accurate, will see the company post yearly EPS figures between $1.18 and $1.22. Even if the top end figure is achieved, this would still represent a fall in EPS of around 4%. There's no reason for panic it's true, but some level of disappointment is understandable. Lastly, announced the same day as its last earnings report, CyberArk's purchase of Conjur, a smaller cybersecurity firm, may have led some investors to worry about a potential M&A related hit to CYBR's 2017 bottom line.CyberArk Earnings History & Estimates. Source: FTHow then ought one view CyberArk, as a solidly performing company with a lot of positives, or as at best a streaky performer in terms of its share price? One for the long haul, or one to miss? If anything, CyberArk's 2017 performance shows that the truth, as is often the case, lies somewhere in the middle. CyberArk is a streaky stock. Its highs are very often quickly followed by lows, yet the company seems to have quite a lot of resilience, and its share price can surely be expected to recover once again. Many analysts, including Bob Tarzey of Quocirca, and Rik Turner of Ovym, see CyberArk's recent purchase of Conjur as indicative of solid long-term planning, helping CyberArk to maintain its market leading position, whilst increasing its involvement in securing DevOps and Agile environments, and the company has retained its position as the overall leader of privilege management in the cybersecurity sector, according to KuppingerCole. Furthermore, taking CYBR's guidance with a pinch of salt, erring towards the positives might be a logical step, given the company's history of never getting its guidance quite right. Original Q1 2017 guidance, for instance, suggested EPS figures of between $0.21 and $0.23, yet figures of $0.28 put such forecasts firmly in the shade. Even more, interestingly, Q2's reduced guidance figures take into account the cost of acquiring Conjur, inclusive of operating costs of around $1 million, meaning that without the purchase of Conjur, Q2's EPS would likely come in in line with original levels of guidance.CYBR Revenue History & Estimates. Source: FTUltimately, whilst cybersecurity companies were expected to make significant gains in 2017, on the back of the rising threat of cyber attacks, as Stifel has noted, fear of attacks does not always lead to immediate revenues for cybersecurity companies. This does not mean they have not been performing but perhaps indicates that expectations may have risen too far, and too fast. Nevertheless, many analysts retain CyberArk as a buy, and given the proclivity of its stock to rally, it is difficult not to see the company's current share price of around $42 as anything other than a case of buy before the next high.(Oisin Breen, Research)"
4185590,24361,2018-07-05T14:04:43-04:00,"CyberArk has been driving the Privileged Access Management market with leading share and solutions that help enterprises create a second layer of security around their networks.Awareness of PAM is growing, and I believe CyberArk's addressable market will reach $5 billion over the next five years, as the company rolls out new products/services and awareness grows.CyberArk is in a ""close, but not quite"" valuation zone for me but would be worth considering on a pullback.","In a highly competitive and ever-evolving space, CyberArk Software (CYBR) looks like an interesting security name to me. Although there’s controversy and debate about the true size of the Privileged Access Management market, I believe it is a meaningful “second line of defense” that will be increasingly important to mid-sized and larger enterprises, giving CyberArk a chance to further penetrate a market that I believe could be worth somewhere around $5 billion. The valuation isn’t quite where I’d like to be, though, so this is a name I’m relegating to the watch list in the hope of getting a better entry price in the next year or two.Where larger enterprise security companies like Check Point (CHKP) and Palo Alto (PANW) are focused on preventing external intrusions into a network (broadly speaking), CyberArk’s Privileged Account Security Solution addresses the Privileged Access Management (or PAM) market that focuses on managing internal access and identifying/disrupting abnormal behaviors.While enterprises have long understood the importance of keeping their networks off-limits to the outside world, for too long it was taken for granted that everything “inside the wall” was safe. Experience has shown otherwise, with high-profile cases of employees/contractors making off with material they weren’t authorized to access (or weren’t supposed to be able to access) and other cases of outsiders gaining access/stealing credentials (including attacks like spear-phishing) and attacking the network through what the existing network security offerings regarded as valid credentials.CyberArk sells an array of tools to help enterprises manage and secure access. The company’s core offering, Enterprise Password Vault, securely stores passwords for privileged accounts and leverages the company’s core Digital Vault multilayered security system. CyberArk also sells several other products with capabilities that include SSH key management, real-time monitoring and recording, access control management, threat analytics, and an endpoints privilege manager that can help block/contain attacks on endpoints and servers and reduce (or eliminate) the impact of ransomware attacks.Although started as an on-premises system, CyberArk has evolved with the times and now offers SaaS capabilities for cloud environments, with the company recently rolling out its new Privileged Access Security as a Service product.CyberArk also has tools for the development side. Augmented by its acquisition of Conjur, Application Identity Manager eliminates hard-coded credentials from app scripts, config files, and other software and basically gives PAM functionality during app development. This matters because development and operations are increasingly blended together in practice today and not securing the development process under the PAM umbrella creates another potential weak point in a network’s security.One of the more controversial parts of the CyberArk story is just how big the company’s addressable market actually is. The market was sized at around $500 million by many sell-side and third-party research firms at the time of the company’s IPO, but awareness of the importance of PAM (and the functionality of CyberArk’s solutions, as well as its competitors) has grown the market since. It is likely true that the large enterprise market segment is rather well aware of these products, and participants have made their decisions (whether to deploy, and whose offerings to use). Even so, there’s a sizable mid-sized enterprise market that is only starting to adopt these offerings, and much like firewall adoption, ultimately, grew beyond initial expectations, so too do I believe that PAM will. All told, I think $5 billion is a reasonable estimate of the addressable license market opportunity over the next five years or so, with about half of that from Enterprise Password Vault and the rest from App Identity Manager, monitoring, and endpoint security. There are service and maintenance add-ons beyond that, and CyberArk continues to develop new products. I’d also note that CyberArk uses a “land and expand” model similar to what both Check Point and Palo Alto have used in the past – making the initial sale with the core product (Enterprise Password Vault) and then selling additional products over time.I believe CyberArk has around 20% to 25% market share (and about half that of the addressable market), with CA (CA), Dell, BeyondTrust, Centrify, Thycotic, and IBM (IBM) some of the most frequently-mentioned competitors. Although CyberArk has done a very good job of securing large enterprise wins (over half of the Fortune 100), growing the mid-sized enterprise market opportunity has been a little more challenging. CyberArk’s rivals have made enough strides to where many potential customers see them as “good enough” and are swayed by what can be substantial discounts to CyberArk’s price (some reports suggest rivals offering “90% of the functionality for 70% of the price”).Between these competitive pricing challenges and some sales force execution issues last year (particularly in Europe), CyberArk has gone back and improved some of its sales and go-to-market strategies. One of the products of this process has been new pricing bundles that group products together with digestible per-user pricing. In addition to expanded product capabilities and recent improvements in simplifying the user interface, I believe these changes are at least partly responsible for the re-ignition of year-over-year sales growth back into the 20%’s.Today, CyberArk can rightly be criticized as a “niche” player in enterprise security, but I believe it is an important niche and one that is gaining more and more recognition as a critical layer in network security. I won’t call PAM “the next firewall”, but I do believe there will be meaningful market growth, sufficient to support CyberArk building toward $1 billion in revenue over the next 10 years (suggesting a mid-teens growth rate). I also believe there is further room to expand margins and boost adjusted free cash flow, such that FCF can outgrow revenue by a couple of percentage points.CyberArk does not look undervalued on a DCF basis, but it would frankly be startling for a well-covered, growing software company to look cheap on cash flow. As far as my other preferred methodology, EV/revenue with the multiple driven by revenue growth and margins, I believe CyberArk is somewhere around fairly-valued to 10% undervalued. Valuations in the software space are above the long-term average now, which accounts for some of the spread (the shares are fairly valued on what would be a “normal” multiple).I’d also note there is certainly take-out potential here. CyberArk was rumored to have been approached by Check Point in 2016, and CyberArk’s name comes up as a potential target from time to time.By no means is this a complete run-down on CyberArk, its prospects, or its risks, and it is meant only as a starting point. Even so, I like this company, and I think I am on the relatively bullish side of the long-term market potential for PAM solutions. I realize the limitations of bringing a value-based/GARP approach to a fast-growing software company, but the valuation today is close enough to be tempting, and it wouldn’t take much of a pullback to warrant a second look."
4087809,74295,2017-07-14T14:00:28-04:00,"CyberArk shares are down more than 17% after hours on Thursday after reporting preliminary Q2 results.The revenue miss is significant and has raised concerns about growth.The company's growth remains solid, but more will have to be done to justify the current valuation.I rate CyberArk a Speculative Buy on the drop.","This article is the 68th installment in a segment called ""Buy on the Drop?"" in which I choose a stock that recently experienced a large decrease in price and give a recommendation on whether investors should ""buy on the drop"" or not. The recommendations are Sell, Hold, Speculative Buy, Buy, and Strong Buy.CyberArk (CYBR) reported preliminary Q2 results after the market close Thursday, missing its revenue guidance by a fairly significant margin and sending shares down more than 17%. The revenue miss has ignited growth concerns, which I think are warranted considering the stock's lofty valuation. At the same time, CyberArk's growth potential in the expanding cybersecurity space looks promising as well, and the combination of strong top-line growth with an already in-the-black bottom line hints at possible upside from here. Because of the risks and the potential reward, I rate CyberArk a Speculative Buy on the drop.CYBR data by YChartsCyberArk stated it now expects to report Q2 revenue between $57 million and $57.5 million, which is well below the original guidance range of between $61 million and $62 million. CEO Udi Mokady attributed the miss to worse-than-expected EMEA performance due to ""certain deals that we anticipated would close did not close by the end of the quarter"". There are two main questions to address here: 1) How bad are these results? 2) Is CyberArk worth buying here? Let's start with 1).At the midpoint of the new revenue range, Q2 will see a measly 14% YoY increase as opposed to the 23% growth expected with the previous range. Perhaps the real reason why this is so concerning is because it is becoming part of a larger trend at CyberArk:CYBR Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsOf course, no one is expecting the company to maintain 30%-40% growth indefinitely, and the valuation doesn't imply this is expected, but 14% YoY growth is a new low, one much deeper than the previous low (which was the most recent quarter by the way).All of this adds up to investor concerns that growth is slowing, and who could fault one for those concerns. Revenue growth is declining rapidly, and if Q2 was not simply a temporary hitch in the road, it's hard to see CYBR justifying its $1.4 billion price tag (assuming a 17% drop).But the news is not all bad. The statement by management seems to indicate that the cause of the revenue miss has less to do with not being able to find and book customers and more on the timing of deals that took longer than expected to close. If true, this would cause revenue to get pulled from Q2 into Q3 instead, which would theoretically offset each other. For this reason, it will be vital for investors to keep an eye on Q3 guidance in the next earnings report to see if it brings YoY revenue growth back in line with the quarters of the recent past, say mid 20% top-line growth.If Q3 revenue guidance is mediocre, then we can glean that maybe timing was not the sole cause of Q2's growth problem in which case CYBR could be in deep trouble. Watching developments in this area will be, in my opinion, the most important thing for investors moving forward. Another important development to keep an eye on is margins, as operating margin is expected to take a hit in Q2 as well.Whether this is the direct and sole result of the revenue miss is tough to say, but operating margin is expected to be 15.2%, down substantially from original guidance of 18.4%. This could be a result of order timing or some other issue, but needless to say, this is another thing to keep an eye on.Considering the brevity of the press release we received and the relative lack of information, I think I about covered the important points. Let's move onto the second question of whether CYBR is worth buying right now. The short answer: Yes, if you can stomach the risks.On the one hand, the valuation is pretty rich at a forward P/E of 30+, and if growth concerns turn out to be well-founded, this stock could fall very far and very fast. Cybersecurity stocks in general are pretty inflated due to growth expectations, so any laggards that appear will likely be culled with rapid precision. I'm not saying that's where CYBR is right now, but if Q2 is any indication that scenario isn't as far-fetched at is appeared a few months ago.On the other hand, I think the risks are heavily outweighed by the potential reward here. First off, CyberArk is a pretty popular name in the big business world, counting 45% of the Fortune 100 as customers. These firms are all utilizing what the company dubs Privileged Account Security, which basically focuses on preventing unauthorized users from gaining access to sensitive information by compromising privileged accounts through the use of password management software, monitoring user actions, layering privileged credentials in a digital vault of sorts, and other related technology.This isn't exactly a niche, but it is a more focused area where competition is a bit less intense. Not many cybersecurity companies in the space specialize in protecting privileged account credentials the way CyberArk does, which is likely why so many of the Fortune 100 companies use their products. The type of security vulnerability CyberArk protects against is ubiquitous and is among the most common area that adversaries target. This specialization, along with the overall growth of the cybersecurity market, bodes well for the company's revenue in the future:I'm inclined to think that the Q2 revenue miss will be an aberration in the grand scheme of things due to the timing of deal closings and not due to declining demand for the company's product offerings. The rapid drop in revenue growth from expected 23% to 14% seems abrupt, and management has usually had good visibility when issuing guidance, which leads me to think that this is indeed an issue of timing, as management claims. We will have to wait for Q3 guidance to know for sure, but I'm expecting a guide for mid-20% YoY growth in Q3.Some more reasons to like CYBR are the company's profitability, cash flow, and squeaky-clean balance sheet:CYBR Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsWith zero debt as well, CyberArk is an impressive position. Most cybersecurity companies remain unprofitable for the time being, and so CyberArk's fairly healthy profit margin is one of its greatest boons:CYBR Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsAside from Check Point (NASDAQ:CHKP), the head honcho of profitability in the cybersecurity space, CyberArk has a lead on other big companies in the industry. This is obviously a huge benefit but still does not justify the current valuation on its own. To get there, we need revenue growth.How much revenue growth is hard to say, but mid-10% range won't cut it. I'm expecting growth to jump back into the low to mid-20% range for Q3 and for the next few quarters, but there are obviously still risks here as the Q2 results demonstrate. Considering CyberArk's upside potential due to its specialized product offering, the growth of cybersecurity industry, positive free cash flow, relatively healthy profit margin, and pristine balance sheet, I think investors might see some reward from a bit on the stock. On the other hand, there are growth risks here as Q2 evidences, and the stock still needs strong results in order to grow into its valuation. I view the stock as a medium-risk, high-reward proposition and therefore rate CyberArk a Speculative Buy on the drop.If you want to stay up-to-date on my articles, you can do so by clicking ""Follow"" at the top of this page or by going to my author page.

As the world becomes more intertwined economically and the cultural/religious differences continue to present themselves through terrorist acts, information leaks, or data breaches, the need for security and especially cyber security at large, medium, and smaller companies will increase.If that is a given, where do we invest? Should we buy the large players like Symantec or EMC? Is there an up-and-comer who might be flying under the radar? Thus, enter Israeli-based CyberArk Software (Ticker: CYBR). There are several reasons I like CYBR right now.To justify the current P/E levels driven by the market, a company must truly be growing at a rapid pace. CyberArk is still a small player in the security industry inside the vast sector of technology, but it is making a massive imprint. Revenue in 4Q2016 was $64.358 million compared to $51.466 million in 2015, an increase of 25%. Full year total revenue for 2016 was $216.6 million, which was a 35% increase over the prior year. Many of the older, larger IT companies have P/E expansion because the market has driven them up as investors continue to buy ETFs, mutual funds, and the like. However, they do not seem sustainable. As CyberArk continues to grow its client acquisition, a P/E in the 40s is not unreasonable considering you are paying for higher growth. Also, with a price-to-free cash flow around 29 after accounting for share-based compensation, acquisition related expenses, and R&D, the stock seems relatively competitive. Simply put, they are reporting a profit (unlike their competitors Palo Alto Networks and FireEye) and managing their business well.Client Loyalty and Diversification – In a highly competitive space, a company must find a way to compete outside of price. Through its self-described “Privileged Account Security Solution”, which helps to protect a firm against cyber attacks using insider passwords or entry into shared systems to penetrate a network, CyberArk is able to “hit home” and assault the most critical areas of an enterprise’s infrastructure. Using the trademarked Digital Vault (which the company describes as an “isolated and bastion hardened server”), all CyberArk products can interact directly with the vault using a proprietary protocol. The Digital Vault subsequently stores keys, passwords, emergency policies, and sensitive corporate data securely on site or in the cloud. Though other companies provide similar services, I think the branding CyberArk has built around the “Privileged Account” and “Digital Vault” is brilliant and sets them apart. The numbers reflect that notion. Clients have increased from 2,500 in 2015 to 3,075 in 2016. As of August 2017, the company has 3,300 customers including more than 50% of the Fortune 500 and 25% of the Global 2000. Some are concerned CYBR has historically had a large number of clients in two industries (energy and retail) which have experienced a seismic shift in profitability and distribution. This was true a couple of years ago, but the company’s client base has broadened in the last 12 months. Now, the two leading sectors they serve by percentage of bookings are financial services and health care. Also, they are heavy in government services as the firm’s PASS is the only one approved by the US Department of Defense. As Trump continues to approve increased government spending on defense, CyberArk should be “first in line” to receive larger contracts.Effective March 31st, there are new guidelines for password management set forth from NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). NIST has proposed no more periodic passwords, no more imposed password complexity (such as requiring a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters), and a mandatory validation of newly created passwords against a list of common or highly predictable passwords. This will push more onus on third party providers such as CYBR. Since most technology budgets are spent on compliance-based requirements because they have no choice but to comply or guard against regulations, this will increase the dollars allocated to cyber security. In fact, according to Markets and Markets in Seattle, “the cyber security market is expected to grow from USD 137.85 Billion in 2017 to USD 231.94 Billion by 2022 at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11.0%”. To further demonstrate the need, the number of US-based data breaches hit a record high of 1,093 in 2016 according to CyberScout and the Identity Theft Resource Center.Since its IPO in September 2014, CyberArk has shown earnings strength on a consistent basis. Yet, I would not consider it a household name; this provides an opportunity for the investor. With a relatively small market cap, CYBR still may not show up on many manager’s screens. If an investor can get ahead of that curve, the chance for substantial appreciation is much higher. The stock is down around 10% this year due to a slight miss on percentage growth relative to previous quarters and a delay in a few contracts internationally. With roughly 40% of its revenue sourced internationally, CYBR is more susceptible to timing and currency changes than a purely-based domestic company. However, it also provides diversification to the revenue stream over time. That being said, their CEO does not seem concerned, stating: “While our results in the second quarter were primarily impacted by certain deals in EMEA that did not close by June 30, we continued to see strong demand for our solutions across on premise, cloud and hybrid environments,” - Udi Mokady, CyberArk Chairman and CEO.In the technology sector, CYBR appears to be an early stage story. Like Under Armour and Chipotle in their infancy, those who follow the stock had become accustomed to 20% plus revenue growth and were somewhat disappointed when last quarter came in light. Though unlike fashion or dining, IT security is more predictable and will not become out of favor. It is a necessity for companies to protect themselves and their customers. The alternative is to pay for the sins of negligence and/or penalties. If there were to be 2-3 more quarters of declining growth, I would be concerned that CyberArk may have lost key contracts or had started to experience a maturity curve in their business. However, I do not see last quarter’s results as an indication of either of these scenarios. There will be quarters going forward where contracts aren’t exactly booked in the quarter they are estimated, but this should not deter investors as long as the growth is still intact.In my opinion, CYBR is undervalued (probably worth at least $50-55 intrinsically) and the recent pullback provides an excellent long-term entry point for investors."
4087666,93566,2017-07-14T02:53:29-04:00,Company pre-announces disappointing Q2 results.First earnings miss since going public almost three years ago.Ongoing issues in EMEA and slowing growth rates in the US.Management offered very limited answers on the call.Major guidance reduction ahead - sell or even get short the shares.,"Admittedly, I wasn't too surprised when Israel-based security software provider CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) pre-announced disappointing Q2 results after the close of Thursday's regular session given that the company's EMEA business was already struggling last quarter, causing the company to make ""adjustments to its channel leadership"" and focusing on ""delivering more consistent performance"" at that time. In fact, in the press release and on this afternoon's conference call, management is blaming the very same issues for the region's severe underperformance like it did last quarter and actually already one year ago:The above quote is from the Q2/2016 conference call, so the issues around EMEA have been well known to management for at least a couple of quarters. So far, the company has been able to make up for the region's prevalent underperformance by outstanding results in the Americas, but even in CyberArk's long-standing stronghold growth rates have been slowing meaningfully during Q2.The Americas' growth rate of 20% is a material deceleration from the 28% number reported in Q1 and a far cry from the 59% recorded during Q2/2016.Unfortunately, management is still trying to water down the company's obvious problems with sales execution and slowing growth by characterizing them as mainly a timing issue:Given this statement, one would assume that the impending closure of these deals would lead to outperformance in Q3 and full year guidance remaining largely intact.But this won't be the case, as on the conference call CFO Josh Siegel admitted to the need of revisiting some of his basic assumptions regarding the timing of deal closures. In plain language, investors should prepare for management to guide down both Q3 and full year 2017 significantly on the company's upcoming Q2 conference call on August 8.To get a better impression of the magnitude of the company's issues, investors should focus on the following key figures:While the second half is traditionally stronger for EMEA sales, this pattern is already well reflected in analysts' consensus estimates which are currently calling for H2 revenues of almost $150 million (compared to around $116 million for H1).At least, management promised to ""determine and implement the appropriate steps to improve execution, drive stronger results and enhance visibility into our EMEA performance,” but given how long these problems have already persisted and the fact that EMEA results actually worsened substantially after the changes already made during Q1, it seems fair to assume that there won't be an easy cure going forward.Moreover, with growth rates in the company's main market North America seemingly also slowing meaningfully (particularly when considering management's statements on the call about Latin America having delivered a record quarterly performance in Q2), CyberArk might soon face even bigger problems.In sum, while the writing was on the wall for a couple of quarters already, the magnitude of the shortfall and management's half-hearted explanations are highly unsettling. Investors will have to prepare for a much slower growth rate for at least the next couple of quarters and potentially increased investments to reinvigorate sales growth over time.Looking at valuation, with the stock currently trading around $42 in the after-hours session, the company's enterprise value is down to below $1.2 billion.This compares to somewhat larger, but less profitable peer Imperva's (NASDAQ:IMPV) $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for slightly smaller, but almost equally profitable competitor Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS).So far, CyberArk's projected 2018 revenue growth rate of 21% outpaced projections for Imperva (18%) and Qualys (16.5%) but given the recent deterioration in the company's growth rates, I would assume CyberArk to now fall behind its peers (assuming the competition will be executing according to expectations).From a revenue multiple, Imperva currently sells for 4.3, Qualys for 5.7 and CyberArk for 4.7 (based on the after-hours share price and an assumed full-year revenue guide down by $10-15 million).So valuation now looks roughly in line with some of its closest peers but given the large miss relative to expectations, the assumed lower growth rate going forward and the unresolved issues at the company, I would expect CyberArk to trade at a discount until overall growth rates bounce back.Expect the usual mix of downgrades and defenses by the analyst community tomorrow morning but it should be noted that Merrill Lynch, Summit Redstone and Imperial Capital already downgraded the stock after the mixed Q1 report, so the number of additional downgrades might be limited particularly as this is the first guide-down from CyberArk after becoming a public company almost three years ago.Bottom lineWhile not entirely surprising, I would expect the magnitude of the company's issues, particularly in EMEA but obviously also starting in the US, and management's limited answers to weigh heavily on the stock going forward.With an anticipated major guidance reduction for both Q3 and full year 2017 just three weeks away, investors should sell the shares or outright enter a short position as I would expect the slowing revenue growth causing CyberArk to trade at a discount to competition going forward. Even with the 17% after-hours decline, the company is not a bargain relative to its closest peers, thus I wouldn't expect bargain hunters or activist investors calling for a sale of the company to show up anytime soon.Don't get deceived by management's statements of mostly timing delays around the closing of large pipeline deals being the primary reason for the miss - the company's growth is actually slowing considerably and will, most likely, continue to do so for the next couple of quarters. Even worse, there's seemingly not that much management will be able to do about this, other than investing even more heavily in sales and marketing, as evidenced by the ongoing weakness in EMEA that has first popped up more than a year ago.In fact, CyberArk now finds itself in a very similar situation like Imperva did last year and in 2014. While Imperva has managed to overcome execution issues rather quickly and also attracted activist investor Elliott Associates, I do not expect this to be the case for CyberArk. I have discussed last year's issues at Imperva in an article which, to some extent, actually reads like a blueprint for today's piece on CyberArk.Personally, I will be looking to get short the shares tomorrow morning, hopefully meaningfully above the after-hours price of $42 but this will require some analyst defenses. With an anticipated major guidance reduction now only three weeks away, I would expect the shares to remain under pressure going into the conference call on August 8.As always, don't bet the farm on short positions and manage your risk accordingly."
4087722,22148,2017-07-14T09:39:36-04:00,"CyberArk crashes after pre-announcing Q2 warning.Sector stocks consistently run into similar problems before snapping back.The stock valuation turns appealing at the after-hours lows, but a lower stock price is expected.","After the close, CyberArk (CYBR) pre-announced disappointing results for Q2. The cybersecurity stock was hit with delayed customer spending that happens all too often in the sector.The stock is down roughly 17% in after-hours trading. As my investment thesis on the stock has stated, the time to buy this stock is on dips so the question is whether this drop provides that opportunity.CyberArk now forecasts Q2 revenues of $57.0 to $57.5 million, down from the guidance of $61.0 to $62.0 million on May 11. The reduction amounts to roughly a $4.25 million hit from expectations or nearly 7%.The company blames the loss on an inability to close deals in EMEA that happens all too often in the software and cybersecurity spaces. Imperva (IMPV) had similar misses back in 2016 including this one in May. The stock was last crushed in October and traded down to $35 and now trades above $50 so a snapback is relatively common in the sector.Besides, CyberArk was recently named the overall leader in the network perimeter security sector so the issue is likely related to sales and not product. Ironically, Evercore ISI just placed these two stocks into the Core Idea list.The real key is the valuation. My thesis on CyberArk has long questioned any reason for paying up for the stock for this exact reason. Despite the strong prospects for cybersecurity, large enterprise customers are constantly dragging their feet on writing the checks.When viewing the Imperva example, the stock consistently hit a low when trading at an EV/Sales multiple of roughly 3.5x forward expectations.CYBR EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsAfter the dip, CyberArk trades at a EV/Sales multiple of 4.2x. The privileged account security provider is highly profitable so a slight premium valuation is probably warranted in comparison to Imperva.Over the last year, CyberArk has held the $45 range so the after-hours trading down to $42 suggests the stock could plunge to 12-month lows. The key investor takeaway is that no reason exists to rush into the stock until after a washout occurs over the next few weeks. The data points though suggest the stock becomes a bargain worth picking up on any major weakness."
4088169,76115,2017-07-17T13:59:16-04:00,"CyberArk experienced a company first, a pre-announcement of lower than expected revenue.However, the reasons behind the miss are more in depth than most realized.Much of the reasoning is very similar to another company I've covered extensively - a call which turned out extremely well.Considering the two companies experienced the same issue for very similar reasons, I foresee this drop in CyberArk as a buying opportunity.","Last Thursday is what I would call a reset for CyberArk (CYBR). The reset is two-fold: First, expectations for companies requiring this kind of security needing it immediately with little scrutiny, and second a share price reset. These combined are allowing the market to readjust expectations but at the same time open an opportunity when these new expectations are exceeded in the future.In the last 12 months, shares have been range bound between $45 and $55 - a good swing trading vehicle for those who are into that but a rather boring see-saw and not much enticement for investors looking for long-term appreciation. However, with a company first occurring last week in the form of a pre-announcement readjusting guidance under the expected range, shares have become interesting again.Industry Expectations ResetMuch of the focus was on the 7% downward revision from original mid-point to readjusted mid-point. However, assumptions have run rampant because of some commentary on the pre-release earnings call as well as a lack of understanding with this method of business and risk versus compliance customers.CEO Udi Mokady mentioned the UK and northern Europe as the primary countries and regions it is having an issue with closing deals in time - and this will be important in a minute - but the most notable comment on the call was from CFO Josh Siegel where he answered an analyst by saying:To many, this now sounds like CyberArk and team are going to change their guidance and full-year expectations and we should hit the brakes and get out when the vehicle comes to a stop. I'm not seeing this commentary as a sign that reads: ""WARNING: Company will drastically reduce guidance ahead.""That would be a quick-to-analyze, off the cuff assessment without taking proper context into consideration regarding the landscape of the industry. There's much more to it than just a CFO saying he needs to reevaluate. Just what is he getting at should be the next question. Thankfully Josh adds more to this than just a supposed bearish comment.I want to focus on the bold emphasis I've added ""seeing a bit of a shift."" What exactly is this shift? Well, that's what we should be digging into. This shift is primarily dealing with Europe where there is a difference between it and other regions such as the US and Americas. Much of the Americas have been on the prowl securing their network borders and minimizing damage if an attacker were to find their way in - these are called risk-driven customers. I have a risk, I must close it.Europe, on the other hand, is a different animal in terms of its profile. The landscape is seeing a change from risk driven to compliance driven. Compliance in what exactly? Compliance in the European Union's GDPR regulation. This regulation is set to be fully enforced in May 2018 and, much like other regulations we see in the US (HIPAA anyone?), it deals with customer privacy and information sharing. But the key to these regulations have little to do with the intent but rather the enforceable aspects. The key word in much of this EU regulation is ""breach."" A breach is defined as ""any incident that results in unauthorized access of data."" When an intruder enters a network and uses administrative passwords to gain unauthorized access to information it is considered a reportable breach. CyberArk's software is built to maintain these administrative passwords and not let these critical keys hang out on the network for easy grabbing.So what's the point you ask? The point is there is less than a year for EU companies (and really companies who do business in the EU) to find, buy, integrate, and deploy a software which meets these regulations. This is where my expertise in implementing compliance driven, security based software comes to the forefront.Up until last year, I worked at a major teaching hospital integrating and maintaining end-user based software. This software managed secure access to end points (the devices doctors and nurses used) as well as the security around prescribing narcotic drugs at the time of signing. This latter functionality was compliance driven and pushed us to implement and deploy faster than we would have otherwise.However, the part which was not so speedy was the determination of the project scope, understanding how many end users we'd impact, and the cost and contract negotiations. The problem with going ahead with a few loose assumptions on a compliance-based purchase is they could have disastrous effects later on. If we didn't purchase enough licenses, purchase the right modules and hardware, or purchase the proper support contract for when we went live, then fines, non-compliant doctors (a big no no), and ultimately a loss of patients due to lack of prescription ability would be the consequence. Any mistakes would cost us and bring us over the regulation deadline. Thankfully we took our time on the front end of the purchase (scope and contract) and were fully implemented two months ahead of our compliance deadline because there was no need to adjust or pivot our purchase.Now, Imprivata (IMPR), whose software I was purchasing and implementing at this job, was covered extensively by me here on Seeking Alpha. Not only this but what's coincidental about this CyberArk guidance warning is Imprivata also went through an identical situation - deals not closing in time for the quarter's end and issuing a pre-announcement about lower revenue. In fact, even the 7% miss in revenue is identical in both instances.I wrote in great detail how the revenue miss was merely timing and the overall revenue for the year would be unchanged:My call turned out to be spot on as I wrote a follow-up article about how the revenue shifted and made the company issue another pre-announcement, this time for exceeding guidance.I see this as an extremely similar situation with slightly varying reasons for the underlying shift in revenue (scrutiny for compliance versus lack of IT resources) and one where the opportunity lies at the bottom of a stock free-fall - which is where CYBR is at or headed to shortly. Either reason for the underlying shift still creates revenue, just not at the time initially anticipated.With less than a year for EU companies to be compliant, CISOs and CIOs will scrutinize all of their purchases so they not only meet regulations but confirm the software works effectively while getting it for the best value. When IT departments need time to think about purchases they use all of that time - to the chagrin of vendors - which is happening here.This shift in customer motivation is what caught management off guard as they expected deals to close as fast as they have been, especially with large attacks like WannaCry focused primarily on Europe. Simply changing this expectation does not eliminate revenue -it requires more understanding of where it's going to be placed - this quarter or next quarter?Share Price ResetThe reason this reset creates opportunity is because the market expects this to be the new normal going forward. This expectation has caused shares to correct almost 17% - for a 7% revenue miss which will be pushed into another quarter. This slight miss in revenue for just the quarter has contracted price-to-sales multiples to the lowest they have ever been for the company, meaning downside is becoming more limited while growth is still present.Because CyberArk not only sells its software in a very similar manner as Imprivata, it is seeing the very same issue Imprivata once had but overcame. In fact, a commenter on my assessment of the Imprivata miss had similar fears to many who are commenting on CyberArk today: a company whose business or regions are shrinking (otherwise known as growth in jeopardy) and this could be the beginning of the end. Turns out those fears were put to rest not only after the revenue recovered but also after the company was acquired for a 95% premium to my call to action price of $10.This doesn't mean I have a thesis to say CyberArk will be acquired - in fact, I'm on the side of arguing against it due to the negative stance management has taken on the subject in the past. But I am saying the company may very well have misjudged when this shift would occur instead of this being the beginning of the end.ConclusionConsidering the exaggerated drop in share price relative to the guidance adjustment, the risk versus reward has been skewed toward reward as multiples have contracted. My assessment says this is, in fact, a timing of deals closing and not a harbinger of things to come. CyberArk management has executed very well and is one of the only profitable companies in its field. It will reassess its sales for Europe specifically and understand what it needs to do to provide assurance for its customers.If you'd like to be made aware of my opinion and analysis in the future on CyberArk, along with other tech and cyber security companies, then I encourage you to follow me by clicking the ""Follow"" link at the top of this page next to my name."
4073766,22148,2017-05-16T12:58:28-04:00,Cyber security stocks are in focus this week following the WannaCry ransomware attack.CyberArk was recently beaten down due to Q2 guidance that disappointed.The company has a history of beating analyst estimates setting up a rally.,"On a day when cyber security was in the spotlight, CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) actually ended down for the day. Though a lot of experts aren't including the stock in the list to benefit from the WannaCry ransomware attack, the issue should highlight the need for cyber security and the benefit of buying such stocks on dips.The stock is down nearly $8 from the recent highs following weak Q2 guidance last week. Should investors use this scenario to own CyberArk?Since CyberArk focuses on protecting organizations from cyber attacks that have penetrated the network perimeter via privileged accounts, the company isn't a big beneficiary from outside attacks. Investors jumping into beaten down FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and into the PureFund ISE Cyber Security ETF (NYSEARCA:HACK) makes logical sense. HACK is approaching the all-time high from back in early 2015 shortly after the ETF started trading.What wasn't logical was the sell-off following supposed weak Q2 guidance. CyberArk has a history of smashing estimates and low-balling guidance. The original Q1 estimates were for the company to produce an EPS of $0.21 to $0.23 with consensus estimates up at $0.27.The kicker is that the cyber security specialist actually reported $0.28, beating the original guidance. The big hiccup with Q2 is the guidance includes about $1 million in operating costs for Conjur, costing the company about $0.03 for the quarter. Otherwise, CyberArk would've actually guided toward the Q2 analyst estimate of $0.27. And we already know that the company easily surpasses those estimates per the below Estimize chart.So without the Conjur employees who are mostly focused on development, CyberArk would be viewed in a different light. The stock trades at about 30x forward EPS estimates so CyberArk isn't cheap, but this is about as cheap as the stock gets.The key investor takeaway is that the cyber attack news of the day highlights the greater need for corporate spending on cyber security that should benefit CyberArk. The time to buy this stock is on dips versus chasing."
4045694,22148,2017-02-14T08:35:14-05:00,CyberArk beat Q4 estimates and made the typical weak guidance.Cybersecurity remains an area of focus under Trump.Normalized revenue growth provides a more stable investment thesis.,"Back last August, my research highlighted how CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) was generating solid results yet the stock wasn't likely to rally. The cybersecurity specialists again reported another quarterly beat for Q4 and the stock is virtually flat in that period.The stock trades around $53 now. The question is whether the quarterly results and guidance are enough to support a breakout of CyberArk?As pointed out in the last article, the issue with decelerating revenue growth was a big headwind. The latest quarter had revenue growth down to 25% and a forecast for a further dip to possibly only 22% for Q1.The key to the investment thesis is that the massive deceleration from quarterly growth still above 70% in early 2015 made investing difficult. A more sustainable growth level now makes investors more willing to make long-term bets.The sector is appealing as state-sponsored cyber attacks continue mostly unabated. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) just warned journalists that they were under attack from places like Russia, while President Trump has shown the cybersecurity sector as a place for investment during his term.Favorable sector trends plus stable growth provide a solid investment thesis. The only real question is valuation. The main reason CyberArk didn't surge after Q4 results was the combination of a premium valuation and the typical weak guidance that holds back the stock.The company guided to a 2017 EPS of $1.20 to $1.24, some $0.10 below analyst estimates. CyberArk originally guided to 2016 EPS of $0.83 to $0.86 and ended up earning $1.26.The company has a history of lowballing guidance partially due to some original fears that cybersecurity breaches pulled revenues forward back in 2015. Despite that no longer being the fear, Q4 guidance a few months ago was for CyberArk only earning up to $0.33 and the company actually earned $0.41 per share.The real issue is the valuation that now stands at $1.9 billion, based on the 36.4 million shares listed outstanding for 2017. Even considering the $250 million cash balance, CyberArk has an enterprise value of $1.67 billion.The stock trades at an EV of roughly 6x revenue guidance and 35x my estimate that CyberArk will conservatively earn $1.50 per share in 2017. Neither value is cheap, but mostly in line with the growth potential here.In comparison to other sector plays like Imperva (NYSE:IMPV) and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), CyberArk is valued roughly at the mid-point of the group. Palo Alto expects faster growth and Imperva slower growth, so one can argue these valuations are logical.CYBR EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that CyberArk is now fairly valued for a license based software company with predictable growth and cash flows. Without the premium valuation based off unsustainable growth in the past, an investor can now own the stock with reasonable return expectations. The stock even provides upside if the sector returns to a period of accelerated growth due to higher risks of cyber threats."
4059957,98236,2017-04-03T20:36:00-04:00,"CyberArk's shares continue to suffer from the disappointing quarterly guidance the company gave at the time of its last conference call.The company has a long record of severely under promising and mainly over delivering to a point where it leaves investors and observers to ponder what is a valid level.Recently a couple of investment banks have said some positive things about the company, leading me to imagine the company has likely produced another quarterly upside of some magnitude.While no one would seriously describe the company's valuation metrics as in the bargain class, they are not outlandish and are certainly not forecasting a significant earnings upside.The company occupies a very specific nice of the cyber security business which doesn't include Cisco and does include far weaker competitors.","CyberArk's Niche: Trying to avoid the Cisco tsunamiThere's an old investment adage that relates to buying the dips. An article earlier today on this site was focused on such a strategy, with regard to Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW), much though I may have disagreed with the premise. It is an investment strategy that appeals to my thrifty nature even though that nature is buried under multiple layers of consumer indulgence. Despite the under-performance of its third-largest component, Palo Alto, the cyber-security index called HACK has appreciated by 12% in the first quarter. There are still opportunities to invest in cyber security and achieve positive alpha. CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR), despite the struggles of its shares, or perhaps because of these struggles, is one of those names that seems to have a combination of valuation and a unique technology focus that ought to lead to better share price performance in the coming months.No one is going to describe CyberArk shares as cheap. They are valued at 5.6X forward EV/S (based on my sales projections) and more based on the First Call revenue consensus forecast. And while that isn't outlandish, it isn't cheap either. And no one is going to describe the company's projection of 24% growth in sales and for EPS at the midpoint that is negative as a hyper-growth cadence. The company's free cash flow yield, depending on exactly what happens with things like the deferred revenue balance, receivables and stock-based comp, is positive, but not positive enough to suggest buying the shares based on that metric.Viewed holistically, if one has confidence in the company's focus and strategy, and expectations that the company is likely to exceed projections significantly, this is probably a reasonable point at which to make a commitment in the shares. In particular, the company's Q1 projections appear to be more than a bit conservative and the two recent buy ratings on the name from large investment banks are most probably a function of expectations that the conservative projections which call for a noticeable decline in sequential quarterly revenues can be bested in a fashion similar to the results versus expectations in last year's Q1.CYBR has a somewhat different twist as a solution for cyber security use-cases. As opposed to the Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) and Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) methodology, which are the most common solutions for dealing with cyber-security threats, this company is focused on working to shut off privileged access to corporate insiders who frequently attack the heart of an enterprise. Privileged account security, at the very least, is a component of a cyber security strategy and is often the key element in providing defense against the most dangerous hackers - the ones who already are inside the corporate firewall.I wrote an initial article about CyberArk back in July detailing its differentiated strategy for dealing with the multitude of threats that are already working for many businesses. The shares initially performed reasonably, but have subsequently declined. They are now 6% below the price they were when I wrote my initial article while the HACK index has advanced by 17%. Much of the under-performance came in the wake of the company's latest earnings release about two months ago. The results themselves were fine, and the company reported a typical earnings upside. Forward guidance disappointed investors and caused a noticeable reset in both growth and earnings expectations. In all, from peak to trough, the shares are down about 13%.In addition to the company's own issues with guidance, its valuation was also impacted by the debacle at Palo Alto which has tarred many high-growth high-valuation security names. CyberArk's shares have recovered modestly from their low point to current levels and latterly the company's shares were upgraded by Goldman Sachs and initiated with a buy at Needham. The upgrade and the initiation have been worth 5% to the value of the shares. It was the upgrades at the end of the quarter that have intrigued me. While life is different for analysts these days than before the scandals and prosecutions of the early years of this decade, it would be unusual for two well-regarded investment banks to issue positive ratings at the end of the quarter without some kind of informational advantage that tends to support expectations for a beat of current expectations for a company under coverage and particularly for a company on which coverage is being initiated.Will the company beat guidance yet again? Does the company have the strategy to avoid what many feel is the tsunami that Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is creating in the cyber security space? And is the valuation at levels that can produce positive alpha for this company despite current investor concerns about the cyber security space. I think that the answer is yes for all three questions and that investors can enter the name prior to earnings both for shorter and longer-term alpha potential.Can beat and raise be a tiresome patternSome years ago, when I was in the midst of the fray and was sometimes asked to offer opinions to management on a winning strategy to maximize share price values, I would always reply ""beat and raise."" I think that is pretty obvious and in my years of dealing with institutions the beat and raise formula was how analysts on the buy side kept their bosses happy - mainly. There are some portfolio managers who can't stand happiness and fight against success - but that's a different story.But at some point, the attempts of a management team to game investors goes too far - and this may indeed be one of those times. Over the past year, CyberArk has beat prior consensus earnings estimates by anywhere from 45% to 24%. When the closest approach to accuracy is 24% and the results are all in the same direction, it is no longer logical to take company guidance as representing any kind of reality. At the start of 2016, the company projected that revenues would reach $206 million with non-GAAP EPS of $.85. In the event, full-year revenues turned out to be $217 million and non-GAAP EPS was $1.26.The company is now forecasting revenue growth for the current year of 24% with EPS declining in part because company management says it wants to invest for growth and market share gains. It becomes difficult to know just how much of what appears to be conservative guidance is real and how much is the best estimate the company can make regarding the results of its operations. I'm not quite sure how one puts together a model for CyberArk that tries to use reasonable assumptions. If I had to try to put together my own model at this point, I probably would forecast an expectation for EPS that is 20%-25% above guidance - not because of what I know, but because that is the historical record and is what would happen, I think, if revenues are 5% above the consensus.Based on some of the commentary during the course of the conference call, it seems quite likely to me that management's guidance is not intended to be taken literally. Here's a bit of dialogue from the conference call. To my mind, it foreshadows a significant upside. But at the time of the earnings release, investors were very disappointed and sold the shares. Therein lies the opportunity:What does that actually mean? Does it mean that growth will be the same as it was in 2016-39%? Does it mean that the Americas is actually expected to grow by more than 12% but less than 39%? As it happened, EMEA revenue grew by 53% year on year last quarter but ""only"" grew 34% for the year as a whole. Is the Americas healthier than that kind of sales performance? And what about the outlook for EMEA? What's the outlook for its year-on-year growth - can it keep up 34%? In addition, APJ, which is still just 6% of total revenues, has begun to build momentum. The fact is that looking at the various revenue segments for the company, 24% growth would suggest that somewhere within the business something is off track. And yet there really is nothing that has been released or was part of the dialogue that suggests that anything has gone amiss.One thing to note is that the company has made some acquisitions over the past two years. The acquisitions have been small and management made the point that its acquisition of Viewfinity, its largest purchase, did not materially alter organic performance metrics as the product it acquired in the transaction replaced another product that it had been selling.English is a remarkably flexible language thanks to its derivation from so many diverse sources. But it is really not quite as elastic as is necessary to square all those statements. Overall, revenues beat the company guidance by 5% last quarter despite what appears to have been slow revenue growth in the geo that accounts for more than 60% of total revenues.The only way I can look at both the results reported and the commentary made on the conference call is to assume that revenues will be significantly greater than those forecast because of a strong rebound in the Americas and some strengthening in APJ. And should revenues rise beyond projections, with gross margins of 86%, the leverage on EPS ought to be similar to the kind of performance seen in past years. I really don't think the current consensus EPS forecast is an appropriate metric to use in evaluating valuation. I might make a case that an appropriate number is at least 20% greater, and probably more than that. And when it comes right down to it - that is the investment case for CyberArk at this time.It is worth looking at this company's operating ratios in some detail. This company has achieved a significant level of profitability far sooner than most companies in this space and has been more disciplined in managing expenses than many of its peers. I will take a look at some of the details later on in this article.The case for CyberArk beyond its conservative guidance strategy.CyberArk is the leader in a cyber security space called Privileged Access Management. In some ways, much of privileged access might seem pretty rudimentary. The solutions amount to managing passwords and delegating various levels of security that facilitate privileged actions. And there are many submarkets identified even within the privileged access strategy. Gartner just released a Magic Quadrant review of something called Identity Governance and Administration. CyberArk isn't even in that review although it obviously competes with companies that are included. IDC suggests that the identity access market is growing at about 8% and is projected to reach $$7.4 billion by 2019. Another study linked here says the market has a CAGR of 20%. I imagine that the second study, which specifically calls out CyberArk, is probably one that animates the discussion of that company's management.This is not a market that exactly excites the user community unless they have already suffered breaches. It is hardly surprising that 20% of users have never changed their default privileged passwords or that 30% of enterprises have no formal password controls which frequently results in password sharing. 70% of users still have no formal approval process for creating a privileged access account.And the market, as defined by TrustRadius, a firm that prepares software reviews based on user commentary, is said to have 90 competitors. The best-known competitors include RSA, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and CA (NASDAQ:CA).Fortunately for CyberArk, it is not facing competition from Cisco which is concentrating its efforts on NGFW. While hardly a high probability, it is entirely possible that a company like Cisco, looking to expand its security portfolio, would have an interest in consolidating CyberArk, although rumors to that effect have been absent. If the CAGR for the space is really the 20% forecast by industry analysts, it would certainly increase the probability that larger vendors might determine that they need offerings in this space.Overall, CYBR has been able to outgrow its competitors handily, and given what the major competitors are in the space, I expect that will continue. The company basically has a partnership arrangement with SAP (NYSE:SAP). Because of its specialist focus, which does not extend beyond the identity management space, however broadly defined that may be, it has significant partnerships with a variety of vendors including Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Palo Alto.It is hard to say that one set of solutions in this space is better than another and probably impossible to quantify just how effective one set of solutions are compared to another. I think under the circumstances, that in addition to continually developing updated products, the key to success for this company is going to be effective sales execution and the penetration of additional geos and specific niches. It just isn't likely that it will be feasible to portray that one password vault or one session manager or one application identity manager is really better than another. Indeed, it would be hard to define exactly what might be meant by ""better.""The company has been able to create some niche products with a measure of differentiation. These include the integration of CyberArk technology into the company's Viewfinity offering that provides credential theft detection and blocking. In addition, the company has made a significant push into creating a threat analytic fabric which can respond to stolen credential reports in a fashion that prevent attackers from taking control of a network. The company is working with AWS to integrate that capability in order to protect against intrusions into cloud applications.Overall, the company increased its research and development spending by 62% last year compared to revenue growth of 35%. Part of that increase was from the costs associated with absorbing acquisitions. But I think given both the runway this market offers and the fierce competition and the limited opportunities for lasting product differentiation, the company is rightfully attempting to use its focused research and development spending as a competitive tool. In Q4, the growth of research and development slowed quite sharply to 21% year over year and to 2% sequentially.CYBR is an Israel-based company and that has enabled the company to do more in terms of development with a smaller research and development outlay than comparable vendors. Even after the spike in research and development spending, the company has a spend ratio in that category of 16%. That is far less than other security vendors such as PANW or Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) and is a principal factor in the company's profitability at relatively small scale.Is CyberArk really going to see margins fall in 2017?In a single phrase - I doubt that it will happen. It wasn't happening in Q4 and it is hard to believe it will happen for the 2017 either. During the course of the company's conference call, management was asked about its forecast and said it would make the investments necessary to gain market share, particularly in sales and marketing and in research and development.Last quarter was a low point for hiring for the company. The company's headcount increased by 33 heads, one of the smallest levels of net increase seen in several quarters. As mentioned, research and development spending growth basically ground to a halt.The following expense ratios are all GAAP. While stock-based comp increased quite noticeably last year, it is still just 8% of revenues. It was, however, 22% of the company's non-GAAP reported net income in the quarter.General and administrative costs rose by less than 19% year on year and by 20% in Q4. I have no reason to believe that the company will be unable to gain continued leverage at scale when it comes to general and administrative costs.As mentioned earlier, overall, the company increased its research and development costs by 62% for the year, but was unable to significantly increase research and development costs in Q4 when they were almost flat sequentially. It is difficult for many companies to find qualified development staff at a cadence they might wish. Israel, despite its lower personnel costs, is the worldwide center for cyber-security research and it is not easy to compete for talent. Given the specifics of how the company increased its spend metrics on research and development last year, it is hard to imagine that the growth in that metric will not contract. Will it be to 30% or 25%? We just don't know. But from a standing start, it is often difficult to achieve hiring targets in a front-loaded fashion.As is the case for many companies of this kind, sales and marketing costs are the single largest expense item. Sales and marketing expense was up 30% last quarter and was up 29% last year. Sales and marketing costs rose by about 11% sequentially last quarter, but some of that increase related to commission accelerators that are frequently significant in a Q4 of a successful sales year. The company CEO said that most of the headcount increase anticipated this year is going to come from sales and marketing. As mentioned earlier, given the nature of the company's products, that makes sense. But I doubt that the company will find it easy to increase the rate of percentage growth in sales and marketing spend. The company has launched a new initiative in Latin America and that will be mainly in investment mode over the next year.In all, CyberArk operating expenses grew by 43% last year and by 25% in Q4. I think it would be hard to imagine that the company would be able to increase spending by more than 30% year on year in 2017 in any kind of efficient fashion. I would be surprised if the company actually saw a margin contraction of any material level this year, and I think that whatever the revenue increase turns out to be, the EPS increase will be the same or higher, assuming the company achieves its targeted growth goals.ValuationAs mentioned at the start of this article, CyberArk shares are not cheap, at least in a nominal sense. But the valuation is based on a management estimate of operational performance that seems likely to prove to be conservative. CYBR currently has 36 million shares outstanding which is less than 1% above the levels reported at the end of 2015. The shares are trading this afternoon at just less than $51 and that calculates to a market capitalization of a bit less than $1.9 billion. The company has net cash as of its last published balance sheet of $295 million which leaves an enterprise value of $1.6 billion.The company is forecasting full-year revenues of $269 million, or about 24% at the midpoint. At this level of revenues, the EV/S would be just less than 6X. Given my own expectations, I think the EV/S stands at 5.6X.The company has forecast EPS for the year of $1.20-1.24. It is forecasting minimal dilution and an effective tax rate of 22%. It has a relatively low tax rate because of its Israeli domicile. In any event, using the company's earnings forecast produces a P/E of 42X. My own expectation is that earnings will show a gain for the year roughly equivalent to, or perhaps slightly greater than sales. Just for the sake of simplicity, I would be expecting the company to report EPS of $1.50 which creates a P/E of 34X.Both of these numbers would be quite reasonable for a company that can sustain growth of above 25% for some years and can create some level of operating leverage as well.The company is forecasting that its operating cash flow will be 0-10% above its non-GAAP earnings. Last year the company had CFFO of $56 million and the prior year it had CFFO of $59 million. It is now forecasting that its CFFO will be 105% of non-GAAP income at the midpoint and that is about $43 million. The principal reason for the noticeable decline in CFFO is that management expects little or no change in deferred revenues, probably offset to a degree by higher stock-based comp, and perhaps some decline in receivables which were elevated because of a higher proportion of services revenue in the mix.I think earnings will be higher than suggested by about $10 million. But regardless of that, I do not see CFFO surpassing $60 million. That is not a high enough level to describe this company as a cash flow story. The company is projecting cap ex this year of $4 million and will also spend another $4 million to finish its headquarters expansion in Israel.The investment case here, both now and for the foreseeable future, is one of greater than forecast revenue growth and a continuation of margin gains. That ought to be enough to engender positive alpha going forward."

(CYBR) announced that it has acquired DevOps security technology startup Conjur for $42 million in an all cash transaction.Conjur has developed security identification and auditing software for organizations utilizing a DevOps approach to deploying software updates.The deal should be a net positive for CyberArk as it expands its offering to take advantage of growing opportunities in the DevOps market.Target CompanyNewton, Massachusetts,-based Conjur was founded in 2013 to help enterprises automate the process of identifying, authorizing and auditing service and user identities at various levels within their IT infrastructure.Management is headed by CEO and co-founder Elizabeth Lawler and CTO Kevin Gilpin. Lawler was previously co-founder off eClinicalDiary and Chief Data Officer at MetaDiagnostic.Below is a brief overview video about Conjur’s service:(Source: Conjur)Investors funded $2.6 million in disclosed financing and included Amplify Partners, Avalon Ventures, Brain Robotics Capital, Leather District Ventures and individual investors.Acquisition TermsCyberArk said it paid $42 million in cash for the deal, but didn’t state whether it was all up front or if any part of the consideration was contingent upon future milestones.As of December 31, 2016, CyberArk had $260 million in cash and short-term bank deposits and total liabilities of $56.8 million, excluding deferred revenues.Conjur was founded relatively recently, in 2013, so likely did not have significant revenues on which to base a valuation.CyberArk probably acquired the company on a ‘team and technology’ basis, rather than a multiple of revenues.Rationale and CommentaryWith the acquisition of Conjur, CyberArk aims to expand its offerings into the DevOps lifecycle, allowing enterprise developers to more quickly deploy software while retaining greater security.As Udi Mokady, Chairman and CEO of CyberArk stated,As more enterprises are using DevOps to push out continuous updates to hybrid cloud environments, their security solutions haven’t kept up.According to a 2015 Gartner report, DevOps will ""evolve from a niche strategy employed by large cloud providers to a mainstream strategy employed by 25 percent of Global 2000 organizations.""A 2017 report by InteropITX states that ""eight out of 10 (organizations in the survey) are planning DevOps investments, and those diving in have realized significant operational and financial benefits.""So, the deal for Conjur promises to provide a critical piece of security and compliance reporting for these enterprises adopting a DevOps approach for updating their IT systems.Assuming prompt integration, the acquisition should be a value-add for CyberArk as it positions itself to take advantage of the opportunities in the growing DevOps market.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

4019696,87586,2016-11-04T13:29:45-04:00,CyberArk results exceed estimates beating even the most optimistic consensus.Billings turned around from last quarter’s drop but deferred revenue not the most important indicator.Current valuations of about 40x FY16 P/E not excessive in my view.Upgraded expectations for fourth quarter should see further re-rating.I am long CyberArk and will accumulate further on dips.,"Introduction:CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) reported third quarter FY16 results yesterday on the 3rd of November 2016, with top- and bottom- line edging out estimates. Management also maintained their guidance for fourth quarter matching the street's estimates. The results went according to script like how I had projected. Whilst I have since trimmed some shares yesterday, I am looking to accumulate more shares of CYBR on dips.Third Quarter 2016 Results ReviewFor the latest quarter, top-line grew 37.2% on a year-on-year (y-y) basis to $55 million, exceeding consensus estimates by about $2.7 million, topping even the most bullish estimate of $53.5 million. Earnings per share came in at $0.33, $0.10 above consensus and easily top the most bullish forecast of $0.26. The results beat saw their shares trade to a high of over 8% in yesterday's trade in-line with my forecast for a results beat.What stood out for me is that billings for this quarter came in at 36% vs. the 3% they managed in the previous quarter that saw their shares sell-off. As I had analyzed in my third quarter results preview (link above), software companies should not be evaluated on their billings on a quarter-on-quarter (q-q) basis due to the lumpiness of contract wins in this sector.Furthermore, for companies like CYBR operating a perpetual software license company, I will argue, new contract wins are more important to them than the deferred revenues, which really is a reflection of the spot contracts that go in there.The more important metric to look at for a company like CYBR - in the early stage of the growth cycle - is the number of new contract wins and increases in customer count. This is important as it gives CYBR credibility in terms of the quality of their product. The new contract wins also translate to future recurring revenue for them.For the latest quarter, CYBR has well over 2,800 customers. According to their Chairman and CEO Udi Mokady, more than 25% of the Global 2000 are using their products, this is up 15% from two years ago.Key Operating Metrics: ValuationsWith the latest results beat, CYBR is now trading at about 40x FY16 P/E and an EV/EBITDA of 34.5x, which is not excessive for a company expected to grow at a full year Bloomberg consensus of 56.5% and over 19% net margin.Source: BloombergExpectations for Fourth QuarterTheir strong results beat has seen the street scramble to upgrade their earnings following management's upgraded guidance. For the fourth quarter, management has guided for EPS to come in at between $0.31 to $0.33, above the street's forecast of $0.31.Source: BloombergThis has seen an earnings upgrade from the analysts, who are now projecting Q4FY16 earnings to come in at $0.325 (see image above), a near 6% change.ConclusionThis quarter saw CYBR exceed expectations on all fronts, with full year top-line growth expected at over 33% and FY17 growth at 22.5%, I think CYBR is poised to further run from here. I am currently long, and will continue to accumulate."
4017088,87586,2016-10-31T09:28:59-04:00,"Large sell-off in the second quarter due to missed billings and free cash flow expectations.I am expecting a slight third quarter beat on top- and bottom- line, with one eye on billings.Valuations based on the EV/EBITDA (trailing) and full year basis not overly excessive in my view.I am currently long CYBR.","Introduction:CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) is set to announce their third quarter results on the 3rd of November before the financial markets open. Although the cyber security space has seen a de-rating in recent times, I think CYBR continues to be a stand out performer in this space with a large greenfield market. In the previous quarter, CYBR saw a sell-off due to weaker than expected billings, which allowed me to accumulate more shares of the company. I continue to recommend investors accumulate a quality company like CYBR.Second quarter results recapDespite recording revenue growth of 39% year-on-year (y-y) and over 30% growth on their earnings, CYBR was sold off, as billings growth rates tumbled from 131% in the second quarter of last year to just 3% last quarter. Whilst investors concerns about the deferred revenues are valid, I think the street's over-reaction is not justified given the nature of the business that CYBR is operating in, which tends to see lumpier revenues.Nonetheless, CYBR did manage to beat on almost every other metric, with revenues, operating margins and earnings coming in higher than analysts' estimates. I think what is noteworthy, is how operating margin came in 270 basis points (bps) higher at 23.3% vs. the 20.6% expected by the street. This as I have mentioned before in my earlier articles put them in a unique position of being a fast growing company (with over 30% top-line growth) and also being profitable.Third quarter expectationsFor the third quarter, the street is expecting CYBR to grow top-line by 30.5% to $52.289 million, and register earnings per share of $0.229. I am expecting them to beat top-line like they have for the previous eight quarters (2 years) driven by greater regulatory pressure on banks and financial institutions (which form the bulk of CYBR's main customers) to better protect privileged account credentials.I calculated the average one-day move of CYBR, which calculates the average share price change of CYBR on the day of the result announcement, this showed an average 9.6% movement in the share price of CYBR. This suggests that any earnings beat (or miss), which I am projecting, will see significant share price movement.Key Operating Metrics: ValuationsRegular followers of my articles will know that my preference for valuing cyber security names is by the EV/Sales (trailing) methodology for easier comparison as most of their peers in the same industry are not yet profitable at the operating level. I have however used the EV/EBITDA (trailing) and P/E valuation measure now for the purpose of valuing CYBR here on a standalone basis due to their consistency in turning in both operating and net level profit. Source: BloombergBased on their closing price on the 27th October, CYBR is currently trading at 34.5x trailing EV/EBITDA and current year P/E of 43.1x, which is not excessive in my view for a company with a track record of turning in consistent operating and net profit level.ConsiderationsHigh growth counters like CYBR tend to have high expectations built into the share price, and any disappointments in the earnings will likely see a major share price correction.ConclusionIt is not uncommon for software companies to show lumpier financials on a quarter-on-quarter basis. And whilst the quarterly results can give us a glimpse of how they have performed in the quarter, I will argue that it is more important to view their track record over-time and on a full year basis as this will give investors a better overview of 1) management's execution and 2) the growth in the adoption of their products. I will accumulate on any weakness."
4045360,76115,2017-02-13T11:00:14-05:00,I let CyberArk's management do its thing in the last six months and it has delivered.Two points for this coming year: The company's business model is still in growth mode and guidance is all about the market's opportunity.The bottom line for this year: let management continue to execute and buy on earnings dips. The rest the company will carry.,"It's been a few months since I've written on CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) - just shy of six months to be exact. The reasoning? I've been content with letting management execute over a longer period. Now though, with full year earnings released and 2017 guidance revealed, I have some opinion and analysis to contribute for the next stretch.Source: CyberArk's LinkedInFor the full year CyberArk brought in $216.6M, an increase of 35% over 2015. Its non-GAAP net income was $45.2M or $1.26 per share, an increase of 26% over 2015's $1.00 in EPS. Guidance expects revenue of $268.5M at the mid-point - an increase of 24% - along with $1.22 in non-GAAP income per share.There are two major points I want to discuss regarding CyberArk's business and its outlook. The first is their business model is still producing growth and the second is their conservative guidance is an opportunity in the short-term for long-term return.Growth Still ContinuesMy biggest concern with the company going into this year was its forecast for growth. CyberArk has been impressive in their growth in the 15 months I've been following them so I wondered what exactly guidance would be.CYBR Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsI expected low 20's and even high teens in growth going into the earnings release. When I heard 24% growth at the mid-point I was pleasantly surprised. While 24% sounds like a slowdown compared to the recent 35% year-over-year increase, it is much better than I expected and will be the low end of actual results, which I'll get into in my second point.So while looking like a slowdown on its face based solely on the numbers, there is more to take into account.How's the competition faring, for one?Good question - and always a good idea to look in to with this industry. When finding the best company to invest in while searching one of the most misunderstood and competitive markets - cybersecurity - a correlation or a disconnect could be the difference in picking the winner.FEYE Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsMany of the larger cybersecurity companies like Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and Fortinent (NASDAQ:FTNT) are experiencing good growth, though slowing - not too dissimilar to CYBR - but CYBR continues to provide an overall smooth trajectory. Its peers, however, are beginning to taper off from their once high growth rates. Sure, the law of large numbers comes into effect for some of these companies as they are growing revenue at $100M clips year-over-year for each quarter but this is a reason why investing in CyberArk will bring higher returns still - it has more runway.Where CyberArk shines above the rest is on an income level. While similar companies like FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and Fortinet hemorrhage cash, CYBR is profitable while it retains and grows its cash. FireEye, while having its own set of problems in the revenue growth department, still struggles with making a profit. FEYE has a non-GAAP loss of $0.99 per share while CYBR had a $1.26 profit.Since IPO'ing in 2014 CYBR has grown cash from $169M (which includes proceeds from its IPO) to $295.5M, nearly doubling its cash reserves in just over two years. This includes two acquisitions for at least $30.5M that we know of. To say CyberArk's cash flow is strong - especially within the context of its peers - is an understatement.Conservative Guidance Means Much More Growth ComingManagement at CyberArk has been executing great in the last year - cash is coming in and revenue is growing - but something it continually does is set expectations in-line with the current year on net income and less than exciting growth in revenue for Street expectations.But I know, and I have said it before, CYBR does this time and time again and never actually meets guidance - it exceeds it comfortably. For example, coming into 2016 management set expectations of $206M or 28% growth for 2016 but instead delivered 35% growth with $216.6M in revenue.Before you jump at the definition of ""fluke"", allow me to show you 2015 expectations and delivery. Initially expecting $128M or 24.5% revenue growth, it delivered $160.8M or 56% in growth for full year 2015.So why am I excited about 24% growth? Because management will realistically deliver high 20's or low 30's.What is even better about this is the market reacts the same way every time. It literally has become like clockwork: rise into earnings, earnings deliver conservative guidance, the stock drops, buyers move in and buy the dip and the stock takes back off. Rinse and repeat. I wrote an article just on this opportunity alone because it really has proven to be an opportunity. And it happened again this past week!Oh but don't let me move on without showing the guidance on net income - it's also one for the notepad. After expecting earnings per share between $0.83 and $0.86 the company, as we know, delivered $1.26 per share. So even though the company guided 2017 for what is shown as a negative growth in earnings, this is not where the final number will land.And one more thing: that initial guide of mid-80's for earnings per share would have been a growth rate of negative 15% compared to the prior year.Case in point? Take the market's reaction as an opportunity. Let the company continue their excellent execution and ride the real results to higher returns.Don't Care What You Call It, It's A Good OpportunityYou can try to point out the flaws in the company's business model, how it's billings at one point during the year looked weak and predicted a huge drop in revenue or how the company sandbags guidance but there is one thing which can't be argued - its results. The execution by management has been consistent and investment worthy. I like consistent and I like results.With greater investments in marketing and sales to come this year - and it has the financial flexibility to invest in it - it will produce results on the other end. Sure, I don't own shares of the company. I explained my situation in an earlier article, but I'm not bitter about it. My readers should know CYBR has been delivering and is set to continue to deliver.I like CyberArk and I like its year ahead.If you'd like to be made aware of my opinion and analysis in the future on CyberArk, along with other tech and cybersecurity companies, then I encourage you to follow me by clicking the ""Follow"" link at the top of this page next to my name."

(NASDAQ:FB), one of the most successful technology companies ever, Zuckerberg is a genius when it comes to technology.But despite Zuckerberg's financial resources and tech smarts, the young billionaire recently fell prey to hackers.In early June, Zuckerberg's Twitter and Pinterest accounts were hacked.The perpetrators found Zuckerberg's passwords --""dadada"" -- in a database of more than 100 million usernames and passwords that were stolen from LinkedIn in 2012.Although Zuckerberg suffered little reputation damage from the incident, the hacking was a bit embarrassing. After all, his company warns its users not to use their Facebook passwords anywhere else online.However, the hacking actually places Mark Zuckerberg in good company.Hacking is going viral in 2016. The headlines have been filled with high-profile hackings threatening the most powerful private and public institutions in the world.In May, Myspace was hacked and had 360 million email addresses and passwords stolen.Experts are saying it could be the largest hack ever.Last week Dropbox, one of the world's largest suppliers of cloud storage, had more than 68 million account details leaked.Hacking is hitting the public sector just as hard.In July the Democratic National Convention was hacked.Hackers recently breached databases for election systems in Arizona and Illinois.Leakedsource.com, a company that sells access to stolen data, says it has added more than a billion records to its databases since May.Being hacked can be devastating for a company, costing tens of millions in lost revenue and legal fees. Add in reputational damage or patent infringement, and losses can spiral into the billions.Sony is the perfect example. When the global leader was hacked in 2015 the breech brought the company to its knees. Estimates suggest the hacking cost Sony $35 million in IT repairs alone.The threat of being hacked will have companies and governments has sent cyber security spending soaring in the last five years. Take a look below.Looking forward, cyber security spending is set to accelerate.According to market research firm Gartner, the global cyber security market topped $75 billion in 2015. Gartner expects the market to grow to $100 billion by 2018. Market research firm Markets and Markets expects the global cyber security market to hit $175 billion by 2020.This tidal wave of spending is creating a great investment opportunity. It has never been a better time to be a cyber security company. These companies are in position to record revenue and earnings.Today I am going to help your profit from this trend.One way to profit is with PureFunds ISE Cyber Security (HACK). Launched in December of 2014, this ETF has been around for less than two years. This fund currently holds 34 cyber security stocks, making it an excellent way for investors to gain diversified exposure to the cyber security industry.Another way to profit is by investing in an individual company. Below is a list of industry leaders that I expect to benefit from more spending on cyber security.From this list, two stocks caught my attention in particular. Both of these companies recently reported record revenue, and I am expecting more of the same in the second half of the year.Check Point Software (CHKP) develops both hardware and software designed to increase network security for large companies. Checkpoint has been on a roll in 2016. Revenue just hit a new all-time high, putting Checkpoint on pace to grow earnings by 8% in 2016. Analysts are projecting another 7% earnings growth in 2017. Many cyber security stocks trade with high valuations, but not Check Point. Its forward P/E of 18 is a sharp discount to the industry average 78, and is in line with the S&P 500.CyberArk Software (CYBR) develops cyber security software with a focus on the financial, energy, retail and healthcare industries. In the last five years, CyberArk's revenue has surged, climbing 164%. Take a look below.Those impressive revenue gains have helped CyberArk crush earnings expectations, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 68% in the last four quarters. Looking forward, analysts expect CyberArk to grow earnings by 30% in 2017.Risks To Consider: Investors are expecting big things from cyber security stocks. That has many of the industry's most promising companies trading with nose-bleed valuations. The industry has an average P/E ratio of 78. CyberArk has a P/E ratio of 69. The industry will need to continue delivering huge revenue growth for shares to move higher.Action To Take: For conservative investors, HACK and Check Point are the best fit. HACK offers diversified exposure to the industry by holding 34 stocks, while Check Point is one of the industry's biggest companies. For aggressive, growth investors, CyberArk is the best fit.This article was originally published on StreetAuthority.com."
4004297,71075,2016-09-06T07:59:24-04:00,Security is constantly changing as it catches up with the advancements in IT and application technology.The rise of privileged account management comes in tandem with the decline of traditional perimeter security.Thycotic is poised to grow quickly within this greenfield market opportunity.,"Cyber threats have evolved beyond their humble beginnings as disruption and publicity stunts. As companies and organizations continue to digitize their assets, hackers are targeting financial gain with more and more at stake. Cyber-attacks are increasingly gaining in sophistication and pervasiveness. There is no denying the importance of cybersecurity in this market. Within a few decades, the industry has grown to a whopping $55 billion, crowning a select number of billion-dollar security giants along the way. As well as being extremely fast-growing, security is also constantly changing as it catches up with the advancements in IT and application technology. One vertical within security that has gained much clout is privileged account management.In the world of privileged account management (PAM), the first name that comes to mind is CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR), the market leader in a white-hot sector of cyber security. However, in the midst of this unprecedented growth and opportunity in privileged account management, Thycotic is quickly becoming a leader in the space.Headquartered in Washington DC, Thycotic provides privileged account management to enterprises. Their privileged account (PA) security solutions proactively protect privileged accounts, limit user privileges, and control applications on endpoints and servers. Growing at nearly 100% CAGR, the Company has over 7,500 customers within a variety of industries. Thycotic has significant exposure with clients in the US as well as Europe and APAC regions. Representative customers include Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Gap (NYSE:GPX), Deloitte, Baxter (NYSE:BAX), and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). In 2015, the Company raised an undisclosed round of from Insight Venture Partners.The State of Privileged Account Management:Privileged account management, what Thycotic specializes in, is a layer of IT security that serves to protect organizations from cyber-attacks that have already penetrated the network perimeter. Essentially, once a hacker has broken into a company's network, the next goal is to gain access to higher and higher privileged accounts. Higher accounts have greater access to a company's data. Due to the increasing sophistication and pervasiveness of cyber-attacks, traditional cybersecurity methods need a comprehensive approach to securing privileged accounts.The Decline of the Perimeter:The rise of PAM comes in tandem with the decline of traditional perimeter security. A large segment of IT spending is on perimeter security that forms a secure perimeter around a corporate network. This includes the nearly $8bn network firewall market, led by large players like Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE). Although perimeter security has played a large role in many current security strategies, there are a few problem areas with this approach.1. Big Data and the CloudWith the increasing adoption of cloud computing, mobile, social networking, and IoT, it has become more and more difficult to properly define the boundaries of a corporate network. Traditionally, data flowed through one network provided by a company, so it was predictable and controlled. Now, the perimeter is drawn by the identity of the person accessing the device. Attackers are targeting the person at the keyboard. Employees or ""Insiders"" can easily bring mobile devices and social network profiles on and off premises. On top of this, as companies compile greater amounts of data, the sheer size of networks has multiplied, driving more complex architectures and a blurred perimeter.2. Internal ThreatsThe outside of a perimeter is heavily secured with current solutions on the market, but the internal components of a network are still left unprotected. Using stolen credentials to impersonate an internal account is becoming a popular method of cyber breaches with high-profile breaches of J.P. Morgan (NYSE:JPM) and Sony (NYSE:SNE) both attributable to privileged account impersonations.As cyber-attacks grow in intensity and comprehensiveness, companies are recognizing that traditional perimeter security solutions are not enough to protect against advanced threats. As a result, companies are investing more and more into internal security within the datacenter to protect the inside of their networks.Where Thycotic Stands:The Company's solutions suite includes PA management, application control, local security, endpoint configuration security, end-user productivity, and group management server solutions. Thycotic's security suite has gotten strong recognition within the industry, making the Inc. 5000 Fastest Growing Companies list since 2013. In Cybersecurity Ventures' new Cybersecurity 500, Thycotic stands at #18, having moved ahead of CyberArk and the rest of the PA security cohort.What makes Thycotic's security software different from its swath of competition including CyberArk, Xceedium, and Quest Software, is a combination of simplicity and deployment speed. Thycotic's privileged account management suite is similar in function to that of CyberArk, but its products are easier to use and can be deployed faster. This can be attributable to the Company's technology and how it was built on a simplicity model. Simplicity of use is important within cyber security because it makes integration with other security software smoother. A smoother integration goes towards a cheaper total cost of ownership.Secret Server Cloud PAMIn order to further boost its deployment speed, Thycotic is planning to launch Secret Server Cloud, the industry's first privileged account management cloud. Powered by Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure cloud platform, Secret Server Cloud is offered to companies for free up to 100 users. This cloud deployment alternative provides yet another method of deployment along with on-premise and hybrid.Arellia AcquisitionThycotic acquired and quickly integrated Arellia, a privileged account management solution for Windows. This acquisition is similar to that of Viewfinity by CyberArk and serves to expand Thycotic's service offerings.With a competitive service offering and continued product developments, Thycotic is poised to grow quickly within the greenfield market opportunity that is privileged account management. In a market positioned like PAM, growth is not a zero-sum game, and Thycotic can certainly ramp up along with its cohort."
4001853,102101,2016-08-24T13:48:45-04:00,CyberArk has continued to beat guidance in recent quarters.Analysts and investors think the party will soon be over.A pair trade with a strategically positioned player can unlock both long- and short-term value for investors.,"CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) is a niche player in the cyber security market with its PAS (privilege access security) technology, protecting organizations from attacks inside the network.Management has consistently guided soft, subsequently beating their estimates in recent quarters.The company's financials are attractive. However, investors doubt its ability to continue this great streak.How long will the streak continue and how can we capture gains since we cannot time the length of the brilliant streak?Let us take a closer look.What are the drivers of growth?Growth in the PAS niche has been driven by an increase in ransomware attacks. Essentially, attackers are now focusing on small-scale exploits as highlighted by FireEye's (NASDAQ:FEYE) CEO Kevin Mandia. CyberArk has profited from this with a steady ramp up in revenue, income and FCF.Revenue has been driven by acquisitions, with the purchase of Viewfinity contributing a big factor to revenue and earnings growth in the last quarter. The PAS niche TAM is estimated at $9B. With a market cap of $1.9B and a strong leadership position, CyberArk is poised to capture more market share as it currently controls less than 5% of the PAS market.How does management want to ensure sustainability?Management has been strategic with acquisitions. They also have been developing products in-house with the recent spike in R&D budget highlighting this. The purchase of Viewfinity and in-house development of cloud security solutions also has broadened the scope and scale of their offerings.Earnings growthEarnings have grown steadily over the past years. This has been driven largely my management's ability to manage cost while generating more value for investors and customers. Their exceptional ability to increase ROIC while gaining market share is compelling. This is the top quality of a management that knows what they are doing.However, to sustain earnings, management needs to maintain their stronghold in the industry by gaining market share. Horizontal expansion is a good way to achieve this. Being a niche pure play, management has not hinted at the possibilities of horizontal integration of other security segments such as firewalls, advanced threats and web security. Investors can seek solace in the many opportunities to gain market share in their niche market, coupled with their product offerings targeting insider attacks on networks. Insider attacks have been a trigger for over 80% of cyber attacks in recent times via techniques such as spear phishing and social engineering - it is not going away anytime soon.Is preservation of margins good for sustainability?If CyberArk witnesses a reduction in profit margins, the stock will be sorely punished. Management knows volatility in the security market makes this a big possibility, and they have been guiding softly to prevent this. However, the growing interest in security by large companies such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and consolidation by other competitors means management will have no choice but to invest heavily in sales and marketing to preserve market share.Analysts are also being conservative with a consensus estimate of around $58, a 3.5% increase from the current price. Clearly, most analysts do not project much growth for CyberArk in the coming quarters.What is the best berth for management?CyberArk has a strong balance sheet and a management with strong operations skills. Its current debt level will offer great incentives to grow the company with a reasonable amount of leverage. I do not think this is a bad idea since IBM, Dell and Microsoft will go after its market share if it fails to build a moat around it. Even Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is starting to develop capabilities similar to CYBR.The future belongs to those who can create, manage and protect large networks. Creation and management are owned by the likes of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). This leaves Microsoft, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and IBM with security. Their huge thirst for power and survival will make them big predators to small players like CyberArk who are trying to carve a niche in the security ecosystem.The recent rise in demand of ransomware attacks has no doubt benefited CyberArk. It is a case of being at the right place at the right time with the perfect product. However, there is no guarantee that ransomware attacks will be as rampant as they are now.Over time, when attackers no longer find it profitable, they will switch to other attack vectors. My biggest berth will be cloud-based attacks and zero-days (advanced attacks) - a threat vector the likes of Cisco, FireEye and Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW) are good at mitigating.Symantec (SYMC) recently learned this the hard way when it concentrated too much focus on consumer security via signature-based virus detection. The commoditization of that segment left it no choice but to expand into cloud security for sustainability.CyberArk is thinking more proactively with the recent announcement of its capability to provide cloud-based PAS to the endpoint. However, it only broadens its scale in PAS and not its scope. It is still handicapped in terms of product portfolio capabilities and functionalities.How should investors prepare?FireEye witnessed lower than expected growth in the last quarter. This was attributed to a shift in attack vector to small-scale ransomware attacks, the defense of which it has little specialty in. To avoid such loss due to shift in attack vector, investors who have the appetite to stomach the volatility of cyber security stocks should consider a pair trade.How will this play out?Long term, demand for security solutions preventing sophisticated attacks will rise. To capture this gain, I recommend investing in a pair of stocks with strong capabilities in cloud security, advanced threat protection and firewalls. I foresee demand rotating between the three product offerings.If CyberArk is not acquired, a reduction in margins and returns will be cushioned by an investment in a cyber security stock positioning itself to capture long-term gains via developed capabilities in the fields mentioned above (ATP, cloud and firewall). The most suitable candidates are Cisco, Checkpoint (NASDAQ:CHKP) and Symantec. All three have a strong brand, sales force and marketing prowess to capture the growing market of consumers who will be interested in security for cloud, IoT, and other advanced threat vectors.Considering a combination of CyberArk (short-term gains) and either of Checkpoint (firewall), Cisco (advanced threat) or Symantec (web and cloud security) for long-term profit.Plotting ROIC and P/S, we find Checkpoint to be the most attractive. This is not hard to find given that firewalls have been the best-selling security solutions.The other candidates (Symantec and Cisco) also have great potential but will take a longer time to realize substantial gains on their current security investments.Investors should perform more due diligence before buying the stock. I see great opportunities in all the listed stocks long term."
3998197,22148,2016-08-10T07:31:04-04:00,"CyberArk beats Q2 estimates by the typical wide margin.
        The company is guiding to Q3 estimates suggesting the growth story is over.
        The stock is setup with limited upside and huge downside risk based on other sector stocks.","After the close, CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) reported that Q2 results blew past expectations. My previous research detailed how the cybersecurity specialists typically blows past quarterly estimates.The stock plateaued at $55 over the last month. CyberArk is trading down in after hours after the beat as a further highlight that the valuation could be a limiting factor to stock gains.The company beat EPS estimates by a wide $0.09 due to the typical revenue beat of $2.1 million. The stock had a valuation of $1.8 billion though quarterly revenues were only $50.4 million so the valuation was already stretched.As stated prior, CyberArk faces the issue of slowing growth. The company grew Q2 revenues by 39% and only forecast Q3 growth of 30%. The number is right inline with analyst estimates, but the normal beat will still lead to a deceleration in the growth rate.The biggest hiccup comes with the Q3 EPS guidance of $0.22 that suggests a $0.07 sequential decrease. The Estimize chart highlights the history of earnings beats, but the company now requires the huge beats in order to grow earnings.Last Q3, CyberArk reported and EPS of $0.26. This year, the company has to beat guidance by $0.05 to generate growth. History shows that CyberArk is likely to achieve that earnings beat, but the impact of not beating by a wide margin could be brutal to the stock.The chart of sector players is a prime example of what eventually happens to the valuation. Cybersecurity stocks like FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), Imperva (NASDAQ:IMPV) and Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW) have all fallen from the lofty P/S ratios from a year ago.CYBR PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that CyberArk continues to forecast that the bullish growth story will end some day. History suggests the stock won't survive very well from these lofty valuations when that occurs."
4000232,76115,2016-08-17T10:05:26-04:00,"Growth looks to be plateauing at CyberArk, but guidance continues to be revised upward.What no one has mentioned is the company has used this year thus far to reinvest in itself.This reinvestment will keep CyberArk at the forefront of their market and they will be able to extend their growth beyond what most expect.","With another quarter on record for CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR), I dove in to see what - if anything - needed further analysis other than the upfront earnings numbers. Only two things stood out to me: guidance has continued to climb and the company has chosen to invest heavily in itself.Point number one has been a hot topic with CyberArk in recent quarters. As has been pointed out by my readers and fellow contributors alike, management likes to play it conservative even if it means formulating substantial slowing in growth or an all-out negative growth story. Take this quarter for example.Guidance for Q3 on net income is set at $0.21-0.23 per share. This compares to $0.26 per share in income for the third quarter of last year. On its face it says a 15% decrease in earnings year-over-year is expected.Now, as I've written about before, management has a track record of guiding light and blowing past expectations. Recently, Stone Fox Capital succinctly made light of this with the recent report also. I think it's safe to say we both agree the company will exceed expectations and will not return a negative growth story.The key point I want to take away from guidance is yearly guidance continues to be revised upward. In Q4 of last year the company announced yearly guidance for '16 with net income coming in at $0.83 to $0.86 per share. Again, those numbers would have shown a remarkable slowing in the growth story we have come to know with CyberArk. However, since then, guidance is now at $1.03 to $1.07 per share for the year. That's an increase of 24% in guidance in just three reports.Based on the way management operates I expect to see another upward revision on the Q3 report which then will set the company up for a beat in Q4, further increasing its yearly earnings. That said, I foresee non-GAAP net income coming in around $1.20 when it's all said and done. This would compare to $1.00 in net income in 2015 or a modest 20% growth rate; a little unsettling for those looking for more growth for a longer time frame.But this brings me to my second point about investing in itself.What no one has really mentioned is the company has dramatically increased spending on research and development as well as sales and marketing this year. In fact, the company has increased R&D spend by almost 92% and sales and marketing by 41%.(Source: CyberArk's Q2 '16 Earnings Release)So far this year operating expenses have increased 54% over last year. This would be a little worrying seeing as revenue only increased 40% in the first six months. However, I strongly agree with management's approach to this reinvestment. It hasn't increased Opex at such neck-breaking speeds so as to lose all growth momentum but at the same time has doubled up on the place which matters most in this industry: R&D.""But, Joe, you're using non-GAAP net income numbers and management is obviously taking out share-based compensation on this reinvestment.""And you are absolutely right.The difference, however, is share-based compensation of R&D and sales and marketing is a fraction of the operating expenses. Only 4.5% of the R&D expense is share-based compensation. While this is an increase of 1,074% over last year's compensation, it is still a small fraction of the remaining Opex.This means most of the expenses are up front, GAAP or non-GAAP. The sticking point is when compensation is compared to net income because it has become a much larger percent and this is why we are seeing a slowing on the bottom line at least on a GAAP basis. Alternatively, the non-GAAP side can't be distilled any further because, as I just mentioned, the expenses are up front.And I'm okay with that.That's because this is a fast moving industry and R&D and sales must keep pace with customers' needs as well as competitors. If the company continued to stay lean on operating expenses but drove net income at a very high growth rate they would surely reach a point where it would run out of gas and the company would be left with zero innovation and zero new customers in new territories.Therefore, as someone looking to CYBR as an investment I am deeply appreciative of how management is tackling its own investments while taking care of its shareholders. I believe this is why we didn't see such a huge drop in share price after earnings and are already seeing the price balance back out. Investors are realizing they are still getting growth while being reinvested into.This approach is a far cry from peers like FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW) who are spending what they don't have. I'd much rather own a company whose management is creating investor equity and still knows how to pivot their company to the next level necessary to stay competitive and relevant in a very intense industry.If you'd like to be made aware of my opinion and analysis in the future on CyberArk, along with other tech and cybersecurity companies, I encourage you to follow me by clicking the ""Follow"" link at the top of this page next to my name."
3981708,76115,2016-06-13T14:17:24-04:00,"CyberArk has had interesting market patterns following earnings allowing for some fantastic investment opportunities.The cause for these opportunities is found in management's guidance, which is perceived initially as light, only for the company to issue earnings above the market's and their own expectations.I believe this earnings pattern will continue as long as peers are struggling and the company continues on their revenue trajectory.","CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) issued satisfactory results on their most recent earnings call. Their guidance was conservative - as is their trend - but the company has stayed on track for growth in a very consistent manner. This is due to steady and precise execution as well as a track record of overdelivering. These two factors have created repeated opportunities for investors looking for start or add to a position in the stock.I want to focus on capitalizing on CYBR's ability to execute above and beyond analyst estimates - as well as their own guidance - as the market creates opportunity. Time and time again we've seen the stock take a dive in trading following earnings because guidance is initially perceived to be ""light"" only for the stock to take off in the weeks that followed.Allow me to give some examples.On February 11th of this year the company handily beat top and bottom line expectations of analysts as well as their own guidance for Q4. The mid-point of guidance was set at $43.5M and $0.19 while reported earnings were $51.5M and $0.39. However, the stock sold off the following day as much as 14.3%. Why? Simply because guidance was ""only"" in range of consensus estimates.Why was this previous quarter's blowout of guidance not taken into account? I have an idea, which I'll get to later, but what I am sure of is I missed an opportunity to start a position in the stock. My limit order didn't hit by inches, to the point I'm not even comfortable talking about it.In the weeks following the stock regained all of its losses and more. In fact, the increase was well over 30% and, if you include the low of $31.50, actual return would have been closer to 36%.That was opportunity knocking and I knew it as I waved at the stock price leaving my limit order and not looking back.But wait, there's more. On May 5th CYBR announced Q1 earnings. Revenue came in at $46.9M while EPS came in at $0.23. This compares to the in-consensus-range guidance issued only three months prior of $43M and $0.16. Pretty decent execution though not nearly as fantastic as the Q4 beat but hardly a reason to sell off 14% only three months before.The stock like clockwork repeated the process. It fell nearly 4% in after hours trading only to recover somewhat to post a small gain the following day. However, if you were watching for the opportunity you could have grabbed shares at $38.20 - 5.4% lower than the previous day's close.What happened in the weeks since then have not been all that surprising considering my first opportunistic example. Since that week's intra-day low of $38.20 the stock has outperformed to the tune of 25.5%.Total return after these two periods has been nothing short of remarkable. If you capitalized on the opportunity I said was occurring in my last article on CYBR then you would have been up 39%. If you took advantage of the opportunity while it was happening a few days before during the volatile session that occurred you would be up 52%!But the question remains: why the negative market reaction?Some Color As To Why These Opportunities AppearMany of the players in the cybersecurity industry have been giving CyberArk a tough time; while CYBR has outperformed, peers have been having rocky go arounds these last few earnings seasons. In other words any inclination of ""weak"" guidance sends any of the industry's stocks down due to the bearish drag on the sector.CyberArk management has been executing so well that they have raised full year 2016 guidance from its original estimate laid out in Q4. Initially expecting $206M and $0.85 at the mid-point they have upped their guidance to $210M and $0.89 at the mid-point. This is in contrast to peers who have been issuing poor results, even worse guidance, and unable to soundly beat said guidance.To put my analysis in perspective, CYBR is not like its peers. CYBR is likely not going to perform at the $0.89 range but instead something far beyond, as their quarterly track record affirms.Their ""light"" guidance is merely the starting point of expectations. When they issue guidance they are saying, ""We see your bet and we call you. We'll see you in the next round where our hand is already setup."" From there the stakes - in this case execution - only gets higher and the pot is theirs (and yours too if you are on to this).Repeat Opportunities Still Ahead?Now, all of this doesn't mean this will continue. Far from it. All investors know past performance is simply past performance. It provides no cushion or lessened risk for the future (but maybe some confidence in management). However, what is unique about the software industry is there is typically a two-part income stream.First there is licensing which is the actual selling of the software to the customer. The second is the maintenance and services (M&S) costs which are on-going during the lifetime of the customer. As long as licensing increases so does this second, more long-term income stream. The only caveat is professional services usually ties into licensing since with new products comes an installation and rollout to the client. However, services can also be used for version upgrades and other miscellaneous activities throughout the lifecycle of software and therefore can be considered ongoing as well.In this stage of growth you want a company to be increasing licensing rapidly so their M&S will consistently provide cash flow in mature stages later on. Typically you can expect software companies to contract about 10-15% of their license costs for support and maintenance on a yearly basis.The company has done a great job building their revenue toward this consistent income stream. As licensing experiences seasonal swings caused by IT departments' budget years starting and ending, the M&S has been on a smooth trend upward.Data Sourced From investors.cyberark.com, Charts Are Author'sThis is all to say CyberArk has very good visibility of their business. As licensing comps begin to slow down with the company scaling into the biggest companies needing internal server and user security, their M&S revenue begins to ramp up. Management therefore can accurately predict their revenue which leaves them to worry about capex and costs which are instead internal factors.Along with their style of management to be conservative, this allows guidance to be foundational rather than challenging. The real challenge is predicting how far above they manage to execute.ConclusionThe bottom line is I expect CyberArk to repeat this type of earnings behavior. This behavior has in the past created investment opportunity due to the subsequent market reaction. The question is will the market continue to respond like it has.If peers continue their struggled growth the market may very well continue to set CYBR up to present opportunity to those looking to get in on the company. Look to peers like FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) for an industry gauge in order to better understand if CYBR's guidance will lead the market to the exits. The silver lining is knowing the company will perform well beyond initial expectations.If you'd like to be made aware of my opinion and analysis in the future on CyberArk, along with other tech and cybersecurity companies, I encourage you to follow me by clicking the ""Follow"" link at the top of this page next to my name."

This also allowed the company to nearly meet my full-year target of $0.75-0.79 in GAAP EPS by racking up $0.73 per share.On the revenue side the company issued Q4 revenue of $51.5M vs. a consensus of $43.88M, good for a year-over-year increase of nearly 42%. Yearly revenue came in at $160M, good for a 56% year-over-year increase.Now let's get to the guidance, which I believe attributed to the fall in stock price post earnings. Starting with revenue, the company expects $205-207M for full year 2016 which represents 27-29% growth. Earnings per share is expected to be $0.83-0.86 on a non-GAAP basis which would mean a decrease in earnings to the tune of 15.5% at the mid-point. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $39.7-41.3M or a decrease year-over-year of just under 7%.For a growth company in an active industry this doesn't seem all that settling. In fact, other than the top line the company might as well be going backwards. However, there's more to this story than simply numbers. First is management's stance on guidance.Last year management guided for 2015 to contain revenue of $127-130M. For earnings per share they guided for $0.24-0.27 on a non-GAAP basis. I think it's worth reiterating what 2015 actually came in at, which was $160M in revenue and $1.00 in non-GAAP EPS. Their guidance was underrated by leaps and bounds. Revenue came in 24.5% higher than the company guided for while net income came in 292% higher. There's a clear guidance pattern here and that's to give extremely prudent guidance while executing on the company's initiatives and billings.This is not to say I expect the company to bring in $3.31 in non-GAAP earnings for full-year 2016 - which would be another 292% jump from guidance. However, I do believe we can expect the guidance to be an absolute baseline. If anything I think issuing guidance at the level management did means the company expects great numbers come this time next year - in other words growth expected for a company executing like CyberArk. To give an idea of the company's execution let's examine the growth trajectory of the company.Over the last two years revenue has been growing steady at 56%. Guidance suggests that revenue growth for 2016 will be 28%. However, the company has beaten their guidance year after year and so if the company comes in 20% higher than guidance (below last year's surprise of 24.5%) that would mean $246M in revenue or 54% growth in revenue from 2015 to 2016. I believe this is realistic based on management's willingness to be prudent in their guidance.Regarding net income, the company has grown earnings per share 71% and 89% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. This is an upward trend but even with that in mind I will discount this year as a year that income growth slows. Given guidance shows a decline of 15.5% yet a most recent upside of 292% to that guidance I will place net income at $1.45 per share which would be 72% over guidance and a 45% increase in earnings year-over-year. This way I've accounted for both a slowing in the upside to guidance and year-over-year growth due to larger numbers and a multiples factor coming into play.Based on these forward looking estimates this would mean CYBR trades for a forward price-to-sales multiple of 4.7 and a forward P/E of 22.6 at current prices. Both of these mean to me that CYBR is in a great buy stage.The second factor to this story is that I believe the outlook for CyberArk's market is still very much in its prime and this is reflected by CEO Udi Mokady. During the Q4 conference call Udi had this to say in response to a question about one of their customer's CEO saying spending should slow now that emergency breach spending has passed:The analyst question is ill-conceived considering what CyberArk provides is the prevention of any stealing of information even after an initial breach. The idea is that CyberArk is providing a set of tools to deal with intruders once they have breached the network, something that I covered extensively in my previous article on the company. Therefore, this is not relevant to emergency spending since CyberArk's tools are meant to prevent critical information from leaving and is something any company can and should utilize to prevent a first breach of data or, in some cases, a second breach after realizing the need for their software.With guidance always being a prudently low bar for the company to exceed along with growth staying steady, I believe the market has created an opportunity to enter the stock for a reasonable value. Additionally, the market for the company's software is still widely in the adoption and momentum phase as confirmed by the CEO's observations and the many new contracts they have secured in the last year.With this said I have the funds and intention to buy CYBR this week should it continue to test 52-week lows. I will be buying in third to half positions in order to gain the best overall cost basis as the market may continue to punish the stock before results begin rolling in this year. At this level I believe there is more upside than downside as the company has been executing exceedingly well while guidance is always the most conservative out of any of the companies I follow, leaving room to exceed most expectations. My horizon is long term and I encourage other investors to determine for themselves whether this opportunity is right for them."
3988418,98236,2016-07-14T12:08:07-04:00,"CyberArk is a leading vendor of ""within firewall"" security solutions.It is a leader in its space although there are many competitors ranging from point vendors to large companies who offer identity management and pass word protection.The company, almost uniquely these days, has a license only revenue model that has had a major impact that has made this company highly profitable without much scale.The company is increasing spend on both R&D and on sales & marketing at high rates in order to take advantage of a host of unexploited opportunities.Over the 6 quarters that this company has been public, its estimates have proved to be far below actual attainment. It is likely that trend is still persisting.","CyberArk-Can a cybersecurity company actually have a special sauce?I think that the answer is yes-although not every industry observer concurs with that judgment. For most of the time since cyber criminals emerged 25 years ago, the principle focus of users has been to protect their data beyond more and more elaborate firewalls. Much of today's technology is based on advanced statistical modeling that attempts to find patterns of threat before the threat actually establishes a toehold. There are as many companies offering advanced firewalls and the adjunct technologies that are necessary to improve the functioning of those firewalls as there are…well perhaps companies who have made plans to build autonomous vehicles and on the number of commentators with thesis relating to gold and yields and the economic cycle. Maybe not as many as the number of Pokémon users. Cyber security trade shows can be dangerous to the uninitiated; lines, people and too many booths to separate the wheat from the chaff. Not enough chairs.CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) has a different approach to security in a battle field far less littered by opposing forces. The TAM for what it does, best described as Privileged Access Management (PAM) is nowhere close to the size of the TAM for all the security appliances that try to build moats around user data. In fact, it is almost impossible to find any consensus about either the definition or the size of the market. Perhaps the best set of estimates that I have seen is that the current market size for the PAM space is about $8 billion and it is growing at a CAGR of 12% and should reach $12 billion by 2020. I do think it is fair to say that PAM is an under-penetrated space with saturation at or below 20%.CyberArk's software operates within the firewall and its goal is to essentially remediate breaches before their impact becomes catastrophic. Many breaches don't come from traditional hacks. They are initiated by criminals and/or disgruntled employees who already have ""legal"" access to passwords and stored information. Firewalls will not stop them because they start from within the firewall. CyberArk and its competitors use technology that is based on something called privileged account security. Most computer professionals are aware that there is usually a ""back door"" into most networks through which network administrators can gain access to help manage the network. (Extreme over-simplification I know but this is an article about investing and not about bits and bytes). These backdoors are usually called ""privileged accounts"" because they give users special access to the heart of the network. Sadly, having access to the heart of the network allows individuals to sabotage firewall protections and facilitate large scale hacks. Hackers steal passwords and privileged account credentials all the time and when they do that, they can make the best firewall resemble the Maginot Line. The criminals are coming around it and not aiming their attacks where the defense is strong.There are technologies that are used to lock down administrator accounts and to manage access to them using privileged identity management software. Quite a bit of the market for privileged asset management comes from both compliance regulations promulgated by the government and by professional auditors and from reporting requirements that have become pervasive in many industries. Sometimes, the PAM solutions are used on a project by project basis.Conceptually the software at a high level doesn't appear to be as complex as the technologies deployed in 2nd generation firewalls. There are many. many companies in the privileged access space and CYBR is clearly the leader of the pack at this writing. The concept of controlling access to things like passwords and to data administration capabilities has been around many years. Single user sign on (SSO) developed as a security technology many years ago and many pioneers in the space have been sucked up into larger software vendors. CYBR has taken the basic concept, elaborated and refined it greatly and has developed sophisticated technology that tries to address all of the threat vectors within the firewall. It has proven to be a winning and a lucrative strategy thus far.CYBR's software is frequently used to manage passwords and to enforce security policies which are frequently adhered to in the breach. The software is said to remove ""the cloak of anonymity"" around shared privileged account usage. The software enforces security policies around privileged account behavior which is supposed to be flexible enough so that business processes can continue unhindered. The software manages the access that privileged users have to privileged accounts on a ""need to know"" basis. The software also provides a detailed audit trail so key executives can determine who had access to what data and when the access was granted. Sounds like the basis for a good spy thriller although most of these ideas have really been worked to death in that genre.Another key category of solutions is in an area called ""advanced persistent threats."" These days, it appears as though APT is in the mode of being a worldwide pandemic. An APT attack is based on a criminal gaining access to a network over a long period of time. The intention of the attack is to steal data rather than cause damage to the network. Lots of APT's originate from the espionage activities of countries such as the PRC who aim to steal the secrets of competing intelligence organizations. The solutions offered by Cyber Ark are quite similar in both purpose and implementation with the solutions that are deployed by the company to manage and control passwords.Privileged account management software is anything but pervasive due both to its expense and its annoying tendencies to lock out systems administrators from their ability to do their jobs.Currently lots of users need access to their data from mobile, web and cloud based interactions. They need to operate in the modern commercial world. In this kind of distributed environment, threats can and often do materialize in remote areas. The company has something that it describes as digital vault technology, military-grade encryption and tamper-proof auditing that has become necessary these days to meet compliance requirements. Is all of that a special sauce? I believe that it is and it is the combination of many ingredients and tweaks that has allowed this company to sell its solutions successfully and most important to enjoy rapid and profitable growth.Profitable Growth-now that is really a special sauce worth learning about!This company has actually achieved GAAP profitability at a scale when most other hyper-growth companies are struggling to achieve break even non-GAAP operations. The 2 significant factors in the company's profitability are the fact that this is a company deriving its revenues from an on-premise model that is not in transition and the fact that the company is located in Israel which has a significantly lower cost of doing business than most American locations. Further, as an Israeli company, the company has a substantially lower tax rate than would be the case for most American companies with IP domiciled in this country. Last year, the company's GAAP tax rate was accrued at less than 19%.CyberArk's 2015 operating cash flow was $59 million which is a cash flow margin of almost 37%, strong performance for any company, let alone one that grew 56%. Obviously, one of the particular elements of the secret sauce is that this company books most of its revenues from traditional license sales and the balance of its revenues come from maintenance and consulting services. Gross margins on license are more than 95%. That is a gross margin attainment that is more or less impossible to achieve in the subscription revenue model given the upfront costs and the long revenue recognition period for the delivery of services. The gross margins on services are outliers compared to the gross margins for other IT vendors. Last year, services gross margins were 73%. Just for comparison purposes, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has a negligible gross margin on services. Perhaps better comps might be EMC (NYSE:EMC) which has a gross margin on services of 65% and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) which also has a gross margin of 65%. Those figures include maintenance and professional services bundled as does the number from CyberArk.The company's other expense revenues were far below what might be thought of for most other software vendors. G&A was 11% of sales, down from 14% the prior year. Sales and marketing expense was 41% of sales, down from 45% the prior year and R&D was 13.5% of sales, down from 14% the prior year. Overall, GAAP operating margins for last year were 20.6% compared to 20% the prior year. These are all GAAP numbers.Overall, Non-GAAP operating margins were 27% in 2015 about 600 bps above GAAP operating margins. Again, much of the better profitability CyberArk has achieved really has to do with the differences between a company that sells perpetual licenses and a company that uses the SaaS business and product delivery model.Long ago, in a faraway land, like the software universe prior to the advent of the cloud say circa 2007, the kind of results that CyberArk has shown at its scale weren't particularly uncommon in the software universe. Now of course, it is essentially unheard of. Many investors have pined to buy a hyper-growth company in the security space that has a significant level of profitability. While CyberArk fits that specification it is worthwhile noting and repeating that companies with a SaaS revenue model have a significant level of ""hidden"" assets, i.e. the ultimate value of their renewals. It would be a serious analytical mistake to compare CyberArk to Palo Alto and conclude that CBYR has a more profitable business model. It has a different business model that reflects profits being recognized earlier in a customer relationship. CyberArk will not necessarily have a more profitable relationship with its users and it may well collect less revenue from customers than it would if it had a SaaS revenue option.There is no current indication that CyberArk is going to offer a SaaS alternative for either its entire product line or for some specific products at any time in the near future. On the last two conference calls the matter was neither raised during the prepared remarks or was raised by analysts during the Q&A.There are companies in the cybersecurity space that offer suites of SaaS solutions. If there is a risk to these shares, it would be the potential that market conditions in the future are going to impel this company to offer their solutions as services. In the real world transitions are not really that onerous. But in the world that readers live in, transitions can be large boat anchors.The threat of having to offer SaaS versions of the company's solutions need not be a factor in assessing these shares at this time. But it would at the least behoove investors to think about that as a possibility and to be aware that the announcement of a SaaS offering could lead to changed guidance and to lower valuations as has been the case when other companies started what would be similar transitions.In the end, the SaaS model, I believe would create more revenues and higher profitability for vendors than the perpetual model. Personally, I would try to have an alternative SaaS product delivery technology available for CYBR. That has been the strategy of many of the firewall security companies and I think it makes sense. I am not sure that there are specific technology issues with making PAM functionality available on a SaaS basis. But this company uses perpetual license sales and that allows it to grow revenues at a substantial rate while also achieving GAAP and non-GAAP profitability along with substantial cash flow at far lower size points than are the case for most other significant new software vendors.Many of the same trends seen during the course of 2015 were continued into Q1 2016 although GAAP operating margins were 13% down from 22% in the 2015 Q1 period. Some of that relates to the very significant growth in deferred revenues which increased by 18% sequentially during the quarter after declining in Q4 2015. Operating cash flow continued to rise, growing by 14% year on year and non-GAAP margins were 23% compared to 27% the prior year.While the growth was flattening out some, the actual numbers that were achieved constituted a significant beat. Overall, revenues of $47 million were 8% above the prior analyst consensus while EPS of $.23 was almost 50% above the prior consensus. When observers such as this writer see that kind of consistent pattern, it becomes likely that this company has determined to use guidance as a floor and not a real forecast. During the call, one questioner asked CFO Josh Siegel why his forecast of sequential growth was below the level achieved in 2015. Paraphrasing the answer somewhat, Mr. Siegel commented that Q1 was a strong quarter and that it was not company policy to project the strength of one particular quarter into a forecast for the following quarter. He and the CEO said on several occasions that the quarter was not back end loaded, that the pipeline was better than good and that they had not seen any slowdown that had plagued the results of some other cybersecurity vendors during the quarter.Historically, one way of determining whether or not quarters were back-end loaded has been to look at the change in receivables and of DSO. Receivables dropped by $4.5 million sequentially or by just shy of 20%. DSO was below 36 days. I think it is fair to say that this company did not have a back-end loaded quarter and that it most likely started Q2 with a fair tailwind.I would also observe that license revenue growth of 38% was visibly less than service revenue growth of 43% last quarter. I would be surprised if the company's internal models were consistent with that result. Almost certainly, license revenue growth of 23% in EMEA and 5% in APJ were significant misses from planned levels. So, the company reported an overall beat on revenues and EPS while almost certainly missing license revenue targets in total. To me, that suggests that the current company forecast which calls for little sequential revenue growth in the quarter that ended on 6/30 is likely to be exceeded. No other result would be consistent with the metrics seen in Q1 and management commentary.So, the bare numbers tell an impressive story concerning growth, profitability and cash flow. That being said, the increases are starting to flatten out a bit, more in the EMEA and the APJ regions than in the US. Actually growth in the Americas last quarter was 69% and revenue in the Americas was 62% of the total. EMEA at 23% growth and particularly APJ at 5% growth pulled down the overall percentage revenue expansion. Given that the Americas is twice the size of EMEA and more than 10X the size of APJ, my guess is that the sales coverage in the smaller regions is spotty or that sales execution in those regions is wanting. When I look at projections for the balance of this year and into 2017, I am inclined to imagine that there is more than a bit of conservatism baked into those expectations.The CFO said that if revenues overattained, then so would EPS. I think it most probable that revenues will overattain and hence I think that current consensus earnings projections are lower than make sense.Overall, while the company increased guidance marginally, it has decided to ramp sale and marketing and research & development spend at rates greater than revenue growth which makes quite a bit of sense given the relationship of sales growth between the different geos. Company CEO Udi Mokady described the issue as one of education in terms alerting potential customers in terms of the dangers they face in not protecting their data. Education is essentially equivalent to spending more on sales and marketing.Mr. Mokady discussed the different growth rates within verticals even in the Americas and commented that both the government and the healthcare verticals are starting to ""wake up."" Overall, Mr. Mokady said, 'at the government we are very excited because it had been a vertical that was lagging just like healthcare was in the past, and we're just seeing consistent understanding that they have to do it, sometimes the are mandated to do it, and they follow our government pace which will serve us in the long-term.""Results in the Q1-2016 quarter benefited to some extent from the acquisition of two relatively small vendors. Viewfinity was a product that CYBR had resold in the past and is designed to insure that local privileged business users do not have unnecessary administrative access to data while allowing those users to access what they need to do their jobs. The other product acquired was an application identity manager that thieves are forestalled from gaining access to embedded passwords.One of the keys to the company's success is its ability to broaden its distribution beyond the areas where it has enjoyed initial success. The CEO spoke about the diversification of business across verticals and business size. He also talked about the need to diversify in terms of geos but as was pointed out above that simply hasn't happened at this point. But the company is making efforts to sell to verticals including healthcare, government, retail, media and education. The company has had a great deal of success in selling to law firms and professional corporations who might simply go out of business if their customer records are ripped off.The company does have a reasonable distribution network at this point and so it should be able to sell to all sizes of enterprises on an economic basis-again that is more in the future than in the present. There are doubtless readers who might be concerned that the additional investment necessary to broaden distribution are going to impact the company's level of profitability.How Secret is the secret sauce of Cyber Ark?Password management is a solution that has been around for quite some time. Many years ago Computer Associates (NASDAQ:CA) bought a single user sign on company, that today is called SiteMinder. Site Minder certainly is far less sophisticated than the functionality available from CyberArk but it has always done what it is supposed to do. RSA SecurID (currently a component of EMC which also may be sold sooner rather than later) and Microsoft Azure Cloud also have password management features. Most other major application software vendors include Salesforce (CRM), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) have some kind of password managers but as might be anticipated they work with their own products and are not global solutions and lack many of the specific functions that are available from CyberArk. Gartner rates CyberArk highly and CyberArk has chaired panels on Privileged Access at Gartner events.Overall, there are 4 significant competitors who have enough critical mass in the specific privileged access space including BeyondTrust (Private), Centrify (Private), Dell (sold to Private Equity) and CyberArk. CyberArk is significantly larger than its 3 competitors in terms of revenues.When looking at the charts that enumerate each feature-and in some level of granularity-and compare each vendor by the availability of each feature, I tend to think enough! I just want to know who has a solution that is competitive and not how to buy some kind of Privileged Asset solution. The answer to the questions that we as investors seek to understand is not going to be found in these endless surveys and analysis.There are clearly several vendors who have broad privileged access solutions that tick most of the boxes and do what they are supposed to do. I think it is difficult to say categorically that CyberArk is the best of these. But it has the combination of scale, technology and apparently user satisfaction (for the most part-one always reads about some horror story about how poor this company or that company took care of a specific problem) that give CyberArk an advantage in the space and a leadership position that seems likely to be sustainable. As is often the case in writing these articles, it is difficult to say that one company or the other has an insurmountable competitive moat. Such things exist perhaps in fairy stories or in the minds of military officers fighting the last war. It is almost impossible to say they exist anywhere in software.As I have tried to write, there are many specific facets to password protection, privileged access and the whole field of solutions to monitor and control what goes on behind the firewall. CyberArk plays in a broader selection of these spaces with a product line that is well integrated and has visible advantages in the field of visible and actionable analytics.I am concerned that at some point, the lack of a SaaS variant of its products may become a competitive issue. As mentioned earlier, that hasn't seemed a problem to date. There are some SaaS alternatives in the space and I wonder if and to what extent that will be a risk for the company's growth rate and overall competitive position going forward. But until that happens-if it does-this company will, at the least, enjoy the growth in its space, which is more than its forecast and do so with a high level of reported profits and operating cash flow and non-SaaS software companies have negligible CapEx requirements.ValuationIt would, I imagine, be surprising for readers to find that a combination of growth and profitability in the cybersecurity space came with a modest valuation. The market often puts up pricing that is hard to understand-not so here. The company had its IPO on September 24 th, 2014. It proceeded to jump 50% from its offering price and ultimately wound up more than doubling again, up to a peak valuation of just above $70/share just over 1 year ago. The shares eventually dropped by more than half despite the business performance of the company and wound hitting a trough on February 9 th of this year at $32. So far, lots more money has been made trading this name than in investing in the shares.The company currently has an enterprise value of just shy of $1.3 billion. The consensus revenue estimate for the current year based on the estimates of 17 analysts is $210 million so that yields an EV/S of 6.1X and the estimate based on 2017 forecasts is about 5X. The growth rates that lie behind these forecasts seem to me to be unrealistically low. There is no reason that I can determine for the growth rate to drop from over 40% that has most recently been reported to 20% over the next 18 months given the low penetration of the space, the company's competitive position and the company's additional sales & marketing spending. I might further comment that many of the company's competitors appear to have some state of internal flux which is likely to be an issue for their own ability to compete.The company's P/E based on current estimates is 58X this year's consensus estimates and 46X the consensus forecast for 2017. Again, I imagine those forecasts will prove to be quite conservative. Over the last 4 quarters, the company has beat expectations consistently with upside in earnings ranging from 200%+ to ""just"" 44% last quarter. The company has a relatively strong First Call consensus rating but with a price target lower than the current price. That strongly suggests that analysts really do not believe their own published estimates. Based on the record this company has had since it went public-they shouldn't. I think a far more realistic expectation on which to base a P/E would be for 2017 earnings to exceed the current $1.14 EPS current consensus by at least 40% yielding a P/E expectation in the low 30X range.The company generated $16.5 million in operating cash flow in Q1 up from $14 million in the year earlier period. The company does not forecast either cash flow or free cash flow which always causes a certain amount of agita amongst observers. There is no accurate way that any outsider can forecast changes in balance sheet items or in deferred revenue balances. Since I believe that a free cash flow margin estimate is one of the principle valuation metrics I make the forecast but with a company with only a 2-year history of being public the exercise is fraught.That being said, most of the increase in operating cash flow in Q1 was a function of strong increase in both depreciation and stock based comp. Stock based comp is still relatively modest at 20% of cash flow but it was 30%+ of non-GAAP operating income. Given the significant increase in R&D headcount and the unavailability of new hires without significant option grants, stock based comp will continue to be a significant factor in the company's financial presentation.Last year the company achieved operating cash flow of $59 million with the largest single contributor being the growth in the deferred revenue balance. This is not a subscription company and it is unlikely to see huge increases in deferred revenues from multi-year maintenance contracts. So, at best I think that the growth in deferred revenues is going to be negligible in the current year, despite the strong results in that category in Q1. My guess is that operating cash flow will increase, but the rate of increase will only be around 10%-15%. Conservatively, I think an estimate of $66 million for the year is reasonable.Companies with a license revenue model simply have little CapEx unless they build a new headquarters. The major use of cash for a company like this is going to be for acquisitions and I would be surprised if CyberArk didn't find a couple of acquisitions to make in the balance of this year. But I think a free cash flow estimate of $63 million coupled with the company's $250 million cash balance gives CyberArk quite a bit of flexibility in finding acquisitions. Free cash flow of $63 million provides a free cash flow yield of just shy of 5%. That is a very reasonable metric for a company at this stage of its growth evolution and far better than free cash flow yields of many other vendors-mainly because this company derives its revenues from licenses and not from subscriptions although some of that difference is washed out by the growth in deferred revenues.As I see it, this company's valuation is reasonable, but less fantastic than it might see to some observers. One should pay a premium for subscription revenues. This company's land and expand strategy does help its forward visibility in terms of having built-in sources of growth. I think the company's estimates seem pretty modest-but I am afraid no one else really believes them either and that the shares are not likely to appreciate as much as they might until the company provides more reasonable guidance and chooses to raise estimates in the wake of significant earnings over-attainment.As many readers may be aware the shares of many security software companies have had a short term stumble due to the profit warning of Imperva (NYSE:IMPV). CYBR shares have not reacted materially to the IMPV news which ultimately puts additional pressure on the company to produce a significant upside when its reports quarterly results on August 9th. At current prices, I think the shares will produce a reasonable amount of positive alpha but less than might be the case with a different kind of set-up!Summing Up!"
3765676,76005,2015-12-18T15:34:50-05:00,There has been a good amount of consolidation in the IT security industry as tech giants acquire small companies.A takeover of CyberArk would be one of the largest deals of the IT security industry.A takeover of CyberArk could carry a premium of 42% of current share prices.,"CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) is one of the most successful companies in the IT security industry. Since its IPO in September 2014 the stock rocketed from $16 to $76. It's now trading around $45 per share, carrying a substantial (and some argue a justified) premium. CyberArk has not only been growing at a tremendous pace, but also it has been growing profitably. Many companies in the cyber security industry are not profitable. CyberArk generates positive and substantial free cash flow. In the nine months that ended in Q3 2015, CyberArk generated ~$40 million in cash from operating activities. When subtracting its investments in property and equipment (aka capex), the company netted $38.5 million in free cash flow on $109 million in sales. We are talking about a free cash flow margin of approximately 35%. Very good.In addition to the cash generating ability, CyberArk's unique product is attractive. Whereas most companies focus on protecting the outside (aka firewall) of an IT infrastructure, CyberArk focuses on the inside. CyberArk focuses to protecting and alerting customers when their accounts have already been broken into. Due to the nature of the product, CyberArk is a complementary to other IT security products.As the CEO expressed in the latest investor conference:""When CyberArk alerts, it's not (to say) hey there is somebody strange walking around the hotel. When CyberArk alerts it is (to say) hey there is somebody strange walking around the hotel and has the master key to all the rooms""Since CyberArk is a solid company in a hot industry, it's a reasonable candidate for a takeover. CyberArk's market cap of approximately $1.3 billion makes it an affordable target for tech giants.If CyberArk were to be fully acquired, it will have to be through a tender offer to shareholders. Under Israel law, an acquisition of 90% (or more) of the outstanding shares will have to be done through a tender offer. But the acquisition can only be completed if the acquirer receives positive responses from the holders of 95% of the issued capital.CyberArk institutional shareholders make up a small portion of the total equity ownership. The majority of the shares is held by a small group that includes the Goldman Sachs Group, Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP) and insiders.With such a large ownership proportion belonging to a small group, things can go either way. The majority would either decide to sell the company unanimously, or not.In a recent article about CyberArk, I argue that the stock carries an expensive premium in its market price. Despite the premium valuation, some believe that CyberArk won't remain independent for long. As the IT security industry continues to consolidate, it's reasonable to play with the possibility of a takeover.A little overview of the M&A activity in the IT security industryThe past two years have brought a good deal of consolidation in the IT security industry. Tech giants have been shopping for small IT security companies, spending approximately $15 billion on acquisitions. One example is Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) acquisition of Sourcefire for $2.7 billion, or 10.7x Sourcefire's sales. According to a PwC study of cyber security M&A deals, the median deal-price-to-EBITDA was 15x and the median deal-price-to-sales (P/S) 3x in 2011.However, the M&A activity in 2013-14 suggests that rich buyers are willing to pay a premium for good IT security companies. In a cyber security study published by Signal Hill, the top 10 deals (in terms of price multiples) cyber security had a price-to-sales (P/S) range from 50x to 9x. See table below for six examples.It's important to recognize that the priciest deals were some of the largest in the IT security industry. The median deal price out of the roughly 200 acquisitions that took place in 2013-14 was $40 million. Relatively small. Therefore, a potential takeover of CyberArk would be one of the largest in the industry. The recent largest deal was Cisco's. Two of the other largest deals are: IBM's acquisition of Trusteer for $900 million and FireEye's acquisition of Mandiant for $990 million.Therefore, a potential takeover of CyberArk will not only be one of the largest in the IT security industry, but also a takeover is likely to carry a P/S multiple between 9x and 50x. CyberArk's market cap of $1.3 billion would make the M&A top 10 list in terms of deal size.Based on the past M&A activity, let's see what an acquisition of CyberArk looks like. In the investment banking world, such analysis is called the comparable transaction method.CyberArk currently trades at a P/S of 9x. So at the bottom of the range, CyberArk would be acquired at a 0% premium. That's unlikely. In order to make a more realistic estimate, the price of a deal was calculated under four different scenarios. Each scenario was assigned a subjective probability of occurrence.The probabilities are as follows:Under the comparable transactions method, a takeover of CyberArk would happen at approximately $64 per share. Considering that there are approximately 31.7 million shares outstanding, the total size of the deal would be ~$2 billion. This is based on last 12 months sales of $145.7 million. Such a deal will carry a 42% premium to today's share price of $45.If an acquisition of CyberArk is priced at a multiple similar to Cisco's, then the deal would be ~$1.6 billion, or $49 per share. This deal would have approximately 8% premium to today's prices."

CyberArk, the market leader and largest pure play company within this vertical of security, is well positioned for strong, organic growth. The current value of the company does not fully reflect both these secular and company-specific positives. CyberArk is a compelling investment due to the following four contentions:1. CyberArk is the market leader both in share and functionality.2. Privileged account security is growing in demand.3. There are positive secular trends driving this company forward.4. CyberArk has made the right moves both within acquisitions and product development efforts.1. CyberArk is the market leader both in share and functionality.As the largest pure play in terms of revenue, within privileged access management, CyberArk covers every major sub-segment within the vertical. The company has garnered the trust of its customers as the top strategic security provider in an industry that is rife with customer churn. Its customer count spans nearly 40% of the Fortune 100. CYBR has taken full advantage of its role as a niche provider and sole focus on PA security to place itself ahead of larger rivals like CA Technologies (Xceedium), BeyondTrust, and Dell (Quest Software segment). Especially with all the recent M&A activity within this vertical, there could be a transition time between new management and operations before any synergies are realized.CyberArk offers its Shared Technology Platform, as a common user interface to manage other CyberArk products.The Shared Technology Platform includes:The rest of CyberArk's product portfolio covers password management, session monitoring, threat analytics, app identification, app control enablement, and privilege management. The pricing for its products are all on a per user or per server basis, which allows CyberArk to grow its revenues along with the growth of its customers as they scale in number of privileged accounts, administrative users, and servers. The industries that are able to utilize CyberArk's security solutions are wide spanning, ranging from financial services, to airlines, to pharma, so the company has the advantage of being a horizontal player in the vertical.Source: CyberArk Q1 16 Results2. Privileged account security is rapidly gaining demand.Privileged accounts (PAs) are simply a combination of a username and password used to login and provide access at the highest level to any device, system, or application. They are very common within databases, control systems, laptops, and applications to name a few. Traditionally, PA credentials are manually stored and distributed, shared among several users, and used by developers to access other applications or databases. However, this practice is risky because providing broad access to PAs makes them vulnerable to breaches, user activity cannot be tracked, and changing hardcoded App passwords can prove to be time-consuming.Privileged account security involves locking highly valuable privileged credentials in a vault, keeping a record of use by other users in a network, monitoring account sessions, and restricting specific functionalities.In 2014 and 2015, some of the largest breaches in the US were the result of cyber-attacks on privileged accounts. JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) infamous client account breach saw hackers obtain access to the highest level of administrative privilege. Sony (NYSE:SNE) discovered that hackers stole computer credentials of a system admin to give themselves broad access across its computer system.Once a hacker infiltrates a company's network, the next step will target elevating its access of privileged accounts and move up the chain to higher level credentials with greater access to every level of the network. CyberArk stops this process in its tracks with its PAS solution.3. Of course, we have all the secular trends.The Importance of PAs - With so many high-profile corporate breaches behind us, many companies are beginning to build up their security strategies with CyberArk as a partner. This ensures that their crown jewels remain intact, think of Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) secret recipe.Migration Towards the Cloud - Instead of hindering the PA security market, the cloud environment increases the risk and sensitivity of privileged access. This provides more room for further growth as companies expand their cloud networks.A Shift Away From Perimeter - Under CyberArk's security solutions, attackers may still be able to infiltrate networks, but CYBR focuses primarily on protecting high-privilege accounts. In turn, companies are shifting towards a more focused security strategy, rather than perimeter-based solutions.Regulation - Particularly in APAC, China recently passed regulations mandating that companies report their internal breaches publicly, essentially forcing them to increase spending on security solutions. Domestically, regulations like HIPAA place greater responsibility on enterprises to comply with data security requirements.4. Good Acquisitions and Even Better Product Developments.In 2015, CyberArk acquired Viewfinity, a Windows privilege manager, for $30.5mm in cash. Previously, CYBR offered a privileges manager for Windows through a reseller partnership, but now has boosted its margins by replacing the offering with Viewfinity. This gives CYBR full control over its product development and offering platform, making things seamless for their customers.Viewfinity also brought in its customer base of approximately 400 accounts to CyberArk's current ~2,200 customer count, giving a significant opportunity for cross-selling. Viewfinity also expands CyberArk's footprint in SaaS since the Windows service can be provided through a cloud platform, helping to further boost gross margins and increase CyberArk's top line.Along the same line, the company has set up a successful alliance partner program, including integration with more than 30 partners and relationships with channel partners and system integrators.CyberArk's Shared Technology Platform gives a sound base to leverage the rest of its product portfolio (outlined earlier in this article). The entirety of CyberArk's product line can be tied to a single platform, giving it a major advantage and allowing its customers easy upgrading to other products. This makes CyberArk a security vendor of sorts, rather than defaulting to yet another niche solution. This has translated to very promising customer retention and engagement metrics, with nearly a third of CYBR's existing customers making an upgrade each year. An increasing number of its customers are purchasing multiple products.ValuationCompared to the rest of the cyber security cohort, CyberArk has very high profitability (EBIT Margin) and similar growth. The best method of valuing CyberArk is based off of a multiple to forward free cash flow. Currently, CyberArk is valued at 29.0x EV/FY16 FCF as compared to its peers which trade at a median of 38.6x EV/FY16 FCF.Bull Case:If CyberArk maintains its positioning as the defining market leader in privileged accounts, expands its potential earnings from its Viewfinity acquisition and platform product development, and the secular growth within its vertical remains, then CYBR should receive a valuation on par with its high-growth comparables of ~38x EV/FY16 FCF. This valuation gives a 12-mo target price of $61 for a 26% upside potential.Bear Case:CyberArk loses market share to surging competitors from incumbent security firms like CA Technologies (Xceedium), BeyondTrust, and Dell (Quest Software segment). Pricing arises as a factor if software solutions become too comparable and this could cut into CyberArk's margins. Within cyber security, it could only be a matter of months before a competitor releases a new product and CyberArk needs to constantly be on its heels in terms of product development and potential partnerships. In the bear case, CyberArk should receive a valuation at a discount to its high-growth comparables of ~28x EV/FY16 FCF. This valuation gives a 12-mo target price of $46.90 for a 3% downside risk.Investment Risks:Perfect Pricing - CyberArk is currently priced to maintain its level of execution and earnings results, thus the company has to maintain those standards to justify its forward valuation.Customer Concentration - The Company's customer base is fairly concentrated in financial services with 36% of the company's bookings in FY 15. If there were to be a downturn in financial services, especially with the eve of 'Brexit', then IT spending budgets could fall, negatively impacting CyberArk's revenue per customer. CyberArk derives a significant chunk of its revenue from European markets, which may undergo some currency volatility due to the recent UK separation from the EU. Companies are unsure of future prospects in Europe and in turn will lower spending in IT and security.Cyber-Attack Frequency - Any decrease in cyber-attacks, especially those targeting privileged accounts, could result in a lower demand for CyberArk's solutions.The Competition - If competitors large or small were to catch up in terms of functionality to CyberArk's solution suite, the business could be negatively impacted.Appendix:Management Team"
3768266,74695,2015-12-21T09:56:51-05:00,"CyberArk is cementing its lead in the promising privileged account security market.While privileged account security is only a subset of the general cybersecurity industry, its market potential is enormous.CyberArk's growth momentum and technological lead in the privileged account security arena should allow the company to maintain its dominance for the foreseeable future.Competition in the privileged account security market will likely intensify in the coming years.","The cybersecurity industry has been growing at an incredibly fast pace over the past few years. As cyberattacks have grown in frequency and sophistication, a new generation of cybersecurity firms like Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) have risen in prominence. Within the general cybersecurity industry, there are a growing number of highly profitable niche opportunities. As the cybersecurity industry grows in size and complexity, subsets of the cybersecurity industry will continue to grow.CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) has jumped on the opportunity to capitalize on such niche opportunities by heavily involving itself in the privileged account security arena. This domain, which focuses on the cybersecurity of higher-level/more privileged accounts, is becoming an integral aspect of cybersecurity. As a large portion of sensitive information lies within the more powerful IT/enterprise accounts, there is a growing concern for privileged account security. Given the general growth of cybersecurity and the particular importance of privileged account security, CyberArk is extremely well-positioned.Growing MarketThe current total addressable market of the privileged account security sector is estimated to be approximately $10 billion. Given the general upward trend of cyberattacks, this figure should continue to expand at a rapid rate. As CyberArk is a leader in this highly profitable segment of the cybersecurity industry, the company is extremely well-positioned to grow. Given that privileged accounts contain disproportionate amounts of sensitive and valuable information, cybersecurity demand in this arena is likely to outpace that of the general cybersecurity industry.The threat posed to privileged accounts commonly come from both inside and outside organizations, making cybersecurity services in this arena crucial. Not only are privileged accounts susceptible to cyberattacks from foreign entities, but it is also highly vulnerable to sabotage from insiders (e.g. disgruntled employees). Some of the most devastating corporate cyberattacks have come from employees, which was showcased by Reuters incident with its former deputy social media editor. In fact, many security experts consider insider threats more dangerous than external threats.Capitalizing on the Growth OpportunityCyberArk has taken full advantage of the growing privileged account security industry. As one of the early movers in this segment, CyberArk is in a far better position than its competition. The company has helped pioneer many next-generation cyber security solutions (e.g. integrated SSH key management, remote vendor access security, privileged threat analytics, etc.), which has allowed it to grow at a tremendous rate. In fact, CyberArk's growth has exploded over the past few years, with the company only gaining momentum both on the revenue and profit front.Despite CyberArk's increasing size, the company's growth rate has actually accelerated over the years. Since 2012, the company has added more than 10% per annum to its growth rate on average. Currently, CyberArk is growing its revenues at around 50% per annum and has amassed more than 2000 global customers. On top of this, the company has business with 40% of Fortune 100 companies and 20% of Global 2000 companies, highlighting its massive reach within the privileged account security arena.CyberArk recently reported record growth numbers, with a Q3 revenue of $40.1 million and a non-GAAP net income of $9.2 million. With CyberArk gaining momentum both in the corporate and government sectors, the company has far more room for upside. Given that CyberArk is currently the most dominant player in the privileged account management segment on the size and technology front, the company should be able to take full advantage of the industry's growing popularity. In addition, the company is one of the few pure plays in this industry, giving it all the advantages that comes with specialization.CyberArk is currently leading the privileged account security industry in terms of technological capabilities and strategies.Source: IDCObstaclesThe privileged account security industry is a relatively young and extremely promising industry, which means that it will likely become far more crowded moving forward. While CyberArk has done a good job of differentiating itself thus far, it will likely have an increasingly hard time keeping the competition at bay. At the company's current P/E ratio of 70, investors have already priced a high level of growth. This makes CyberArk all the more risky given the increasing competition in this industry.With emerging powerhouses like Palo Alto Networks increasing their grip on the cybersecurity industry, CyberArk investors should definitely be wary. However, CyberArk's prospects still look bright given its early mover advantage and momentum (both in terms of growth and technology) in the privileged account security arena. While the cybersecurity space is constantly evolving, CyberArk has a good chance of extending its dominance moving forward.ConclusionCyberArk still has more upside at a market capitalization of $1.4 billion. With the company experiencing approximately 50% annual growth rates and annual revenues in the $150 million range (2015 guidance), the company seems to be undervalued. Given the massive increase in insider cyberattacks over the past decade, demand for CyberArk's products/solutions should grow moving forward."
3982861,22148,2016-06-18T17:10:54-04:00,CyberArk has bounced significantly off the February lows following a big Q1 beat.The privileged account security leader faces decelerating growth rates.The stock doesn't appear to provide reward commensurate with the risk of not meeting growth expectations.,"For a cybersecurity technology leader, the stock of CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) is naturally very volatile. The stock hit a low below $35 in February and now trades at nearly $50. Ironically, CyberArk traded at similar levels in 2015 as well. My research last year questioned whether the stock wasn't headed for a period of weakness.The stock provides a prime example of paying appropriate prices for growth rates. The privileged account security leader now faces slower growth rates and stalling profits as revenues approach the $200 million level.The stock has rallied strong following the release of Q1 results at the beginning of May. At nearly $50, though, the stock should start hitting a wall with a market valuation of $1.8 billion based on 36 million diluted shares.The growth rate is set to decelerate at a rapid pace following a couple of years of expansion possibly driven by some benefits of going public in 2014. As an example, the Q1 revenue growth rate was only 43% while the important license revenue only expanded 38%. These growth rates are far below the 56% growth produced in 2014 and 2015 and the peak at 89% to start 2015.The year started off growing slower than the last two years. In addition, the Q2 guidance was for revenue growth of only up to 33%. CyberArk does have a history of beating results by a large amount, but as revenues start approaching $50 million on a quarterly basis, the margin of exceeding guidance will start declining.The last three quarters have seen the company beat estimates of 30%+ revenue growth guidance to end up with around 42% growth rates. The following earnings numbers are per Seeking Alpha:An investor really needs to bet that the company actually under promises to a large extent for Q2. CyberArk must reach $51.7 million in Q2 revenues in order to reach a 42% growth rate again.A $3.4 million beat from the current analyst estimate of $48.3 million is clearly possible. What happens to the stock if the company doesn't deliver the standard surprise?What we do know is that the stock trades at 8x FY16 revenue estimates and any slowdown in growth will damage that multiple. Any upside can push the multiple up to potentially 10x revenues. As cybersecurity sector stocks like FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), Imperva (NASDAQ:IMPV) and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) highlight, the multiple risk is more to the downside with limited upside.CYBR PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that the time to buy CyberArk was on the dip to $31.50 in February. The current price offers limited value proposition as the company ultimately heads towards revenue growth below 30% while the market expects constant quarterly beats. Do you want to own the stock if the company doesn't beat by a large margin in Q2?"
3751936,76005,2015-12-13T01:02:42-05:00,"A comparison to peers suggests that CyberArk is trading at high valuations around $40 per share.But CyberArk has a solid business, with strong profitability and a good product.Buying the stock now is very risky, while holding the stock is perfectly fine.","CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR) is a cybersecurity company that has found a solid strategy in the IT security industry. The company offers security services that protect ""privileged accounts"" within a cloud IT infrastructure. Privileged accounts are as they sound; accounts with privilege. For example, a privileged account has administrative rights to install new software (or malware), has access and permission to move data, and other privileges. CyberArk protects clients not only by protecting their privileged accounts before hackers gain access but also by using intelligent analytics that protect clients after a hacker has gained access into the account.CyberArk's strategy positions the company to offer top service among the many types of IT security products. In fact, the financial results of CyberArk are a proof of the potential in its strategy. CyberArk has grown at a tremendous pace, increasing revenues from $47 million in FY2012 to $145.7 million in the last 12 months. Unlike other competitors such as FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), CyberArk is a profitable company with strong margins. CyberArk's operating margin is roughly 20% and its profit margin is roughly 10%. That is excellent compared to both FireEye and Palo Alto Networks, which are unprofitable.Most of the technology community agree that CyberArk will continue growingThe cybersecurity industry is experiencing super-fast growth. As cyberattacks threaten companies, IT spending will likely continue rising. CyberArk is a mid-cap company. Its market cap is roughly $1.2 billion in the cybersecurity industry that is estimated to be worth over $50 billion. The US government budgeted $13 billion on cybersecurity spending this year. Of course, the US has a lot of valuable data!A profitable company with a great product coupled with a fast industry growth seem to be a good combination for the success of CyberArk's stock. In fact, that is a great combination. But when considering a stock, it is always important to consider the valuation. Ben Graham said that a real risk the common stock investor faces is the ""risk of paying too high a price for good-quality stocks"". It appears that CyberArk is a good-quality stock. But is the price of the common stock too high?CyberArk is not the only player in the IT security industry, which means it faces competition. On one side, some of the large technology players - such as IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) - are entering the IT security industry. On the other hand, many smaller companies are also entering the market. Since CyberArk is a pure cybersecurity company, it should be compared with similar pure cybersecurity companies.Despite CyberArk's great potential, I believe the valuation is stretched compared to close peers. Investors would take considerable risk to enter the stock at current prices.Compared to close peers, CyberArk appears to be expensive. The peers I am comparing to are: Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC), AVG technologies (NYSE:AVG), and Qualys Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS).Take a look at the table below where key price multiples and margins are compared.Source: BloombergWhile the profitability is similar for all four companies, the market is seeing something special about both Qualys and CyberArk. I say this because those are the two companies that trade at the highest price multiples. Both in terms of EV/EBITDA and P/S, Qualys and CyberArk appear to be far stretched. A company trading at 9x sales and over 30x EV/EBITDA is priced for very high expectations of both top and bottom line growth. This is where CyberArk is risky. Compare CyberArk to both Symantec and AVG multiples. Since both Symantec and AVG are not expected to grow as fast, the market is giving them less credit. Therefore, Symantec and AVG trade at much cheaper valuations.See the revenue growth tables below. E indicates estimates.Source: Bloomberg, Estimates reflect analyst consensusSymantec is the only player whose revenues are expected to decline. Otherwise growth is expected to be solid for CyberArk and Qualsys, and somewhat slower for AVG. Growth is expected to slow down for all companies in 2016. This is the key risk that CyberArk faces. If revenues do not grow as expected, the market can (and likely will) punish the stock by lowering its price multiples. The current revenue growth is already built into the price of the stock. Therefore, the stock will likely move higher only if the expectations are exceeded.Key TakeawaysIn my opinion, the current price of CyberArk of $40 per share continues to be a high price to enter the stock. CYBR trades at 9x sales and 30x EV/EBITDA, which are much higher than its slower growing peers. This kind of valuation can only be sustained with abnormal growth. While the sell-side community expects abnormal growth, what if it doesn't happen? The thing is that if CyberArk does not surprise on growth, then the stock would get punished really hard. Alternatively, if there is some bad press to the company, the stock would get punished simply because it is trading at high valuations.However, CyberArk is a great company with a real good product in an industry that is poised for growth. Those characteristics make CYBR a good stock. It would be risky to buy the stock at these levels, but CYBR is perfectly fine to hold for current shareholders. For shareholders who bought at the >$50 level, I believe you might have to see a long time of sideways trade before this stock pays off.The stock market is about risk and reward scenarios, and at this price, CyberArk's stock appears to have already rewarded the early buyers. CyberArk had an IPO price of $16 in September 2014. At the current price, new investors are taking higher risk than early investors for buying this stock."
3699116,89326,2015-11-19T12:22:00-05:00,"CyberArk Software posted outstanding 3QFY15 earnings on November 4 evening, beating both top-line and bottom-line estimates.The company's prospects remain strong on the back of ever-growing needs of cyber security infrastructure.Based on its fundamentals, the stock has at least 16% upside with further appreciation to be seen over the long term.","BackgroundCyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR) is a growth company with ever-increasing revenue of 41% in the last three years. Its customer numbers are now over 2,000, comprising 40% of Fortune 100 and 18% of Global 2000. The company sees significant potential in the industry sparked by the trend of purchase of cyber security products as strategically driven rather than compliance driven. The company's major forte is protection of privileged accounts. The beauty of this industry lies in its diversified verticals as almost all sectors require security of its privileged accounts.Financial services is the major sector (41%) while the rest of the verticals occupy 5-9% share. The company's major products include Privileged Threat Analytics, Enterprise Password Vault, Secure Shell (SSH) Key Manager and Privileged Session Manager. The company strives to sell cyber security as a complete package and not as simply one product. It proposes to safeguard all systems. The company's acquisition of Viewfinity serves this purpose as it would add technology that would enable it to exercise proactive controls. Consequently, there has been a pickup in purchase of multi-product sales, which grew to 25% vs. 17% compared to last year. Geographically, the company's majority sales are in America (65%), followed by EMEA (27%) and Asia Pacific (8%).3QFY15 ReviewIn recent 3Q results, the company recorded significant revenue growth of 43% to $24.8 million. Its margin remained healthy at 86%. License growth is the main driver for its growth (62%) with maintenance revenue being its support (38%). The growth has been supported by investment in R&D and headcount. The employee figure has risen to 581 vs. 415 in Sept. 2014 resulting in a rise of operating expenses by 57% year-on-year. Hence operating margin presents a more true picture of the business, which remains stable at 28%. Net income per share grew 73% to $0.19 on a year-on-year basis. On a cumulative basis, 9MCY15 EPS surged to $0.50 vs. loss per share of $0.07 in the same period last year.The company secured significant contracts during the quarter. It secured multi-product sales from two different steel producers. Also, it secured a sizeable deal with a Canadian subsidiary of a major U.S. retailer. Furthermore, the company sold its five products to a software division of a large industrial conglomerate.Future OutlookCyberArk Software is anticipated to maintain this positive momentum going forward. The company foresees similar growth in the last quarter and the full-year result is likely to witness 48-49% growth in revenue with operating margins maintained at 24-25%.I project non-GAAP operating income of $9.7 million on revenues of $44 million in 4QFY2015. This would translate into a topline expansion of 21% YoY in the coming quarter. Moreover, I estimate non-GAAP EPS to come in at 20 cents in the December quarter. These forecasts represent the upper end of management guidance.For full FY 2015, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $152.3 million to $153.3 million, which represents an outstanding 48-49% topline expansion for the year. Moreover, non-GAAP operating income is projected to gross between $37.3 million and $38.1 million. This would translate to a margin improvement of 331 basis points (bps) YoY. Non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be around 80-82 cents, representing an expansion of 28-30 cents YoY, considering 35.5 million weighted average diluted shares.ValuationThe company has so far achieved revenue growth of 64% year-on-year in 9MCY2015 after growing 56% the previous year. The gross margins have remained stable at 85%-86% in the last five years. The EBITDA margin has varied over the last five years averaging at 17.4% but has stabilized in the last two years at just over 20%.Source: Company 10-KsI have assumed a discount rate of 8.1%, derived from the CAPM model. To note, the beta of IT stocks are usually on the higher side, hence above market beta is taken into calculation. The enterprise value amounts to $1623.2 million translating into an equity value of $45.4/sh.On a relative-valuation basis, CYBR is trading at above the P/E multiple of the industry. Its current P/E stands at 77.4 vs. the sector's P/E of 55.4, a premium of 40%. The growth nature of the stock warrants this premium. On the other hand, it's trading at a cheaper P/B multiple to the industry. Its current P/B stands at 6.35 vs. the sector's P/B of 8.15, a discount of 22%.ConclusionThe company is on a fast track to growth, with post-IPO return of 34% in one year and revenue growth of 64%. The company sees a lot of potential with the growing need of developing a proper cyber security infrastructure from a strategic point of view and not just mere compliance. The company's acquisitions of Viewfinity and Cybertinel are likely to help the company facilitate this strategic shift, thereby resulting in further upside. I believe this stock has potential and needs to be included in your portfolio. I recommend buy with a one-year price of $45.40."

I maintain my Hold rating.","IntroductionCyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) reported third-quarter results last week beating both top- and bottom-line estimates. Despite this, the counter continues to be weighed down by valuation concerns, which I talked about in my initiation report and my report during their last earnings. I think current valuations are not entirely compelling at this point. I reiterate my Hold rating.Steady Ark in Stormy weatherCYBR's third-quarter results saw them beat on the top- and bottom-line by $2.95 million and $0.13, respectively. They also upgraded revenue and earnings forecast for the fourth quarter of this year. For the fourth quarter, they have upgraded guidance for revenue from $41.9 million to $43-44 million and earnings per share of $0.18-0.20 from the consensus's $0.17.The strong results reported were a marked contrast to those reported by those in the cyber security sector making them a standout compared to the rest of the players who have already reported earnings. I think the positive for CYBR is their ability to control costs - particularly, selling and marketing - that the rest of their cybersecurity peers have struggled to manage. On a year-on-year basis, EPS is up 79.8%.Despite the strong results however, investors were cautious that CYBR might be experiencing an industry-wide slowdown in growth. Consider this - for the third quarter of 2015, CYBR grew 43% on a yoy basis, compared to the 65.5% in the same period last year. And 48.3% growth in the third quarter of 2013 raises fears that CYBR might have to contend with slower growth moving forward.Keen followers of CYBR will remember that I had argued previously that the steep valuations for CYBR means that they will need to match investors' expectations for growth, and if they were to fail, the capital markets would punish them. And they have for their underperformance. The recent share price correction will help assign a more realistic valuation on CYBR and that is a positive for the counter.Viewfinity Contribution to CYBRCYBR announced in October that they have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Viewfinity, a private company, which provides Windows least privilege management and application control software for $30.5 million in cash. I am attaching the statement made by the copy below:The acquisition of Viewfinity marks CYBR's first acquisition as a public company and will extend their capabilities in privileged accounts security solutions which put simply, protects organizations from cyber breaches that have made their way inside the network perimeter.Investors should not expect too much from this acquisition in the near term, given that management has guided for revenue of $7-9 million for 2016. The deal is also expected to be earnings accretive to non-GAAP earnings. This is likely to be slightly lower however, since a part of Viewfinity's revenue came from their partnership with CYBR.ValuationsI have used the EV/Sales (trailing) measure to value CYBR. Based on their last closing price on the 10th of November 2015, CYBR is trading at 9.2x EV/Sales (trailing), which is higher than the sector's 8.3x. I think the sector will see an overall de-rating in the next few months and the over 10% premium CYBR is currently trading at relative to their peers should come under pressure as analysts downgrade their overall ratings for the sector.Source: BloombergIn light of the above, I maintain my Hold valuations rating, due to steep valuations.ConclusionSince my initiation report on CYBR where I initiated with a Hold due to steep valuations, the counter is down over 35%. I think their acquisition of Viewfinity is a positive since it allows them to offer a more comprehensive service to their customers and has strong synergistic revenue proposition for them. Despite their strong financial performance however, I think current valuations are not particularly attractive at this point."

The company also upgraded its guidance. This was no surprise, as I had already highlighted in the initiation report, the conservative guidance from management was a relatively low-hanging fruit and should see CYBR meet the guidance easily, and it did. Nonetheless, I reiterate my ""Hold"" call on CYBR.Since my initiation report, the company has traded downwards on valuation concerns. This is also due in part to the secondary offering of new shares, which it issued on the 11th of June this year. The results beat did not surprise me, but I think valuations are not compelling at this point.More intense competitionCA Technologies' (NASDAQ:CA) announcement on the 4th of August 2015 that it has acquired Xceedium, a provider of privileged identity management solutions for hybrid enterprises, will pose a greater threat to CYBR.Whilst the terms of the deal were undisclosed, the acquisition is expected to add synergistic value to CA's security portfolio. It will also allow it to provide customers with a more comprehensive solution for controlling and protecting IT administrator or other privileged user accounts from insider mistakes and malicious misuse.My channel checks reveal that whilst CYBR has traditionally competed successfully against Xceedium, the acquisition by CA will give Xceedium access to the technology and compete more effectively against CYBR.ValuationsI used the P/S (trailing twelve months) valuation metrics to value CYBR given that most of its competitors are not yet profitable.Source: BloombergAt 8.9x P/S (TTM), based on its last closing price on the 11th of August 2015, CYBR does not come cheap. The company is trading at a premium of 30.8% relative to that of the industry. The forward EV/Sales for FY16 also indicates that CyberArk is overpriced.ConclusionDespite the strong earnings beat, the valuations are too expensive at this point and on a forward basis. I reiterate my ""Hold"" call."
3659076,22148,2015-11-06T18:50:22-05:00,"CyberArk continues to outshine sector peers with strong earnings and free cash flow generation.The company continues to see a deceleration in growth, though still at a solid rate.The stock will likely trade sideways while investors grasp the lower growth rates, offset by strong cash flow generation.","On Thursday evening, CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) reported quarterly results that were generally solid. Since the numbers followed a day where a fellow cyber security stock plunged 23%, the biggest fear is that the party is over for the sector.CyberArk has some big advantages over FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE). The company is very profitable and doesn't rely on heavy sales and marketing spending to grow revenues. As well, CyberArk is free cash flow positive and that is the holy grail for software stocks.The biggest warning flag for the stock is the Q4 forecast for revenue growth of only 18% to 21% over last year. After a quarter of strong 43% revenue growth, the fear is that the emergency spending called out by FireEye flows over to CyberArk. After all, the CyberArk CEO was one of the original executives in the sector to point out concerns that 1H15 spending growth rates wouldn't last.CyberArk continually under promises on quarterly results so the question naturally is whether the guidance is legitimate or another head fake. The company originally guided to Q3 revenues of $36 million to $37 million, or roughly 30% growth. The end result was $40 million for 43% growth. The Q2 guidance was revenue of $31.5 million to $32.5 million, or roughly 50% growth. The end result was revenue of $36.4 million for 70% growth.The clear result from the last couple of quarters is that CyberArk beats estimates by several million. Even adding $4 million to the Q4 guidance only brings revenue up to $48 million on the high end. Even this high-end target would only lead to 32% revenue growth.In the course of two quarters, CyberArk would see revenue growth decelerate from 70% to 30%. Stocks typically don't trade well in those environments, hence CyberArk is trading down about 2% in mid-day trading following good numbers.Some analysts, including Joel Fishbein of BTIG, suggested the sustainability of demand issue is only related to FireEye and threat prevention with a hint that something like privileged account security from CyberArk wouldn't see a similar slowdown. In reality, FireEye still guided to faster Q4 revenue growth whether accurate or not.Ironically, the CEO didn't make similar claims that spending in the sector is due to a slowdown from the heavy spending corresponding with all of the security breaches from earlier in the year.Regardless, CyberArk is already a free cash flow machine. The company has now earned $40.3 million in operating cash flow and only spent $1.8 million in capital spending this year. The free cash flow of $38.5 million is impressive for this stage in the growth process. As Piper Jaffray forecasted previously and highlighted in my previous research, the company appears on a pace to exceed $125 million in FCF next year. The real question is how much one wants to pay for that ability to generate cash.The key takeaway is that CyberArk is a different beast than FireEye. The ability to turn solid revenue growth into strong FCF generation warrants higher valuation multiples. The struggle, though, is that the stock is worth $1.8 billion when quarterly revenue only hit $40 million. If the company can reach the FCF targets for 2016, CyberArk probably will see higher prices from the current $50 level.The party isn't over for CyberArk, but the stock will struggle as investors grasp with the slower growth."
3541136,22148,2015-09-30T16:28:01-04:00,CyberArk continues struggling to gain traction despite the cybersecurity focus of the Chinese President's visit to the U.S.Several analysts have upgraded the stock after the recent dip below $50.The privileged account specialist provides a compelling free cash flow story though short-term issues will impact the stock for now.,"With the U.S. visit of the Chinese President, cybersecurity is back in prime focus. However, stocks of the related cybersecurity companies aren't trading as well. One stock getting a lot of analyst praise lately is CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR).CYBR is down over 35% from its all-time highs back in June. Should investors use this dip below $50 to now buy the stock after warning last month that the company was having a difficult time living up to extreme valuations?Potential Market SizeThe clear message from President Xi's visit to the U.S. is that despite an acknowledgement of the issue by both sides, it is highly unlikely that China prevents cyber attacks on U.S. companies in the future. Whether the attacks are state sponsored or rogue individuals, U.S. corporations will need to continue spending aggressively to stop hacks.CyberArk remains right in the middle of the growth area with enterprise-wide approaches to address the privileged accounts issue. Cyber attacks are now trying to take advantage of the flaws in the system that allows criminals to gain legitimate access and utilize that access for damage.According to Frederick Grieb at Nomura Securities, the total addressable market is approaching $9 billion in license revenue. Add in another $1.8 billion for maintenance fees and CyberArk is looking at a total market of nearly $11 billion. He suggests the company only accounts for 2.8% of the market that is a sub-segment of the identity and access management sector, but the analysis appears to suggest a considerable shift in how the money is spent by enterprises in the current segment.According to an IDC report, CyberArk is the dominant player in the privileged access management sector again suggesting the $11 billion market potential is far into the future.Cash Flow ExtremesPiper Jaffray made a compelling thesis that CyberArk trades at an enterprise value of only 10.7x 2016 free cash flow, or FCF, estimates. Analysts Andrew Nowinski and Andrew Boyce estimate that the company will crush current FCF estimates for 2016 of $46 million. The analysts suggest the company will generate up to $129 million in FCF due to already producing $35 million in the 1H15.The FCF target is achievable due to CyberArk not only being profitable, but also receiving cash for licenses upfront. For Q2, the cybersecurity specialist produced income of $6.2 million while watching deferred revenues jump to $39.6 million, up roughly $21 million over the December 30 level. Incredibly, the company spent only $1 million on property and equipment.The biggest remaining concern is that the CEO has made several suggestions that demand was pulled forward this year due to the high-profiled cybersecurity hacks. Analysts forecast earnings declines YoY for the next couple of quarters. The stock likely struggles to bounce when CyberArk reports those numbers.TakeawayWhile the market potential appears large, CyberArk still must build the sector demand which could require more spending. At the same time, the company continues to suggest demand pulled forward that will hurt growth in the short term. The stock is becoming compelling based on the FCF scenario, but the recommendation is stay on the sidelines until the company returns to a profit growth situation."
3678876,76115,2015-11-12T07:34:41-05:00,"Cybersecurity is not nearly as complicated as one may think. In fact, many of the most high-profile attacks are done through simple procedures and gaining ""front door"" access.CyberArk's main focus deals with 91% of all cyber attacks. This places the company in a great strategic position and not in a niche market.In contrast, FireEye deals with a lot of forensics and malware analysis. Malware prevention is a different type of strategy to combating an attack.If an investor is looking for growth, it will come from the company in the most vulnerable aspect of cybersecurity, which is spear phishing and therefore privileged account protection.This growth is clearly visible between both companies and how they are performing; one raking in profits on little expenditure, while the other bleeding cash and spending more for growth.","Cybersecurity is a fairly misunderstood sector within the technology industry. This misunderstanding is due to not only the shift in our world away from familiar malicious attacks - such as direct physical harm - but also because it seems highly complicated, ""rocket science"" to most. Many people don't understand how internet traffic works, let alone how one breaks in someone's ""front"" or ""back door"" to see what they have stored or what they are up to.Thankfully, there are companies in the industry that have that knowledge and make a business out of protecting the companies that hold our personal and government information - or do they? Turning a profit is the key for both of them and for you as an investor, but does it actually happen? It seems this past quarter and recent earnings have shown a light on who is actually making money off of protecting your personal and financial information (among many other things) and who is not. Furthermore, I intend to explain that CyberArk's focus is not the niche market that many believe it to be. By the time I'm done, I hope investors gain an understanding that it's actually other forms of security that are the small markets and getting smaller.Two Companies - Two StrategiesFireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) is a cybersecurity firm that uses real-time customer information (beyond typical attack signatures) to detect if an attack is occurring in a company mostly by way of malware detection. If it detects an attack, it responds accordingly and blocks traffic or eradicates the problem files. FireEye uses its crowd-sourced data to determine these attacks and relegates a response and forensics of what happened.CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) is also a cybersecurity firm and, much like FireEye, looks to stop an attack before it does damage by losing or stealing data. CyberArk focuses on things a little differently and seeks to stop privileged accounts from being compromised or, if they are, to render the account incapable of performing elevated operations.To the non-technical person or investor, it would seem both of these companies use same business models and technical approaches to fight cyber-attacks and create a cybersecurity model. However, once you dig into what is occurring in the field and where the most vulnerable threat is, one realizes that these two are going after different corners of the market.Understanding Cyber AttacksMany of the more recent cybersecurity attacks and hacks were much simpler than you might think. In fact, it was sometimes so simple that all it took was asking a simple question and unlocking the kingdom with its own keys. You might be calling my bluff on this, but it's actually a simple procedure that requires little knowledge of programmatic brute force hacking.Most people have heard of phishing. This is when would be ""hackers"" send out mass emails to people, posing as the legitimate company, with the intent of trying to trick them into whatever it is they want to steal. You may have seen emails in your inbox at one point saying your credit card had a problem with its last transaction and you simply need to login with your username and password to rectify it. Some uneducated users willingly oblige and click on the link within email. That link sends them to a rogue website that gathers the information they submit and then uses it to login to the actual online bank account, stealing things such as your identity or personal bank information. Typically, to make the email convincing, there is a line that informs the user that their bank account will be disabled if they don't do this.This is how many ""hacking"" attempts are executed. In fact, this isn't really hacking. This is you willingly handing over your login information to what you may think is a secure website when in fact you've handed someone your account information on a slip of paper and delivered it to them. It turns out you were tricked by a conniving criminal. The real bottom line is you should never ever hand out online login information to anyone, even family or friends (this is my ""IT guy"" plug). The reason why these phishing attempts work is because the underlying point is making the website seem like the actual legitimate website it is impersonating. You think you aren't sharing it with anyone but your bank, however, your bank will never ask you to enter your login information through a link or through an email. It's that simple.The Real DamageNow, this kind of attack is not just confined to the private individual sitting at their home computer. Ideally, the best attack is one that aims for a vast amount of information through someone who has access to thousands or millions of accounts. The above example I gave has to do with stealing just one person's identity and information by contacting thousands at a time. Aiming at a business or company who holds a large amount of records is the real gold mine. The difference is it only takes one person's credentials to unlock the mass amount of protected information. Attacking a couple of users or employees specifically is called spear phishing and is done through social engineering or other relatable-to-you presentations. Many times these spear phishing attempts pose as another employee or a supervisor and sometimes more simply as family or friends. This attempt for the user to open the email allows an attachment to get loaded on the computer. This attachment may have a program that then learns the user's password and the attacker now simply uses the ""insider account"" to do the damage. Let me give you some real world examples to show you how pervasive and widely used this is.Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) earlier this year admitted to having a breach of their data, some 80 million records of protected health information (PHI). The company claimed that it was a ""sophisticated attack"" on their system and was the reason their records were infiltrated. Turns out the forensics team found out it wasn't all that sophisticated. KnowBe4 claims the attack was a spear phishing attack:Sophisticated? Hardly ... it was an untrained employee who touched a phishing email.Sony (NYSE:SNE) was another victim of spear phishing as over 47 million records and social security numbers were breached in late 2014. Several different possibilities were cited for who exactly was responsible but it seems apparent that any one of those responsible used a spear phishing campaign to get inside the network.Everyone remembers the Home Depot (NYSE:HD) incident in mid-2014 where ""hackers"" gained information to over 56 million customers' credit cards and email information. The apparent cause was the access of a third-party vendor's account information. Yeah you guessed it, probably through a spear phishing attempt.These are just a few examples; I can go on and on and include Target (NYSE:TGT) and healthcare provider Community Health (NYSE:CYH) to this list as well. However, I'll let you research those and the ""advanced tactics"" used as homework.What's It Worth - Attacker and CompanyNow that we know how simple it can be to get to these confidential records let me quickly explain what each record is worth to those looking to steal it. Your credit card information goes for about $0.50-$1.00 per record on the ""black market."" Your health information goes for 10-20x that! That means each individual health record goes for $10-20 a piece. That Anthem breach? That is likely worth in excess of $800M!That's what criminals will pay for your record, though, and shows how lucrative it can be for them. But, what impact does this have on the company that was breached? This one is a little harder to put in solid terms but because Anthem had a cyber security insurance policy in place it makes it easier - insurance companies are going to put your damages in dollar terms quickly won't they? I, myself, almost couldn't believe that the $100M insurance policy they had in place wouldn't cover the damages from the breach. In fact, the report says that this won't even cover contacting the 80M victims in the attack. But wait it gets better, the report believes it could cost Anthem $8-16 billion to recover from the attack!Let that sink in for a minute. One spear phishing attempt was able to bring an entire company's reputation to its knees and cause its accountants to faint at the thought of paying for the damages. It's incidents like this that make executives and management stop and say, ""Do whatever you can to make sure this never happens again"" or to those who have yet to discover a breach, ""Make sure this never happens to us.""What I'm really saying is cybersecurity has a very small price compared to the consequences. A company is going to need the very best and so far CyberArk has found the attention of 40% of the Fortune 100 and 17 of the world's top 20 banks. Having clients like this speaks volumes in terms of distributing software and protection for the many billions in assets they have combined.Making A Business Protecting BusinessesIf you were going to start a company and were looking for the best market to target to bring in customers and revenue, you would probably go after the largest need. If the need of spear phishing defense was represented in saying 91% of all cyber attacks are through this method, is that enough? I would say so.That 91% figure was back in 2012. Let me recap what has happened since then. The number of attacks per day has decreased from 116 a day to 83 a day, but at the same time there has been a 62% increase in the number of actual data breaches. There are two reasons I surmise is the cause of this. The first is the attacks have become more targeted and more honed in to specific companies and are better coordinated. A lower number means the next attacker is gathering more and better information, biding their time so as not to blow their cover. The second - and this is my opinion based on my research and education on this topic - it is becoming harder and harder to detect the actual phishing emails. In other words, a portion of the decrease in attacks is due to the ability to detect them - or not detect them in this case. Combined with waiting to hit the jackpot of data, these two reasons are enough for me to dump a bigger portion of ""my"" IT budget in securing this clever attack strategy.The idea of a cybersecurity business is to install software that understands and monitors for the intrusions and attempts that I've already described. This is becoming harder and harder and is not something an internal IT team can possibly tackle on their own as it is too costly and resource intensive.CyberArk is specialized in this type of defense - a defense that knows the human in the company will ultimately be compromised. Their methodology is about transforming the security culture within the business its protecting on top of doing all the behind the scenes monitoring. Not only that but it knows that the last line of defense should be the strongest. But why do I say all of this - I mean you probably think I'm a hired spokesperson at this point (the answer is no, I'm not, I'm just on the IT side and want to find the best defense, too). I say this because CyberArk is going after the most exploited and prolific attack method that we are experiencing right now in our world. You would want to invest in a company that has its pulse on what the world needs resolution to, right? I know I sure do.Business Is One Thing, Growth And Profit Is AnotherKnowing that CYBR is in the business of protecting against the most attempted and damaging attacks, it would then be wise to understand if their business model actually brings in revenue and is growing. Let's look at some basic growth indicators to understand where CyberArk is headed and what it could be worth.The company has increased revenue in mid-to-high double digits the last four quarters. The third quarter saw revenue increase of 43% while the second quarter saw revenue increase in excess of 70%. The first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year saw 89% and 81% growth, respectively. Competitor and peer, FireEye has seen of 69%, 56%, 45%, for the first through third quarter, respectively.For the full year of 2015, the expectations are for revenue of $152.3-153.3M or 48-49% growth year over year. The company is expecting growth in revenue of the fourth quarter to be in the range of 18-21%. This is a healthy growth rate for a company in the thick of defending the technological and network-driven world we live in.Some may see the growth lessening or shrinking here as the fourth-quarter growth may be less than what has been seen in quarters past. I believe there are two reasons for this. The first reason has to do with higher comps from the prior year, as growth was in a hyper stage these last two years. Secondly, a majority of IT departments are ending their budgets in the fourth quarter while creating business cases for their 2016 initiatives. I expect growth to be seasonally less in the fourth quarter compared to the first quarter of any given year. This is in-line with what I see for budgeting and planning within IT divisions.Moving to margins, let's see how healthy or unhealthy they are. CYBR has enjoyed operating margins in the high teens and lower 20s. FEYE on the other hand doesn't enjoy positive operating margins. In fact, their operating margins are grossly lower than CyberArk's. FireEye has seen declining margins between the time before their Mandiant acquisition and about two quarters ago and earned margins of as low as -125% but has improved slightly to -85.9% in the recent quarter. Either way you look at it margins are far and away from being profitable.What I'd like to point out next specifically is how much CyberArk is spending versus how much FireEye is spending. This I believe is where the true strengths lie in CYBR and even though revenue isn't growing in the three digit range the fact that the company is not losing money and burning cash is a huge benefit in the short and long-term. The below chart shows a telling story about which line is higher for each company.CYBR is clearly spending less but improving revenues quarter over quarter, while FEYE has a large gap to cover before revenue ever meets expenses.Just How Much Is That Profitability Worth?With the understanding of which company is profitable, I'll move onto just how profitable CyberArk is and what value can be put on the stock. The company has a trailing-twelve-month GAAP EPS of $0.64, giving it a current P/E ratio of 64. It seems high at first, but let's continue to work through their expected growth.The company guided for fourth-quarter EPS of $0.18-0.20 which would be equal to last year's equivalent period, implying no bottom line growth. However, the company has a record of guiding light and analysts have estimated in-line with guidance, typically. The company then in turn beats estimates by an average of 214%! However, since this quarter will be a tough comparable to the prior period I will err on the side of a less-astounding estimate and guidance beat. If the company posts EPS in the range of $0.30-0.34 - or a 68% beat to guidance - then full-year 2015 EPS should be somewhere in the $0.75-0.79 range. This brings the trailing P/E to 53.Considering that growth is still expected to continue and that guidance and estimates have been well short of actual numbers, the company may be in a great position to surprise investors and drastically bring the valuation into a comfortable range. Earnings estimates have steadily risen over the last three months by over 16% for full year 2016. If the company can continue to beat guidance and top estimates then they will see EPS numbers in excess of $1.00 by the end of 2016. I believe they could see somewhere between $1.10 and $1.20 as long as management continues to execute and keep costs not only well below revenue but on a diverging path away from each other. To round out the exercise here, P/E could drop into the mid-30s in this timeframe.It's worth mentioning that the company has a cash pile of $239M. This is up from $124M just 9 months ago. The company also boasts nearly zero debt. This is a great asset to consider especially when acquisitions - such as the Viewfinity and Cyberintel ones - are doable in all cash. This gives the company greater leverage to bring onboard technologies it feels add to the company's effectiveness and competitive edge.All of this sounds like valuation is still somewhat on the over-valued side but keep in mind competitors in this space are far and away from becoming profitable themselves. For a company to grow as strongly as CyberArk has, acquire at the rate they have, and press further and further into profitable territory is a strong testament to the discipline and execution of management. Investing in CYBR means you are investing in a here and now profitable company within the center of the cybersecurity war.The Bearish Sentiment Of CybersecurityThere is no denying that there is a bearish trend in the cybersecurity sector right now. In the last three months three of the most popular names are negative with FEYE leading the way and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) starting to feel more pain.The bear case merely rests on valuation. In the $60 and above stock price area I would begin to agree that valuation would be a concern. However, with the beating the stock has taken and seeing the $40 area for the first time since the beginning of the year I believe it is time to see valuation being a little prettier than it once was.I believe as the market punishes these names it allows investors to feel more comfortable as multiples and valuation comes together, specifically in the case of CYBR. Since CYBR is targeting the core market and is doing so in a fiscally responsible manner it makes it my choice for investment.The Investment Tie-inSeeing how the world we connect with today is different than the last decade when it comes to cybersecurity, the need to adapt and defend against threats is more real than ever. Chances are it has already affected you just by the odds of all the aforementioned breaches.CyberArk is not only zoned into this as their primary objective but they are doing it with a strong forward march in revenue and, more importantly, with cash flowing to the bottom line. The title of this article is not to imply that it's a ""no brainer"" but rather to say knowing how to spear phish and hack isn't required to invest in a cybersecurity company. If an investor can understand what the most used tactic is, can find the company that targets that exact exploit, and is profitable and growing to boot then it deserves a strong look at owning its shares.I believe taking advantage of the downturn in sector sentiment here is the last trigger in investing in CYBR. I would consider the stock if it remains in the low $40's level, as I believe the company is well managed and is well placed to continue fighting the cybersecurity war."
3634956,95816,2015-11-02T19:23:32-05:00,Cyber security industry is growing at a rapid pace due to the nature of cyber attacks.CYBR specializes in a niche security product that has huge growth potential.The company is looking to diversify through strategic acquisitions.,"BackgroundTarget, Home Depot, Neiman Marcus, Anthem - these are just a few companies that have experienced cyber attacks in the last five years alone. Target's breach cost the company nearly $150 million. One doesn't need to look far to see that the need for cyber security is growing: In 2014, 71% of organizations reported being compromised by a cyber attack. Additionally, the cost of each attack grew 15% year-over-year - no wonder analysts have pegged the cyber security industry at a valuation of nearly $10 billion.Companies within the cyber security industry are poised for immense growth given that they're the gatekeepers of the comprehensive tools needed to build cyber security infrastructures up-to-par with hackers' increasing finesse. However, no company looks as attractive as CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR). Founded in Israel in 1999, CYBR has solidified itself as a key player within one of cyber security's hottest niches: Privileged account security.Privileged account products are at the core of CYBR's value proposition and, therefore, should not be overlooked by investors. Privileged accounts are exactly what they sound like: User accounts within an organization's network that have broad security clearances (in other words, privileged users are given keys to the metaphorical kingdom). If such accounts fall into the wrong hands, considerable damage can be done. Essentially, CYBR gives companies a suite of tools in order to protect themselves from the inside, including password management systems, secure proxy servers and threat analytics.Fundamental AnalysisCYBR has experienced double-digit growth over the last few years. In 2014, earnings grew by over 50%. Even more appealing, metrics from the trailing 12 months show earnings growth of 125%. A growth company indeed, CYBR doubled its EPS growth from 21% in 2014 to over 47% within the past year. Growth has not been unsustainable: Profit margins have been consistently healthy. CYBR recorded an operating margin of 19.26% in 2014, a cut above competitors FireEye (-112.58%) and Juniper Networks (-9.07%).CYBR Net Income (Annual) data by YChartsThe company also bests its competitors in terms of ROE: Hovering around 10%, CYBR sweeps away the competitors mentioned before (-40.20% and -8.6%, respectively), as well as Palo Alto Networks (-33.8%). From the numbers, CYBR proves to be a great pick for growth-focused investors who want to see return as well as momentum.Not only has CYBR achieved massive growth by occupying the niche internal security space, a segment of the industry that's burgeoning due to recent trends, but it's also doing a good job of filling in the gaps. Due to effective cash management (FCF has been positive and growing for years), CYBR is well-positioned to make strategic acquisitions of companies offering differing products in order to diversify its lineup. It has already made good on this front - it recently acquired Viewfinity, a manufacturer of external security software that blocks malicious code from entering a system at point-of-entry.Market ConsensusCritics like to argue two points when it comes to the cyber security industry: First, it's in a bubble, and second, it's a ""red ocean"" industry and thus, expensive for companies to compete and gain market share.Overvalued? This argument can be made for just about any industry in the market today, but I think its applicability to the cyber security one is a tough sell. Values within the cyber security industry are justified because the costs of cyber attacks are so great. In recognition of this, 62% of companies plan to raise their IT security budgets within the next year - the average IT security budget is $4.6 million and growing. We can see here that there is a tangible need for the services of the cyber security industry. Most importantly, it's a need that can be easily monetized. (For comparability purposes, consider the fact that Twitter has struggled to even make a profit yet it has a market cap 12x that of CYBR's.)Yes, CYBR has a lofty P/E (about 100), but deservedly so. The company is projected to achieve EPS growth of 30% over the next year, a number that is supported by historic earnings growth and profitability. Another boon for the stock is August's market correction: The stock is currently trading about $25 off of its high, so it's now fairly valued. It's important to note that this dip gives CYBR plenty of room to grow: It has a high target of about $80 (a target even higher than it's all-time high of $76) and a low target of $47, which is about where it is now. With such high growth rates and consistent stability, skewness toward the upside is significantly more likely than unlikely.Crowded-out? Indeed, cyber security is rapidly evolving, and some have questioned whether CYBR can keep up with larger competitors such as FireEye and Palo Alto Networks. One needs only to look at CYBR's R&D budget - it grew by 25% over the last year and is still growing. This is encouraging: It means CYBR can continue to innovate and maintain its moat within the market. Additionally, it has a healthy FCF balance that isn't overrun by expenses (the same can't be said of FireEye), allowing it to make strategic acquisitions in the future. Its recent acquisition of Viewfinity in a $30.5 million cash deal is notable for giving the company a more solid grasp on security products beyond privileged accounts.CatalystsIn addition to the possibility of future acquisitions as I mentioned above, there are two main catalysts that will propel CYBR forward:Increased cyber attacks. As long as cyber attacks continue to happen, cyber security companies will be open for business. This is not a trend that is going to slow down any time soon: Cyber attacks have occurred at a compound annual growth rate of 66%. The frequency of breaches has become so alarming that Congress recently moved to pass the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, or CISA, which will make it easier for companies to defend against attacks.Further cloud integration. A hallmark of many cyber security companies is their cloud-based security tools, and CYBR is no exception. Its privileged account solution is designed to work on all interfaces, including both on-premise and cloud-based infrastructures. The whole idea is to make sure that all of an organization's accounts, which come together via devices linked to the enterprise's cloud platform, are secure from all types of threats. This concept is referred to as BYOD, or ""bring your own device,"" in which users connect to a network on various devices. BYOD initiatives are expected to double within the next year, which means plenty of companies will need the proper cyber security infrastructure.ConclusionThe data don't lie: Cyber security is a new battleground and companies must gear up in order to make it out unscathed. Investors would be wise to bet on CYBR - it's a growth stock within a growth industry that stands out from its competitors for its healthy numbers."
3437856,24663,2015-08-13T15:17:13-04:00,"CYBR fell after reporting earnings, as growth concerns continue to weigh on the company.CYBR is guiding to grow more than 40% this year, very impressive once you consider its spending, or lack thereof.Compared to FEYE and PANW, CYBR's growth may be the most impressive of the three, mainly because it is not emptying the bank to do so.","CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR) is currently trading lower by 6% after reporting second quarter earnings that beat expectations. Analysts have begun to note concerns with the company's growth rate, something I consider to be absurd due to CyberArk's niche service and the opportunity in cybersecurity that exists. Beyond that, I tend to believe that CyberArk is the most impressive company in the space, because it is profitable.First and foremost, CyberArk is a security company. Its software is unique because it is used once a threat breaches an initial layer of security. These are threats that are already within an organization. CyberArk's software finds the threat, locks down a network or computer, and prevents it from spreading or leaving with important company-related data and information.This is a market that other cybersecurity firms have not penetrated, as most aim to stop a threat before it strikes, or identify before it becomes a problem. CyberArk has acquired and invested in technology to better bolster its software, like recently acquiring Cybertinel, which protects a company's privileged accounts that can access sensitive information. This is often the first area that cyber criminals try to penetrate in order to gain as much sensitive information as possible while being undetected. However, CyberArk can identify those threats quickly, and with acquisitions that provide added layers of security, ensure those threats don't spread, and are removed.With that said, enterprise customers are flocking to CyberArk's software. During its first and second quarter the company's licensing revenue rose 120% and 100% year-over-year, respectively. The company's licensing revenue accounts for over 60% of its total revenue. However, as the company grows larger and ages, that licensing revenue will become maintenance/subscription revenue, which rose 38% during its second quarter. Combined, CyberArk's revenue rose 70% in the second quarter to $36.37 million, making its trailing 12-month revenue over $133 million.Albeit, CyberArk is clearly growing fast, but is still considered a relatively small company, especially compared to market favorites FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), which have 12-month revenue of $530 million and $820 million, respectively. Therefore, CyberArk remains speculative, not yet established in the world of cybersecurity, and some even question how large it will ultimately become. After all, the company's guidance suggests it will grow just 42% this year, although CyberArk consistently and always guides light. Still, 42%, even 50% growth is well below the growth rate of both FireEye and Palo Alto when both companies were of similar size. However, there is one very big reason to give CyberArk the benefit of the doubt, and that can be seen below.As seen above, CyberArk has kept its costs in check whereas Palo Alto and FireEye have both spent rapid in order to grow. CyberArk's revenue growth has well exceeded its total expense growth on a trailing 12-month basis, which means that CyberArk is spending less to create new revenue. Palo Alto's spending growth well exceeds its revenue growth, and while FireEye has seen some improvement, investors must remember that FireEye has an operating margin of negative 94%!Now that you see how the three companies are spending to find new growth, I think the above chart will be especially telling. CyberArk is the only company of the three with an actual operating profit, and with far less revenue. What this shows is that CyberArk may not be growing as fast, but it is spending far less to create its revenue, and is still producing quite a bit of growth. Specifically, Palo Alto spent $1.15 for every $1 earned in revenue; FireEye spent $1.95 for every $1 in revenue; and CyberArk spent just $0.76 for every $1 earned, as of its most recent quarter.Therefore, CyberArk is the only company that's proven it can grow at an aggressive rate without emptying the bank. That's very impressive! Furthermore, I tend to believe that if CyberArk were to double its spending, it would likely be growing far faster than the 70% it saw in the second quarter. In essence, it is CyberArk's spending, or lack thereof, that really sticks out to me, what I think separates it from larger competitors.Over the last year, the vast majority of FireEye and Palo Alto investors have seemingly ignored spending, but sooner or later, spending must subdue and both companies must prove that sustainable profits are possible in each business model. So in some ways, I think Palo Alto and FireEye are riskier investments than CyberArk, as CyberArk has already proven that it can grow fast with an emphasis on margins and profits. Unfortunately, we can't say the same for Palo Alto and FireEye, who trade at 17 and 13 times sales respectively. Personally, I'd much rather pay a high premium, 13x sales, for a company with proven profits, fast-growth, and a rather unique way of attacking cyber crime versus larger companies that are yet to grow without spending ferociously. In other words, CyberArk is one impressive company."
3294105,24849,2015-06-30T12:35:31-04:00,"Time to re-evaluate after float has soared.Valuation has improved compared to peer group.Results continue to impress, so estimates are rising.","Back in February, I warned investors about a bubble ready to burst for shares of CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR). The stock was soaring due to investors flooding into the cyber security space, and things were a bit out of control. At that time, I was worried about a huge valuation and lock-up expirations that would significantly increase the float. Now that things have calmed down a bit, it's time to take another look at the name. Today, I think the stock could be a buy for investors wanting to jump on the cyber security bandwagon.My first worry was that the low float stock was about to see a flood of shares available for trade after lockup expirations passed. Back in February, the stock's float was under 13 million shares, and Yahoo now reports the figure at 21.79 million. That's about a 70% increase in the float, meaning the supply of shares available has jumped significantly. The stock has become a lot less volatile with the higher float. Also, we've now seen a lot of short sellers come in, as seen below, which could lead to a short squeeze.(Source: Nasdaq short interest CYBR page)The second item that I like is the continuation of strong results. In early May, the company announced solid results and gave impressive guidance. License revenues were up 119% year-over-year in Q1 2015, an acceleration from the 95% growth seen in Q4 2014. We've seen analyst revenue estimates for this year rise from $133.60 million to $140.51 million since the earnings report with the current estimate representing 36.4% growth. The average forecast for next year also has jumped by more than $12 million to $180 million, which would represent another 28.5% growth in 2016. Management has given conservative quarterly guidance since its IPO, so a few more beats could push these forecasts even higher.The other major problem I had initially with CyberArk was its valuation. Back in February, the stock was trading at about 20.2 times its trailing 12-month sales compared to a peer group that averaged 7.86 times. Since then, the peer average has dipped to 7.72 times, while CyberArk is down to 16.5 times. Yes, the stock is much more expensive than peers, but the gap has closed. Also, CyberArk's growth prospects appear better than before.In the end, I think CyberArk Software is worth another look after this recent pullback. While the stock is still expensive compared to peers, the cyber security space is hot right now. We hear about new attacks almost every week, and the company is poised to show strong growth in the coming years. Now that lockup expirations have passed, the stock's float has soared, so investors shouldn't need to worry about a deluge of shares flooding the market anytime soon. The company's most recent offering will give it more cash with which to strengthen the business. Back in February, the stock was in a bubble, which did pop. A few months later, things look a bit more realistic, so investors may want to take another look."
3414626,24400,2015-08-07T11:54:37-04:00,"CyberArk's proprietary solutions -- which are in high demand -- have tons of money-making potential.There are no signs of slowing down, given how quickly the average analysts fiscal year 2015 revenue estimate has climbed.CYBR stock should be owned, especially given how hot security stocks have become.","Enterprise security software specialist CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR) may be a relative newcomer in the realm of cyber security and computer threat prevention, but the company, which reports second-quarter earnings Tuesday after the closing bell, has developed an important niche -- one that differentiates CyberArk from what has become a crowded market.Trying to stay several steps ahead of cyber criminals and hackers who pose huge security and financial risks, is not easy, especially when hackers have come up with innovative ways to steal sensitive personal and business data. And ubiquity of mobile devices and smartphones, which allows remote access to corporate files and cloud data, only heightens the risk. And this is an area where CyberArk thrive, sending its shares up 48% on the year and more than 100% in the past twelve months.Indeed, much larger rivals like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) have established strong footholds in the security space. But CyberArk -- by having added a new security layer -- takes a different approach. Among several of its features, CyberArk can protect businesses from threats that have already breached the first level of protection, making its way inside the organization.And once the threat is discovered, the software is able to lock down internal computer/network systems, thereby preventing data from leaving the network. It's a way to restrict the threat -- whether internal or external -- from stealing information. This is important because, in assessing the security risk, CyberArk's software doesn't assume the threat originated outside of the organization, and not inside from a disgruntled employee even.As evidenced by 120% year-over-year jump in first-quarter license revenue, businesses are embracing these features at incredible rates. This translates to revenue growth acceleration of around 95%. And there are no signs of slowing down, given that how quickly the average analysts fiscal year 2015 revenue estimate has climbed, up from around $133 million to $140 million, representing almost 40% year-over-year growth.So while CYBR stock, which trade 97 times forward earnings (S&P 500 trades at a P/E of 17), don't scream value today, the company is delivering on the growth implied by the P/E. Plus, given that CyberArk's features has both limited competition and has first-mover advantage, it will be a while before the company will experience meaningful signs of slowing growth.So, until then, CYBR stock should be owned, especially given how hot security stocks have become. Combined with its proprietary solutions -- which is in high demand -- and money-making potential (2016 earnings projected to climb 40% year over year), CyberArk will be around for years to come, if it's not acquired. Either way, shareholders will profit."
3252385,55922,2015-06-12T10:43:57-04:00,CyberArk offers second secondary and extends lockup by 75 days.GoPro also extended its lockup but that didn’t stop its share price from falling.CyberArk is weakest of the cyber stocks on valuation and growth.More hacking over the long term will only benefit CyberArk up to a point.,"On Wednesday evening, CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) announced it had closed its second secondary at a price of $61. The price at close of day was $63.37 and around $68 when details of the number and pricing of the secondary were shared with the market a few days ago. The company is selling 900,000 new shares and 4 million shares from existing holders. What's a little unusual about this offering is that it is the second one in 3 months and replaces what was to be CyberArk's lockup expiration, where 18 million shares were to become available for sale.I am having deju vu here - all over again - since something very similar happened with GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO). Back then GoPro had a secondary where it sold 10 million additional shares (the float at that point was 20 million) and it only allowed a further 15 million shares to be sold in its lockup expiration on 23rd December. The bulk of the shares, some 76 million were locked up for another 90 days. None of these machinations prevented GoPro's stock from crashing down to $37, though the stock has made a partial recovery since.In CyberArk' case it had 12 million in float and has added another 5 million. The remaining 13 million shares plus 5 million in options and restricted stock units are still to come. 13 million shares can be sold 75 days from now. A further 5 million options and restricted stock units have been registered and are available for immediate sale.It's not made clear whether the new 75-day lockup agreement with the principal selling shareholders also applies to those options. The lack of any explicit statement indicating they are included in such agreement seems to indicate they can be sold.History doesn't repeat but it does rhymeNow obviously CyberArk' stock won't necessarily follow in GoPro's footsteps. But there have now been several high flying stocks that have crashed to earth after their lockups have expired. Names like Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Zulilly (NASDAQ:ZU), Fireeye (NASDAQ:FEYE) (another cybersecurity stock), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), Gopro etc. and readers can no doubt think of others.CyberArk is more expensive than GoPro at its peak on both a P/S and P/E basis. Cyber is only ""fairly"" priced in comparison with other cyber security stocks and there are good reasons to think that Cyber should trade at a discount to its peers.*At stock price high 6 months ago.So CyberArk is 40% more overvalued than GoPro at the camera maker's peak stock price. CyberArk has a similar valuation to other cyber security stocks. In fact adjusting for growth Cyber is priced the same as Palo (NYSE:PANW). But Palo surely should trade at a premium to Cyber given that Palo is the no. 1 stock in the space. Fireeye is harder to evaluate given that it is loss making. In theory its higher growth might compensate for its current lack of profits. Call it a tie. One last factor that should handicap Cyber is that being a non U.S company (and non E.U for that matter) it is restricted from government work and perhaps certain commercial work that relies on classified technology. So far that restriction hasn't impeded Cyber's growth figures, but an ultimately lower TAM should result in a discounted valuation.That's the relative valuation, what about the intrinsic valuation? It won't matter after all if Cyber is expensive compared to other cyber security stocks if the whole sector goes on to double again. Cyber along with the other stocks in its sector has a PEG of over 3 whereas a PEG of one is considered reasonable. The only way cyber security stocks can grow into their valuation is if earnings accelerate. Is this plausible?To an outsider to the cyber security industry (as I am) it's hard to evaluate just how big the market can grow. Unlike other stock market crazes such as fuel cells, which didn't really have viable or sustainable business models, cyber security is a sector whose time has clearly come. But how much growth is there left? Already most companies with sensitive customer information like retailers and banks already use cyber security services. There's some growth still to come no doubt among small companies yet to bother with cyber protection so far. It's also possible that sectors that haven't seen the need for cyber protection will get hacked and then start spending money on companies like Cyber. But this sort of growth is expected and built into forecasts for revenue growth and earnings. The only way cyber spending can go above that level is if there is a massive increase in successful hacking operations and companies are willing to spend even more of their budget on protection against hacking.Even then Cyber and existing companies may not benefit. After all, if these hacks get through CyberArk's (as well as other established cyber security companies) defenses, why would companies ramp up their spending on those same companies?Imagine an analogous situation: there is a massive increase in burglary in the United States, do burglar alarm manufacturers benefit? Would homeowners keep spending more on ever more complex alarm systems? Well up to a point, but beyond a certain level homeowners are going to realize that alarms aren't sufficient and that other measures are necessary. This is the situation in places like South Africa where guns and wired fences and guards are used.ConclusionI've been short CyberArk since it doubled in the space of two weeks back in Feb. I actually managed to short the stock with a buck of the peak value. I also was able to cover within a couple of bucks of the recent bottom. Unfortunately I decided to re-short in the low 50's and have watched aghast as the stock price surged to above $70. Luckily the price has come down a quite a bit now. With half the shares still remaining to be unlocked and lockup only 10 weeks away, CyberArk is in my opinion the weakest of its sector. How far it will drop will ultimately depend on how the sector fares overall but I can easily see $50 being retested in the next 3 months, with a decline to $30 not out of the question."
3432246,22148,2015-08-12T10:37:43-04:00,"CyberArk continues to under promise and over deliver.
        The company regularly smashes Estimize estimates though the valuation multiples suggests the market already has that expectation.
        The stock is likely to struggle gaining traction until it better proves that demand is sustainable.","By all accounts, the Q2'15 earnings results for CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) were a blowout. The security software firm easily exceeded both analyst and company estimates suggesting CyberArk has unstoppable growth. The stock though isn't showing the same enthusiasm for the strong results.According to the data, CyberArk always smashes estimates. Or at least, the company has beaten the numbers since going public last year. According to Estimize, the company has even beaten their estimates where the analysts don't follow the Wall St. norm and basically repeat the corporate numbers.For Q2, CyberArk reported earnings of $0.19 that even surpassed the $0.13 estimate of Estimize.The company though didn't divert from its guidance of the standard 30% revenue growth for Q3. CyberArk continues to suggest the recent hacking incidents are pulling forward license agreements that will leave the company short of new customers down the road.On the other side of the equation, the cyber security firm is loading up on expenses though it claims revenue growth will eventually decelerate. Operating expenses surged $2.6 million sequentially to $23.8 million.Most concerning in my book is that CyberArk increased all expenses outside of research and development. It actually spent $2.0 million more on sales and marketing in order to attract $3.4 million in sequential revenue gains. R&D spending is down to only 11.8% of revenue from 15.5% last year. At some point down the road, the lack of spending on development is going to hurt sales.As a repeated theme, stocks have an extremely difficult hurdle for overcoming multiple valuations in excess of 10x forward revenues. In the case of CyberArk, it originally hit $70 back in February when the forward PS ratio soared beyond 13x. Even after strong revenue growth throughout the year and a stock price that is down to $60, the PS ratio is still over 10x forward revenues.Compared to other industry players like Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), CyberArk trades in the middle of the multiple range for a stretched sector.CYBR PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe key takeaway remains that the company actually makes a compelling case that revenue growth will decelerate. In that scenario, the stock heads lower. Regardless, it doesn't add up that the CyberArk claims revenue growth will decelerate and then turns around and spends heavily on sales and marketing to pull that revenue forward.The company is clearly in the sweet spot of the cyber security industry, but the stock is having a difficult time overcoming extreme expectations. It is hard to justify a valuation of $2 billion for a quarterly revenue forecast of only up to $37 million. Sure the company will likely smash this estimate again, but the market expects a $40.0 million quarter and if the company doesn't deliver you won't want to own the stock."
3166556,22148,2015-05-11T17:04:34-04:00,CyberArk produced blowout Q1 2015 earnings.The cyber-security stock trades near all-time highs despite providing weak guidance for the second half of the year.CyberArk appears reliant on more large-scale security breaches to justify higher stock prices.,"After a blowout Q1 2015 earnings report, investors sent the stock of CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) up nearly 8% for the day. The cyber-security expert that focuses on protecting company networks from privileged account attacks surprisingly guided to revenue declining sequentially during Q2. The market shook off the guidance and sent the stock close to all-time highs near $70.With the stock worth over $2.3 billion now, investors appear ahead of themselves on this one. Previous research questioned chasing the stock above $50, but the market appears to disagree. Due to some recent high-profile breaches, the question now is whether the huge beat in Q1 is sustainable.Did The Market Understand The Guidance?Due to the huge beat in Q1 ($32.9 million actual versus $26.0 million guidance), investors are ignoring guidance that's probably conservative. Though, CyberArk guided to revenue growth of only 33% for the full-year suggesting a significant deceleration in growth from the 89% revenue growth rate in Q1.The company suggests that it overachieved during Q1 with the likelihood that several accounts were pulled ahead due to the recent high-level security breaches at Target (NYSE:TGT) and Anthem (NYSE:ATHM).The full-year guidance only suggests revenue of $72 million in the 2H of the year, only up from slightly over $64 million last year. So a company that's producing license revenue growth over 100% can only guide for 12.5% growth in the 2H? Note that the 2H is about 50 days away from starting and CyberArk should already have some of the pipeline developing.No doubt the guidance is conservative, but the market possibly didn't catch the actual weakness of the numbers. Sure the numbers are off the charts low, but the possibility exists that CyberArk doesn't see the prospects projected by the market.Prepare For Expectation DisappointmentsThe other scary part of the CyberArk story is the huge increase in expenses expected for Q2. The company increased headcount by 13% sequentially during the quarter and forecast more hires in Q2. The company did take the initiative to spend more during the 1H of the year to prepare for the Q4 push, but the level of spending suggests the amount of license growth is requiring this higher expense. Otherwise, the blowout Q1 margins and profit levels aren't sustainable and will require a level of deleveraging during the quarter to be sustainable.An analyst on the earnings call predicting $5 million sequential growth in operating expenses wasn't shot down by the company. Remember that CyberArk guided toward flat to down revenue growth and net income of around $2 million to $3 million. The net income number is down sharply from the $5.7 million generated in Q1.TakeawayWith 35 million shares outstanding, CyberArk has an incredible market value for a software firm guiding to limited growth. The stock is worth nearly $2.3 billion and trades at roughly 17x internal revenue guidance of $137 million for 2015. Even if the ultimate revenue growth is 50%, the company will only produce $155 million for 2015.The signs exist that CyberArk has an issue with the sustainability of demand. Further security breaches will undoubtedly lead to faster revenue growth than forecasted, but it doesn't appear that the company has any reason to expect blowout numbers to persist without a market influencing event. In fact, the lack of an event in the next couple of months could leave the market wondering why it paid up for a stock that guided to such subdued growth rates."
3155866,87586,2015-05-07T17:02:00-04:00,"There has been an explosion in the number of cybersecurity threats in recent years, leaving both governments and corporations vulnerable to data breaches that are both embarrassing and damaging.According to research done by Frost & Sullivan and Interpol, the cybersecurity market is set to be a $155 billion market by 2020, representing an 11.8% CAGR from 2013.Crucial growth inflection point - From 2011-2014, CyberArk has seen its top-line growth exceeding 40%. Management has guided for 23-26% growth in 2015, which is fairly conservative, allowing for upside surprise.","Company DescriptionFounded in 1999, CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) provides security solutions aimed at discovering, monitoring and protecting privileged accounts associated with employees in IT departments and other areas of enterprise in addition to servers, applications and devices. A global company, CyberArk is headquartered in Petach Tikva, Israel, with its U.S. headquarters located in Newton, MA. The company also has offices throughout EMEA and Asia Pacific.CyberArk completed its IPO on September 24, 2014, issuing 5.36 million new primary shares (6.16 million including the overallotment as of September 30, 2014) at a price of $16/share.IntroductionThere has been a dramatic increase in data breaches in notable organizations like the National Security Agency (NSA), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Standard Chartered (OTCPK:SCBFF). There also has been an increase in hacking by hackers, with the latest being Sony (NYSE:SNE). The above highlights the growing threat of cybersecurity to organizations today.Catalysts:Cybersecurity, a $155 billion market in 2020. According to INTERPOL World 2015, one main focus this year is the threat of cybersecurity. It also projects cybersecurity to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 11.8% from 2013 to 2020 based on research taken from Frost & Sullivan's Global Cybersecurity Market Assessment 2014.Strong competitive position relative to its peers. CyberArk has the technological advantage of being focused solely on cybersecurity. The issue of cybersecurity is gaining key importance, and in my view, companies are beginning to recognize this. US arms maker Raytheon's (RTN) recent acquisition of Websense for $1.9 billion just last month (April 2015) shows its desire to expand into the cybersecurity space vs. its traditional focus on defense technologies. This comes on the heels of its acquisition of Blackbird Technologies for $420 million in Nov. 2014 last year. CyberArk has the advantage of being a pure cybersecurity play.Growth inflection point: From 2011 to 2014, top-line revenue has grown at more than 40% (41.5%) CAGR. Noteworthy for investors is that CyberArk represents the rare few cyber plays that are actually profitable vs. FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) for example. Net margins for 2014 are a respectable 9.7% vs. 2013's 10.0%. The decline is mainly attributed to an increase in R&D and sales and marketing expenses, which is common for a new start-up company trying to establish itself in this space.Steep valuation: The Street has a preference for the EV/sales matrix to value new start-up companies like CyberArk. Based on its last closing price of $62.68 on the 6th of May 2015, this means that it has an historical EV/sales of 16.9x. While the growth opportunities for the company remain intact, the extremely steep valuation suggests a slight degree of overvaluation. I therefore have a hold recommendation on the counter and recommend accumulation at the next correction.Business ModelCyberArk is focused on the protection of privileged accounts. In order to better understand the business, I think Gartner does a pretty good job in terms of classifying the different aspects of privileged accounts, as highlighted below:· PSM (privileged session management) solutions are defined by the ability to establish/control sessions and record them for archive or on a real-time basis.· SAPM (shared account password management) solutions provide an encrypted/hardened password safe or vault for storing credentials, keys or other sensitive information. The products will control access to shared accounts to allow only authorized users to access them. The user may not see the actual password necessary to access the vault when integrated with a PSM solution that automatically initiates a session without disclosing the password.· SUPM (superuser privilege management) tools are designed to filter or restrict commands that can be run under elevated privileges. Common examples are the Unix/Linux command ""sudo"" and the Microsoft Windows command ""runas"" that allow users to run a command under the privilege of another user.· AAPM (application-to-application password management) tools are usually an add-on to a SAPM solution used to eliminate hard-coded passwords/credentials stored in files. The AAPM tool provides the function to pull credentials from a vault (usually through a trusted session) and interfaces with the application or script that requires the credentials.· AD (Active Directory) bridging tools are used to allow users and groups defined within the Active Directory to be recognized on Unix and Linux systems. Gartner notes that AD bridging tools are not strictly privileged account management tools, but are often sold or used in combination with SUPM.FinancialsCyberArk's financials reveal the growth inflection point discussed above. Moving forward, I see top- and bottom-line expansion from 1) Greater need for companies to upgrade their cybersecurity infrastructure, and 2) Reduced costs from marketing and advertising as they gain greater prominence and visibility.Source: Company data and reportsThe catalyst for the above would be high profile breaches resulting in companies taking greater precautions to boosting their cybersecurity infrastructure. Their gross margins also reflect a level of stability for investors in the company.Improving operating margins: The company has been able to improve operating margins over the last four years. This in my view reflects the management's ability to control costs and grow sustainably over time, avoiding costly cash burn that's typically evident in new start-ups. FireEye for instance has seen its expenses in sales and marketing rise faster than revenue - this is not evident here.FundraisingThe company just completed a secondary offering in March 2015 for 4,000,000 ordinary shares at a price of $51.00 per share. The company has no debt and could raise debt in the future to finance its growth.ManagementIt is important that investors know the background of the management given that CyberArk was a start-up firm created by the founder who also is the CEO. I took a close look at its management team and feel that investors will have confidence in its ability to execute moving forward.Udi Mokady, founder and CEO of CyberArk, was also the COO of CyberArk from 1999 to 2005. During his capacity as head of operations, he focused on strategy and sales operations/expansion prior to taking over as CEO. In my view, CEOs with operations background tend to be better in terms of setting strategic directions for the business.Investment Thesis:Strong competitive position: The emerging threat of cybersecurity put firms at risk of having their privileged and customer data compromised. It is my view that companies today are themselves still uncertain of how to deal with this emerging threat. Moving forward, they are likely to increase expenditures on this area, which is a positive for companies like CyberArk (pure play).Seen in the above light, customers are likely to shortlist companies with a proven track record and capability in dealing with such threats, and CyberArk is, in my view, well positioned to take advantage of this. FireEye recently reported its 1H15 results which showed top-line improvement of 69% vs. 1H14. CyberArk is due to report its results on the 8th of May 15, and should also see top-line expansion. The massive upside surprise the company generated in Q4'14 with EPS of $0.21 vs. Street's expectations of $0.05 has resulted in a big move in the stock price.Rise in new business growth: Based on its Q4'14 results, CyberArk now has a total customer count of 1,800, with 30% of the customer base buying additional products annually. For full-year 2014, CyberArk saw deals over $100K grow 41% to 217 vs. 154 in 2013.Management GuidanceManagement has guided for 23-26% year-on-year growth for full-year 2015. In my view, this is likely to be easily reached. And management's attempt to manage expectations is positive in my view, which allows it to surprise on the upside.CompetitorsI scoured for the list of competitors that were closest to CyberArk in terms of offerings, size and technology and narrowed them down to a few I think investors will compare CyberArk with. They are Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS), Imperva (NASDAQ:IMPV), Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT) and FireEye.As mentioned above, I used the EV/sales matrix as the valuation matrix most comparable for firms in this industry. And at current levels, CyberArk is trading at more than 50% premium above the industry average around 7x EV/sales.RisksNew competitors entering the market: I looked at a list of venture capital sites and found a great deal of new start-ups focused on this area. In my view, these start-ups could pose a threat to CyberArk given the relatively low barriers to entry and constantly evolving cybersecurity threat in this area.ConclusionFireEye recently reported 1H15 results, which showed top-line improving by 69% vs. 1H14. CyberArk is due to report its results on the 8th of May 15, and should also see top-line expansion. The massive upside surprise the company generated in the fourth quarter has resulted in a big move in the stock price. Even if it surprises on the upside in its latest results, a lot need to go right for the company given its strong run in the share price, which is a risk investors need to consider. Nonetheless, as seen above, this industry is starting to see M&A activity taking place, which could be a plus for CyberArk if it should be acquired."
2958076,33901,2015-02-27T06:57:26-05:00,,"Humans have always had the need for security. In the earliest days of civilization, early humans would bury their valuable possessions, or hide them in caves. As time went on, skilled trades people crafted vaults and safes to store the valuables of those who could afford to pay them.With the internet, however, came the need for an entirely new kind of protection and security. The digital exchange and storage of information gave hackers the opportunity to steal that information.And with the increased volume of transactions and data stored online, the need for security has increased exponentially. Regular readers of the Financial Markets Wizard blog and options trading newsletter will be well aware of the many companies that have been created to serve this need. Indeed, subscribers to the options trading services we provide have made several profitable trades on companies in this industry.That is why the digital security firm CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR) is worth some attention. It has made a strong start to life as a publicly traded company, with the share price doubling from its initial trading range of $30 to the most recent high of $70.48.So are there more opportunities for the share price of CyberArk Software to continue to grow in the near future?Understanding the BusinessIn medieval times, the method of defending against invading armies was simple. Wealthy castle owners would put their assets behind high, impenetrable walls and pull up the drawbridge before fighting off the attackers. Most digital security works off exactly the same principle.Traditional firewalls and anti-virus software places the crucial information and assets of a person or company behind digital ""walls"" in an attempt to keep out intruders. But the higher the walls are built, the better the attackers become at climbing over them, meaning that software and information needs to be upgraded rapidly to stay ahead of the attackers.CyberArk Software provides this traditional form of protection, but with one important added extra. The Israeli based company also researches, designs and sells software that protects from threats inside the digital walls of a network.The reason for this is twofold. First, it allows companies whose defenses have been breached to lock down their systems and prevent the attacker from moving around freely and stealing more. Secondly, it protects against internal threats to the organization, such as an employee who might sell passwords or access illegally to malicious third parties.Research shows that data theft and information security breaches are far more common from inside organizations than from outside them, often from contractors or employees who have access to the system from the inside. To go back to the original example, this would be like people inside the castle putting the drawbridge down and helping the attackers get inside.Metrics and MeasuresThis innovative and novel approach to securing digital networks delivered impressive results for the company in their latest quarterly earnings.For options trading services, the really interesting number was the headline revenue increase in the fourth quarter of 81%, which equated to over $36 million. Of that revenue figure, recurring license revenue was over $24 million, which was almost double that of the previous quarter.Recurring revenue is the best kind of revenue for a company to earn, as it means that customers are making repeat purchases and providing earnings stability.The quarterly net income of CyberArk Software was also impressive, with $6.7 million earned after costs were taken out of revenue. This represented an increase of almost five times on the previous figure of $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.Cash flow was also strong for the full year, with the company having over $177 million in the bank at the end of 2014, compared with $65 million at the same time in 2013.The Investment CaseThe investment case for a stock like CyberArk Software is compelling. It serves the need for all organizations to have a strong digital security service at all times to protect against external and internal threats.CyberArk is interesting in that it is pursuing a completely different way of providing this security, by designing solutions that are designed to work if intruders get through. This is clever, because it sets the firm apart from the many other cyber security firms fighting for market share.A point of difference such as this is why investors are interested in CyberArk, and why its share price has performed so well to date.The risk to the company is that the large competitors in the field like Norton and Symantec begin to develop similar solutions in addition to their market leading external protection abilities. If this happens, CyberArk may be forced to cut margins to sell its products and win new clients, which would have a negative effect on revenue and profits.ConclusionCyberArk Software is one of many firms providing digital security solutions, but also possesses a unique approach that sets it apart from its competitors. If it can entrench its first mover position in this market, it will likely capture a high number of recurring clients, which will give it the ability to reinvest profits to protect its market share.Disclosure: None."
3242966,76785,2015-06-08T10:25:53-04:00,Investing in the cybersecurity in only one direction is volatile and risky.Pairs trading helps reduce volatility while still allowing sizeable returns.Going long CyberArk and short Proofpoint are the author's picks for playing this industry.,"A rising tide lifts all boats. A fitting phrase that applies perfectly to the stock market as sector rallies in hot areas of the market can cause share prices of both the good and bad to rise. However, as investors how can we minimize the risk of taking long or short positions in these hot market sectors while minimizing the impact of a fall from grace?In this piece, we look at pairs trading. Most investors know that the biggest influences of stock prices are not related to the merits of an individual company, but overall market and sector sentiment. The cybersecurity industry specifically makes for an excellent proving ground for this strategy. This nascent industry is going through its expansion phase.Revenue growth is high as large firms run over top of each other to invest money into cybersecurity due to outsized risk. The recent shocks of data breaches in the past two years at large companies such as Target (NYSE:TGT), UPS (NYSE:UPS), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS), and Sony (NASDAQ:SNY) are fresh in the minds of top brass in boardrooms across the business world. Top management knows there isn't a more sure fire way to shoot your business in the foot than having to publicly announce that highly sensitive information from consumers has been compromised. It isn't a surprise that a flood of investor dollars has swept into these markets to speculate on the next big thing.Yet while growth is high, competition is also fierce. There are multitudes of companies in this space with billion dollar valuations that have not yet turned a profit. To skirt the issue of profitability, analysts have turned to valuation methods such as EV/Revenue to justify sky high valuations that can't be substantiated via traditional methods based on earnings. As with all new industries, consolidation and bankruptcy is coming for many companies as the cream rises to the top.What To Do?Pairs trading looks to minimize the risk of investing in sectors like these. By taking a long and a short position in comparable securities, traders hope to hedge exposure to broad market rallies or falls. If the overall market or sector moves up, the loss on the short is covered by gain on the long and vice versa. In a perfect pairs hedge, you have eliminated all the market noise. All that is left that matters is the merits of the individual companies. This creates a perfect opportunity for astute stock pickers who think they can isolate undervalued and overvalued stocks within a sector.Many investors have gone long at the top of a market bubble, leading to devastating losses as they hold on for hope of a turnaround. Likewise, going short here with no hedge can be a risky play. Just because these companies don't turn profits doesn't mean that shares can't continue to march higher. The recently created HACK ETF (NYSEARCA:HACK), made up of the biggest players in the industry, has decimated the returns of the S&P 500 since its creation. You could easily lose your shirt before there is a valuation adjustment in the industry.*HACK returns versus SPX, November 2014 to presentSelecting Our PairsAbove is a list of the top high-flying names in the cybersecurity industry and their respective EV/Revenue and Price/Sales measures, common means of valuation. I've also listed if these companies were GAAP profitable. I'm not a big fan of adjusted non-GAAP EPS within this industry as the non-GAAP numbers generally exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, and acquisition/litigation costs. For many of these companies, stock-based compensation is the biggest of these expenses. For technology companies, stock-based compensation has become an integral piece of the compensation picture for attracting and retaining workers and is unlikely to change, even as the companies grow and mature. Excluding a primary piece of labor expense that is so unlikely to change strikes me as just a gimmick to help companies tout when they reach a profitability point. Because of this, this GAAP profitability measure will be a key component in selecting our long and short. We will go long an already proven, profitable company and short an unprofitable one.What we're looking for on the short side is business model weakness, specifically weaknesses that might lead to market share loss versus other companies on this list as they all compete within similar markets. FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) may be trading on the highest multiples, but it is also the fastest growing player in the industry. It is also highly diversified in its product offerings. MVX (the company's primary security system) covers a range of devices and points of failure. Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) have developed similar cloud-based systems that cover threat detection across multiple platforms. Companies with broad-based product offerings generally have an easier time and do not make for as attractive short positions. Another company on our list, Infoblox (NYSE:BLOX) is a network control company that focuses on securing data that funnels through internal networks and external traffic, through means such as through DNS security. DNS security is a vulnerability that companies have become increasingly aware of through DNS-based DDoS attacks and DNS tunneling. The company is going through a shift with a new CEO and business model, which is why it trades at the cheapest multiples on our list. Given the company is going through a revitalization period after having its share price fall more than 50% since the company's highs late in 2013, the brunt of the damage may have already been done. We'll pass here as well.Short ProofpointWhat we're left with is Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT), which makes for an attractive short for several reasons. From a business model perspective, Proofpoint's products are primarily related to e-mail, such as preventing phishing attacks and offering archival services. The company has made acquisitions in protecting social media accounts, but we have not yet seen concrete results that these acquisitions will bear fruit. Overall, the company lacks the broad product solution that companies like FireEye offer. Over time, my belief is that companies may tend to want to consolidate their cybersecurity needs into only one or two vendors. Having a few vendors limits confusion and allows a deeper relationship between the two management teams. Proofpoint is well behind in offering a varied product suite and this puts them at a disadvantage.Further adding pressure to the company's core business, e-mail is entering a period of stagnation as growth slows. Once ubiquitous with the internet, it is beginning to fall out of favor as a means of communication. Within the business environment, more and more business communication is beginning to filter through instant messaging platforms and other means of real-time team collaboration. While I'm not arguing that e-mail will go away anytime soon, I do believe that its dominance as the primary means of communication within businesses will fade with time.From a financial statement perspective, as we've highlighted earlier, the company has not yet turned a profit. In fact, losses are accelerating from -$0.69/share in 2012 to -$1.72/share in 2014 (GAAP). I expect 2015 GAAP losses to be in the range of $1.75/share based on a continuation of current 2014 trends (which we are on track for after a $0.56 loss in Q1 alone, up from a $0.31 loss in Q1 2014). The company's own 2015 guidance (which may be hard to match with foreign currency concerns) and analyst estimates paint a similar picture over the next two fiscal years. This isn't for lack of growth. Since 2011, revenue has grown at an annual rate of 24.34%. However, operating expenses have grown at a 25.05% rate, resulting in accelerating operating income losses. Net income has fallen further as the company picked up debt in 2014, so interest expenses have begun to impact the bottom line. This debt issuance has also leveraged the company. Proofpoint holds a debt/equity ratio of 3.4, indicating the poor situation shareholders are in as their equity ownership has been eroded. Proofpoint already has penetration with 45 customers in the Fortune 100 and 231 in the Fortune 1000 at the end of 2014. Far from a positive, I view this as symptom of the lack of profitability. Proofpoint has managed to garner a sizable market share of large firms that purchase its business, but has not been able to turn that into net income. As a further weakness, analysts expect revenue to decline to a 29.09% rate in 2015, a decline over its historical growth rate.*Proofpoint Income StatementInsiders are selling as well. In the last twelve months, insiders have dumped 853k shares of stock, with no open market purchases. This is an acceleration from prior levels. Unsurprisingly, Insider ownership remains poor. Gary Steele, CEO, still only holds one share of stock according to Nasdaq filings. If the company does turn profitable, 3.5M shares will enter the market due to vested stock options that become available. Insiders will likely do as they have prior, dumping those shares on the market.Based on all these factors, the company is undeserving of its $2.4B market capitalization. Proofpoint is unprofitable, costs have outpaced growth, and the company faces substantial risk from being behind the curve on a multi-faceted protection product. The company to me is clearly has one of the hazier futures in this market. But what about the long side of the trade? Is there a company out there that can be the polar opposite of Proofpoint?We left ourselves with two choices for the long side of our trade based on our parameters, Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) and CyberArk. Fortinet has seen its revenue continue to grow, much like peers. However, as one of the early pioneers in this industry, it has seen its margins come under pressure as upstarts in the space have put pressure on the company. Gross margins of 70% in 2014 are a far cry from levels that peaked at nearly 80% in 2012. EPS has fallen from 0.44/share in 2010 to 0.15/share in 2014 as the company has been unable to increase operating margins. For our long, I think we are better suited finding a disruptive upstart that has more potential.*Fortinet Income StatementLong CyberArkCyberArk is a relative newcomer to the cybersecurity market and focuses on its own niche. CyberArk has pushed a new layer of security solutions that helps protect organizations from cyber attacks that have already made their way inside a company's outer protection or originated inside them. Data theft and breaches are more likely to be from insiders than from the outside, or at least have had inside help. CyberArk aims to help prevent this, along with also providing systems that lock down internal systems during breaches to prevent an outflow of information. This is a relatively new area of security, one that CyberArk has limited competition in and has first-mover advantage.For many companies like Target and Home Depot that already counted major cybersecurity companies as vendors, the value added here is clear. Through a second, independent layer of protection that operates from within, risks are reduced. Even if competitors offered similar products to protect against privileged accounts, CyberArk monitoring can just point to the value in having a second, independent party monitoring the inside. As fears runs rampant in C-suite related to breaches, it is clear that this area of protection is likely to be an area of immense growth. I foresee better demand for CyberArk products than Proofpoint going forward.Since going public, CyberArk has been solidly profitable. The company earned $0.21/share (GAAP) in 2014 and analyst estimates forecast revenue to continue to be hot, growing revenue 35.83% in 2015, above the historical average for CAGR. While critics point to management's own low level of revenue guidance of 25% growth for 2015, management has had a history of being conservative and easily beating its own guidance. *CyberArk Income StatementGross margins have seen some pressure, but that has been a trend across the entire space. Unlike most other companies, CyberArk has seen operating margin improvement. This is why we've seen operating income more than double to $20M in 2014 from $6M in 2011. The company has shown the ability to generate strong operating leverage, even in the face of sales and marketing expenses growing nearly 45% year/year as the company increased headcount 40%. I estimate GAAP earnings for 2015 to be in the range of $0.30/share, a nearly 50% increase over 2014 earnings.CyberArk carries no long term debt, but it does plan a follow-up offering to raise additional funds after raising more cash in the equity markets recently. Given the hotness of the market and the relative risk ratings that the company would likely receive in the bond market, management has likely made a proper choice electing to issue stock to raise capital. Until the company matures further, shareholders should likely expect some dilution. Additionally, venture funds hold significant internal holdings. At some point, these funds will likely want to unload shares. This doesn't concern me too much from an investor's perspective given the addressable market for the company's products, but it is something that investors need to be aware of and consider.My estimates are in-line with JP Morgan analysts, who view the privileged account management market as a potential multi-billion dollar landscape. Channel checks by JP Morgan point to CyberArk as the brand leader here with estimated 2015 and 2016 sales growth at 35% and 34% growth in 2015 and 2016 respectively.Returns YTD and Concluding ThoughtsWhile this is no indication of the future, how would a trade of Long CYBR, Short PFPT done since the beginning of the year? This is what your return would look like purchasing 251 shares long in CYBR ($9,984.78 on an open price of $39.78) and 205 shares short of PFPT ($9,969.15 on an open price of $48.63) on January 02, 2015 until now:Year to date, this trade has returned $3,193.65 as of 06/01/2015 closing prices, or in excess of 31% on our approximate $10k investment. This is more than double the return of the HACK ETF over this timeframe, which clocked in around a 15% return. This has been because the recent positive news in the space is more likely to benefit CyberArk than it is Proofpoint. While I wouldn't expect such significant outperformance of the HACK ETF to continue, this trade has proven itself to be a profitable one in the immediate rear view mirror. Overall, this strategy should be less volatile versus holding the HACK ETF outright. This is how I see certain scenarios playing out:Cybersecurity rally continues. CyberArk is the smaller player with more to gain than Proofpoint. Chances are major rallies will be based on continued incidents of security breaches, from which CyberArk is likely to be picked by the market as a bigger beneficiary. Your pairs trade will most likely be positive. This is what has occurred in the first half of 2015 and led to runaway gains.Cybersecurity stalls. In a sideways market, I still think CyberArk has the better future, all things considered. Given both shares trade at rich premiums, any contraction in valuation within the sector will bring both companies down relatively evenly. You should see positive results on this trade in a sideways market.Cybersecurity falls off a cliff. In a sustained downward market in this sector (25%+), you may experience mild losses since CyberArk is the newer upstart with less established sources of revenue. However, I find the chances of a major contraction in this market very small in the short term. With breaches occurring at the government level, it is apparent that hackers are having an easy time having a field day with getting access to sensitive data, and are unlikely to stop what is assuredly lucrative activity for them anytime soon.Pairs trading like this is a great way to hedge your exposure to certain industries, especially in volatile sectors where you as an individual investor believe you can spot relatively over and undervalued companies. Pairs trading is still very much underutilized in my opinion by retail investors, which is a shame as it reduces volatility and risk. In the end, we'd all like to sleep better at night with our investments and pairs trading helps us do that."
3007036,22148,2015-03-18T11:30:24-04:00,"CyberArk had blowout Q4 results.The cybersecurity stock saw substantial gains in February due to high profile security threats and general excitement in the industry.The potential for further insider dumping by pre-IPO venture funds could weigh on the stock.The stable and profitable growth of CyberArk is a preferable method in the current market, but the current PS ratio suggests limited upside.","The excitement in cybersecurity led to CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR) rallying over 100% in a matter of weeks during February. The rise isn't all that different from the moves in fellow security stocks of FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) that led to drastically different results for shareholders.With CyberArk now trading down nearly 30% from recent highs after a strong Q4 report and a secondary offering, should investors use the dip to buy the once smoking hot cybersecurity stock?Recent Earnings And Insiders Dumping SharesThe company secures corporate networks from privileged account security. In essence, the software eliminates the cyber attacks that breech the network perimeter and use insider privileges. Though a necessary security need, one has to wonder if the addressable market will present a large enough opportunity due to a general desire and focus of enterprises to block the threat from even entering the network.Regardless, CyberArk had blowout Q4 license revenue growth YoY of 95%. The guidance though for Q1 and full-year 2015 leaves a lot to desire for a high-multiple stock. The company forecast net income declines from 2014 levels on top of higher share counts. CyberArk generated huge operating margins due to generally constrained operating expense growth in 2014 though it expects to ramp that up in 2015. The forecast is that net income will decline from nearly $16 million in 2014 to only $12.5 million on the high side in 2015.The biggest concern is the lockup shares hitting the market on March 23 that was partially alleviated by the pre-lockup secondary that allowed selling shareholders to unload 4.6 million shares at $51. It still leaves the pre-IPO venture investors with a significant amount of shares.Source: CYBR prospectusIn total, insiders own over 50% of outstanding shares. Most importantly though, the shares are owned by the venture funds of Jerusalem Venture Partners, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and Vertex Venture Capital. These funds are likely looking to exit positions more than the executives of the company that control around 1.5 million shares.Sector TrendDue to the high profile security issues of the last year, sector stocks have had very volatile trading in the last year or so. One major trend that might seem obvious to most has distinguished the vast difference in the trading of FireEye and Palo Alto Networks over the last 18 months. Palo Alto continues to grow at more sustainable and profitable levels while FireEye is growing at an enormous rate while losing substantial amounts of money. The resulting impact is the initial excitement over the 100%+ growth of FireEye hasn't met a continued excitement with shareholders. Palo Alto gains to outshine FireEye is the bigger stock gains.The data suggests the market will reward the profitable growth of CyberArk though the stock appears fully valued based on the larger players in the industry. If anything, the recent selloff is only bringing the PS ratio back into the normal channel for these stocks.TakeawayBased on the relatively lofty PS ratio and the potential for venture funds dumping more stock, the forecast is that CyberArk struggles to see stock gains from the $50 level. At the current price backed by profitable growth, the stock isn't set for any major stock collapse either. At this point, the recommendation is to not buy the current dip. The stock needs a further large dip that isn't likely to occur."
2524555,25120,2014-09-26T16:41:20-04:00,"CyberArk Software witnessed a very successful public offering this week.The Israeli cyber security business is growing rapidly, has a good outlook and is profitable.After shares have doubled from their initial guided range, appeal is limited in my eyes.","CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR) is a provider of IT security solutions protecting businesses and other organizations from cyber attacks. The Israel-based company went public on Wednesday in what has been a very successful public offering.The company is showing rapid growth and is profitable, yet the very strong returns have limited the risk-reward potential in my eyes at the current moment, leading me to remain cautious.The Public OfferingCyberArk provides software which is predominately focused on the protection of privileged accounts, a key target in today's cyber attacks. These accounts are key to the IT infrastructure, providing access and control of the entire information technology infrastructure and crucial business and consumer data.The software solution monitors activity and detects malicious behavior, adding another security layer for companies in their efforts to keep data and their IT safe. This is crucial given the increased scale, sophistication and frequency of attacks as businesses generally have been rather slow to react, or pro-actively improve their online defenses.The company already has some 1,550 customers among which some 35% of the Fortune 100 businesses, underpinning rapid growth in recent years.CyberArk sold 5.36 million shares for $16 apiece, thereby raising nearly $86 million in gross proceeds. All of the shares were sold by the company with no shares being offered by selling shareholders. Demand for the offering was great with shares being sold above the higher end of the preliminary offering range at $13-$15 set by the underwriting syndicate and the company itself.At the public offering price of $16, equity in the business was valued at $474 million based on an outstanding share base of 29.6 million shares. Shares did jump towards $29.93 on their opening day, pushing the valuation up towards $886 million.Banks which aided the company in its process to become a public firm were J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, William Blair, Nomura and Oppenheimer & Co.ValuationAs discussed above, CyberArk stresses the need for its software as the privileged account security solution prevents organizations from cyber attacks in an area which can result in big damages when intruded by external parties.The company's purpose-built solutions which monitor continuously, are proactive and scalable, key in those respects in a market anticipated to show continued growth. Continued innovation in its product, growing the customer base, increased penetration of the existing customer base, distribution partnerships and potential deals should allow for continues growth going forwards.For the year of 2013, the company posted sales of $66.2 million, a 40.1% increase compared to the year before. The company posted healthy earnings of $6.6 million on those sales, which was actually down from $7.9 million the year before on higher effective tax rates and interest payments.Growth continued in the first half of this year, as sales were up another 32.6% to $38.7 million as the company broke-even versus a $2.7 million profit reported in the comparable period last year.Before the offering took place the company held little over $76 million in cash and equivalents while not having any debt outstanding. Adding to this the gross proceeds of $86 million and the company will operate with a net cash position of around $150 million. This values operating assets at around $725-$750 million at the moment, the equivalent of less than 10 times forward sales and little over 100 times earnings as reported for 2013.Final TakeawayCyberArk witnessed a very successful public offering. Not only have shares been offered some 14.3% above the midpoint of the preliminary offering range, they witnessed a big jump on their opening day as well. Consequently shares are now trading at levels more than double the midpoint of the preliminary offering range.The reason for the enthusiasm is simple. CyberArk focuses on the hot market for security solutions which aim to prevent cyber attacks from becoming effective. At the same time it grows rapidly and is even profitable as well. For the latest quarter, the company posted sales of $21.3 million which values the company at less than 9 times annual revenues going forwards on an annualized basis. The company posted a tiny profit of $1.2 million in the period.Of course the valuation is not sustainable on the current metrics, but relies largely on further growth as the company operates with a rock-solid balance sheet following the offering at the moment. As such the biggest risk is probably not the current business model, but rather the pace and duration of anticipated extra-ordinary growth.Growth might be impacted by the quality of its offerings, a general shift in the technology and security landscape, further competition, reliance on channel partners and the fact that the business is headquartered in Israel, a sensitive issue given the geopolitical situation.Obviously the growth and profitability are key strengths, combined with the continued growth in the cyber security market. That being said, the 30% current revenue growth is not that impressive in my eyes given the tailwinds in the industry amidst the very high valuation multiples. On the other hand, gross margins of nearly 83%, as reported for the first half of this year, allow for potentially very fat margins which could be appealing, also as the business is already profitable.Yet, the valuation based on the current performance is still rather high in my eyes, as much relies on future growth. Consequently, the risk-reward at current levels is not really appealing after shares have doubled from the midpoint of the initial guided range. For now, I remain on the sidelines, keeping an eye on the performance of the business going forwards, not being interested in the shares at current levels at this point in time."
2937096,24849,2015-02-20T18:52:11-05:00,Cybersecurity software has become a red hot space.Stock has soared from $16 IPO.Lockup expiration could tremendously increase float.Valuation needs to be justified by substantial future growth.,"In recent months, there has been a lot of discussion about cybersecurity. Hack attacks involving retail firms, government agencies and other businesses have many on edge. Companies that deal in security have seen their stocks soar lately. One of those names is CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR), which has skyrocketed in recent days and weeks. Unfortunately for investors, it seems as if a bubble is forming in this name, and today, I'll detail why that can be dangerous.The upcoming lockup expiration:CyberArk started trading in September 2014 with almost 30 million shares outstanding. However, the float was much less, and currently stands at less than 13 million shares according to Yahoo. Having a low float for a newly trading stock is not uncommon, and it is one reason why I think shares have soared recently. Unfortunately for current investors, that float may be about to soar. The following statements taken from an SEC prospectus filing are with regard to a late March lockup expiration:When the company announced quarterly results recently, the company stated that the fully-diluted share count for EPS purposes was almost 34.7 million in Q4 2014, and 2015 guidance implies that the number will top 35 million this year. There is a lot of room for the float to increase in the coming months and years.Now, it is likely that some of those holders of the 23 million shares will hold on to them after the lockup expires. However, one must wonder if even a few million shares will be sold. Remember, this name had an IPO price of $16 and is now in the low $70s. That's a substantial jump in such a short time period. The float could rise tremendously in the next couple of months, which could really hurt the stock. It is even possible that some kind of offering is announced, which may help these insiders to get out. We've seen this with other names as lockup expirations come.An extreme valuation:One of the items that really worries me about the name, and most of its peers, is that the valuation is extremely high. Yes, some of these names are expected to show a lot of growth, but you are paying ridiculous valuations for them. In CyberArk's case, the company had a huge Q4 beat, and analysts are currently at the high end of the company's revenue range for 2015.In the chart I'll show in a moment, I've detailed price-to-sales valuations for a number of names based on trailing twelve-month sales. I selected nearly 20 companies for this chart, taken from the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF (NYSEARCA:HACK), including the following: FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), Infoblox (NYSE:BLOX), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), AVG Technologies (NYSE:AVG), Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT), Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS), Science Applications International (NYSE:SAIC), Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP), Barracuda Networks (NYSE:CUDA), Symantec (SYMC), VASCO Data Security (VDSI), KEYW Holding (NASDAQ:KEYW), and Imperva (NASDAQ:IMPV).After Friday's rally, CyberArk now trades for more than 20 times its trailing twelve-month sales. Of the 17 other names above, the mean value is 7.86 and the median is 7.27. Those numbers may be slightly inflated as well, thanks to a couple of these names not reporting earnings yet. CyberArk trades at the extreme high end of this range.This is why I'm worried about the stock in the short term, because it requires explosive growth just to maintain a high price-to-sales figure. In the table below, I showed how this P/S figure can be projected in the future. Over the top, I've used a share count (in millions), and the left side shows trailing twelve-month sales, the 2015 and 2016 current analyst estimates, and even the $200 million mark, well above the $164 million analysts are expecting next year.So even if the company were to achieve revenues of $200 million next year, CyberArk would be still trading at more than 10.5 times sales if the outstanding share count is 30 million. If that figure goes up to 32 million, you are over 11.25 times. This $200 million number would require the company to blowout results over the next couple of years, and if that doesn't happen, this table shows how the price-to-sales value could still be substantial. Are you willing to pay 14 or 17 times sales when the sector may not even be going for 10?We've seen this story before:A lot of times, companies that go public see huge first-day gains and perhaps rallies that can last for weeks or months. Unfortunately, some of these tremendous gains don't last, and after a while, these names come crashing back to earth. Just in the last couple of years, we've seen some of the above-mentioned names, as well as other tech names, show big rallies and then fall apart. In the table below, I've shown some key statistics on these stocks, and I've included Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) as other recent cases. The IPO Day change is the gain shown on the first day of trading, the IPO High category is from the IPO price to the high point, and the last column is from the high point to Friday's close.The table doesn't even tell the whole story as Twitter fell below $30 before recovering and Barracuda fell into the mid $20s before rebounding. The stories all seem to be the same though, with a big rise followed by a tremendous fall. CyberArk is the next name that could see a dramatic drop. The average fall of the High-Current category above is nearly 39% when taking out CyberArk, and it would be even greater than that if you were to adjust Twitter and Barracuda. A fall of even 30% would make CyberArk a $49 stock, and that value is above both the mean and median price targets on the Street currently.Final thoughts:This frenzy over cybersecurity has sent a number of names shooting higher, and CyberArk Software is certainly one of them. The stock is up nearly 90% in the past two weeks, pushing the valuation into the extreme category. This stock had an IPO price of $16 and closed Friday at more than $70. In about a month, there will be a lockup expiration, which could substantially increase the float. As you can see from the chart below, this stock has gone straight up recently. A number of similar names and other tech favorites saw this kind of treatment after their IPOs, but a crash eventually came. At this point, it looks like CyberArk could be the next one to see its bubble burst. I believe it is just a matter of when, not if, it will happen.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)"

But adjusted net income was down -10%.To put the conclusions and observations in context, the following is reorganized, edited and summarized from the full S-1 referenced above.BusinessCYBR is a global leader and pioneer of a new layer of IT security solutions that protects organizations from cyber attacks that have made their way inside the network perimeter to strike at the heart of the enterprise.Market growthAccording to a 2012 report by International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide spending on datacenter security solutions was $10.7 billion in 2011 and is expected to grow to $16.5 billion by 2016, representing a compound annual growth rate of 9.3%.According to the same report, worldwide spending for IT security solutions was $28.4 billion in 2011 and is expected to grow to $40.8 billion in 2016, representing a compound annual growth rate of 7.6%Software solutionsCYBR's software solution is focused on protecting privileged accounts, which have become a critical target in the lifecycle of today's cyber attacks. Privileged accounts are pervasive and act as the ""keys to the IT kingdom,"" providing complete access to, and control of, all parts of IT infrastructure, industrial control systems and critical business data. In the hands of an external attacker or malicious insider, privileged accounts allow attackers to take control of and disrupt an organization's IT and industrial control infrastructures, steal confidential information and commit financial fraud.CYBR's comprehensive solution proactively protects privileged accounts, monitors privileged activity and detects malicious privileged behavior.CYBR's customers use its innovative solution to introduce this new security layer to protect against, detect and respond to cyber attacks before they strike vital systems and compromise sensitive data.Organizations worldwide are experiencing an unprecedented increase in the sophistication, scale and frequency of cyber attacks.The challenge this presents is intensified by the growing adoption of new technologies, such as cloud computing, virtualization, software-defined networking, enterprise mobility and social networking, which has resulted in increasingly complex and distributed IT environments with significantly larger attack surfaces.Organizations have historically relied upon perimeter-based threat protection solutions such as network, web and endpoint security tools as the predominant defense against cyber attacks, yet these traditional solutions have a limited ability to stop today's advanced threats.As a result, an estimated 90% of organizations have suffered a cybersecurity breach according to a 2011 survey of approximately 580 U.S. IT practitioners by the Ponemon Institute, a research center focused on privacy, data protection and information security policy.Organizations are just beginning to adapt their security strategies to address this new threat environment and are evolving their approaches based on the assumption that their network perimeter has been or will be breached.They are therefore increasingly implementing new layers of security inside the network to disrupt attacks before they result in the theft of confidential information or other serious damage. Regulators are also continuing to mandate rigorous new compliance standards and audit requirements in response to this evolving threat landscape.CYBR believes that the implementation of a privileged account security solution is one of the most critical layers of an effective security strategy.Privileged accounts represent one of the most vulnerable aspects of an organization's IT infrastructure. Privileged accounts are used by system administrators, third-party and cloud service providers, applications and business users, and they exist in nearly every connected device, server, hypervisor, operating system, database, application and industrial control system. Due to the broad access and control they provide, exploiting privileged accounts has become a critical stage of the cyber attack lifecycle.The typical cyber attack involves an attacker effecting an initial breach, escalating privileges to access target systems, moving laterally through the IT infrastructure to identify valuable targets, and exfiltrating, or stealing, the desired information.According to Mandiant, credentials of authorized users were hijacked in 100% of the breaches that Mandiant investigated, and privileged accounts were targeted whenever possible.Intellectual propertyAs of April 30, 2014, CYBR had two issued patents and ten provisional or pending patent applications in the United States. CYBR also had one patent issued and seven applications pending for examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and two pending Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications, all of which are counterparts of its U.S. patent applications.The claims for which CYBR has sought patent protection relate to several elements in CYBR's technology, including the Discovery Engine within its Privileged Account Security Solution, Digital Vault, Privileged Session Manager, Application Identity Manager and Privileged Threat Analytics.CompetitionCYBR believes that none of its competitors offer a fully comprehensive and integrated privileged account security solution; however, CYBR does compete with companies that offer a broad array of IT security products.CYBR's current and potential future competitors include CA, Inc., Dell Inc., International Business Machines Corporation and Oracle Corporation, in the access and identity management market, as well as providers of advanced threat protection solutions such as Hewlett-Packard Company, EMC Corporation, International Business Machines Corporation, FireEye, Inc., Splunk Inc. and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. and other smaller companies that offer products with a more limited range of functionality than CYBR's own offerings.5% shareholders pre-IPOEntities affiliated with Jerusalem Venture Partners 46.6%Entities affiliated with The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. 24.1%Entities affiliated with Vertex Venture Capital 11.6%Cabaret Security Ltd. 7.7%Dividend PolicyNo dividends are planned.Use of proceedsCYBR intends to use the $66 million in proceeds from its IPO as follows:hiring additional sales and marketing and research and development personnel.CYBR may also use net proceeds from this offering to make acquisitions or investments in complementary companies or technologies, although CYBR does not have any agreement or understanding with respect to any such acquisition or investment at this time.CYBR does not currently have specific plans or commitments with respect to the net proceeds from this offering and, accordingly, are unable to quantify the allocation of such proceeds among the various potential uses.Disclaimer: This CYBR IPO report is based on a reading and analysis of CYBR's S-1 filing, which can be found here, and a separate, independent analysis by IPOdesktop.com.

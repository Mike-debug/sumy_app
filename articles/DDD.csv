The company is facing a growing number of challenges, from shaky financials to sluggish growth. The coronavirus has only exacerbated the problems facing 3D Systems and is putting far more pressure on the company.3D Systems reported underwhelming Q1 results. The company missed expectations both on the EPS and revenue front with a GAAP EPS of -$0.17 and a revenue of $134.7 million. If 3D Systems underwhelms again in its Q2 earnings, which is coming up in a matter of days, the company will lose even more influence in the industry.3D Systems has been severely impacted by COVID-19. The company has not experienced any significant recovery over the past few months unlike the rest of the market.Data by YCharts3D Systems has long established itself as a leader and innovator in the 3D printing industry. However, the company is rapidly losing its grip on the fast-growing 3D printing industry. 3D Systems has consistently reported negative earnings over the past few years despite the promise of 3D printing.Profitability continues to be an issue for 3D Systems despite all the changes made to address this issue. To make matters worse, 3D Systems is not growing at a breakneck pace like it was in years past. In fact, the company has even experienced negative Y/Y quarterly revenue growth in recent years. Whereas a lack of profitability could be excused in a high-growth situation, it is highly problematic in a stagnating company.3D Systems' Q1 revenue declined 11.4% Y/Y. While this revenue decline can in part be attributed to coronavirus-related disruptions, 3D Systems has experienced negative quarterly growth for years now. With COVID-19 continuing to rage on with no clear end in sight, 3D Systems will likely experience growth issues for the foreseeable future.After a period of explosive growth from 2010 to 2014, 3D Systems has clearly stagnated. The graphs below measure the company's revenues (billions) over time.Source: Macrotrends3D Systems' continual management changes also reflect the company's growing struggles. In fact, the company just recently appointed a new CFO after CFO Todd Booth resigned less than a year after being hired. This CFO change comes shortly after the company just hired a new CEO. Such an unpredictable and volatile management structure is certainly not a sign of a healthy company.The coronavirus is only making matters worse for 3D Systems. The company's printers and on-demand manufacturing businesses have been notably impacted by COVID-19. Decreased demand in important markets like dental and supply chain disruptions in countries like China have taken its toll on 3D Systems.COVID-19 is also likely to significantly impact the company's Q2 results. Given how unpredictable the coronavirus has been, there is no telling how much damage the pandemic will do to 3D Systems over the long term. On the positive side, COVID-19 has allowed 3D Systems to demonstrate the unique capabilities of additive manufacturing technologies.The company has been able to leverage its additive manufacturing technology to rapidly manufacture personal protective equipment for frontline healthcare workers. This crisis has helped showcase the incredibly rapid and flexible nature of additive manufacturing compared to traditional manufacturing. Moreover, the pandemic also shows how vulnerable the global manufacturing supply chain is.Despite the lackluster performance of industry leaders like 3D Systems and Stratasys (SSYS), 3D printing as a whole is expected to grow at a rapid rate. According to Statista, the 3D printing industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 26.4% from 2020 to 2024. The entire market is expected to be greater than $40 billion by 2024, which will undoubtedly attract far larger competitors.Large companies like Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) are already starting to invest in 3D printing. Siemens launched its Additive Manufacturing Network last year and is looking to make a large impact in the 3D printing industry. A company like Siemens has far more resources than 3D Systems and could easily outcompete smaller players.If the 3D printing market continues to grow at its current pace, it will almost certainly attract more companies like Siemens. At best, 3D Systems will either help lead the industry or be acquired at a premium by a larger company. At worst, 3D Systems will be pushed out of the market entirely. If 3D Systems is not able to turn things around, the company could very easily find itself in the latter situation.As the 3D printing market grows, more established companies could end up dominating the industry.Source: Siemens3D printing is an incredibly promising market. However, it is uncertain which companies will eventually lead the industry. 3D Systems does not appear like it will be a 3D printing standout if current trends continue. The company consistently reports negative earnings and sluggish growth despite the fact that 3D printing is growing at a rapid rate.Investors should be wary of 3D Systems at its current valuation $814 million. It is hard to imagine how 3D Systems will be able to compete in this promising industry when the company is still struggling on the profitability and growth fronts. It is unlikely that 3D Systems will be a long-term winner in the industry."

Interestingly enough, we can see that the shares trade at the 1995 level. With 3D printing emerging as an innovative solution to rethink supply chains around the world, by providing its users with flexibility and resilience, let's figure out if there is any value left to be uncovered for investors looking to get exposure to this growing industry.Source: MorningstarIn 1986, Chuck Hall patented a stereolithography device which is an early form of 3D printing technology. Following his invention, he decided to create 3D Systems in order to monetize his invention. The company, currently, provides 3D printing solutions to manufacture locally produced complex parts, with the benefit of eliminating expensive tooling and reducing the time to market. Industries such as healthcare, dental, aerospace, automotive, and durable goods benefit today from this technology. 3D Systems derives its revenue from the sale of 3D printers and materials (61% of 2019's revenue) and from the sale of software and maintenance services (39% respectively). Geographically speaking, the firm markets its products throughout the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. Despite the fact that 3D Systems serves a multitude of clients around the globe, it is worth noting that the company generated 11% of its 2019 revenue from a single client, as stated in their 2019 annual report.3D Systems had its fair share of growth in previous years. Between 2010 and 2019, the revenue almost quadrupled from $160M to $612M. With the company increasing revenue as high as 55% annually at the beginning of the last decade, the firm was a growth story and was priced accordingly. The chart below shows the wild valuation ride this company had in past years.Source: macrotrends.netHowever, as it happens too often with many growth stories, the situation turns ugly when the growth slows down. The chart below provides an interesting comparison showing how the decrease in the gross margin's growth rate affected the stock price.Source: author's computation based on each year's 10-K report (share price at year-end).And the growth did slow down. With product sales declining considerably in 2019, the COVID-19 crisis has just accentuated the company's troubles. Before the pandemic, management has attributed the decrease to a ""slowdown in manufacturing activity"", while stating during the Q1 2020 earnings call that the company expects its sales to be severely affected by its costumers' CAPEX decrease. With Q1 2020 revenue down already 11% compared to the same period last year, it paints a bleak picture of the company's Q2 results (which are released on August 5, 2020). Besides the potential near-term favorable outlook provided by the reopening of the economy, I do not see any clear long-term catalyst which would increase the company's value and drive additional growth (with the biggest threat being competition from bigger players, which is discussed in Industry Outlook).Source: DDD 10-K for 2019. It shows the slowdown in product revenue that already started pre-COVID-19.Regarding the main operating expenses which are expressed in the table below, the company is in line with the industry average for both R&D and SG&A expenses. However, I personally find 40.4% SG&A expenses to be high from a fundamental perspective, regardless of the industry's average. If we put it in perspective over the past 10 years, SG&A expenses have increased from 27% of revenue in 2010 to 40% in 2019. With the company spending more since 2014 and providing limited revenue growth, I am very cautious about the effectiveness of the strategy in place.Source: author's computations based on data sourced from seekingalpha.comPerhaps the main red flag regarding 3D Systems' business model is, in my opinion, the continuously unprofitable quarters the company has been experiencing. With 20 consecutive quarters of negative earnings up until this day (interrupted only once in Dec. 2016), the firm's profitability has deteriorated from a period of continuous positive earnings from September 2009 until March 2015.Despite the firm's lagging growth rate, the 3D printing industry has been growing and is expected to continue to do so at an astonishing pace. In a study published by Deloitte in December 2018, the annual revenues' growth of 3D printing companies has been forecasted to be in the double digits. While the recent pandemic temporarily slashed demand for 3D printers, as companies slowed down production, the long-term outlook created by the pandemic could turn out to be beneficial for this industry in the long run. In another recent analysis published by Deloitte, the dependency on a globalized supply chain model which depends mainly on China is questioned. One of the solutions to rethink the supply chain of tomorrow is 3D printing, as it provides companies with much more flexibility and independence.Source: Deloitte USBecause of the above, the high probability of future growth in this industry appeals to investors seeking securities providing high rewards. But can we accurately pick the winner? In my opinion, this is where the situation gets tricky with companies providing 3D printing solutions. Larger companies such as HP (NYSE:HPQ), Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), or GE (NYSE:GE) have recently or are expected to challenge the existing 3D Systems' market (you can read more on this EY report on page 10). That being said, smaller companies such as 3D Systems or Stratasys would have a hard time competing with companies having much larger financial resources and distribution networks.Source: hp.com. HP already provides 3D printing solutions made of plastic or metals.There are several other risk factors that should be raised. The following points present a non-exhaustive list of potential factors which I think could further negatively affect the firm's equity value:Source: altmanzscoreplus.comWhile 3D technology has plenty of room to grow in the upcoming years, the uncertainty surrounding 3D Systems' business fundamentals does not look appealing to me. With growing competition and rapidly evolving technology, the company is continuously challenged. Having been a pioneer of this technology, it failed to create a long-lasting dominant position in the industry. Moreover, the acquisitions made throughout the years have not meaningfully contributed to the value creation but rather to inflating the balance sheet with large amounts of goodwill while profitability has been decreasing, reflected by constant negative EPS. With the above being said, I consider this investment to have much more downside than upside for the time being, and for this reason, I will personally avoid it."

The company has lost ~50% over the past month alone and has performed even worse than the general market. The current economic downturn will likely continue to have a disproportionate impact on 3D Systems given the company's already precarious financial situation.3D Systems reported solid Q4 numbers and beat expectations on several important fronts. The company reported a GAAP EPS of -$0.04, beating expectations by $0.05. Unfortunately, the company's revenue of $164.57 million represents an 8.9% Y/Y decrease. However, a revenue decrease was expected and the company's revenue actually came in higher than expected. While 3D Systems performed well enough during the quarter, the company is facing huge obstacles.3D Systems' stock has plummeted over the past few weeks as a result of the global pandemic.Data by YChartsSource: YChartsThe current global pandemic is putting an incredible strain on 3D Systems. 3D Systems was not in the best financial situation even prior to the pandemic. The company has around $133.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, which could be problematic in the current rough macroeconomic environment. As a point of comparison, Stratasys (SSYS) currently has around $321.8 million in cash and cash equivalents.On the bright note, 3D Systems generated $21.5 million from operations in Q4. However, 3D Systems will almost certainly have an increasingly hard time generating cash in the current economic environment. 3D Systems' declining revenues could also present problems as investors start to lose even more faith in the company. Stagnation in a growth industry is clearly not a good sign for a smaller company like 3D Systems.3D Systems is experiencing a period of prolonged stagnation after years of explosive growth.Source: Macrotrends3D Systems, along with main competitors Stratasys, was seemingly poised to dominate the 3D printing industry. Unfortunately, 3D Systems has been on a clear downward trajectory since the 3D printing bubble burst in 2014. Not only has 3D Systems underperformed on several fronts over the past few years, but the company is also facing far more competition.Stratasys appears to be in a better position to weather the economic downturn given its cash reserves. To make matters worse, Stratasys may not even pose the largest threat to 3D Systems in the long run. 3D Systems may face far more competition from larger companies like HP (HPQ) and Xerox (XRX), which have started entering the additive manufacturing space.These larger companies have far more resources to invest in 3D printing and could more easily weather periods of economic distress. HP is currently even using its 3D printing resources to provide critical medical supplies to help with coronavirus relief.If 3D Systems is not able to show consistent growth in the near term, which will be harder than ever in the current environment, investor sentiment will sour even further on this company. The ramping competition from the likes of HP will only make growth more difficult for 3D Systems.3D Systems is facing far more competition as larger companies like Xerox are entering the 3D printing space. Source: Xerox3D Systems has done a good job of improving its cost structure and cash generation. After years of hype and endless acquisitions, 3D Systems began focusing on operational efficiency. However, these efforts could prove insignificant if the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent economic downturn lasts far longer than expected.If demand slows down for a prolonged period of time, 3D Systems will have an increasingly hard time generating cash and keeping its business afloat. The company's major competitors like Stratasys are better positioned to deal with the current economic crisis and could take more market share from 3D Systems. It is hard to see any upside for 3D Systems in the near-term future.While 3D printing and additive manufacturing are extremely promising technologies, such technologies may still not be ready for the mainstream. 3D printing and additive manufacturing have found formal usefulness in more industrial settings like manufacturing and prototyping. While 3D Systems has adapted to this reality, the company is still struggling to grow.3D Systems is facing far too much economic uncertainty in the current environment. The company is still too risky to buy even after its valuation has been cut by half over the past few weeks. Investors should still stay away from 3D Systems at its current market capitalization of $700 million. Despite 3D Systems' stagnant growth and a highly uncertain macroeconomic environment, the company still boasts a forward P/E ratio of 90. Investors should wait and see how the current economic crisis plays out before seriously considering 3D Systems."

The company has seen its stock prices tumble after its peak in 2014 and has not recovered since. Bad news continues to pile up for 3D Systems as CEO and President Vyomesh Joshi recently announced plans to retire.After years of employee turnover, news of a high-level upcoming leadership change should worry investors. Despite such worrying trends, there are signs that 3D Systems could be headed towards an upward trajectory. 3D Systems is starting to make positive strides on the cost structure front and is now running a more efficient business. As 3D printing and additive manufacturing technology continues to mature, 3D Systems will be in a great position to benefit.Since 3D Systems' stock collapse in 2014, the company has made efforts to become a more efficient organization. The company continues to focus on cost structure by leaning out its organization and reducing headcount. This has enabled 3D Systems to improve operational efficiency and cost of sales, which will be essential in pushing the company towards profitable growth.In Q3, the company reduced its inventory by $11.2 million and generated $6.5 million from operations. The company also reduced its total non-GAAP operating expenses by nearly 10% in the first nine months. 3D Systems has also managed to cut its SG&A and R&D by 6% and 11% respectively during the same time. If 3D Systems continues to improve its cost structure, the company could experience sustained profitability.Despite 3D Systems' improving cost structure, the company is still having trouble growing its top-line. The company's Q3 GAAP revenue of $155.3 million actually represents a 5.6% Y/Y decrease. This trend of stagnating and even declining revenues is certainly troubling. However, 3D Systems is growing in specific promising segments like materials (+3% Y/Y) and healthcare (+6% Y/Y).While 3D Systems overall quarterly revenue declined Y/Y, the company is making gains in promising segments like healthcare.Source: 3D SystemsAs 3D Systems puts more emphasis on promising growth markets and steers away from less productive segments, the company has a solid growth path ahead. Healthcare, in particular, has been a bright spot for the company. 3D Systems grew its healthcare segment by 15% in Q3 excluding the large enterprise customer. In fact, the company grew every part of its healthcare business in Q3, including advanced medical manufacturing and simulators.3D Systems is also making impressive gains on its innovative Figure 4 platform. The company has introduced eight new Figure 4 platform materials and is planning to scale its industrial Figure 4 platform. This innovative platform and the new materials that come with it should further help push growth moving forward.The innovative Figure 4 platform could be a significant growth engine moving forward.Source: 3D SystemsWhile the consumer 3D printing sector has dramatically underperformed in recent years, the industrial and manufacturing 3D segments are gaining steam. 3D Systems has acknowledged this fact and is now attempting to grow its presence in the industrial and manufacturing sectors.Rather than chasing the overhyped home consumer 3D printing market, 3D Systems is being more pragmatic by increasing its focus on more proven 3D printing production markets. The days of endless acquisitions in an attempt to meet 3D printing hype appears to be winding down. This could lead to more sustainable growth over the long-term.3D Systems is no longer the dominant force that it once was. Back in 2014, 3D Systems and its rival Stratasys (SSYS) appeared set to take over the 3D printing industry. Both these 3D printing pioneers have since experienced precipitous price declines. To make matters worse, 3D Systems now has to contend with larger and better equipped 3D printing entrants like HP (HP). Such large competitors could easily take market share away from 3D Systems.Large companies like HP are starting to make major inroads in the 3D printing industry. Many of their products are starting to rival those of pioneers like 3D Systems.Source: HPWhile it appears increasingly unlikely that 3D Systems will dominate the industry over the long-term, the company could still obtain a major foothold in several promising 3D printing markets. The 3D printing industry is growing fast enough to accommodate smaller companies like 3D Systems. After years of general industry underperformance, investors now appear to be underestimating 3D printing's long-term growth potential.The hype surrounding consumer 3D printing has rightfully died down. However, 3D printing's potential on the industrial and manufacturing side is brighter than ever. 3D Systems is well aware of this fact and has made positive strides in capturing market share in these sectors. While 3D Systems may never become the 3D printing powerhouse that many thought it would become, the company still has a lot to offer.Investors should still be wary of 3D Systems at its current market capitalization of $1.4 billion. While 3D Systems is improving its cost structure and becoming a more efficient organization, the company is still experiencing stagnating revenues. In a fast-growing industry like 3D printing, hyperfocus on costs rather than growth is not exactly a great sign. If 3D Systems proves it can achieve profitable growth, the company could witness turnaround. For now, however, it would be wise to stay neutral on this company."
4291977,103187,2019-09-17T05:36:00-04:00,"DDD continues to struggle with revenue growth.The company revealed headwinds are on the forefront in the Q2 earnings call and Q3 is historically soft due to seasonality.Despite the impressive history of 3D Systems, this is one to avoid.","The incredible story of 3D Systems (DDD) is really the story of the beginning of an entire industry. You see it was Chuck Hull, the co-founder and CTO of DDD, who invented Stereolithography and printed the world's first-ever 3D printed part in 1983, changing the world forever.From Industry WeekToday, 3D printing is commonplace, used in everything from automobile manufacturing to space exploration. The technology even save lives by allowing for miracle inventions like 3D printed heart valves. Mr. Hull's invention changed the world and his company 3D Systems lives on today, although the landscape they operate in is much different than it once was.These days 3D Systems uses not just stereolithography technology, but also more recently developed selective laser sintering, direct metal printing, multijet printing, and colorjet printing. DDD sells this tech in a host of printing systems as well as through a 'turnkey' solution that includes software and proprietary materials, allowing for more recurring revenue.3D Systems stock appreciated enormously between 2010-14 as the company had spent years developing intellectual property through a combination of research and development and acquisitions which left them an industry leader during a boom era for 3D printers. However after 2014, expiring patents, increasing competition and a falling out of love with the 3D printing industry by investors put pressure on 3D Systems' growth and the company turned to more, perhaps unwise, acquisitions.Since then share prices have cratered from highs of almost $100/share to around $8.50/share as DDD has struggled to reach profitability and maintain revenues. Although DDD is no longer the growing 3D player it once was (as seen below), the company is attempting to right the ship with new products, a renewed focus on operational efficiency, as well as cost and debt reduction.Unfortunately, Q2's results were not the best example of management's efforts. Although I do believe DDD's new products may increase revenues which could stem the tide of revenue loss, I fear increasing industry competition from big players like HP, Inc. (HPQ) and General Electric (GE), as well as smaller up and comers like Xometry will hurt results. Additionally, DDD announced near-term economic headwinds are expected going forward in their Q2 conference call. Given these findings I believe the stock is not worth the risk. 3D Systems is a SELL.Share prices of DDD dropped some 16% post Q2 earnings after the company turned in poor results prompting JP Morgan to turn bearish on the name and drop their price target to just $7/share.From 3D Systems' Earnings Call SlidesWith revenue down 11% in the quarter, it isn't hard to see why investors and analysts are wary of 3D Systems. Management continues to point to increases in printer unit sales, however, the decreasing revenue in every one of the company's key business units (as seen below) illustrates the issue is the company's sales mix. More higher end printers need to be sold, not only because they increase revenue, but the margins are far better for them as well. DDD's printers are priced between $5,000 to over $1 million so the sales mix going forward will be key.DDD also turned in a poor $23.9 million net loss in Q2. The company was able to decrease operating expense by 1.5% YoY this quarter, however, that included a 0.7% increase in SG&A expenses and an 8.4% decrease in R&D expenses. Since R&D is really a necessary component of DDD's business, I don't see the decrease there as a positive. Even worse if you take out that decrease, operating expenses were actually about flat YoY. And of course this means operating expenses as a percent of revenue expenses actually increased 560 basis points to 58.8% in the quarter.Perhaps the worst part of the Q2 report was the Q2 earnings call where there was a discussion of uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, which caused management to turn very conservative. Instead of focusing on growth in this supposedly growing industry, as John Mcmullen, former CFO (replaced by Todd Booth) said in the earnings call:This conservative tone was echoed by President and CEO Vyomesh Joshi in what turned out to be...The Q2 earnings call revealed a company with many issues. From operational issues like the technical delays with powder management systems to poor macroeconomic trends, it was not a strong showing in Q2.Here is President and CEO Vyomesh Joshi discussing the current headwinds coming DDD's way:It appears automotive revenues will be hit by headwinds going forward. Even worse, in the earnings call it was revealed that over the past four years, revenue has averaged down about 6% from the second quarter to third quarter due to seasonality. So I expect a tough Q3.President and CEO Vyomesh Joshi also struggled to respond to analyst Greg Palm's line of questioning regarding an Air Force contract. Here is the excerpt below:Given the fact that management has trumpeted the Air Force contracts as big wins, I would expect a little more detail about potential delays or revenue shortcomings and was disappointed by Joshi's response.Another interesting part of the earnings call was the discussion of a 30-35% reduction in revenue from a large enterprise customer in the medical segment. Management said that it was just seasonality and the customer remained a large buyer, but the seasonality has never been that extreme which gives me pause.Excluding this large enterprise customer, the medical segment grew 11% in the quarter with dental systems leading the way. DDD continues to gain significant market share with the NextDent 5100 dental printer in the medical segment. They also improved results with the Simbionix Medical simulators in Q2, which help doctors and nurses practice before having to go into the field.DDD's Figure 4 factory solutions printer, which is meant to fit in production lines has also seen solid sales. However, the company's line of metal printers including the DMP Factory 350, haven't sold as desired. Perhaps due to increasing competition in metal printing space from the likes of Stratasys (SSYS) and Proto Labs, Inc. (PRLB).Although the new printers of DDD will help buoy revenues, I fear the sales mix will continue to be an issue unless larger systems like the DMP Factory 350 start selling better. Overall Q2 was not a good one for DDD as management continues to misfire.DDD trades at over 34x fwd earnings and has an EV to EBITDA over 78x. This for a company who has seen just 1% annual revenue growth over the past three years (including acquisitions). The 3D printing industry is not what it once was due to increasing competition and economic headwinds and that should severely discount DDD's value. The company does trade at a better valuation in terms of revenue vs. its peers after being beaten down post Q2.Still, I don't believe DDD is a good investment given the growth issues and poor profitability metrics.Despite an impressive history of invention and industry dominance, DDD is no longer what it once was. Management has continued to disappoint (CEO is now in the third year) on both the top line and bottom line growth estimates. The conservative cost-cutting approach seen in Q2 clearly doesn't warrant a 34x fwd earnings valuation. Furthermore, the 3D printing industry has changed with ever-increasing competition from both large and small players. Economic uncertainty has also led to a global manufacturing slowdown which will hurt business going forward.Despite new products and a solid showing from the medical segment of the business, DDD is a Sell. The company doesn't offer attractive growth, or profitability and certainly there are growing risks involved going into the later stages of the economic cycle. DDD may very well continue to rise off its historically low share prices, but as far as a long-term investor is concerned, this is one to avoid in my view."

(DDD) has come a long way down due to slow growth. However, the company is focused on achieving profitability despite this slowdown. Recent results are encouraging, and 2020 will be an inflection point for the company when the results of 5 years of new leadership could finally materialize and put 3D Systems in investors’ crosshairs once again.3D Systems was one of the first companies to enter the 3D printing industry. Founded in 1986, the company operates in the business of 3D printing at an enterprise-level, providing materials as well as services and software to its clients. 3D’s clients are mainly in medical, dental, automotive, aerospace, durable goods, government, defense, technology, jewelry, electronics, education, consumer goods, energy, and other industries.3D’s stock peaked back in 2014, reaching around $95. Since then, the company has come (down) a long way. 2015 was an inflection point with the company officially exiting the 3D “retail” segment and posting a ~$500 million net loss due to goodwill.As of writing this article, the stock sits at $8.77, quite close to its historical low. Indeed, 3D has fallen out of favor in the eyes of investors and it is no surprise once we look at both the state of the industry and the company.In this section, we will cover the main pain points that 3D is having to deal with. These will serve to justify the decline in the stock price and will allow us to understand if and how the company can turn things around.Source: SA3D was in its time producing staggering growth rates, and investors expected the company to be able to sustain this. If we look at the 10-year CAGR, 3D has achieved revenue growth close to that of Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). But if we zoom into the last 5 years, the story is completely different, with 3D struggling to maintain its revenue. How could this change so quickly?The truth of the matter is, 3D was only able to maintain its high growth rates thanks to numerous acquisitions. According to Crunchbase, in its history, 3D has acquired 29 companies, the last one being NexDent in 2017. That’s a staggering number and should have been an early sign that the growth of the company was not “organic” but rather bought.In terms of valuation, 3D was also a victim of the over-hype of both experts and investors regarding the size and growth of the 3D industry. Both the company and investors believed at one point that 3D printers would become commonplace in American households. However, as mentioned above, 3D discontinued this segment to focus on enterprise services. It is clear now that 3D printing is incredibly useful for the production of particular and specialized gear, like in the medical sector, but does not have many uses at the individual consumer level.Source: SAThe other issue hanging over 3D Systems' head is that of profitability or rather lack thereof. The company has not managed to turn a profit since the share price plummeted in 2014. Operating income has been negative every year, and while the company knows this, it hasn’t been able to rein in expenses in a significant way to increase its gross margin. SG&A and costs of services have remained quite flat in terms of % of revenue.The company has a lot of work to do to regain anything close to its prior valuation. To this extent, I feel there are some reasons to be somewhat optimistic in this regard. 2020 will be an important landmark for 3D which will determine the future of the company.New combinations of 3D printing materials, together with improvements to existing materials, will not only enable unprecedented 3D printing applications but will also help reduce prices. We will see an emphasis on metals that is likely to grow over the next three years. Advancements in printing technologies and capabilities also will spur the development of new equipment and applications, like 3D-printed electronics.Years ago, the possibilities of 3D technology were overstated, which led to a bubble in the 3D space. Today, however, the opposite is true. The sector is now mature and every day new applications are being discovered.In 2014, Vyomesh Joshi took over as CEO of the company. Since then, the company has been focusing on its cost structure and cash-flow generation. 3D has managed to reduce its costs at the same level as revenue but has not achieved any significant increases in profitability. However, Joshi, in the last earnings call, points out an 8% reduction in operating expenses in the first 9 months of 2019.Overall, the company is becoming leaner, with regular divestitures and cost reductions going on, and more emphasis being put on profitability rather than growth. Having said this, it is likely growth could take a turn for the better.While overall revenues have decreased to the tune of 8%, certain breakdowns of revenue paint a more encouraging picture.Source: 10-QAs we can see, the company managed to achieve quarterly growth in its Materials segment. If we were to break the revenue down by sector, Healthcare and Simulations services grew by 6%. Furthermore, there is overall growth in certain regions such as EMEA, which has grown near 10% in the last nine months.In general, while 3D printing services will not become as mainstream as it was once thought, there is certainly a niche market for the services and products 3D Systems offers. According to research by United Parcels Service Inc. (UPS), the 3D printing market will grow at a CAGR of almost 30% until 2024. The projected size of the market for 2020 is of $21 billionSource: UPS ReportThis growth in the market will be made possible as 3D printing moves into the consumer electronics market. The UPS report cites smartphones as the next landmark for 3D printing. 3D printing currently represents 0.04% of the global manufacturing market, with prototyping as the leading use today.According to sources from the UPS report, 3D printing could eventually capture 5% of the global manufacturing capacity, which would make 3D printing a $640 billion industry.Moving forward, the company will have to deal with increased competition. As the 3D market becomes larger and more profitable, new companies will spring up. To this extent, it's important that 3D Systems leverages its current position to stay ahead of the curve. In order to do this, they must continue to invest in R&D so that their technology doesn't become obsolete. New competition will most likely come from overseas. It will be hard for 3D to compete in terms of costs, so the company will have to focus on giving extra value through better technology and service.While the company is performing poorly at the moment, fundamentals for the industry and the business look good. The last quarterly results have shown a slight turnaround and, according to management, 2020 should bring the first positive quarterly earnings. This can be achieved if SG&A can be reduced to around 30% of revenues. This would be more in line with the industry average and competitors such as Proto Labs, Inc (PRLB).However, my rating, for now, is neutral, but I will keep a close look at the next reports, looking for confirmation that DDD can turn things around in a significant way. Once profitability is achieved, it is just a matter of time before the share price recovers. While it would be hard to calculate a target price based on P/E, I would say the stock could easily triple if the company manages to break even."

        Trade wars could drive more 3D Printer sales as countries and companies look for ways to offset higher prices.
        Growth across most verticals should sustainably continue into the future.
        3D Printer sales look ready to take off over the next year.","source: 3D PrintThere's a lot of things to like about the latest earnings results reported by 3D Systems Corp. (DDD). While one quarter doesn't prove the company has turned the corner, most of its verticals indicate sustainable growth is in its future.Even though the share price soared after the company beat, I see a lot more growth in its future as its 3D printer unit is gaining traction and with the exception of its software unit, which was flat, its other market segments enjoyed growth.And in the case of software, with the significant boost in 3D printer sales, software sales will without a doubt increase as well in the quarters ahead.With the overall sector starting to understand what will drive market growth going forward, 3D Systems is poised to enjoy the increasing clarity and visibility, as it develops products and services that have long-term growth potential.Revenue in the second quarter of 2018 was $176.6 million, up 11 percent from the $159.5 million in the second quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP earnings per share in the quarter was $0.06, beating estimates by $0.05.On a GAAP basis gross profit margin dropped from 50.6 percent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.8 percent in the latest reporting period. The decline was attributed to investment in on-demand manufacturing and services, along with mix of sales.Non-GAAP SG&A expenses jumped to $56.5 million, up 22 percent. Non-GAAP R&D expenses dropped to $22.5 million, down 8 percent year-over-year.The company generated $10.7 million in cash from operations and closed out the quarter with $119.3 million in cash on hand.The most positive surprise in the quarter in regard to sales was the performance of the company's 3D printer unit. The company generated $39.2 million in revenue, up 41 percent from the same reporting period of 2017. The number of units sold climbed by 37 percent.I believe it will continue to outperform in its printing unit, but the company did reiterate that printer sales have the probability of fluctuating because of the variety of products it will launch throughout the year at a ""very wide range of prices.""In its healthcare unit revenue finished the quarter at $61.4 million, up 26 percent. All of that was organic growth. This unit will without question continue to experience consistent future growth.Healthcare as of the last reporting period accounted for 35 percent of the company's revenue. The tools used in healthcare demand precise specifications and the U.S. government is committed to spending an enormous amount on the sector; this will continue to drive growth in this unit for 3D Systems.This is valuable to know because it provides a predictable and sustainable revenue stream that will offset some of the volatility associated with other units of the company.Revenue from materials was $45 million in the quarter, a modest increase of 3 percent. An increase in sales is important because printed materials include wide margins. That will be further enhanced by the introduction of new products in the latter part of 2018, according to the company.Sales from on-demand part manufacturing increased to $27.4 million, a gain of 6 percent. According to the company, investments “helped drive improvements in our on-demand manufacturing business that will drive continued growth over the longer term.”Software sales were flat at $24.1 million. I believe with the increase in 3D printer sales, an increase in software sales will follow. It'll lag printer sales, but should be a decent contributor in the quarters ahead.The most important takeaway from these segments is the company is moving ahead with a positive growth trajectory. That momentum will continue.In the manufacturing sector, 3D printing is becoming an increasingly important part of the business. Combining 3D printing with precision molding and machining empowers manufacturers to accurately and efficiently produce many complex metal parts.To that end, 3D Systems entered into a partnership with Georg Fischer Machining Solutions ""to deliver a combined solution featuring both additive and subtractive manufacturing technologies.""For 3D Systems it'll provide the opportunity to expand its global footprint.Beyond the obvious benefits from increased sales, a larger network and more marketing opportunities, I see this as also playing into the growing concerns about trading inequities that have led to trade wars and a rising number of tariffs.Even if and when the current issues are resolved, I don't think countries and companies around the world are going to look at international trade in the same way any longer. This will likely result in taking defensive measures to counter potential fallout from future trading issues that could lead to tariffs, which result in many cases with higher commodity and material prices. In some industries having 3D printers on hand could help mitigate exposure to trade wars and potentially devastating price effects. In the shorter term this would probably be more beneficial to mature economies because of existing reliance on emerging markets to supply low-cost materials. If companies are able to produce many of their needed parts or tools internally, it would shrink dependence on imports. I don't see this happening rapidly, but I do think that this will become a significant part of the 3D printing industry in the years ahead, and it should be a very positive trend for 3D Systems.The company said this about the partnership:The overall impact of that as it relates to the trade wars is it will at minimum offset any increase in prices of commodities or materials, and in general, lower dependence on foreign goods.In the near term the company said this about the introduction of its first solution:The healthcare unit of 3D Systems is visible and demonstrably able to continue to increase revenue for some time to come. The potential associated with its printers hasn't been able to produce that type of success yet, but it may be getting much closer to doing so. If it's able to execute in this market segment, it's going be a giant growth catalyst going forward.The company attempted to temper expectations in the printer unit, as mentioned earlier, but I think that's only because of the release of a number of products at different price points which will take time to level off and see where they stand on a revenue basis.And as I noted earlier, increasing printer sales will inevitably boost the sales of materials as well.It appears to me that DDD is close to sustainably moving this unit much higher, based upon the quality and capability of the printers it's releasing or soon to release.One of those that have already shipped is the NextDent 5100 dental printer. The company asserts it is four times faster than anything its competitors have in the market, and in relationship to dentures, reduces the time it needs to make them by a range of 70 percent to 80 percent.Another recent addition to its printer product line it has also started shipping is its low-cost entry, the FabPro 1000. The industrial desktop 3D printer has received ""excellent feedback"" from experts and customers, according to management.Another recently released product was its Figure 4 printer, which the company says “can reduce injection molding cycle times by over 40%, provide 20% plus cost savings, and increase production rates by 30% compared to traditional manufacturing.” Management also said it “provides lower total cost of operations and faster time to part compared to similar systems.”What's most significant about the new printers concerning the performance of the company is they reportedly had little impact on results in the last quarter because of the timing of their releases.In the second half the company sees them generating incremental revenue, and in 2019, really generating “significant” revenue in 2019.It has been several years since a lot of the media-induced hype surrounding 3D printing in general several, and 3D Systems in particular, has settled down, and during that time 3D Systems has struggled to maintain growth.So even with the solid results in the second quarter, it still has to prove it has now entered into a season of consistent and sustainable growth. It's a certainty that its health division will continue to grow nicely, providing a floor on the stock price and offset some of the volatility associated with the industry.If the company can meet expected outcomes from its 3D printer unit, and continue to maintain growth in its other segments, it will surprise the market to the upside. My thought is it's very close to doing so, but the sales results from the new printers releases need to confirm it has turned the corner in that market segment, and that demand is sustainable over the next couple of years.If it is able to do so, I believe past expectations for the company will start to be realized, and its share price will take off.Last, it has been doing well internationally, with growth in Asia soaring by 38 percent year-over-year.Assuming the competitive advantage from its new products is accurately analyzed and based in reality, it should be a catalyst for new sales in a number of sectors, including automotive and the military.After its big surge in response to the positive results of the reporting period, I think the stock may take a breather and possibly remain flat until more results come in to confirm its positive outlook.If it is, I see the stock having a lot more upside over the next couple of years, even if it remains flat through the remainder of 2018. I see this as a good price point to consider taking a position before the share price starts to climb again.With that in mind, the valuation of the company where it stands at this time is close to where it should be, assuming it is able to maintain existing performance levels. But with the momentum across its various units, I see it being undervalued based upon management's guidance and the potential of each of its business segments to be able to continue to grow."
4276104,102940,2019-07-19T14:53:20-04:00,"DDD is on a turnaround mode in an industry with a bright growth outlook.If management puts it in the right direction, revenue growth will accelerate substantially and drive a big margin expansion.The risks are high, but there could be an average annual return of 24% to 40% on the investment for a 2.5 years holding period.","3D Systems Corporation's (DDD) stock has melted from mid-2014 to early 2016 and has been fairly volatile in the US$10-US$20/share price range since. It has also significantly underperformed the 3D Printing ETF (PRNT) as shown in Figure 2 below. The company operates in a presumably promising industry (3D printing), but its earnings have been pressured by weak top-line growth amid a tough competitive environment, quality issues in the past, and a lack of focus.After bringing new people on board since he joined the company and implementing a turnaround strategy, the CEO is trying to put DDD back on a profitable growth path. As a result, the stock seems to be in the kind of ""special situation"" we like, especially as it is significantly below its historical levels and seems to be quite unloved by the market - a joy for contrarian investors!Figure 1: DDD Share Price and Forward EV/EBITDAData by YChartsFigure 2: DDD vs. PRNT (3D Printing ETF)Data by YChartsThe 3D printing market is expected to grow at a 30% rate between 2017 and 2024, reaching US$35.6 billion in sales in that year, according to the Wohlers Report. This is a quite significant growth that should boost revenues and earnings of well-positioned players in the industry. This secular growth trend should benefit DDD in the coming years, in our view, should the company correct its route and start catching up with the market.The market seems extremely fragmented and competitive. The above-mentioned Wohlers Report showed in its latest edition that there are 177 manufacturers versus 135 in the prior year. So, the industry not only seems very competitive, but there is also a significant number of newcomers to this market.3D System's CEO Vyomesh Joshi, who came on board three years ago, announced that the company will exit non-core businesses and focus on two key areas: 1) Plastic and metals hardware and materials and on demand solutions and 2) software and healthcare workflow solutions. This increased focus on more promising businesses should help DDD achieve better results in the future. According to the CEO, DDD was facing some relevant issues when he arrived:Now, the company expects to stop the cash burn that has been going on for some years already and reestablish a profitable growth trend. With the ongoing initiatives, we think the plan could be successful. But R&D is an important driver for future growth in this business and if the company does not prove itself to be able to generate enough revenues to fund increasing R&D expenses, DDD's future may be compromised.Figure 3: DDD's OutlookSource: CompanyWe assume DDD will reestablish a faster top-line growth trend from 2020 onward, which should lead to some gross margin expansion but mostly to a significant dilution of operating expenses. We try to clean up the income statement from one-off items that could distort the recurring earnings, as we like to focus on a company's real earnings power. Therefore, the number we present below and our adjusted net income may differ significantly from reported GAAP numbers.Figure 4: Historic P&L and our forecasts, adjusted to reflect recurring resultsSource: Company and authorDDD is going through a turnaround in which management is cutting costs and expenses in an attempt to boost margins. Nevertheless, as the 3D printing business demands a high degree of customization, it is paramount that the company achieves a certain level of top-line growth that is enough to dilute fixed expenses and contribute to operating margin expansion.Figure 5: Operating Expenses EvolutionSource: CompanyFrom 2014 to 2018, DDD's revenues have been growing at an average rate of 1.3% per year, while its operating expenses have grown at a 6.0% average rate. Obviously, the minimum top-line growth that DDD should achieve in order to have sound financials is the same rate as its opex growth. But as the operating margin is currently negative, the top-line growth should surpass the increase in opex by a sizable margin for DDD to turn a profit, especially as management is guiding for ""mid 40s"" gross margin in the near term (as per the latest conference call). Going forward, we expect some improvement in gross margin due to scale gains in and a greater focus on more profitable businesses. But the most important factor of the investment thesis is an accelerating top-line driving open dilution and significant margin expansion.One of the most important things to do when taking on a risky bet is trying to assess what is the risk of losing your capital if there is a complete failure. In that sense, it is important to take a look at indebtedness and cash burn. DDD currently has a net cash position of US$80mn (as of year-end 2018 to avoid quarterly seasonality), although it has been declining in the past 3 years at nearly US$50mn per year. With the current cash in hand and assuming its cash burn continues at the same rate, we estimate DDD could live approximately until the end of 2020 without any major financial stress.However, we believe this is not the base case as management is trimming expenses and focusing on more profitable areas. If the company turns EBITDA-positive, it will be much easier for it to finance its operations. Nevertheless, it is important to monitor very closely how the cash burn, EBITDA, and cash position evolve over the coming quarters in order to track the solvency risk.With the growing importance of 3D printing and additive manufacturing processes, DDD could have some strategic value to potential buyers, especially considering it currently has an enterprise value of around only US$1 billion. In a potential scenario of increasing consolidation in the sector, DDD could benefit from expanding multiples and eventually receiving a bid from a competitor, which could accelerate the maturation of an investment in the stock. There is no indication that such an outcome is likely in the near term, however.In our view, DDD is a high risk, high return stock. The ""high risk"" part means that things have a reasonable chance of not going well. However, if things do go well, the return should be asymmetric because the earnings growth would be significant. We believe that if management gets things right and reestablish DDD on a growth trend, the top line should grow significantly (in line with the market's 30% growth, and not merely 5-10%), and that should drive an exponential EPS growth because operating leverage should work its way towards expanding margins. As operating margins are currently negative, the mid-to-long-term potential EPS growth should be tremendous should things go well.Having said that, assuming our reasonably-bullish estimates for earnings growth and a not-so-bullish exit P/E of 15x (due to the risks associated), we achieve a 24% average annual return rate on the investment (IRR) for a two-and-a-half holding period, buying DDD at US$8.95 a share. This return could be significantly larger should a successful turnaround contribute to re-rate the stock to a higher exit multiple (e.g. at 20x the IRR should be 40%).Strengths: Industry outlook; proprietary technology.Weaknesses: Poor financials; weak recent track record.Opportunities: Turnaround; growing market.Threats: Too many competitors; new technologies.Threat of New Entrants: High, as despite the fact that there are already plenty of competitors, recent data shows many newcomers to this market.Threat of Substitutes: The risk here seems low at this point as 3D printing and additive manufacturing is the new technology, something that could potentially drive substantial gains for manufacturers in terms of quality and speed.Bargaining Power of Costumers: High, as there is plenty competition and many of the customers are large companies. However, there is not much revenue concentration. The largest customer accounted for 13% of DDD's revenue in 2018 and no single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues in the years 2016 and 2017.Bargaining Power of Suppliers: Low, as there seems to be enough fragmentation of suppliers and DDD can ultimately increase its verticalization should it need to avoid too much bargaining power from third-party suppliers.Competitive Rivalry: High, as there are several other suppliers of 3D printing solutions of all sizes and in different geographies as well as providers of other competing technologies for the manufacturing processes of DDD's customers.We believe that the points below represent some of the most important points to monitor and potential drivers for DDD's share price:The industry dynamics and outlook seem quite promising, but DDD needs to fix itself to reestablish a profitable growth path and boost its valuation. We believe management is taking important steps in that direction, which makes the stock a potentially-high return investment, bearing in mind the high risks involved. At this point, it seems an interesting stock for a potential asymmetric return, assuming it is included in a well-diversified portfolio in order to dilute the risks associated with it."

It truly is that; educating readers about risk and market psychology.Since I like buying ""overvalued"" stocks like Netflix (NFLX), Square (SQ), Twilio (TWLO), ZScaler (ZS), Alteryx (AYX), or MongoDB (MDB) (although, to be honest, I don't really consider them that overvalued) it's obvious that I follow a vastly different investing approach than famous value investor Howard Marks.We know that ""overvalued"" stocks are usually priced on the assumption of a rosy future and that bad news usually has a disproportionately negative impact on these stocks. As Marks wrote, ""loss generally happens only when risk collides with negative events"". The book got me thinking: How can we anticipate negative events? And if we can't, what should we do when these negative events happen? How do we know when an investment thesis is broken? What should we be looking for?These are no easy questions. They can not possibly be discussed in a single article conclusively. But maybe, I thought, it's possible to tackle this subject bit-by-bit. This article is inspired by the idea that we learn the most valuable lessons about investing not from theoretical formulas but from real-life cases. By digging deeper into the story of a fallen growth-stock darling, I hope to discover some valuable lessons about when growth fails.3D-Systems (DDD) used to be a poster child growth company in the years 2012 and 2013. Its fall – and the fall of the whole 3D printing sector for that matter – remains one of the more interesting examples of a failed growth story of the recent past.Everyone knows what happens when a growth stock stops growing – investors lose money. In the case of 3D-Systems, investors who bought in at the peak of around $96 per share at the very beginning of 2014 and are still holding, are sitting on a 90% loss of capital (while the S&P 500 was up 52% during that time frame).Data by YChartsWhy did 3D-Systems shares fall so hard? There were probably many reasons, chief among which were a stalling top-line and a deteriorating bottom-line from 2015 onwards. But these things hadn't materialized when shares already had seen a dramatic drop in 2014. Could you have anticipated the drop? Maybe.In 3D Systems' case, there were some warning signs already visible when shares were at their peak:Ok, this last point was a bit of a joke – no disrespect to will.i.am, I'm sure he is a talented creative person. But becoming Chief Creative Officer at a multibillion-dollar technology company and then making comments of the quality that 3D printing will eventually print people within our lifetime? A bit too much for my taste.When 3D Systems reported their last earnings report before their story started derailing – Q3 2013 published on October 29, 2013 – everything looked good on the surface: Revenue growth came in at 52% and looked like it would accelerate, printers’ and other products revenue grew 76%, and printer units demand more than tripled over the year before unit sales. Gross margins were stable in the low 50s – not the greatest number but not bad either – and the company, despite investing heavily in growth, was profitable for some time and showing some operating leverage (although the operating margin was slightly trending down which could have been interpreted as a small warning sign already).Data by YChartsThe company was trading on the narrative that 3D printing will soon become ubiquitous in manufacturing globally and that consumers would massively adopt the technology. 3D Systems was building up a razor and blade business model where they would sell their printers and then receive recurring revenue from selling printing material and services. Thus, you could have argued at the time that 3D Systems' business was doing quite well, that the share price appreciation of the past was warranted, and that they had an even brighter future ahead. Many people did.But that's not the whole picture. Much of 3D Systems growth was based on an extremely aggressive acquisition strategy. According to Forbes, 3D Systems made 38 acquisitions between 2011 and 2013. Thirty-eight! That's more than one acquisition per month on average. How can an organization handle such a strategy? Well, it turns out it can't, or at least 3D Systems couldn't.What is equally important is that this acquisition strategy heavily skewed the actual revenue growth rate of the business. Yes, they reported 52% revenue growth but their reported organic growth rate in Q3 13' was only 30%. A ""bought"" growth rate is not worth much if the company overpaid for their target or can't properly integrate it into its business. Actually, a too aggressive acquisition strategy can be very harmful to a business, as it often distracts the company from focusing on their products and customers.My first key takeaway is this: Be wary of growth companies with aggressive acquisition strategies. Acquisitions should be rare, strategic, and well thought out.Also worth mentioning, if a company has a lot of inorganic growth this has to be discounted in its valuation. On January 2, 2014, 3D Systems was trading at a trailing P/E of 204.7, a forward P/E of 82.6, and a trailing P/S ratio of 17. Valuations like this can be justified in rare cases in my opinion.But 3D Systems didn't fit the bill: Considering organic growth of only 30% in a business that was based on selling hardware (which is by nature a very cyclical business), gross margins in the low 50s, and a market that was seeing increasing competition (3D Systems was maybe the market leader but didn't have any noteworthy durable competitive advantages), the company was clearly overvalued at a P/S ratio of 17.Look at this chart from Credit Suisse that estimated the Additive Manufacturing (3D printing) market growth in 2012:Now look at Statista data published in 2019 about the worldwide 3D printing market size from 2013 to 2021:There was massive hype around the 3D printing technology in 2013, people thought it would be everywhere. But as you can see from the actual Statista data, Credit Suisse, despite being bullish, actually underestimated the potential of the 3D printing industry in 2012 by quite some margin. And still, market leaders like 3D Systems lost 90% of their market value in the years following 2013.How is that possible? Well, apart from the business and valuation reasons already cited, as you can see above, the estimated 3D printing market was approximately $4 billion around 2013. Here is how the market valued this market opportunity in early 2014:Data by YChartsAt the hight of the hype the market valued 3D Systems and Stratasys (SSYS), the two leading companies in the space (but far from the only ones), at over $16 billion, that's 4 times more than the estimated total market opportunity of 3D printing at the time and still more than the total estimated market value today (almost 6 years later).Is it necessary to elaborate further on why this situation was not an ideal setup for future outperformance? Even if you dramatically increased your investment horizon this investment still wouldn't have made any sense.So here is my second takeaway from 3D Systems' case study: Always look at the TAM and compare it to the market capitalization of the business and the industry as a whole. Look for a considerable gap between the TAM and the companies' market capitalization. If the company is already priced above its own future TAM it is a big red flag for the investment thesis.Now, the points I discussed above illustrate that there was really no reason to invest in 3D Systems, at least from the second half of 2013 onwards, possibly even before that. But let's assume you got caught up in the hype – it was quite enticing at the time I must admit – and were still invested in early 2014. Here is a very important thing to note: There is usually enough time to get out when things start turning bad.Data by YChartsAs you can see, 3D-Systems' stock didn't fall 90% overnight – it took almost two years. Shares dropped 30% very quickly but it still took the stock the whole 2014 to be down 60% from its highs.There were a lot of warning signs accumulating in 2014. For example, industry peers Stratasys (SSYS) and ExOne (XONE) issued mixed guidance for 2014 in January which could already have been interpreted as a sell-sign for careful investors (although, admittedly not a very strong one).The first clear sell-indication for investors, in my view, came on February 5, 2014, when 3D Systems issued an earnings warning for Q1 2014 sending the stock crashing 27%. This is when it became apparent that the company wouldn't be able to meet sky-high expectations. Careful investors could have exited at this time and preserve most of their capital, or even save a little gain from an earlier entry point – and they would have been right to do so because, unfortunately, it only got worse from here in 2014:If this news didn't make you run for the exit what would have? Just to remind you: There is a huge difference between being down 30%, 50%, 60%, 90%, or greater in terms of recovering your investment dollars:Taking a 30% or 50% loss is painful. But it is still magnitudes better than being down 90% – there is almost no way to come back from such a loss.That's why my last key takeaway is to rather be careful than forgiving when it comes to high valuation stocks. Often, when a company starts reporting bad news there is more bad news to follow. A stock that is priced with lofty expectations doesn't react well to bad news which is why these situations should be carefully avoided – even if it means realizing a capital loss.Obviously, the issues discussed were not the only reasons why 3D Systems failed as an investment and hasn't recovered from its 2016 lows. After a very challenging 2014, the company basically stopped growing its top-line and has also struggled to be profitable ever since.Data by YChartsContemplating how spectacularly 3D Systems failed as an investment (at least for now) is truly fascinating. What strikes me the most is how the market could think that this was a good investment when the company was already trading at twice its TAM while being far from a monopoly. Shares were priced like they had a huge runway – only that they hadn't. Everyone could see that but few thought it was an issue.3D Systems teaches us to be humble as investors. It also teaches us to be diligent, and also not to trust the markets at all times. Although, to the defense of the market, you have to admit that it figured out that something was wrong with 3D Systems pretty quickly and adjusted for it rather relentlessly. I think growth investors should aim for the same relentlessness when they see a change in the underlying business.That doesn't mean selling a stock just because its price dropped. Growth stocks are volatile, and if you sell out every time shares drop 20% or more on any given news you will rob yourself out of the best investment opportunities regularly.The important thing is to distinguish between facts that could break an investment thesis and facts that are merely noise in the grand scheme of things. This is not an easy feat. The only way to pull this off, in my opinion, is to know the companies you are invested in very well, to follow them closely, and to have an understanding of how things can play out in the market. This last part only comes from experience. Studying business and stock cases like 3D Systems' hopefully helps to build that experience.Let me close with another Marks quote from the book:If you like what you just read, consider following me so you get notified when my new articles come out and you can read them before they hit the paywall.

Since then, DDD has initiated a strategic restructuring plan to cut cost by $100 million/yr and achieve profitability given the current revenue base.3-D Systems will now focus on two primary markets: healthcare and industrial solutions.","Like many companies, 3D-Systems' (DDD) YTD performance has been significantly impacted by the global pandemic. As a result, first six-months revenue was down 20% yoy. The company hired a new CEO in May and is now is undergoing a strategic restructuring effort that is ultimately expected to cut $100 million in annual operating costs. If successful, the company expects to be profitable given the current revenue base. In addition, DDD will now concentrate on two primary markets: healthcare and industrial solutions. The changes should transform DDD into a leaner company with a more strategically focused business plan.3-D Systems has been around for more than 20 years and at one point in 2014 the stock traded at over $90/share. It closed Tuesday $6.32. The company makes 3-D printers, 3-D content-to-print services, manufactures online/on-demand custom parts with specialized materials, and provides a suite of software tools to enable reverse engineering, additive/subtractive manufacturing, and inspection.One look at the Q2 earnings report below reveals the need for change. While investors might be tempted to blame the big drop in revenues on the global pandemic, note the company lost $0.43/share over the first six-months of pre-pandemic 2019:Source: Q2 EPS ReportWhile innovative and disruptive companies like 3D-Systems often sacrifice near-term profitability to focus on long-term cash-flow generation, it cannot do so forever and the loss of revenue due to the global pandemic has led to unpredictable cash-burn.Yet cutting $100 million in operating costs out of a company that only had $629 million in revenue for full-year 2019 is obviously a big ask. The company's plan is to cut deep:In the second half of the year, DDD expects to take aggregate cash charges in the range of $25-$30 million for severance, facility closing and other costs. The company said it may incur additional charges in 2021, but the vast majority of charges will be taken this year.Meantime, the new strategic business focus will be on two vertical markets: Healthcare and Industrial. 3D Systems President and CEO, Dr. Jeffery Graves, who was hired in May, said:The new focus will be in areas where DDD has achieved success over the years:Source: August PresentationFor examples of some exciting new markets, consider the case of ACS Custom - a UK-based digital production house for custom hearing devices. ACS has transformed its workflow using 3D Systems’ Figure 4 direct digital solution. As a result, ACS has increased capacity by 4X with a 2X increase in efficiency. Meantime, material consumption has been cut by 50% and labor cost by as much as 80% on a single part (below left).Source: 3D Systems (here and here)3D Systems has also been a pioneer in 3-D printing for dental devices. On October 1 the company announced that the Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") had granted clearance for maxillofacial surgical guides (in photo above right) 3-D printed using the company's LaserForm® Ti and DuraForm® ProX PA materials. In 2018, 3D Systems announced an exclusive partnership with Stryker (SYK) to deliver innovative solutions for maxillofacial surgeons. The new clearance and enhancements to 3D Systems’ VSP System is the latest DDD deliverable on the road of two companies’ shared objectives. Using LaserFromTi for titanium cutting and marking guides results in guides that are 20x stronger and 70% thinner than traditional guides. Nylon marking guides produced with DDD's DuraForm ProX PA are up to 88% tougher.Additive manufacturing (or ""AM"") can be used in many other applications as well:Source: August PresentationThe point is there seems to be no-end in sight for the number of creative applications for which 3-D's tools can be used in the coming years.After burning ~$70 million over the first half of 2020, the balance sheet is showing signs of stress. At the end of Q2, DDD had cash on hand of $63.9 million, total debt of $21.5 million, and ~$24 million available on an existing $100 million unused revolving credit facility.On the same day of the Q2 earnings and restructuring plans were announced, DDD also announced a $150 million at-the-market equity offering program to sell common shares for ""general corporate purposes, which may include repaying amounts outstanding under its senior secured term loan facility and its senior secured revolving credit facility.""At the current share price of $6.32, exercising the full-amount of the ATM plan would equate to 23.7 million shares or an estimated 20% dilution to the average 115.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2.While the pandemic proved the value of in-house additive manufacturing, it also hurt the DDD's dental market hard and led to lower spending from industrial customers. The aerospace industry has been hit hard by the pandemic - that includes Boeing (BA), which already had a major issue with the grounded 737-MAX. These challenges will likely continue as long as there are high infection rates and widespread community transmission. The longer the pandemic continues, the more likely the company will need to issue ATM shares (i.e. shareholder dilution).3-D Systems also faces increasing competition from companies like Statasys (SSYS), ProtoLabs (PRLB) and Materialise NV (MTLS). Higher competition may lead to a less than robust sales outlook on the other side of the pandemic and to margin compression. Summary & ConclusionThe shares of DDD are down 27% YTD as the global pandemic has hit sales. The company's new CEO appears to be taking all the right steps to improve the companies financial performance and to position DDD to emerge on the other side of the pandemic leaner and more levered to an expected increase in sales. While it is hard to be overly bullish on 3D Systems today given the circumstances previously outlined, note DDD is the #4 holding of the ARK 3D Printing ETF (PRNT) with a near 5% weighting. The ARK Funds have an excellent track record when it comes to discovering undervalued innovative and disruptive technology companies. See ARKW: Big Returns On Disruptive Tech Investments."
4179715,102683,2018-06-06T09:46:44-04:00,DDD's share price is breaking out higher.Its products are disrupting the manufacturing process of many industries.I am buying stock in this name.,"3D Systems (DDD) looks to be forming a bottom after years of price decline as its products are gaining traction in many industries. DDD's product offerings are disrupting the traditional operations of industries as wide-ranging as dental molds to ship building. The company plans to ship a number of new products throughout 2018, potentially improving its top-line growth. As its operations grow, investor sentiment also looks to be improving. I am buying stock in this name as its fundamental operations potentially fuel further share price gains going forward.DDD looks like an attractive investment at current levels as it moves into industries where it is disrupting the traditional ways in which they do business, while also ramping up product offerings throughout the coming year.The company provides three-dimensional [3D] printing products and services worldwide. It offers 3D printers, such as stereolithography, selective laser sintering, direct metal printing, multi-jet printing, and color jet printers that transform data input generated by 3D design software, CAD software, or other 3D design tools into printed parts under the Accura, DuraForm, LaserForm, CastForm, and VisiJet brand names.In recent days, investor optimism has picked up around the company due to the announcement of a contract for 3D ship building, a new fore for the company. DDD has announced it will partner with Huntington Ingalls Industries' Newport News Shipbuilding division on metal additive manufacturing tech for building naval warships. This signals growing demand for the company's products within a large, stable industry, where 3D technology could potentially improve supply chain efficiencies.During the most recent quarter, total revenue increased 6% to $165.9 million due largely to growth in printers, healthcare, software, and on-demand manufacturing. Printer revenue grew 24% on a 44% increase in printer unit sales prior to shipping any of its new products, according to management. Printer units are important to the company's long-term growth as it is expected to lead DDD's annuity-based business model in the future. By using an annuity-based business model, DDD looks to smooth its cash flow, while also ensuring cash flow generation over a longer time horizon. Printer unit sales and revenue mix may continue to fluctuate in coming quarters due to the launch of products throughout the year at a very wide range of prices.Management also remains focused on driving operational efficiencies, while bringing disruptive new products to market. DDD is planning a series of new product introductions throughout 2018 to further solidify its leading market portfolio. The company recently began shipping the SLS 6100 and FabPro 1000, receiving positive feedback on these products, according to its earnings call. The FabPro 1000 offers 2.5 times the speed of competitors with unmatched accuracy. Moreover, the next generation SLS 6100 system provides six production-grade materials, superior part quality, and enhanced temperature control, enabling more productivity and better total cost of operation than competitive systems, according to management.At its recent LAB DAY, DDD previewed the NextDent 5100, which will potentially redefine digital dentistry at a price point of less than $10,000 per printer. This solution offers 30 dental materials, working at four times the speed of competitive systems, with up to 90% cost savings for customers compared to traditional production methods. This can potentially cut the number of patient visits in half for products such as dentures which typically require multiple fitting visits, according to its earnings call.Meanwhile, DDD recently announced the U.S. Air Force has selected its Figure 4 for research on integrating high-speed 3D printing into the aircraft maintenance supply chain, according to management. This project brings together DDD with aerospace manufacturing leaders including Lockheed Martin (LMT), Orbital ATK (NYSE:OA), and Northrop Grumman (NOC). One of the main goals of this research is to explore how Figure 4 can be used to reproduce aircraft components for older planes with difficult-to-replace parts and to demonstrate rapid part delivery with just-in-time production and no minimum order quantities, reducing costs and time for repairs, according to management. A reason stated for Figure 4 being selected is because it is the quickest, most accurate 3D printing technology available, delivering the fastest time-to-part, with unparalleled Six Sigma reputability, according to management. DDD plans to begin shipment of NextDent 5100, standalone Figure 4, and modular Figure 4 this summer.Additionally, later in 2018, management plans to bring to market the DMP 8300 metals printer, a factory-ready model of the ProX 320, and the larger DMP 8500 Factory Solution. Thus far, the collective feedback on its full set of new products from customers, beta testers, and trade shows has been positive, with potentially incremental and expanded market opportunities going forward.Below is a chart of the company's revenue and earnings per share. Over the last decade, the company has largely operated at a loss on a per share basis. Its revenue growth was strong from 2010 through 2015. Since 2016, revenue slowed but looks to be regaining some traction as the company launches and ships new products in coming quarters. As demand for new products picks up, its share price should similarly increase going forward.The company's share price looks to be forming a double-bottom formation as demand for its products picks up following a few years of flat-lining top-line growth. As revenue growth slowed, it brought down the company's share price from roughly $100, to now just $14. The company's disruptive technology is proving capable of innovating the supply chain of industries from dental to ship building. Investor optimism on recent contracts announced pushed the company's share price above $14, a level that had acted as resistance in recent years. As the company's fundamental operations continue to gain traction, its share price should similarly push higher.DDD looks to be forming a bottom after years of price decline as its products are gaining traction in many industries. DDD's product offerings are disrupting the traditional operations of industries as wide-ranging as dental molds to ship building. The company plans to ship a number of new products throughout 2018, potentially improving its top-line growth. As its operations grow, investor sentiment also looks to be improving.

4120468,22445,2017-11-04T02:58:46-04:00,"This is an unforgiving market for stocks that do not exhibit top-line growth.Unfortunately for 3D Systems, growth is not there, and there is evidence that revenue might be lower in the next several quarters.This could mean the market marks down its stock to 1X revenue or less, or close to $5.60 a share.","3D Systems (DDD) shocked the market on Tuesday reporting a loss of $37.7M and a respective loss of $0.20 EPS for Q3'17. The EPS result was a huge miss by $0.32, and frankly it does not get worse than this.The company also missed on revenue by about $10M. While on the face of it, $10M is not a lot, it is as a percentage of revenue, when DDD only did $152.9M in revenue.That not being bad enough, the company withdrew its guidance, citing it has ""significant transformational work in solving legacy issues"", while at the same time addressing executional issues.Long-time readers know I always caution on paying too much for growth. Yes, growth is what has driven this market, but not at any cost. And in the case of the entire 3D space, investors unfortunately paid pie-in-the-sky valuations over the years.DDD PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsLong-time readers also know I place a lot of emphasis on the Price/Sales ratio as a guide for not paying too much. While it's not the only ratio I look at, any stock above 5 (with a few expectations) is a suspect for losses or underperformance.And as the chart above shows, investors have paid ""through the nose"" for DDD's growth only to find themselves losing massive amounts of money over the years.And the only way to protect yourself from stocks like DDD is to refrain from buying them, or at least know what you are buying and be ready to sell at a moment's notice.Because when a company has no growth in this market, or when a company is reorganizing, then the market really knocks down valuations. In the case of DDD, I think you will be surprised at how low this stock might go in the future.Please recall that as of my last article on the company, I warned there was no growth in sight. While I thought the company could trade at 2X revenue, a prerequisite for this was at least anemic growth and a minuscule EPS.However, when we take those two elements out of the picture, then this market can punish a stock more than anyone could imagine.DDD Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThe above chart does not encompass the latest revenue data; however, the outcome would have been almost the same. What is important to note is that DDD has a current revenue run-rate of about $640M per year.At the moment, the company is not burning cash, and that's a good thing (for now at least). However, since it's entering some kind of reorganization phase, we have to assume that at some point it might in the future, or we might see write-offs.Another thing to keep in mind is the outstanding share count.DDD Shares Outstanding data by YChartsThe company's float has remained steady over the years, so I do not see a problem at this end (for now).We also have to take into account that the company withdrew its guidance. What exactly does this mean? The company last quarter guided for minuscule revenue growth and even missed that by a good margin. Is there a chance we see revenue lower over the next several quarters?Printer unit sales increased 8% in Q3, but printer revenue decreased 11%. Is this the start of some kind of price-war in the 3D space? I don't know; however, it's not a good sign. Sure, materials revenue increased 4%, and healthcare revenue rose by 10% for the quarter, but were these enough to offset legacy revenue? The numbers seem to suggest no.So in retrospect, it might seem that revenue for DDD might go lower over the next several quarters. It also seems that competition from HP (HPQ) that I mentioned in a recent article is in full throttle.Like I said, when no growth is on the horizon, stocks can trade for 1X revenue irrespective of EPS. However, when we have a company that is also losing revenue - or has a good chance of lower revenue - then valuations get punished even more.So taking the average yearly revenue of about $640M and dividing that by 113.8M shares, I think DDD can trade as low as $5.60 a share. Please note that if things do not stabilize over the next several quarters, this number might be adjusted further to the downside.As for DDD, all my technical indicators are bearish, and $6.40 is the first line of defense. But if it does go that low, I think it will go even lower, close to the $5.60 level.As per other stocks in the space that are in a similar boat:All technical indicators on Stratasys (SSYS) are also bearish, and I think $14 a share might be an absolute bottom, if it corrects in sympathy with DDD to the levels mentioned above.As for ExOne (XONE), all indicators are also bearish, but not as bad. If however the space continues to have problems, then there is a chance we might see XONE at the $6 level once more.Unfortunately this is market that does not spare any stock that does not exhibit top-line growth. You can miss as many times as you want on the bottom-line, but if revenue growth is not there, stocks get punished by a lot.In the case of DDD, that could mean $5.60 a share, assuming the situation does not get much worse in the coming quarters. Stay tuned..."
4197030,95006,2018-08-09T11:39:37-04:00,"In January of this year I wrote an article explaining why 3D Systems was a buy from a cyclical value perspective.
        I recently took profits in that investment after nearly a 100% gain.
        I review the strategy I used to make this investment and highlight another stock that has a similar dynamic that 3D did in January, and why I expect similar returns.","On January 8th of 2018, I publish an article titled ""3D Has Entered Cyclical Value Territory"" which was featured as an editor's pick here on Seeking Alpha. In the article, I outlined my cyclical investing strategy, why I thought 3D Systems (DDD) was a buy at the time, and I explained how I go about investing in stocks that have recently come off super-cyclical highs. At the time I wrote the article 3D Systems was down 90% off its 2014 highs:Investing in highly cyclical stocks requires a unique investing approach, and I've spent the last three years focusing almost exclusively on researching cyclical value stocks. The best time to buy cyclicals is when everything looks absolutely dreadful for them. While not every cyclical stock needs to be down 90% off its highs like DDD was, it's not uncommon for me to invest when stocks are down 50%-80% with few signs of life. The reason for that is because the rewards are highest if one can find the courage to invest when things look the bleakest. Here is how DDD has performed relative to the S&P 500 (SPY) since my article was published 8 months ago:As you can see, there was quite a lot of volatility during this period, but I have now taken profits with almost a 100% gain, which was my stated goal in the original article. ($18.42 is the price I ended up selling my position, which is the price this chart shows.)Inevitably, when things go well, there are those who attribute the success to luck. And the fact of the matter is, investing, like poker, involves a reasonable degree of luck (both good and bad). But the investments I've written about as ""cyclical values"" on SA over the past 2 1/2 years have generally performed very well. Of the ten I've written about, five of them: BorgWarner (BWA), FMC Corp (FMC), Amtech Systems (ASYS), Twin Disc (TWIN), and now 3D Systems, have all realized returns between 90-110%. Here is how the other five, unrealized investments are doing:Mylan (MYL) and Signet Jewelers (SIG) have struggled, but still have about three years before my time horizon for the investments arrive:McDermott (MDR) is a newer pick from 2018 and a bit different in that it involves a merger/turnaround, so I expect it to take a little longer to develop as an investment, but I'm optimistic for its prospects over the medium-term.And, unlike the previous stocks where the goal was a 100% within five years, the next is a shallow cyclical value, whose goal is a 50% return within four years. Powell (POWL) is very near that goal after about one year:By the end of the month, I might have another cyclical value winner in Powell to write about, bringing the total to 6 out of 10 fully realized winners, 3 out of 10 that are modestly negative, but hardly in danger of serious losses, and 1 that I'll discuss later in the article that investors can still buy at a bargain price. While this isn't a large sample size, it's big enough to instill enough confidence for me that the overall strategy that I'm using is probably more than luck.As you probably noticed, I sold a little bit short of my goal of a 100% gain. Whether I sell a little below 100% or a little after largely depends on how the stock in question got to where it is trading. If 3D's price increase had been more steady and stretched over more time, I might have held on to get that the last few percentage points of my stated goal, but I think most of the shorts have been squeezed out of the stock, and a lot of good news is now priced in, so holding on to the stock, potentially for several months, just to squeeze a few more percentage points out doesn't seem worth it in this situation, if I already plan to sell a few cents higher. Quite often after a big pop in price like this, there is a pullback and consolidation before the stock takes another leg up, and I don't want to wait for that process to unfold.That doesn't mean that I'm now a bear on the stock or that the stock price couldn't double yet again. It just means that my method of identifying a good price for the stock can't predict that rise much farther than $19-$23 per share or so (and I'm notably conservative when it comes to predicting future gains). The way I think about it is this: I just made the equivalent of five years of 15% CARG in about 7 months. I don't need to get greedy here. If the stock continues to double or triple after I've sold, that's alright with me because I don't feel I have a good way to predict that future price growth with any confidence. First, I didn't exactly pick the bottom. I just tried to maximize the risk/reward based on past cycles. At the time my DDD article was published, the stock was trading at $9.39. It's 52 week low was actually $7.92. So it was off the bottom a fair amount when I purchased the stock.My method for determining entry points for stocks is based on the individual stock's historical cyclicality and whether it passes my impairment tests. Many stocks have a long history of price cycles and some of them can be fairly consistent. I try to go back in history as far as I can, sometimes up to 50 years, and see if the historical price cycles have something to say about the stock. If it looks like the stock is going through a 'normal' cycle, they I try my best to estimate a couple good entry points near the bottom.Once that is done, I run the stock and the company through my impairment tests. The goal of these tests is to check and see if 1) the company is at least of average quality and 2) to make sure that there isn't something different about the current cycle that might prevent the stock price from recovering the way it has done historically.These are the six main reasons that I've found a cyclical company may not recover in a timely manner (in this case, within five years).1) A fatal flaw in the company's business model is exposed for the first time.2) The price did not drop enough.3) The stock price experienced a recent super-cyclical high.4) There is a clear and present disruptive threat to the core business.5) The company has high relative debt compared to past down-cycles.6) Management is corrupt or incompetent.If a company passes these tests, then I make an investment. Typically, for deep cyclical stocks like DDD, I aim for a 100% return on my investment within 5 years. Below is an excerpt from my original article where I take readers through my process for the first three impairment tests. Most notable is how to deal with the super-cycle 3D had recently gone through.I went on to explain how DDD passed the remaining impairment tests after this, but this is the basic outline of why I decided to invest in DDD when I did. The most promising stock I have written about recently that has the potential for 50-100% gains is RPC Inc. (RES). I wrote about the stock back in June in my article ""RPC Inc: A Quality Cyclical Value"". It shares a blend of the attributes that 3D and Powell had. When I wrote about RPC it was about 50% off its highs even though demand for oil will likely remain strong over the medium-term; it carries no debt on its balance sheet; it has weathered similar cycles before, and it currently pays a 2.69% dividend. Since I wrote about the stock it has begun to move up in price, but it still likely has another 50% to go:If for some reason we enter a bear market or a recession sooner rather than later, I would feel confident holding this stock through the bottom of the cycle if necessary. If I could only put new money in one place, this is where I would currently invest.Overall, my cyclical investing approach has been working very well. After taking profits in 3D, half of the cyclical picks have now been realized for average gains of 100%. A few of the picks are struggling, but are not currently in danger of producing huge losses, and I'm close to realizing another big winner in Powell. Thanks for reading, and I would be happy to answer any questions in the comment section."
4135981,95006,2018-01-08T13:20:24-05:00,"Occasionally I find unexpected companies while looking for cyclical value stocks.DDD is a stock I had skipped over in the past simply because it didn't fit what I would normally consider a cyclical company.After examining it more closely, however, DDD is indeed its own type of cyclical stock and it has just come off a super-cyclical high.I explain my process for determining a future market valuation for post-super-cycle stocks and why I think DDD is a buy at these levels.","For the past two years, I have focused the majority of my research on highly cyclical stocks and investment strategies related to them. Thus far, the early results have been encouraging, and so I have continued to both fine-tune my initial strategy as well as expand the scope of stocks to which I apply the strategy. Perhaps my biggest surprise throughout the research was the wide range of companies I've found. My four biggest successes all came from different industries: chemicals (FMC Corp. (FMC)), semiconductor equipment (Amtech Systems (ASYS)), diversified machinery (Twin Disc (TWIN)), and auto parts (BorgWarner (BWA)). Three of those four met their goal of a 100% gain, and the last is up over 75% since my initial article. Currently, I hold shares of and have written articles about, companies in the industries of jewelry stores (Signet Jewelers (SIG)), generic drugs (Mylan (MYL)), industrial electrical equipment (Powell (POWL)), and heavy construction (McDermott International (MDR)). We have yet to see how these newer investments will ultimately play out over the medium term, but one thing that has become clear is that there is a broader range of industries than the typical industrial cyclicals that immediately come to mind when we think of 'cyclical stocks' to which the strategy can be applied.So, while it shouldn't surprise me that 3D Systems Corp. (DDD) turned out to fit my broad definition of a cyclical stock, I had previously skipped overtaking a closer look at it several times during the course of my research simply because I assumed, given the industry it was in, that it wouldn't pass my qualitative screen for cyclicality. I mean, ultimately, I'm a value investor. I look for cyclical values. When I hear about 3-D printing technology, I think about a company on par with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Bitcoin, companies I wouldn't touch in a million years based on value using this strategy. But in this case, I think that I was wrong to overlook DDD.Additionally, after reading 3D System's annual report and learning to some degree what it is it actually does, I see that it is much closer to a type of industrial cyclical than I would have initially expected. Here is how it describes the products it offers in its 10-K:It also provides software services, 3D simulators, on-demand 3D manufacturing, and healthcare services. So, basically, one shouldn't be surprised that the demand for its products and services ebbs and flows like any other cyclical company. Its business relies more on the development of newer technology at a faster pace than many other cyclical companies, though, which does add an additional layer of risk compared to a traditional industrial company whose business changes less rapidly.Since my approach to value investing is unorthodox, I like to give a quick primer in my articles about at least one aspect of what it is I try to do in order to frame my basic thesis for a stock. In this case, it is important to point out that I differ from most analysts in that I don't try to value a stock based on a prediction of the company's future earnings. Instead, for this strategy, I base the potential medium-term value of a stock based on a price the market has recently assigned it. (Recently, usually meaning within the past 2-3 years.)For example, I recommended buying FMC Corp. (FMC) April 1st, 2016, at around $40.00 per share then recommended selling it after about a 100% gain in August of 2017.FMC Total Return Price data by YChartsFMC has continued to make new highs since August and is now ~$98 per share, but since I used a previously discovered market price from 2014 as an estimation of potential future value, I sold when FMC hit the top end of that range in August of 2017 because my strategy wasn't designed to predict future earnings but rather to predict that similar market conditions that caused FMC to reach ~$80 per share in 2014 would likely happen again in the medium-term (which they did).FMC data by YChartsIt's a strategy designed to buy stocks near the bottom of the cycle, not a strategy designed to predict at what point we will see the top of the cycle. FMC's stock price is still rising and could keep doing so, and this strategy has nothing to say about the likelihood that it will rise or fall from this point. It's one of the major limitations of using a previous market price as an estimation of fair value.In order to be a good candidate for this strategy, a company must have a sufficient history of cyclicality. If a company passes my initial cyclicality tests, then determining whether there is some factor that is likely to impair their eventual recovery is where I spend most of my research time.I have six basic impairment tests that I use to help determine whether or not I wish to make an investment in a company that I have found to be sufficiently cyclical. I use these tests first to determine if I want to make an initial investment and also to determine how much I should weight that investment. These are the six main reasons that I've found a cyclical company may not recover in a timely manner (in this case, within five years).1) A fatal flaw in the company's business model is exposed for the first time.2) The price did not drop enough.3) The stock price experienced a recent super-cyclical high.4) There is a clear and present disruptive threat to the core business.5) The company has high relative debt compared to past down-cycles.6) Management is corrupt or incompetent.Let's first look at #1 with regard to DDD, A Fatal Flaw: Let's use the example of bitcoin since everyone else is talking about it nowadays. I would never invest in bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency simply because they haven't been around long enough for their potential fatal flaw to be exposed. And, for what it's worth in this case, bitcoin almost certainly does have a fatal flaw. (My guess is that the flaw is that there isn't any reason we can't have an endless supply of other cryptocurrencies so that bitcoin's scarcity isn't enough to create value... but this is a whole other discussion.) I don't have to predict the flaw. I just have to know that it can take 10-20 years, or sometimes more if a company gets lucky and the economic conditions are just right, for a flaw to be exposed. For this reason, my general rule is not to invest unless a company has a 20-year track record as a publicly traded company. This is partially because usually that amount of time is required to examine their historical cyclicality, but it is also important so that we can avoid fatal flaws. Tesla may drop 50% this year, but that doesn't mean I would be interested using this strategy to try to pick a bottom. Commercial electric cars simply haven't been around long enough and they may have a fatal flaw that I can't foresee.3D Systems has actually been around for quite some time... over 30 years in fact. And that's usually enough time to expose a true fatal flaw.DDD data by YChartsEven though the price of the stock hasn't appreciated much in that time, it has been around long enough to pass my first test.Next, I'll examine the second and third tests of whether the price has fallen enough and whether it has recently come off a super-cyclical high. One look at the chart above should tell us that yes indeed DDD has recently come off a super-cyclical high. While I don't have any clear test for what constitutes a super-cycle, they basically look exactly like that chart from 2011 to 2016.The problem with super-cycles and the strategy I'm using is that super-cycles throw off the entire bottom predicting process and it makes it very hard to 'catch the falling knife' by the handle and not the blade. For this reason, if it seems obvious to me that a company is coming off a super-cycle, then my strategy is to wait for a bounce and essentially a double-bottom. The reason for this doesn't have anything to do with reading charts in the classic sense (at least not for me). What it does is allow me to disregard the price history of the recent super-cycle and instead use the price history of the bounce as my guide for a potential future market value of the stock. Let's take a closer look at that bounce:DDD data by YChartsOkay, we saw in the first chart that DDD peaked at over $90 a share. But, since that occurred during a super-cycle, we should not expect the price to return to that high anytime soon. Instead, what I use is the price during the post super-cycle bounce. That price peaked at about $23 per share last summer. If I were to buy at the current price (which I did), I would earn a 100% return at about $18.50 per share, so that price will be my target exit (though any price under $23.00 per share I would consider a reasonable exit point using this strategy, which means any buy price under, say, $11.50).As for whether the price has fallen far enough, DDD has lost over 80% of its value four previous times in the past 30 years and recovered each of those times. This time will be the 5th if it recovers. For that reason, I think the price is low enough to make an initial investment even though it could still fall farther before a recovery happens.Test #4 is whether there is a clear disruptive threat to its core business. While I'm not even close to being an expert in this industry, mostly what I see and read about is stiff competition, not a true disruptive threat. It doesn't appear as if its technology will become obsolete any time soon, so it passes this test well enough for me.Often when I make it this far into researching a company, I find that they have made the mistake of taking on far too much debt, usually via a recent acquisition. That is not the case with DDD. It essentially has no meaningful debt, which is great. This also says something about management as well, because they haven't taken the short-term, easy route of levering up the company in a quest to get the revenue growth that DDD is desperately in need of.As for management, I think the verdict is still out on them. They recently misguided earnings, and to their credit, they have decided not to issue guidance until they've had time to implement some changes. They simultaneously seem committed to continue investing in R&D and other products for the future. I'm not familiar enough with the industry to evaluate the likelihood of their specific actions having the desired result, but it seems like there are multiple issues on multiple fronts that they are trying to get a handle on. The positive part of this is that they don't seem like clueless cheerleaders spouting empty promises. The negative part is that it feels like they could be in over their heads a bit. There are a lot of moving parts in this business between all the different products and services it offers along with the global scope of its business. Overall, one could say I'm neutral on management and I don't think we'll know for perhaps another year or two whether the changes and investments they are making will work to raise revenue and the stock price.In this section of the article, I'll explain both my entry and exit points for DDD and also my portfolio weighting. These potential price points and weightings combine together to account for the fact that trying to predict a bottom in a cyclical stock is not a precise activity. It is more art than science and contains its fair share of unpredictability. With that in mind, my goal for deep cyclical stocks like 3D Systems is to obtain a 100% return within five years.When we combine that goal with the approach of using a recent previously established market price as our estimate of fair value (as discussed earlier), 3D Systems' current price of $9.39 is more than 50% off the recent bounce from its super-cyclical high:DDD data by YChartsWe would achieve our 100% return goal at a price of $18.78, so that will be our rough guide for an exit price. Remember, this is not an exact science, just an estimate on both entry and exit based on my goals for this strategy. However, the top limit of an entry price using this strategy would be $11.50. If the price was higher than that, I wouldn't invest.Cyclical stocks can lose a lot of value in a short period of time. It is entirely possible that 3D Systems could drop another 50% from the level it is at today. After its last super-cycle in the early 1990s, DDD lost over 95% of its value:DDD data by YChartsCurrently, after this recent super-cycle, it has lost about 90% of its value:DDD data by YChartsIf one isn't careful, they may think that this means, using history as a guide, we could expect 5% more downside if we bought at today's price. Unfortunately, the risk is much higher than that because these percentage changes are based off the peak price. So, if a company was priced at say $100 per share (as DDD nearly was) and it loses 90% of its value, that means it trades at $10 per share. However, if it were to continue down to 95% of its peak value, it would reach a $5.00 stock price. So, if you bought at $10 per share, you would be in for a 50% loss. This is almost exactly the situation we find ourselves in with DDD if we use history as our guide.This potential of further drop in price is why I always plan on making a second stock purchase of equal value at a predetermined price should it reach that low. So far, while using this approach, I've only made a second purchase one time, with Signet Jewelers. But the price of Amtech Systems and Mylan each came within pennies of hitting that second stock price before they recovered. While I base the second purchase price on a number of historical factors, it's ultimately just an estimate. In this case, I think using an additional 95% drop from the high (or ~50% drop from the current price) as a likely hard bottom of $4.70 combined with fellow SA author George Kesarios's estimate of $5.60 per share, I'll take the difference of the two and make my potential second purchase at $5.15 if the share price should fall that far.As for the weighting of this investment, I weight cyclical investments on a 1% to 4% scale. The fact that the company doesn't earn much money, has a lot of moving parts with manufacturing and clients spread all over the world, and has to continually stay on the leading edge of technology that I frankly know very little about, I'm going to give this my lowest weighting of 1% and commit myself to an addition 1% of portfolio value if the price drops to $5.15."

In fact, the opposite happened, with DDD shares rising up to 20% in afterhours trading. I immediately took a very small short position. However, I was surprised the stock was not dropping, and I covered with a tiny profit.I then started reading the press release and was shocked the stock rallied. The company said it expects Q4 revenue to come in the range between $176M and $178M, or an increase of 6-7% Y/Y.Ok, I said to myself, perhaps the bottom is in for revenue. As a reminder, DDD's revenue has been in a downhill for some time.DDD Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsBut then, I also read:So, in other words, the market got excited because the company will be reporting a GAAP loss for the quarter, and a non-GAAP profit of one-fifth of what was reported last year, at best.That not being bad enough, the company expects to report an FY'17 GAAP loss of $0.58 to $0.60 per share vs. a $0.35 loss in FY'16, and a non-GAAP loss in the range of $0.01 to $0.03 per share vs. a non-GAAP profit of $0.46 per share for FY'16.So, the market got excited about a little revenue growth but disregards the red ink, both for the quarter and the full year. So excited, that it bid up shares of DDD 20% and continued bidding the next day on Friday. Oh, I forgot, results were a little better than analysts expected.Looking at the long-term chart of DDD, it's been in a wide trading zone between $24 and $6.30 over the past three years. And not only has the stock (and the sector) underperformed, but long-time investors who placed a bet on the overhyped growth story years ago still have massive losses.Now, I have to admit that looking at the long-term technicals, it seems to me that DDD might be at some kind of bottom at these levels. In fact, I might have to update my price target of $5.60.However, the truth is that for DDD to trade much higher, it has to do a lot better than show us some minuscule revenue growth. And to date, we have not seen much from a profitability perspective to warrant much higher prices (my opinion).Please keep in mind that DDD is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market. About 33% of the float was short as of the latest data (via Yahoo). So, my guess is that the rally had a lot to do with short covering on the back of a headline surprise.However, please note that sooner or later, those who are short covering will stop covering, and chances are that new shorts will come in at higher levels. So, the recent rally is probably not a result of investor demand, but short covering.Now moving to the sector, voxeljet AG (VJET) also issued preliminary FY'17 results and provided guidance for FY'18, and the numbers were not good. The company guided FY'17 revenue between €22.5M and €23.5M (consensus: €29.57M) and full FY'18 revenue in the range between €28M and €30M (consensus: €36.81M).The stock got marked down about 15% on the news and has not recovered since then. And if you ask me, there are still no reasons to be a buyer of VJET for the time being. The stock has been on a downward trend for several years now, after growth prospects and market enthusiasm gave way to reality.Stratasys (SSYS) recently announced Q4 results, but guidance was not as expected, and its stock also tumbled. Yes, revenue climbed to $179.3M vs. $175.2M up 2.3% Y/Y (yawn). However, adjusted EPS guidance for FY'18 was $0.30 to $0.50 vs. the consensus of $0.61.Please note SSYS is a $20 stock. There really is no reason for its price to be where it is today if EPS comes in at the low-end of guidance by the end of the year. There is still a lot of risk involved. In fact, if you ask me, even $0.60 EPS is not enough to warrant its current price (my opinion again).SSYS data by YChartsPlease also note over the past three years, both stocks have underperformed the market by a lot, and I personally doubt these stocks will perform better than the market anytime soon.While I do not doubt the sector will continue to grow in the future, the inability of these companies to participate in the sector's growth is troublesome.DDD, SSYS, and VJET are very heavily shorted stocks. So, the small pop might be short covering and not investment demand. Yes, they are very good trading stocks. However, I think they all have a long way to go before they could become buy-and-hold picks.In the case of DDD, revenue seems to be stabilizing after a long period of decline. However, the company still has profitability issues.DDD, SSYS, and VJET are trading at a trailing Price/Sales ratio of 2, 1.62, and 2.3 respectively, and forward 12-month P/E of 67, 34, and VJET is expected to have losses in 2018 once again.In order for these stocks to rise substantially, we either have to see growth to the tune of 20%, or higher profitability that will warrant their current share price. Currently, neither growth nor higher profitability is on the horizon.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."

Their management experience in a Fortune 500 environment could provide valuable insight in minimizing 3D Systems' biggest roadblock to profitability - huge SG&A expenses.3D Systems has a strong balance sheet with conservative financing, but it currently lacks the income statement performance to support it. Significant investments in research and development and a focused strategic vision shifting additive manufacturing processes from prototyping to production will create future value, but it's too early to make an investment. In addition, the recent insider sell-off exacerbates my short-term concerns.Last week, I developed a brief industry report on Additive Manufacturing and where the industry may be going, identifying 3D Systems as a quick pick that needed more research.3D Systems was founded by the inventor of stereolithography, the world's first commercialized 3D printing process to convert digital files into a solid product layer by layer. The Company provides promising strategic insight into the capabilities of additive manufacturing and how it sees itself shaping the transition that will move AM from prototype printing to production. On a per share basis, 3D Systems will need to showcase spectacular growth and cost reduction in order to prove a worthwhile investment, but the future could be bright should management succeed in reshaping its cost structure.3D Systems Corporation was incorporated in 1993 and operates in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific. The Company provides 3D printing solutions, materials, software, and manufacturing services. The Company also has Virtual Surgical Planning capabilities. Solutions offered by 3D Systems primarily support customers in the healthcare, aerospace, automotive, and durable goods industries. The Company has been operating in the 3D printing space for over 30 years and has both seen or contributed to nearly all the innovation since the technology was introduced commercially.3D Systems is focused on driving the shift in the 3D printing solutions industry from prototyping applications to printing for production.Source: 3D Systems Corporation Annual Report 20163D Systems was co-founded by the inventor of commercialized 3D printing, Charles Hull, in 1986, shortly after he filed his patent for the Stereolithography Apparatus in 1984. In 1987, the Company commercialized the first 3D printer, the SLA-1. The Company was issued two more patents in 1989 and 1993 for Selective Laser Sintering and the force-feedback haptic device, respectively. 3D Systems entered the virtual reality surgical simulation space in 2000 with the release of the first Simbionix, and in 2009, it launched its capability for On Demand Parts Manufacturing. Direct Metal Printing was added to the Company’s portfolio in 2013, and in 2016, the Company showcased Figure 4 SLA technology, the “next generation of Stereolithography”.Source: Company HistoryDDD does not currently have a positive P/E ratio, but it does have a better than average Price/Sales ratio of 2.2x compared to the industry average of 3.3x.

Problems set in at the Operating Profit Margin, where the Company has a -5.3% margin compared to an industry average of 24.2%. The bulk of the Company's problems lie in SG&A costs and R&D expenses that are not currently driving enough sales growth.Source: TD AmeritradeThe Company is rated a 2.7/5.0 overall by its employees on Glassdoor, with only 48% of reviewers willing to recommend 3D Systems to a friend - both are fairly negative ratings. On the other hand, 77% approve of the CEO, which bodes well for senior leadership. Ratings trended upward through the end of 2016 and the beginning of 2017 but have taken a dip since March of 2017.

The Company has not posted positive net income since 2014 and does not look like it will pull above the break-even point in 2017 either. While interest expenses are very low (the Company’s only forms of debt are leases and a $150,000 revolving credit facility), 3D Systems has faced problems turning operating income positive. My projections have the Company facing negative operating income until 2019. 3D Systems has an impressive balance sheet with high liquidity, low debt, and high book value per share despite net losses in recent years, but the Company must revamp its cost structure for it to be profitable at these sales levels.Including intangible assets, DDD has a BV/Share of $5.88, a quick ratio of 2.95x, and a Debt/Assets ratio of less than 1%.

Growth rates were kept in line with management’s forward year guidance provided in the Company’s second quarter earnings release. In order to justify the price ranges in which the Company’s stock price currently resides (around $12.50 as of 8/23), 3D Systems would need double-digit revenue growth and significant margin improvements over the next five years.While I see a lot of potential quality in 3D Systems' strategic focus, and the space that it operates within, I simply cannot reconcile the price with the value - or lack thereof - that DDD is currently providing. I'd like to rate DDD as a Watch List stock. While operational deficiencies will prove difficult to turn around, 3D Systems' influential placement in an industry that's 1-3 years from explosive growth (combined with the Company's strategic vision and strong balance sheet fundamentals) entices me to keep an eye on it. The Company's efforts to become the dominant provider for healthcare needs in AM are also encouraging. 3D Systems could prove to be a valuable long-term investment should sales growth increase at a greater than expected rate following FY17 or SG&A expenses remain in check. For now, I will be taking a wait and see approach for this particular company."
4226539,102080,2018-12-05T15:04:09-05:00,"For most of its history, 3D Systems has been aggressively acquiring strategic 3D printing assets.Perhaps the most valuable 3D printing asset it owns today is the human capital of the employees working at the company.An approach that attempts to evaluate the present value of DDD's human capital by using an investment philosophy employed by Warren Buffett.Technical indicators that support a short-term bullish thesis.","For those that may not be already familiar with the company, 3D Systems (DDD) was founded by Chuck Hull shortly after he invented and then patented stereolithography in 1986.Essentially, stereolithography is the process of creating 3D objects by successively ""printing"" thin layers of an object using a medium curable by ultraviolet light, starting from the bottom layer to the top layer.Stereolithography (""3D printing"") can be used to create things such as prototypes for products in development, medical models, and computer hardware, as well as in many other applications.Today, Chuck Hull sits on the company's board of directors and acts as the DDD's Chief Technology Officer.Meanwhile, 3D Systems' technologies and services are used in the design, development, and production stages of many industries, including aerospace, automotive, healthcare, dental, entertainment and durable goods, with the company following a ""razor and blades"" sales model whereby it develops hardware for customers and follows on with sales of accessories and support in order to generate recurring revenue streams.3D Systems posted a $66 million net loss in 2017 or a loss of $0.59 per share.It also generated just shy of $26 million in operating cash flows in 2017 which were more than offset by nearly $31 million in capital expenditures and another $34 million in acquisition expenses.Through the first nine months of 2018, it's posted a GAAP loss of $41 million, recorded a $3 million deficit of cash flow from operations in addition to spending another $28 million on capital investments.These are not exactly the type of qualities that I would typically look for in an investment.But I began to wonder if maybe there's more to this company - and its valuation - that meets the eye.That is if you're willing to do a little outside the box thinking.DDD's sales are 8.1% higher through the first 9 months of 2018 compared to where they were a year ago.Sales of DDD's products were $316 million through September 30, in addition to services revenue of just under $191 million.That at least tells you there are customers out there who are demanding what the company is selling.So, where is all that money going?3D Systems was able to generate a respectable gross profit margin of 47.6% through the first 9 months of this year, an improvement over the 46.6% gross margin it generated a year ago.Yet, each and every penny - and actually more - of those gross profit dollars are being gobbled up by DDD's operating and R&D expenses.Operating costs have risen 9% so far this year compared to the first nine months of 2017.Even acknowledging the company's recurring sales business model, I don't love that costs are outpacing sales.Particularly when those sales are only growing at a single digit rate.Add to this, the persistent net losses and cash flow deficits - this company literally has no economic value in the traditional accounting sense.But what about the presence of other ""real economic value"" being held within the company that eludes the confines of traditional accounting techniques?For example, what about the value of 3D System's human capital?Human capital is defined as the present value of an individual's future labour income.The above definition is in reference to the considerations an individual is faced with when making asset allocation decisions including the need to purchase life insurance.The idea being that when individuals are starting out their careers, their largest asset is the value of their future earnings while at the same time individuals who are younger in age might have far fewer financial assets to their name by comparison.But why can't we apply the same concept to the case of 3D Systems?After all, a prospective investment in DDD is much more about what it could become (the value of future earnings) rather than the cash flows and profits that it is currently producing.And keep in mind that this is a firm after all that has strategically set out to accumulate what it believes to be valuable human assets for much of the past century.Source: Pfeifle, Sam (10 October 2012).

""Printing in 3D"" (Video). Bloomberg West. United States: Bloomberg Television.OK, so let's go back to the numbers for a minute.Right now, the company is worth $1.44 billion based on a market capitalization of 114 million shares outstanding at a price of $12.65 per share.Meanwhile, 3D Systems had reported current assets of $347 million versus total outstanding liabilities of $223 million in addition to non-controlling interests valued at a little under $9 million as of the third quarter.So, the company has virtually no financial obligations to its name at present, but it does have approximately 2,600 employees working for it globally, according to DDD's September 2018 corporate presentation:Based on the reported figure of 2,600 employees and a market capitalization of $1.4 billion that suggests the market today values each of the company's staff members at approximately $530,000.If that a fair price?What would you, personally, value your own human capital at?Some of you may recall this famous quote from Warren Buffett when he addressed an audience at Columbia Business Students in 2009:Source: CNBCWhat Buffett is suggesting here is that if, for example, you were currently earning an annual salary of $100,000, he would be willing to offer you a lump-sum of $100,000 in order for the right to receive a 10% perpetuity of your future earnings.As:10% of $100,000 salary = $10,000 Buffett's annual shareThe $100,000 lump-sum figure implies that Buffett is valuing that individual's earnings at a 10x multipleBy extension, this would mean that if Buffett, or anyone else for that matter, owned 100% of your human capital (i.e. your employer, or more accurately, your employer's shareholders in the case of a publicly-traded company) that according to Buffett's logic, a fair price for your human capital would be equal to 10x your current one-year earnings.Let's apply that logic to the case of 3D Systems.In 2017, DDD's total selling, general, and administrative costs were $264 million.Based on 2,600 employees, that works out to an average annual salary of about $101,000 per employee.Now, I understand that there are other non-payroll expenses included in SG&A, but I will also point out that part of the expenditures for costs of goods sold and research and development will also contain an element of costs associated with hiring labour.And for whatever its worth, that $101,000 figure would probably not be far off the mark for someone who had specialized knowledge of 3D printing and moreover, would also probably not be far off the mark from the average salary of the graduating students at Columbia's business school whom Buffett was addressing with the original quote.Sticking with our example, if you were to go ahead and apply Buffett's 10x multiple against 3D System's 2,600 employees at average annual earnings of $100,000, this would imply that the value of the human capital currently employed by the company may actually be, in fact, worth something closer to $2.6 billion, nearly double the firm's current $1.4 billion market capitalization.A $2.6 billion value for the firm equates to about $21.14 per share or 71% upside from Friday's closing price of $12.38.Of course, one of the issues in using this type of logic would be if the firm had to provide an immediate return to its suppliers of capital.Bondholders, for example, are going to demand regular interest payments on the capital they've loaned to the firm.There's simply no feasible way to accomplish this by way of liquidating the value of the firm's human capital (besides laying workers off).The good news, however, is that given DDD at present has no (net) financial obligations (and minimal capital requirements for that matter), this issue becomes something of a non-starter.Perhaps then, this is why when DDD has turned to capital markets to provide financing in the past, it opted to issue equity (which does not require regular cash distributions) as opposed to debt.As far as those shareholders are concerned, maybe they're more than happy to forgo the benefit of a smaller, nominal dividend in exchange for the prospect that 3D Systems will be able to reinvest those funds towards the goal of innovating a revolutionary technology that will one day pave the way towards a much larger firm with the capability to provide more traditional returns to future shareholders in the form of profits, dividends, or share repurchases.Some readers may recall the ""clientele effect.""Source: Investopedia (paraphrased)The clientele effect helps to explain the manner in which the stage in a company's life cycle and the nature of its business operations have the propensity to attract - and dissuade - certain types of investor.Given all of the above, maybe an approach to valuation that emphasizes the potential value of DDD's future earnings held within its available human capital is the more appropriate approach to follow.It's just a theory…But there's more I like about this stock than just ""creative accounting""But to be perfectly honest with you, if the speculative value of DDD's human capital as outlined above were all this stock had going for it, that wouldn't be nearly enough to get me interested in DDD as a prospective trade or investment.Truth is, I happen to really like the current chart set up as well.For one, the DDD stock has twice previously exhibited strong support at levels below $20.The first was during 2016. After falling to $6 per share, the stock shot up more than 200% in less than six months, to $18.Then again towards the end of 2017, DDD stock was trading at a 52-week low of under $8, only to go on to mark a fresh 52-week high north of the $20 mark less than a year later, a 150% spike.However since then, DDD's shares have experienced a retracement - mind you nothing out of the ordinary.DDD stock has fallen approximately 42% from the 52-week high that was marked earlier this summer and now trades back at familiar levels around $12 per share (more on that below).Meanwhile, the fact that the second bottom ($8 per share) marked by the stock in 2017 was significantly higher than its 2016 low ($6 per share), is considered to be a bullish indicator for DDD stock.And if the shares were to indeed bottom out at $12 this time around, that third consecutive ""higher low"" would similarly provide bullish confirmation of the pattern that would (in theory) be beginning to develop in the company's share price.There's at least some reason to believe that could end up being the case.Below, we can see that DDD stock has demonstrated solid support at $12 twice previously within the past five months.The first time was in late July. After falling just shy of 20%, DDD stock would go on to rally 75% over the month that followed.More recently in the fourth quarter, the stock fell 29% on Q3 earnings but has since gone on to stabilize itself somewhat in the $12 region.Will it happen again?There's simply no way of telling for sure.That's particularly true in light of the fact that DDD doesn't pay any kind of dividend or return any cash flows to its shareholders.In fact, there's nothing to say that it wouldn't be possible that rather than taking off to $20 - or higher - that DDD stock falls back down to $8 per share, its 2016 lows - or worse.Not helping either is that the XLK, SPDR's Technology Sector ETF, is down 11% since the fourth quarter began, including a decided move below its 200-day trading average.I do however find this illustration of DDD's MACD particularly compelling:That alone wouldn't be enough to get me to jump into the DDD stock either, but the combination of (at least in my view) strong 'speculative' value along with some decent technical qualities tell me this may not actually be the worst idea in the world right now.Mind you I don't even hold a terribly bullish outlook for markets these days, but if this much anticipated (or at least much speculated about) ""Santa Claus Rally"" were to take hold in time for us to close out 2018 on a positive note, maybe just maybe, there will be a DDD stock certificate waiting for me below the Christmas with a couple of extra bucks beside it.Happy Holidays."
4077357,81916,2017-05-31T10:17:55-04:00,"DDD has inexplicably rallied over 50% after missing Q117 earnings (revenues were roughly inline) a couple of weeks ago.Investors seem to be infatuated again with 3D Printing stocks despite tepid or non-existent growth.Oncoming competition from HP will make even their mundane 3% organic revenue growth guidance for this year tough to maintain going forward.Are we again in 2013 when there was no price too high to pay for the opportunity to own a sliver of the exciting 3D printing growth opportunity?The industry, amazingly, remains GAAP unprofitable 3-4 years after the height of the 3D printing bubble despite significant revenues.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has, in our view, inexplicably rallied over 50% since reporting Q117 earnings a couple of weeks ago; these are no longer the halcyon days of 3D printing so we are scratching our head as to what's going on here. Was their quarter that great? After looking at it every which way, the answer is simply ""No.""They reported Revenues/non-GAAP EPS of $156.4M/$0.06 vs. consensus $155.8/$0.10. The EPS miss on essentially inline revenues was a function of higher than Street modeled OpEx, which isn't that surprising given the company gives no formal quarterly guidance at this point. To cut to the chase, I believe the name is a no-brainer short at this point.Key reasons why it's a short now/ASAP- For roughly 3% organic revenue growth (guidance is ~5% growth but they've already acquired a company which they say will add ~2%), investors are now paying about 40x EV/non-GAAP EBIT (and roughly 40x non-GAAP earnings as their non-GAAP tax rate is minimal).- Despite the fact that DDD hasn't grown in years (Revenues: CY14 $654M, CY15 $662M, CY16 $633M, CY17E $662M), investors are still giddy enough to put a high growth multiple on what looks to me at best a GDP (or likely lower) top line grower.- Industry sources (namely 'IDC') cite a double-digit annualized industry growth rate, so clearly, DDD is a share loser.- New CEO (from HP) has done a good job of cutting a bloated cost structure over the last year-plus since arriving. We believe this dynamic has likely run its course, reflected in an uptick in R&D spend last quarter and a resulting bottom line miss in Q117- Recent insider selling has emerged by a director who has been a savvy buyer in the recent past.- A January 2017 acquisition of Vertex appears to be more of a revenue buy, than a logical synergistic acquisition given a low percentage of revenues derived from 3D printing.Expanding on the points aboveDDD has guided to 2%-8% revenue growth in 2017, including approximately 200bps from their Vertex acquisition, putting organic growth in the neighborhood of 3% at the mid-point of guidance. For a supposed growth industry and a stock that is clearly valued as such, this somehow doesn't make much sense to us. In three years (despite acquisitions along the way), DDD will have grown 1.2% (not CAGR, total). Find me another growth stock with sub-0.5% top line CAGR over 3 years!So we're left with a company growing 3% organically in 2017 based on guidance (and <1% CAGR over the last 3 years despite acquisitions) trading at ~40X an untaxed EV/Earnings (or EBIT). I'd be happy to fill up my short book all day with dozens of names that fit that spectacular short profile.The relatively new CEO (Vyomesh Joshi) has done a good job of cutting costs, but these improvements are starting to show diminishing returns. In the most recent quarter, DDD showed 5% non-GAAP EBIT margins vs. 3% a year ago (on 3% top line growth). Hardly impressive.Third-party research sees the 3D printing market growing at a 20%+ CAGR, so clearly DDD is implicitly losing share.DDD Chairman Lowenbaum, to his credit, has been a savvy trader of his company's stock. In the last couple of weeks, he's sold 50K shares for a bit over $1MM after buying 20K shares at roughly half that price a year ago.After the new CEO took over, the company's historically disastrous M&A strategy had appeared to be over. Now, we get a Jan '17 Vertex acquisition. All the company has told us is that it's accretive (used $34M in cash and a de minimus amount of shares, so this is simply akin to saying that the acquired company is profitable and/or soon will be given the cash on DDD's balance sheet was earning roughly zero in interest).What we found most interesting about the recent Vertex acquisition (which is focused on materials) is that it was said on the call discussing the acquisition (1/31/17) that the acquired company had ""more than 10% came from 3D printing.""For a 3D printing company to acquire a company that derives less than 20% of revenues (given their quote we feel comfortable assuming that) of their revenues from actual 3D printing materials, we believe smacks of desperation and a buy that merely pads revenue.While they only claim it added about 2% to revenue, for a company struggling to show any revenue growth at all (~5% revenue growth at the mid-point is current guidance, which includes the Vertex acquisition), this matters and buying 2% of revenue to aid in showing growth is very noteworthy in an industry that is characterized by lumpy revenues due to systems that often cost several $MM each, and, thus, inherent unpredictability.RisksHigh short interest (23% of float) is the biggest risk I see here, though I'd point out it is roughly a third lower in terms of total shares short than where it's been at its highs over the last couple of years.M&A is always a risk, but I honestly can't imagine who would be dumb enough to buy them up here; there wasn't interest when the stock was in the single digits, so why now at $22 when numbers haven't gone up?ConclusionDDD is roughly a GDP-level grower (and has been below that for the last 3 years). While cost-cutting under new management has taken them back to a very modest level of profitability, given the lack of meaningful growth of profits, I struggle to see why this company should be valued at more than 15x-20x operating income to be generous. At the high end, that would put the shares at $12 based on 2017 guidance, which represents almost 50% downside.This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

4070738,102359,2017-05-08T15:35:17-04:00,"3D Systems has gone through the ""momentum stock gauntlet"" and come out the other side still intact.
        After it's great fall, the stock has recovered admirably and continues to improve technically.
        The chart is indicating a pending breakout.","The BackgroundQuite some time ago, I published an article about 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), making the case that after it's meteoric rise and subsequent fall, the stock presented quite a bit of upside. In my mind, DDD is the epitome of the classic momentum stock, battered and belittled, abandoned by the first round of investors and traders and band wagon jumpers and thus possibly representing a great opportunity. The greatness of this opportunity, of course, depends on the fundamentals of the company. Now, as always, this is debatable, but I said then and I still believe now that DDD is one of the strongest if not the strongest players in a nascent market with massive growth potential. They have plenty of cash and improving revenue and they continue to make headway in developing products for the health care industry, and area that could provide significant growth opportunities.In my analysis of the stock's chart, I concluded that the stock was in the process of developing a constructive base and was heading towards a breakout in the near to medium term. In the time that has passed, the chart has continued that formation and, in my view, only gotten better.The ChartsBelow is a long-term chart of DDD (six year weekly), just for some context.You can see the quite dramatic rise and fall and the following rebound which could have been thought to be a dead cat bounce, and would have been, if the company itself didn't still hold actual value and growth opportunity. It's this period of consolidation that has occurred after the rebound that I want to look into more in depth. To do that, we need to look at a few more charts.Here's a three year weekly chart:Take a look at the base the stock has hammered out for itself over the past year and change. To me, this is a clear consolidation pattern, and an indication of a breakout. Now this kind of pattern can occur prior to a upside breakout as well as a downside breakout, or a breakdown if you will. In this case, however, there are some convincing pieces of evidence to indicate the former is much more probable.First of all, and not at all technical, the nature of the business and the overall fundamental state of the company, which I touched on earlier. DDD isn't a dying business in a decaying industry, quite the opposite. Now, obviously the fact that DDD operates in a nascent industry with significant growth potential does nothing to indicate that the company isn't failing. But the valuation, balance sheet and the latest earnings report certainly do.And from a technical perspective, there is little reason to believe this consolidation is likely to lead to a breakdown. First of all, most if not all of the investors that jumped onto the stock when it was hot have since abandoned ship. They sold out in a flurry as the stock was falling apart the first time, obviously thus driving the plunge downward. Almost anyone who didn't get out then took the opportunity to get out after the stock rebounded back to almost $20 per share. That's in part why the stock again sold off so strongly and abruptly in April of last year. The last remaining hold outs have taken every opportunity to get out, while a new round of investors has gradually and continually filtered in, which is why the chart has formed the pattern it has. You can see more extended periods of buying on solid volume as the stock moves steadfastly upwards, and then when the stock reaches that resistance level (or perceived resistance level) in the high teens, it sells off quite sharply. Only to find support a bit higher than it did the previous time. This is a chart purging itself of the old guard, the profit takers, the followers.Now take a look at the one year daily chart:Here you can see in detail the buying and selling patterns I'm describing, and you can see the strong buying on significant volume that occurs off the gradually increasing lows. And take a look at last Thursday. It was an interesting day worth noting, as the candlestick formed a big hammer on fairly big volume. Followed up by a strong day on Friday, the stock looks poised to test that resistance level in the high teens once again.Whether or not this current test will be the one that finally breaks resistance is very tough to say, but it is certainly possible. I'm looking for the stock to make a move up to $19 or so, and if it pushes past that, I believe we will be looking at a chart that is breaking out with room to run."
4071001,21434,2017-05-09T08:14:31-04:00,"Lower costs and increasing demand finally make the 3D printer business profitable.
        DDD shares are indicating a lot of buying interest, setting up a breakout move.
        3D Systems is expected to swing to a GAAP profit this year.","To say the 3D printing craze was one of the market's biggest-ever investment disappointments would still be a considerable understatement. Industry mainstays like 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) saw their stocks rally as much as 1000% -- and in some cases, more -- over the course of 2012 and 2013 as the dream of 3D printing became a functional reality.None of those mainstay stocks are anywhere near where they were in late 2013 though. XONE shares are still down more than 80% from their peak price despite a measurable recovery effort beginning in late 2015. DDD shares are only 25% of their previous peak value, again, despite an respectable rally effort for the past year and a half.The problem? As it turns out, though companies and consumers are using (and buying) 3D printers. They just didn't adopt them at the pace being touted by the 3D printing industry's bulls in 2013... not even close. Frustrated investors threw in the towel, with most of them shelving 3D printer stocks forever.Big mistake. See, 3D printers and on-demand printing were never not a growth business. It's just that the expectations raced so far ahead of fiscal reality, a painful correction was inevitable.The question is, have you looked at this business and its stocks recently? Maybe it's time to put them both back on your radar.The Industry Tide is (Still) RisingContrary to popular belief, the 3D printer/printing industry is growing. It has been for a while, but is poised to explode in 2017 and beyond.It's an optimism that's been quantified by several entities. BP is one of them, recently opining the 3D printing industry would be worth roughly $9 billion this year, and reach $20 billion by 2020. Note on the chart below, however, that the industry's revenue has been on the rise since 2014.Data from BP, chart from betweener.esThe number jibes with Digital Engineering's recent look at the industry, which reckons a record-breaking 455,772 3D printers were shipped in 2016, roughly doubling 2015's count. That's nothing, however, compared to the 6.7 million 3D printers the organization expects to be shipped in 2020. Interestingly, Digital Engineering believes the market will be worth $16 billion in 2019, and worth $26.5 billion in 2021.Data and image from Digital EngineeringTechnavio sees compound annual growth in excess of 35% between 2016 and 2021 for all key users of 3D printers (healthcare, automotive, aerospace, consumer, etc).Point being, it was never a lack of growth opportunity that up-ended the industry's stocks. It was terrible timing. The hype came well before the business was hitting a critical mass... well before the world was ready to adopt a relatively new and relatively expensive technology.The market is ready now. That readiness just happens to coincide with a drastic decrease in the price of 3D printers.3D Systems Offers Proof of LifePerhaps just as important (if not more so), the industry's key names like Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and 3D Systems are seeing revenue growth finally turn into palatable profits.3D Systems' recent results paint the most representative picture of the 3D printer industry's turnaround. Though it missed its profitability estimates of 11 cents per share by posting a profit of only six cents per share, revenue was up 2.5% year-over-year, and did meet estimates. The GAAP net loss narrowed too. 3D Systems also reiterate its revenue guidance for growth of between 2% and 8%, and per-share operating profits of between 51 cents and 55 cents per share.Better still, the analyst outlook projects impressive revenue and earnings growth, driving 3D System to a valuation that's at least somewhat commensurate with market standards. DDD is priced at a forward-looking P/E of 30.6.Data from Thomson Reuters, chart made by authorWith all of that being said, though most investors have overlooked the agonizingly slow right-pricing of DDD shares and its peers, enough investors have taken notice to put the stock into a technical position that sets the stage for a breakout.Michael Sica-Lieber offers up the detailed technical analysis of the budding breakout effort here; consider this the abridged version of his take. That is, DDD has stabilized since early 2016, developing a wedge pattern that finally gave way on Monday with a very strong bullish thrust.Chart made with Schwab StreetSmart ProThough it's likely there will be some pushback and profit-taking, this squeeze has been brewing for a while, and is founded on the company's fundamental strength. Investors would be wise to take the clues at face value, though knowing it's unlikely 3D Systems shares will be able to move higher in a perfect straight line.Bottom LineWere it just the stock or even just the company's apparent progress, it might not be worth noting. The industry's tide is rising too, however. It has been since the beginning. What's new is that these companies -- and 3D Systems in particular -- are turning that rising tide into real earnings now that the supply and demand balance has been found as costs have come down. The euphoria too many investors were feeling in 2013 is the kind of excitement they should be feeling now. And, maybe they will. As was the case five years ago though, you don't want to be late to that party... a party which could restart sooner than you might think now that DDD shares are teasing us."

And the old that was exotic, is no more, or not exotic enough.Another problem is that eventually the technology becomes mainstream or even a commodity. Also, even if the sector continues to exhibit high growth, there will always be companies within the sector that will not perform well.Once this happens, multiples fall by a lot. And investors who bought high flying stocks, thinking they will retain their valuations forever, usually lose a lot of money. This is what has happened to the 3-D space.Investors have lost a lot of money buying 3D Systems (DDD), Stratasys (SSYS), Voxeljet (VJET) or ExOne (XONE) over the years. And in my opinion, most investors will never recoup their investment if they bought near the highs.DDD data by YChartsAnd while the above chart simply tells you that shares have come down by a lot, the chart below tells the story of why investors should never have bought these stocks to begin with, at the levels they did.DDD PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsTime and time again I caution investors not to buy any stock above 5X revenue, but very few listen. There are only a handful of stocks that can be bought above 5X revenue, and under very specific conditions (my opinion).On average, I have been a bear on the 3-D space for several years. Only slightly did I go long the sector with DDD, and that was mainly for trading purposes. (all my 3-D articles here).My problem was never the companies themselves, their products, or even management, but the valuation the market gave them. In other words, my beef is mainly with the market. The sector always traded at stratospheric valuations.Why 3D Systems might not recover soonIf you noticed DDD has been going up and down the past two years. While buy and hold did not make you money, swing trading did.DDD data by YChartsLike I said valuations have come down a lot. And even if DDD once traded as high as $90 a share, it still fell by 20% after its recent Q2'17 earnings report.And if you want to know the reason, the answer is in the recent press release:In other words, the company for several quarters now is guiding about the same revenue and not much in EPS. And if you want to see what the revenue growth picture looks like, the chart below is very enlightening:DDD Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsFolks the problem with DDD and the 3-D space in general, is that there is no growth anymore. I will not speculate if the problem is the sector or any company individually, I am simply pointing out to the facts.And in the case of DDD, this even after the company has done 10 acquisitions since 2014:DDD acquisitions since 2014 (source)Granted these are not big acquisitions, and are mostly technology related, however for a sector and a stock that was going to reinvent manufacturing as we know it, there is not much to show for it over the past 3 years.This market punishes stocks that exhibit no growth, no matter how much EPS you have (well almost). Time and time again I see stocks trading for very low valuations, just because a company is not growing.In the case of DDD, the market pushed down its valuation all the way to 1X revenue in 2016, from a once high-flying 17X revenue in 2014. Currently the stock trades at about 2.2X revenue.DDD data by YChartsUnfortunately, the problem is that we might see 1X revenue again as we did when the stock traded at about $7.50 in 2016. Especially if we see a general market correction.However I do think DDD deserved to go so low. And if DDD does correct once more to about $7.5 per share, it will be a great opportunity. And the reason is that DDD is not just a manufacturing company.DDD has an annuity based business model. In other words, it does not simply sell 3-D printers, but also software, materials and services that ensure a steady revenue flow. So irrespective of printer sales, the company has a steady revenue stream that should increase over time. This alone in my book is worth a little more than an average manufacturer, that simply makes stuff.Furthermore, the company is witnessing a customer shift from prototyping to production printing. While this is happening at a snail's pace, this might be the break DDD needs to dramatically increase revenue and profits in the future.Production printing will require more printers, materials, services, and software than prototyping. So this is something to follow closely and keep in mind, as a possible future driver for DDD.However this driver might be further out in the future, because management is not guiding for a substantial increase in overall revenue. While a revenue increase of 2% to 6% is better than nothing (as guided in Q2 by the company), it's not something that is signaling a huge increase in revenue, and thus an industry transformation from prototyping to production with 3-D printers (yet).Management however is guiding for adjusted EPS about $0.46 for 2017 (the same as 2016). While the P/E multiple based on this guidance is not cheap, nevertheless DDD is not losing money, which is something that might act as a pillow under the stock.Furthermore, the company's balance sheet is just fine. With current assets of $411M, almost double total liabilities of $221M, there are very few things than can go wrong balance sheet wise.So overall I like the company, the only problem is that it's not growing yet.While I think DDD has a lot of things going for it, unless the company exhibits growth, I do not see many reasons to buy the stock at current levels.The reason is, this market does not reward stock valuations unless you are growing.I would however be a buyer of DDD even without growth, if I can get it a substantial discount. I think that anywhere below $9 a share would be a good entry point and will eventually reward investors.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4048485,102459,2017-02-22T16:14:08-05:00,"Management's lack of guidance has made expectations unclear.As a result, Wall Street estimates seem to be too low.I will explain why I expect 3D Systems to outperform EPS expectations.","This article will attempt to predict the EPS number that 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) will report for its fourth quarter results that are due to be released next Tuesday (the 28th of February). Wall Street currently expects an EPS of $0.12. I will show why this estimate is too conservative and argue that an earnings beat is very likely.Getting startedIn order to get to the actual EPS number, I will start with an attempt to predict the total revenue 3D Systems will realize over the fourth quarter. Management does not give an accurate guidance for this. During the most recent earnings call, someone asked management about their expectations on Q4 sales relative to past historical seasonality and whether we should still see some seasonal sequential strength in sales in the upcoming quarter. This was their response:Predicting revenueBy ""typical sequential trends,"" management means a significant increase in sales compared to the third quarter. This is evident from this picture taken from the third quarter earnings presentation:If we look at last year's sequential revenue growth between the third and fourth quarter, we would see 21% growth. Simply assuming this same growth number on this year's third quarter revenue would result in an expected fourth quarter revenue of about $189mln. While 3D Systems certainly has had success in certain segments since the beginning of this year (as can be seen above), a revenue of $189mln would seem to be a bit much considering the earnings trend of this year's three reported quarters. Although its Healthcare Solutions, Materials and Software segments seem to be doing great, some other segments seem to be facing difficulty to generate revenue growth even though the number of units sold in fact do see growth.Therefore I believe that the fourth quarter will most certainly be the one where 3D Systems generates the highest amount of revenue (once again), but it would probably be a decent amount lower than last year's number of $189mln, considering the revenue trend we have seen so far this year. Just to be conservative I will lower last year's sequential growth number from 21% to 15%. This lower growth number would result in a more conservative revenue estimate of $180mln.Gross profitThe next step on our way to estimate EPS is calculate the gross profit number. This part is much simpler since management has spoken about their gross margin expectations for the second half of the year. Management expects second-half gross margin to stay around 51%.51% of $180mln would result in a gross profit of $91.44mln.Operating expenseAlthough not specifically mentioned, management did give us hints about the possible operating expenses. This part was also mentioned in the quote earlier stated in this article. Operating expenses are expected to be, at minimum, flat and possibly as high as slightly ""half-over-half."" In the first half of this fiscal year 3D Systems saw total operating expenses of $139.3mln. Since $64.7mln was spent on operating expenses in the third quarter this leaves us with about $74.6mln for the fourth quarter. In my calculations I shall use $75mln in operating expenses.$91.44mln - $75mln leaves us with $16.44mln.Tax payment and final estimateFor taxes management guided for $1mln to $2mln. I will use the highest number.$16.44mln - $2mln results in a net income of $14.44mln. Dividing this number by the total outstanding shares would result in an EPS estimate of $0.13, $0,01 higher than the current consensus.ConcludingNote that I have used conservative numbers in my estimation of the EPS. If, for example, I had used a slightly higher gross margin of 51.5% as management indicated would be a possibility, used operating expenses of $74.6mln and used the tax payment of $1mln instead of $2mln, the EPS estimate would have resulted in $0.15. Therefore I conclude that 3D Systems will most likely have no difficulty in meeting the Wall Street consensus of $0.12 and has a big possibility of beating the estimates."

Vertex-Global is a provider of 3D printing materials sold into the dental market for the creation of dental prosthetics under the Vertex and NextDent brands. DDD expects the deal to be ""immediately accretive"" to non-GAAP EPS. Vertex-Global sells to over 200,000 dentists and dental assistants and has regulatory approvals (for dental use) in over 70 countries, providing an established channel for DDD's 3D printers. The global dental implants and prosthetics market is expected to reach $12.32b by 2021, according to research firm MnM.DDD, which has been enjoying a bit of the Trump rally and the occasional acquisition rumor, is up 25.3% ytd (to $16.52 on 1 Feb. 2017) and up 32.7% since just before the 2016 election (52wk range: $7.78-19.75).What we expect/what is the potential risk/gain?This acquisition continues a busy period for DDD, which has issued a flurry of announcements over the prior months, including:We are positive on this acquisition, another sign of the continuing maturation of 3D printing, moving from being ""novel and glamorous"" to ""mundane and non-sexy,"" governed by more practical, positive ROI drivers as it becomes more mainstream. DDD is continuing to commercialize its software by going after market expansion in areas that are well beyond the initial 3D printing market - sorely needed as its revenues, like those of rival Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), have remained essentially flat-to-down of late.We continue to believe DDD is well positioned long term to protect its market share and modestly re-accelerate revenue growth, particularly if it continues to diversify its product offering into adjacent manufacturing and training/simulation markets where its technology could be transformative.3D printing (which is only commoditizing at the low end) and 3D software applied to virtual and augmented reality (which is not commoditizing) both hold tremendous long-term potential.However, we expect 2017 will continue to be transitional for DDD, which faces some significant challenges moving forward, including stiff competition from emerging rivals, such as Carbon3D, as well as established players SSYS and HP (NYSE:HPQ), the latter of which is expected to focus more intently on the 3D printing market in 2017. HP had once been rumored as a potential acquirer of DDD; however, we believe that firms such as Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) and GE (NYSE:GE) may be better suited, especially for DDD's 3D software assets.ISRG presently has a $26.93b market cap, a solid cash balance, limited debt, and relatively flat Y/Y growth, and is capable of helping expand 3D Systems' market position in the medical vertical where DDD is also strong and has complementary products, especially in software. GE has already acquired two 3D printing companies (Arcam AB and SLM Solutions Group) and knows how to leverage the technology on an industrial scale.Our RecommendationsIn advance of the 4Q 2016 earnings release (est. 13 March 2017), we have taken short-term profits and trimmed our position (in our Samadhi Capital Partners' client portfolios), though we remain positive on our long-term (5yr) outlook for DDD.- Samadhi Position: OWN in the ""Samadhi 16,"" our High-Conviction Category in the Samadhi Capital Partners Client Portfolios."

Its recent rally though has brought it back into bubble territory despite it being down ~80% off its all-time highs four years ago. The stock today still trades at a multiple of 3x sales and ~33x non-GAAP EBIT for a company that has produced no growth in four years and has cut expenses to the bone, meaning bottom line margins are maxed out for now (this was demonstrated in its Q1 miss based on OpEx over-runs; our article on Q1 discussed). We'll repeat ourselves here on the numbers from our last article: (Revenues: CY14 $656M, CY15 $666M, CY16 $633M, CY17E $662M). This represents an annual CAGR of approximately zero over four years. We'll say less than 1% to be fair, i.e. less than GDP growth either in the US or worldwide.What prompted this update?You may be asking why we're writing only a month and a half later on the same company which we correctly recommended shorting at the time (down ~15%). Fair question. The answer is simple. We still believe the company is massively overvalued the more work we do. We believe the competitive threat that will most evidently start to emerge for DDD's new CEO, former HP executive in printing (Vyomesh I Joshi, goes by ""VJ"") are competition (not ironically really) from HP (NYSE:HPQ). Why would a printer company with $Bs at stake cede a market...especially when a competitor is now piloted by one of its former middle-execs? It wouldn't. Our channel checks have turned up several notables items. Before getting into them specifically, 3D printing is predominantly in two categories: (""SLS"" or Selective Laser Sintering and ""SLA"" or Stereolithography). Now onto the key points here:SummaryShort and sweet. A tech-driven bull market has sent shares of DDD up to insane levels. Hyped as recently as Friday on CNBC Fast Money by Brian Kelly, we're in stupid bubble territory still I'm safe in saying. At over 35 untaxed non-GAAP EBIT for no growth, any company is insanely valued, but especially one with the noted headwinds. I can't think of a worse place to put long capital (if I were forced) across my short book than DDD."

Product sales have slowed down. Stratasys attributed the slowdown to a ""challenging AM environment, driven primarily by weak investment in capital equipment by customers within key verticals"". (Source: Company Filings SEC.gov)On November 15th, 2016, Stratasys reported its Q3 2016 earnings. The report showed that product revenue had dropped by 7% compared to a year ago. Within the total product revenue for the quarter, system revenue declined by 20% compared to the same quarter last year.Exhibit 1: Stratasys Revenue from Products and Service Q3 2016 (Source: Company Filings, SEC.gov)3D Systems did not do much better. Its quarterly (Q3 2016) product revenue was down 6% Y-o-Y. It even showed weakness in revenue from on-demand parts.Exhibit 2: 3D Systems Q3 2016 Revenue Drivers and Quarterly Y-o-Y Growth Rate (Source: Company Filings, SEC.gov)3D printer manufacturers are trying to weather the slowdown in product sales by bulking up their services especially manufacturing services. There are multiple advantages to doing this:Companies are following various paths towards this goal of diversifying their revenue streams. Let's look at the service revenue streams of Stratasys and 3D Systems.StratasysIn 2015, Stratasys formed Stratasys Direct Manufacturing (SDM), a paid-parts service from three service companies:Stratasys was able to increase services revenue by $40 million in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to inclusion of full year of Solid Concepts and Harvest revenues. Gross profit margins for services revenue decreased to 33.6% in 2015 as compared to 38.5% in 2014.Exhibit 3: Stratasys Revenue from Operating Segments and Growth Rate for FY 2015 (Source: Company Filings, SEC.gov)Exhibit 4: Stratasys Gross Profit from Each Operating Segment for FY 2015 (Source: Company Filings, SEC.gov)Exhibit 5: Stratasys Gross Profit Margins for Operating Segments (Source: Company Filings, SEC.gov)Stratasys had a massive decline in total gross profit which it attributed to impairment charges of $191.4 million related to some of its intangible technology assets and a decrease in product net sales.Stratasys had sold a total of 146,024 units globally in 2015. This number included about 98,579 units from MakerBot. Lately, the consumer printer market has shown tremendous weakness. 3D Systems exited the consumer market to focus solely on its industrial customers. Exiting that market may not be an option for Stratasys in the short term given that it accounts for a larger slice of the revenues.The services operating segment of Stratasys combines the revenue from the following:Exhibit 6: Stratasys Annual Revenue from Services and Growth Rate (Source: Company Filings, SEC.gov)Exhibit 7: Stratasys Revenue from Products and Services (Source: Company Filings SEC.gov)Exhibit 8: Stratasys - Services as a Percentage of Annual Total Sales (Source: Company Filings - SEC.gov)Exhibit 9: Stratasys Quarterly Services Revenue and Growth Rate (Source: Company Filings - SEC.gov)Exhibit 10: Stratasys Revenue Break-up between Products and Services Six Months 2016 (Source: Company Filings, SEC.GOV)Exhibit 11: Stratasys Revenue Break-up Between Products and Services Six Months 2015. (Source: Company Filings, SEC.gov)Moving forward, Stratasys Direct Manufacturing would derive its strength from its size and global reach. Its weakness is that it was relatively late in emphasizing manufacturing services compared to 3D Systems and had to rely on acquisitions to increase scale. It will have to develop domain expertise in key verticals such as healthcare and aerospace and show some great sales wins. It's time for it to show organic growth.3D SystemsThe services operating segment of 3D Systems combines revenue from the following:Exhibit 12: 3D Systems Annual Revenue from Services (Source: Company Filings - SEC.gov)Exhibit 13: 3D Systems Revenue from Products and Service (Source: Company Filings - SEC.gov)3D Systems has focused on the healthcare vertical to help grow its services revenue. Its healthcare revenue includes sales of products, materials and services for health-related applications, including simulation, training and planning, and printing of surgical instruments and medical and dental devices. The 3D Systems chart shows the total revenue from healthcare segment that includes product sales.Exhibit 14: 3D Systems Quarterly Healthcare Revenue and Y-o-Y Growth Rate (Source: Company Filings, SEC.gov)Exhibit 15: 3D Systems Revenue Break-up Products, Materials and Services for Nine Months 2016 (Source: Company Filings, SEC.gov)Exhibit 16: 3D Systems Revenue Break-up Products, Materials and Services for Nine Months 2015 (Source: Company Filings, SEC.gov)3D Systems has been able to rely on healthcare for a steady stream of revenue. It's a key focus area for the management and it will be a challenge for it to continue growing its healthcare revenues while building a customer base in aerospace and automobile.ConclusionIt is an extremely challenging sales environment for 3D printer manufacturers. Manufacturing services has become a critical revenue driver. Beyond short-term revenue benefits, manufacturing services helps in building expertise, mind share and reputation. By using services, a customer is able to try 3D printing for end-use parts without making millions in capital expenditure. The size and global reach of both Stratasys and 3D Systems offer them an advantage that smaller players lack. 3D Systems has built valuable expertise in healthcare applications. Its challenge will be to continue growing it while building expertise in other areas. Stratasys was late in realizing the importance of manufacturing services, but has caught up by making acquisitions. Its challenge is to win over customers for their services. Since both these companies have been prudent to diversify their revenue base they may be able to weather this storm of lower product sales and become strong players in the long run."

Many companies in the industry saw revenue growth come to a abrupt standstill in 2015. Stratasys saw its revenue drop (Stratasys 2015 Annual Report, Page 4) from $750 million in 2014 to $695 million in 2015. ExOne saw its revenue drop from $43 million in 2014 to $40 million in 2015 (The ExOne Company 2015 Annual Report, Page 31). In comparison, 3D Systems saw a modest 1.9% increase in revenue in 2015. The growth struggles of 2015 for the entire industry can be blamed on increased competition, slower growth in adoption of 3D printing, and on the relative sluggishness in the global economy. The chart below shows the annual revenue and growth rate for 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) from the years 2010 to 2015.Exhibit 1: 3D Systems Annual Revenues and Growth Rate 2010 - 2015 (Source: SEC.GOV)In my opinion, 3D Systems will have more pain rest of 2016 and into 2017. Some of the reasons of the pain are:New Management TeamIncreased CompetitionExhibit 2: 3D Printing Market Expected Growth Rate and Size of the Manufacturing Sector (Source: HP Inc., Analyst Day Slides, October, 2016)Uncertain, Slow Growth of World EconomyStrategic Vision and Business Segments3D Systems has a laid out a vision to focus on 3D printers that can be used to manufacture end-use parts. They plan to achieve this by offering a product portfolio that ""enhances a customers' workflow from design to manufacturing"" ( 2015 Annual Report).Exhibit 3: From Design to Manufacturing and various 3D Systems Products in each step. (Source: 3D Systems 2016 Investor Presentation)Exhibit 4: 3D Systems Operating Segments. (Source: 3D Systems Company Filings - SEC.GOV)The management is aiming to gain leadership in producing metal parts using direct metal printing. In January 2016, they introduced a high-precision, high-throughput metal printer called ProX DMP 320. This printer has models that are optimized for printing with titanium, stainless steel or nickel alloys.Exhibit 5: ProX DMP 320 Metal Printer (Source: 3D Systems)In the same month, they had also introduced a MultiJet Printer (MJP) series called ProJet MJP 3600 that increases the throughput to print more parts while at the same time printing parts with finest details.Exhibit 6: ProJet MJP 3600 Series - High Throughput for More Productivity (Source: www.3dsystems.com)The main industrial segments they are targeting for bulk of their revenue from products such as these are:Exhibit 7: 3D Systems Customers by Industrial Segment (Source: 3D Systems 2016 Investor Presentation)The challenge for 3D Systems is that every other 3D printing company is targeting the same industry segments. This can lead to increased pricing pressure on products and lower margins.ProductsGrowing product sales are critical to 3D Systems. Product sales will lead to increased sales of materials and services. Most people are familiar with the razor-and-blades business model. 3D Systems business is very similar to that with one exception. In the razor-and-blades business model, the base unit is sold at or below cost and most of the profit is made from selling the consumable. In this case, given the high price of a 3D printers, it would not be wise to sell below cost with the expectation of making-up the loss by selling more materials and services. But, material sales have a higher gross margin of 75%. So, 3D Systems can be wildly successful if they can find the sweet-spot of product pricing that would help them gain market share. Once they gain the market share, they can continue selling materials and services. 3D printing can be a very sticky business once customers have bought into the ecosystem of hardware, software and materials. This strategy is easier said than done given that pricing is one of the toughest things in business to get right.Exhibit 8: Various Categories of Products Sold by 3D Systems (Source: Source: 3D Systems Company Filings - SEC.GOV)Exhibit 9: 3D Systems Product Operating Segment Revenue. (Source: 3D Systems Company Filings - SEC.GOV)As a percentage of total revenue, product segment fell to 34% in first six months of 2016 compared to 39% in the same period of 2015.Exhibit 10: Percentage of Total Revenue from Each Business Segment in First Six Months of 2016Exhibit 11: Percentage of Revenue from Each Business Segment First Six Months of 2015Gross margin is a metric that I watch closely across all the companies. The product gross margins took a huge hit in 2015 (see exhibit below) that the company attributed to lower sales of 3D printers and to cash and non-cash charges of approximately $27.4 million related to their shift away from consumer products. The first half of 2016 saw gross profit margin for products improve to 32%. This metric should be closely watched in upcoming quarters to gain insights into pricing, product mix and competition.Exhibit 12: 3D Systems Gross Margin Percentage (Source: 3D Systems Company Filings - SEC.GOV)MaterialsAs the chart above shows, materials operating segment has seen a 200 basis points improvement in gross margins and services has seen over 400 basis points improvement in 2015 compared to 2013.Chuck Hull ( Founder of 3d Systems and the inventor of stereolithography) in a recent meeting described 3D Systems as a materials company. What he meant was that research on materials is critical to the success of the company. Most of the materials sold by 3D Systems is proprietary. It seems like there are generic materials you could buy from other sources, but using those materials would void the warranty on the machines.Exhibit 13: Different Types of Materials Sold by 3D Systems (Source: 3D Systems Company Filings - SEC.GOV)Exhibit 14: 3D Systems Annual Revenue from Materials Operating Segment (Source: 3D Systems Company Filings - SEC.GOV)ServicesExhibit 15: Various Categories of Services Offered by 3D Systems (Source: 3D Systems Company Filings - SEC.GOV)Services has done well even in a dismal year such as 2015, growing by 22% compared to the previous year and making-up for the drop in revenue in other segments. Healthcare seems to be a competitive advantage for 3D Systems. Total healthcare revenue, which includes products, materials and services, increased by 11.4% to $38.8 million for the quarter ending June 20, 2016. It made-up 24.5% of the total revenue for the quarter.3D Systems offers a solution to surgeons called Virtual Surgical Planning that utilizes medical image data to accurately plan surgery in a computer environment and then transferring that virtual plan to the patient using customized instruments. 3D Systems also offers medical prototyping and manufacturing services that involve printing of medical and dental devices.There is increased competition among 3D printing companies in the healthcare space. If 3D Systems can keep the leadership position and gain market share, it could be a sustainable advantage for the company.Exhibit 16: 3D Systems Annual Revenue from Services (Source: 3D Systems Company Filings - SEC.GOV)Research & Development3D printing technology is rapidly evolving. Companies are racing to improve print speeds, quality, strength and accuracy. So, 3D Systems will have to make large investments in R & D or acquisitions or do both at the same time to remain competitive. R & D expense is growing at a rapid clip. In 2015, 3D systems spent nearly $93 million in R & D. This is another metric to watch closely to measure the growth rate of this expense compared to revenue. In 2015, R & D expense was nearly 14% of total revenue.Exhibit 17: 3D System Annual R & D Expense and Growth Rate (Source: 3D Systems Company Filings - SEC.GOV)Exhibit 18: R & D Spending as Percentage of Annual Revenue (Source: 3D Systems Company Filings - SEC.GOV)Number of Outstanding sharesExhibit 19: Weighted Average Number of Outstanding Shares (Basic) (Source: 3D Systems Company Filings - SEC.GOV)For the six months that ended on June 30 th, 3D Systems had a per share loss of $0.20 (GAAP). But, if and when they return to profitability, this metric and the diluted number of shares metric should be watched closely for the impact on earnings per share. They have been issuing restricted stock to their employees and that is increasing the share count in recent years.ConclusionThe next six to eight quarters are very critical for 3D Systems. It may be a sign to buy if they can show revenue and profitability growth against heightened competition in the next four quarters. Some of the competitors would not survive as independent organizations. 3D Systems could also be acquired. But, prospect of acquisition should not be the primary reason for buying a stock. The strong run-up in the stock this year (from $6.42 in January of 2016 to close to $14 today) is not based on fundamentals, but on acquisition prospects. For example, GE has shown interest in acquiring 3D printer companies. If you bought at the 52-week low, it may be prudent to take some profits now before they report earnings in November.I would consider buying the stock between $8 and $10 per share. At that price, 3D Systems would have a market capitalization of around $900 million to $1.1 billion on annual revenue of around $620 million. It would still be a speculative buy given the competition and the fast changing world of 3D printing. There's a lot going on at 3D Systems. So, closely watch the earnings report on November 3 rd, 2016 before the opening bell."
4037351,59621,2017-01-17T12:47:39-05:00,"Delocalizing production broke America’s edge on manufacturing.The loss of high paying jobs also broke America’s social organization and, in the end, resulted in Trump’s election.The border tax is the main threat stemming from Trump’s populist agenda. It has the potential to influence US companies to produce more at home.Manufacturing in the US cannot be dependent on low wage jobs, it will have to depend on new tech being adopted in the production process.The border tax will be a game changer for several companies associated with production tech.","Photo credit: Creative ToolsThe case for smartfacturingThis article was to be about Nike (NYSE:NKE) and its innovative manufacturing process Flyknit. But then, Flyknit's efficiency and smoothness made me realize that its concept could be extended to the rest of US manufacturing. As Elon Musk has put it so well, US companies need to rethink the machine that builds the machine.Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO has been struggling with production issues, so he knows what he's talking about. In order to improve production efficiency, his staff has been forced to rethink and reorganize the whole production process to build a car. From the logistics to the factory floor, every notion has been challenged and revisited.This might seem obvious, but, during the last decades, the main improvements in factory productivity didn't come from adopting newer and better technology, it came from delocalizing production to the third world. However, the production arbitrage through cheap labor countries might have reached its limit. Unintended consequences in the western world have produced sociological factors that are coming into play. Long-term unemployment and low paying jobs in so-called prosperous countries have brought a populist and protectionist wave that will slow the convergence between the first and third worlds.Therefore, further gains in productivity will have to come from other sources like the aforementioned technological advances. This includes, among others, the fields of data processing, autonomous robotics, additive manufacturing and connectivity being applied to manufacturing. The end result is expected to be higher cost efficiency and higher production flexibility.The ability to increase flexibility of the factory floor will bring two related advantages. Firstly, higher flexibility will allow the production of different objects without having to incur heavy retooling expenditures. This fact alone provides the possibility of economically producing small batches of a given product. Secondly, small batches of a given product allow a high degree of customization, which will offer new business models possibilities.We have already mentioned several science fields with breakthroughs during the last decades but that failed to find their way into the factory floor (though some high-tech specialized companies have been using them for long). This happened, in part, due to the trend toward production arbitrage during the 1990s and the 2000s. Now that the need for cost-effective onshore production due to a protectionist wave is on the rise, we might get the incentive to update the factory floor with recent tech. The recipe has always been the same: as technology improves, new production processes become possible, creating room for additional business model possibilities.Trump's role in US manufacturing renaissanceTrump's victory is the symbol of the Americans' revolt against a society converging with the third world through higher unemployment and lower living standards. The President-elect had the merit of reading the public's anxiety accordingly and addressing the main perceived problem: manufacturing delocalization. Analysts suggest that there is nothing like manufacturing to create jobs, each manufacturing job has the ability to generate up to 2.9 additional jobs. In high-tech manufacturing, the figures are even brighter, we are talking about up to 16 additional jobs.It shouldn't come as a surprise that the President-elect wants to protect US manufacturing in order to restore the virtuous cycle between production, innovation and better paying jobs. The threat of a border tax has been waived constantly against companies announcing intentions delocalizing.The alternative for corporations is to keep production onshore and re-engineer production processes to increase productivity and flexibility of capital-intensive production tools. The border tax is key at this point. It might be the economic incentive needed to incentivize US corporations to keep and even add in-house production.Companies making labor arbitration, through cheap work in East Asia, will have to adapt. As I mentioned before, one way to do it is through the introduction of automation, additive manufacturing, data processing and connectivity. In this article, I'll be focusing on additive manufacturing.The role of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and the 3D printing industryIn my opinion, 3D Systems is one of the companies better positioned to profit from this new environment. Before 2016, 3D Systems' was focused in growing its mass market printing business. However, expectations weren't fulfilled and the company ended up replacing the CEO in early 2016. Vyomesh Joshi, a veteran executive from HP Printing business unit, took the helm of the company and redefined the strategy. Here are some of VJ's remarks:I've stated in previous articles that I agree with this strategy. However, now it makes even more sense. If Trump succeeds with his border tax threat and he is able to enforce US companies to produce at home, then additive manufacturing will have its place in many factory floors. In this case, 3D Systems will have changed its strategy at the right time without even realizing it.Investment RationaleLast year wasn't great for 3D Systems. The company fired the CEO in the beginning of 2016, and this kind of moves tends to leave scars and destabilize organizations. This is especially true in the 3D printing industry, where the rate of technological development is key to survival. When industry leaders in growth industries get into internal convulsions, smaller competitors tend to take advantage from them.3D Systems used and abused issuing shares to finance acquisitions. Now that the stock price has crumbled, this strategy is no longer viable. The company's management has repeatedly mentioned at conference calls that cost cutting will serve to finance strategic investments in order to remain cash-flow positive.In this context, Trump's border tax has all the potential to be a game changer for 3D Systems. It might work as a catalyst for sales in the manufacturing unit, spurring a growth wave in sales of 3D printing devices for production. Since, 3D Systems has been profitable every year but 2015 (and probably 2016) a significant increase in demand for printers will likely lead to profitability once again. I believe the market will be fast to incorporate this fact once it becomes evident that the border tax is acting as a catalyst.There is one negative factor that may offset part of the sales gain. The sourcing of materials and components used by the company is hard to trace with precision. Therefore, we should keep in mind that 3D Systems might come to suffer from the border tax in its own operations. I believe the net effect will still be positive for 3D Systems because the main manufacturing facilities are located in the US but I cannot sustain this claim beyond this reasoning.Why 3D Systems?A good part of the accumulated goodwill from acquisitions (a trademark of the leaders in the sector) has been written off already, which means that the balance sheet now has a lower probability of generating unpleasant surprises.The liquidity position seems adequate. The acid-test ratio is above 2 and the cash flow from operating activities has oscillated from slightly positive to slightly negative. If we add the low debt profile, the company seems to have enough cash to face the following quarters. Therefore, survival doesn't seem to be an eminent risk.Graph 1 - 3D Systems vs. S&P 500 since the US Presidential election (Source: Google Finance)I'm taking an opportunistic position here. The company has a good portfolio of technology and it has been profitable in recent years. Trump's protectionist wave has the potential to be the driver for growth in 3D Systems' sales. Looking at Graph 1, the market seems to be overlooking this aspect and it has failed to significantly price in this possible development. In part, the market must be assuming that the border tax won't be easily approved.My take here is the risk is asymmetric. The market has not reflected Trump's border tax in the company's stock price. Therefore, if it fails to have a material impact on 3D Systems' sales, shares should not suffer much. However, if the border tax increases demand for 3D printers, shares should rise significantly."
4006391,54332,2016-09-15T09:35:37-04:00,3D Systems Corporation is facing hard competition in 3D printing industry and it is suffering from declining revenues.Weakening financial metrics and high stock price volatility make it hardly a suitable investment for those seeking stable income.The most beneficial development for DDD seems to be a merger with one of comparable competitors or a takeover by one of industry giants.,"Competition in 3D printing and related products is very strong with those like HP (NYSE:HPQ), GE (NYSE:GE) and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) among the participants. The industry was booming in 2013, but after some cool-down it now needs a new momentum. Meanwhile, sales are decreasing - in 6m2016, 3D Systems Corp.'s (NYSE: DDD) revenue in key ""Products"" segment (3D printing equipment) dropped the most significantly (by 18.4%). At the same time, demand for supplementary services is more resilient - so that ""Services"" segment sales declined only by 1.6% (supported by growing precision healthcare segment, e.g. development of artificial joints) and ""Materials"" segment grew by 7.5%. ""Materials"" are also by far the most marginal segment (gross profit margin equaled 77.2% for 6m2016 compared with 50.2% for ""Services"") so its faster growth should contribute positively to future net income increase. Geographic composition of DDD's revenues is quite typical for a hi-tech company with a focus on developed countries - 53% of sales in 6m2016 were derived from Americas and 13% from Germany. Foreign currencies' risks are therefore not a significant threat for DDD.Declining demand for DDD's manufactured products is also evidenced by a sharp growth in finished goods and parts (grew by 23.9% from end-2015) to 8.1% of total assets (compared to 4.7% (adjusted for goodwill impairment in 2015) of total assets at end-2014). Such increase indicates a decline in inventories turnover ratio (from 6.8x in 2014 to 5.0x in the first half of 2016) and less efficient business processes.Uncertain market perspective is visible more clearly from massive impairment of goodwill and long-term intangible assets (most probably caused by unjustified forecasts of previously acquired subsidiaries). A $537 mln loss was the key reason for DDD's 2015 equity shrinking twice. At end-2Q16, DDD still had $329 mln (37.2% of its total assets) represented by goodwill and intangibles which may be subject for further write-offs. Such a course of events may have a large negative effect for DDD but $650 mln of equity represents a comfortable safety cushion.DDD's financial metrics are weakening. The slight improvement in net income for 6m2016 YoY ($22.4 mln loss vs. $26.9 mln loss in 6m2015) was caused by a decrease in intangibles amortization ($14.4 mln less) - so the company's performance actually decreased further. Nevertheless, in the first half of 2016, the company still paid solid $18.9 mln stock-based compensation to its executives (compared with $20.0 mln in 6m2015).DDD is not leveraged and has enough cash (19.9% of total assets at end-2Q16) to finance its ongoing operations. But raising funds for massive expansion can be difficult. At end-2Q16, DDD had $150 mln available under unutilized credit facility which imposed financial covenants on the company. Under the agreement, DDD's debt / EBITDA ratio cannot exceed 3.0x at the end of any quarter when any part of this facility is utilized. DDD doesn't disclose this ratio but we estimate average EBITDA at $5.7 mln per quarter for the first half of 2016. If low profitability is persistent, DDD will be able to raise only $16.2 mln of total debt under this agreement. This is another argument supporting possible takeover discussed below - it should be the most effective way of financing the company's expansion.Among the several really positive factors for DDD are [i] its focus on primary activities and high quality products and [ii] absence of serious litigation expense.Pricing and dividends of DDD are also not favorable for stable income-minded investors. According to its 10-Q for 2Q16, DDD ""currently does not pay, and has not paid, any dividends on its common stock, and currently intends to retain any future earnings for use in its business."" The above-mentioned credit facility also imposes $30 mln per year limit to cash dividends - and given current market capitalization of $1.7 bn this would imply maximum dividend yield of modest 1.8%. The stock is also very volatile which is confirmed by large beta (1.63) - although in 2016 price has rebounded from a sharp fall (from 2011 to 2014 it rose 8.9 times and in 2015 it dropped again to 0.83 of 2011 level). Now DDD is trading at 1.3 multiple to end-2010 price. All these factors make it highly possible that total return on this stock will vary greatly.Given its established (although currently not profitable) business model, DDD can be an attractive takeover target for a large company which could give its sales a boost and economies of scale. DDD and some of its rivals are rumored to be among M&A targets but the perspective is highly uncertain.DDD is not rated by any of major credit rating agencies."
4013455,102359,2016-10-20T10:56:13-04:00,"3D Systems was one of the hottest stocks of 2012 and 2013.
        After the hype wore off and the story weakened, it was punished severely by the market.
        Now it has emerged on the other side of the hype cycle and is much more modestly priced.
        The chart is showing a strong basing pattern and there is a strong case to be made, from a technical perspective, of significant upside from here.","Even the most casual investor knows the name 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD), as it was one of the hottest stocks of 2012 and 2013, climbing from the high single digits all the way to its peak of nearly $100 per share in early January 2014. You can see on the chart below that DDD was basically a ruler stock for two years.Since then, however, the stock has given back a large majority of those gains, experiencing a disastrous 2014 and 2015. Sentiment, once giddily positive, was unsurprisingly negative over the last couple of years as well.However, 2016 has proven to be much more productive for the stock. After a rough start, DDD's stock price is up over 80% year-to-date.The question is: after such a meteoric rise and a painful fall, what's the story the now?Anatomy of a hype stockAll hype stocks share a fundamental characteristic in common: Their demand is fueled by a powerful and often overly optimistic narrative which is not supported by reality.As more investors pile in and the price of the shares increase, the divergence between the value of the company (as represented by its trading price) and the value of the company (as represented by its fundamentals) increases. Eventually, such a stock becomes extremely overpriced and there is simply no more buying demand (no more buyers who want a piece of the story).Selling then overcomes buying and the stock price moves down. As it does, more investors begin to sell and take their profits, eventually snowballing into a torrent of selling.As the stock price falls apart, so does the accepted narrative. So now a stock that was fueled upwards by optimism untethered by reality gets pushed downwards by pessimism that is equally as untethered.This is exactly what happened with DDD.When stocks like DDD become interesting, especially from a technical perspective, is when they emerge on the other side of the inevitable fall.After the fallAfter making some management changes and dropping its consumer products operations and refocusing on where the real growth opportunities are, most recently in state-of-the art healthcare solutions, the company seems to be better positioned than ever before. The basic narrative has not changed: 3d printing technology is still in its nascent phase and likely to become a game-changer in manufacturing and healthcare , with a vast amount of potential applications. The only thing that has changed is that the hype is over. Moreover, besides Stratasys, Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS), DDD still has no real competition in this space.Most importantly, the technical picture continues to improve. Let's look at it and start with a longer-term view. Below is a three-year chart.As you can see, after the stock price bottomed out in late January of this year (getting as low as $6 per share), DDD rallied strongly, reaching almost $20 per share. In doing so, it broke the primary downtrend and signaled the start of a reversal. Strong buying pressure pushed the stock up to high teens. It pulled back from those highs, not unsurprisingly, as it was technically quite overbought.Interestingly enough, this pullback was foreshadowed on April 14 buy a gravestone doji (circled on the chart), the name of the type of candle that was formed on that day, on high volume. Since that pullback, the price action has been very productive and we're seeing a consolidation pattern emerge that looks very positive.Let's take a closer look at that basing pattern with a one-year chart.Looking at the price action over the past several months you can see a steady improvement in the base that has developed. The stock established strong support in the $12 range and did so on days with high trading volume. From there, the stock has progressed nicely and momentum has steadily improved, as shown by the uptrend in the MACD.Of course, most recently we've seen DDD pull back a bit, but in my mind, this is not a negative; It's simply pulling back from a slightly overbought position. As a stock forms a base and begins to make progress to the upside, it will tend to make rallies which become over-extended and fall back from the highs. This is just part of a productive consolidation.As long as it falls back to increasingly higher support levels, then the base is constructive and the picture is positive. And that is what we've seen happen here. The stock has pulled back to the $14 level and held strong at support which is a very positive sign and validates the argument that we are seeing productive consolidation leading to a breakout.Breakout potentialBased on the technical picture, I expect DDD to hold the $14 level and move up from there to eventually retest the $18.50 level. From there, the stock presents real breakout potential."
4000586,51022,2016-08-18T10:22:40-04:00,"Since my last report, the 3D Systems’ price per share has risen by ~80%.3D Systems does not demonstrate stability and will likely not show it in the future.3D Systems missed my annual expectations for financial results and has not shown signs of recovery in Q1 and Q2 2016.I therefore recommend investors to HOLD or SELL this stock. The DCF and comparative analyses confirm my opinion.","IntroductionOn February 22, 2016, I published an article that outlined the main reasons why I deemed 3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD) as a good buy. Since then, the stock has rocketed from $8.61 to $15.43 per share, or by more than 79% (see Diagram 1). You can read the whole article here.Now I am going to make a revision of my opinion, according to the latest news and financial results.Diagram 1.(Source: Yahoo Finance)Latest trends1. The stock price had been rising on the expectations of good annual results after Q4 financials. However, a goodwill impairment made the company release its 10-K later than expected.2. The company`s 10-K was unusual. On the one hand, the Q4 results were better than expected (so it helped the stock price increase to ~$18 per share). On the other hand, the revenue was much smaller than I expected (I will discuss it later) and it was not obvious what the company is planning to do to do in the future to improve the top line.3. Citi downgraded 3D Systems to Sell after poor Q1 results, especially in the top line (missed by ~$4M). All combined, it caused the stock price fall from $18 to $12 per share. Despite that, the stock has made a mean-reversion to the $13 level.4. HP Inc.'s announced the dates of Jet Fusion 3D 4200 and 3200. The 4200 model will be delivered in late 2016, and the 3200 model in 2017. The competition is getting tighter.5. The company COO and CMO resigned in June 2016 as per the three-part company`s restructuring plan.6. The Q2 results were better in EPS but worse in sales. Nevertheless, the stock has risen to $15 per share.In light of this information, I made three conclusions:1. The company reports worse figures in sales but better ones in EPS. Overall, the trend is in decline.2. The rivalry is getting harder, and the company is trying to survive in a declining market.3. The latest boost in market valuation after Q2 seems unjustified.Now I am going to discuss the FY2015 results, comparing them to my expectations. As you can see from Diagram 2, most of my forecasts failed. I did expect revenue, gross profit, EBIT, EBITDA, and net profit to be higher (without taking the goodwill impairment's effect into account). Hence, I look skeptically at future Q1 and Q2 results because they do not show a potential for a recovery.Hence, when revising my financial model, I had to make more pessimistic assumptions than in my previous model. The only exception is the EBT-to-EBIT ratio - I have left it practically unchanged because of the better-than-expected results.Diagram 2.(Sources: calculations by author, 3D Systems' 10-K)DCF analysisMy DCF model is presented in Diagram 3. In Diagram 4, you can see how different metrics of the company are expected to change during this period. I have made and revised several assumptions, which can be seen in the ""Assumptions"" tab of my Excel file.My model shows that, after subtracting the market value of debt, minority interest, adding back cash and investments, and subtracting the adjusted goodwill effect, the market value of equity is around $529M in the Base scenario. Consequently, the stock's fair value is around $4.73 per share. It is more than 70% lower than the current market price of the stock ($15.43 per share) and 56% lower than my previous estimate.Such a drastic correction is the result of my assumptions' revision. I do not think that the company has a potential to win the market and show the necessary competitive advantages over its peers.Diagram 3.(Source: data - Morningstar.com, DCF model by author)Diagram 4.(Source: data - Morningstar.com, model by author)Sensitivity AnalysisThe sensitivity analysis is presented in Diagram 5. According to the Base scenario and the assumptions for the EV/EBITDA multiple and WACC, the price range is estimated to be between $4.32 - $5.19 per share. This price range translates into a (-66%)-(-72%) downside opportunity.Diagram 5.(Source: data - Morningstar.com, model by author)Comparative AnalysisMy comparative analysis is based on two key ratios: P/S, and P/BV (see Diagram 6). The P/E ratio is not meaningful because the LTM earnings are negative. The P/S ratio shows that the stock is overvalued by 50% on average, while the P/BV ratio shows that the company is overvalued by about 20%. Hence, the result of the comparative analysis is also a Sell recommendation.Diagram 6.(Source: data - Morningstar.com, infographics by author)Opinion3D Systems' financial results have missed my expectations both in revenue and profit figures. The current share price is higher than I expected, and I do not see any catalysts for the company to be valued higher than that. Hence, I advise the readers to HOLD or SELL this stock and set a target price range at the level of $4.32 - $5.19 per share."
3995689,22148,2016-08-04T10:18:23-04:00,"3D Systems soared on a Q2 beat based mostly on cost controls.The industry continues to expand and 3D Systems isn't showing an ability to capture that growth.The stock isn't expensive, but 3D Systems doesn't offer a better relative value that has typically been the case in the sector.","The perplexing story surrounding the 3D printing sector has always been the favoritism with 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). The company originally had a charismatic founding CEO that was active in the financial media, but 3D Systems hasn't always delivered the goods for investors.The 3D printing sector ran into a brick wall combination of over investment, the feared entry of HP (NYSE:HP) into the industrial sector, and bad strategies in the consumer sector over the last couple of years. The sector stocks that includes Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) have shown some life this year, but several reasons exist to question the relative value of 3D Systems.Missed Industry GrowthOne wouldn't know this from listening to 3D Systems or Stratasys, but the 3D printing sector saw substantial growth in 2015. Wohlers listed (via Forbes) industry growth at nearly 26% last year to a total market value of $5.1 billion.The main growth came from the desktop printers costing under $5,000. As this chart via Engineering.com shows, the desktop sector has seen phenomenal growth in the last few years.3D Systems via the Cube and Stratasys via MakerBot both missed the growth opportunity with printers that were undercut by Asian manufacturers sending both back to focus more on the industrial sector. The biggest problem though is that these smaller printers are creeping into the needs for manufacturing and industrial applications.Back To Current RealityThe current reality is despite an industry with fast growth, 3D Systems saw Q2 revenues decline by 7% and missed analyst estimates by nearly $3 million. The revenue drivers remain mixed with the key printers and manufacturing services segments down huge in the quarter.Source: 3D Systems Q216 presentationThe company beat EPS estimates by a large amount which is what sent the stock up 18% on the day. The gains though came from cost controls and the management team previously at HP spent the majority of the earnings call discussing operating expenses. 3D Systems isn't going to win this competitive market with quarterly R&D expenses of only $20 million.The other question investors convinced of a rebound in the sector have to wonder is why choose 3D Systems as the vehicle. After the big gain on Wednesday, 3D Systems trades at a P/S valuation multiple nearly double that of Stratasys. As well, the revenue projections generally favor Stratasys.DDD PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsTakeawayWith a market value of only $1.6 billion even after the big gains, 3D Systems is still a reasonable valuation. Many questions remain regarding the unproven management team and a big focus on cost control when the market is still expanding. Ultimately though, the stock doesn't offer the best value in the sector and limited reasons exist supporting 3D Systems as the best vehicle for playing a rebound in the group."
3976996,96466,2016-05-23T07:15:06-04:00,"3D Systems Corp. trades at a fair value now.The recent announcement of a new long-term strategy will cause a surge in the price of 3D Systems’ shares.The 3D market is relatively young, and the second wave of its development will be more impactful.","3D Systems Corp.'s (NYSE:DDD) Q1 2016 revenues decreased by 16.8% to $152.6M compared to Q4 2015, due to the departure of the corporation from the consumer segment of the additive manufacturing market. At the moment, it is difficult to estimate the number of potentially lost customers, but it is projected that sales of consumer 3D printers will grow rapidly in the near future:(Source: Gartner)Irrespective of the correctness of this decision, the corporation will not receive much harm because of it, apart from a small forgone profit in the consumer segment, of the company's total revenues.(Source: 3Dsystems)On the other hand, a focus on the industrial segment will bring benefit in the form of a lower cost of sales. The structures of the company`s revenues in Q3 2015 and in Q1 2016 are similar and suggest a slight decline in cost of sales after leaving the consumer segment:(Source: 3dsystems)(Source: 3dsystems)Despite the increase in sales in Q1 2016 by 0.6% compared to Q3 2015, the cost of sales for the first quarter of 2016 actually decreased by 6.8%. The reason for this decline is the reduction in labor costs associated with the consumer segment. This should also improve overall business profitability in future quarters.Also, you should take into account the low value of the debt-to-equity ratio, which currently stands at 0.1%. This indicates a high level of financial stability when compared to the industry:(Source: Macroaxis)We calculate the fair value of the company to be $13 per share, which is very close to the current market value of the stock. This means that 3D Systems is not a value stock anymore, but still offers a good expected return in the form of a high cost of equity (e.g. its beta is currently at 1.6, according to Google Finance).3D Systems' operating cash flow amounted to only $12.6M in Q1 2016. This is a pretty poor result. We think that the corporation has a number of opportunities to boost its profits and cash flows in the future.For example, the company can increase research and development spending, which will bring benefits over a longer period of time. The new CEO, Vyomesh Joshi, is a valuable asset for shareholders because of his previous leadership experience at Hewlett-Packard, where he ""doubled the printing business's operating profits during an eleven-year period"" (Source: 3DSystems).In conclusion, it should also be noted that one of the company's main activities is the 3D printing services in the healthcare segment:(Source: visiongain)In the US, the 3D printing industry originally gained immense popularity due to the availability of investment capital because of the high level of development of the venture capital industry. 3D Systems has been successful in North America so far; the region represents over 50% of its sales:(Source: 3D Systems)The EMEA region, which is the second largest geography for the company after the Americas, represents 38% of global GDP, and its population exceeds 1 billion people. As a result, we believe the 3D printing business has an enormous potential in the EMEA region over the next decade.ConclusionWe think that 3D Systems' current management will strive to replicate past success in operational efficiency to drive the business' profitability higher. While we do not think the company is a growth stock, we see value in the long term, if the company is able to expand successfully in the EMEA region, as it has done in the Americas, and manages to keep the cost of sales at the current level. With the shares trading at approximately their fair value of $13 per share, we see the company's high cost of equity (in excess of 12% per year, as per the CAPM model) as the main driver of returns for its shareholders.Societe Financiers is an investment research team focused on long-term, long- and short-only ideas.

3974458,22775,2016-05-12T10:30:52-04:00,"3D Systems' short-term prospects are reasonably encouraging.But the valuation (30x P/E assuming an operating margin recovery to 10%) is not a bargain anymore and can only be justified by long-term recovery assumptions.As new threats are emerging, we find it hard to bet on such a recovery scenario.","In recent months, we have been constructive on 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), considering that the company's weak operating trends were fully discounted into the stock price and that the cash burn was well under control. For the second quarter in a row, 3D Systems' earnings confirmed our thesis.We warned about potentially increasing order/shipment volatility on a quarterly basis in a previous article and that was visible in the Q1 top line organic growth of -8% which came in well below Q4 (slightly positive growth), leading to a soft revenue figure ($153m vs. $156m). That said, both margins and cash flow surprised on the upside.Gross margins improved for the first time in two years (+170bps year-on-year), driven primarily by the company's shift away from consumer products. Importantly, this Q1 performance suggests that gross margins on non-consumer printers are bottoming out and that printers' ASP is under control, something corroborated by rival Stratasys' (NASDAQ:SSYS) sound Q1 performance (margin up 100bps) and encouraging FY16 guide (margin up 200-300bps to 54-55%).3D Systems' cash position improved to $170m, reversing the cash burn trend of previous quarters. This rock solid balance sheet clearly gives time to revive the top line and improve profitability.As new printer models start shipping, we believe that 3D Systems' revenue growth could gradually pick up over coming quarters, sparking some margin leverage thanks to tight cost control. While this should be positive for investor sentiment, we would caution that the valuation is not a bargain anymore. Assuming the business generates $700m revenue annually with a ~10% operating margin, we get to EPS in a $0.40-0.45 range and a P/E around 30x.Such a valuation could be justified by long-term recovery prospects. But recent industry news flow is not supportive of such a recovery scenario in our view.While Carbon just shipped its long-awaited 3D printer, the M1, HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) is expected to introduce its Multi Jet Fusion printer later this year. As we explained in previous articles, should Carbon and HP's products be well received, 3D Systems' revenue would probably decline at a fast pace, impairing the positive impact of cost savings. The company would probably be loss-making on a non-GAAP basis.Aside from this commercial risk, 3D Systems could suffer from the changes both Carbon and HP are trying to bring to the industry's business models. First, Carbon introduced a subscription-pricing model for its M1. While this kind of model generally makes sense in the long run (more recurring and predictable revenues, lower selling costs), it would probably disrupt 3D Systems' financials in the short-term (see the Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) example) should the company decide to follow Carbon's lead.Second, in a major shift away from the razor - razorblade model, HP announced that it sees its 3D printer as an open platform and that it will let third parties develop materials. We have long been saying that materials are likely to climb the value chain of the industry over the years due to their rising complexity and that third party providers will play an increasingly important role in the industry. HP's stance on materials clearly confirms our view.Worryingly, this move is likely to spark increased competition in the materials space and put some pressure on the prices and margins of 3D Systems' (and peers) materials business. Materials accounted last year for 23% and 40% of 3D Systems' revenue and gross profit, respectively. A major source of profit for 3D Systems and the industry's long-term earnings growth driver are thus at risk."
4009196,23998,2016-09-29T11:25:09-04:00,"Shares of 3D Systems are up more than 40% over the last three months, but this month, we've had warnings about the stock and the broader market on Seeking Alpha.Seeking Alpha contributor Investment Standard warned about increasing competition and declining revenues in a key segment for 3D Systems, and Seeking Alpha contributor Jeff Opdyke warned the market was overextended.We look at Dark Pool data to see if there's anything worrisome there (not currently) and present two ways to hedge 3D Systems, one of which may be worth considering.","3D Systems: Deteriorating?You're bullish on 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) - otherwise you wouldn't own it, right? But maybe you've been thinking of adding downside protection after reading Seeking Alpha contributor Investment Standard warning of DDD's increasing competition from HP (NYSE:HPQ), GE (NYSE:GE), and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), and declining revenue from its 3D printers. Or maybe Seeking Alpha contributor Jeff Opdyke's warning that stocks are too late for rescue has you feeling a bit cautious.Granted, you've been reading similar warnings about the market being over-extended for years, and if you moved to cash the first time you read one, you would have missed out on years of a bull market. But still, you figure the bull market does seem long in the tooth, so maybe staying long while adding downside protection might make sense. So we'll look at a couple of ways of hedging below, the second of which may be of interest. First, though, we checked SqueezeMetrics to see if there was any worrisome DDD action in dark pools.Dark Pool Indicator For 3D SystemsRecall that the Dark Pool Indicator (DPI) looks at the ratio between institutional buying and selling in dark pools (private exchanges where institutions trade): a high DPI means most of the dark pool volume was institutional buying, and a low DPI means most of the dark pool volume is institutional selling. For DDD, most of the dark pool volume was institutional buying, as you can see below, with the DPI at 60%.DDD didn't appear on the high-DPI list on SqueezeMetrics, because, although a 60% DPI is positive, it doesn't represent a one-standard-deviation move relative to DDD's average DPI over the last 120 days. But nothing worrisome about the dark pool indicator for DDD as of Wednesday.Hedging DDD With Optimal PutsWe used Portfolio Armor's iOS app to find optimal puts and an optimal collar to hedge DDD below, but you don't need the app for that. You can find optimal puts and collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article if you're willing to do the work.Whether you run the calculations yourself using the process we outlined or use the app, an additional piece of information you'll need to supply (along with the number of shares you're looking to hedge) when scanning for an optimal put is your ""threshold,"" which refers to the maximum decline you are willing to risk. This will vary depending on your risk tolerance. For the purpose of the examples below, we've used a threshold of 16%. Often, we mention at this point that if you're less risk-averse, you could use a smaller threshold, but 16% was actually the smallest one you could use over this time frame.We don't expect anyone to be interested in this hedge; we are just presenting it for illustration purposes.These are the optimal puts, as of Wednesday's close, to hedge 1,000 shares of DDD against a greater-than-16% drop by mid-February.As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above, the cost of this protection was $2,700 or 15.23% of position value. Extremely expensive. Nevertheless, a couple of points about this cost:Hedging DDD With An Optimal CollarWhen scanning for an optimal collar, you'll need another number in addition to your threshold, your ""cap,"" which refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly. One starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge - you don't think the security is going to do better than that anyway, so you're willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that.We checked Portfolio Armor's website to get an estimate of DDD's potential return over the next several months. Every trading day, the site runs two screens to avoid bad investments on every hedgeable security in the U.S., and then ranks the ones that pass by their potential return. 3D Systems passed, and the site estimated a potential return of 8.8% for it over six months. That was higher than the negative return implied by the Wall Street consensus 12-month price target for the stock (screen captured via NASDAQ below).We were able to raise the cap to 12% without increasing the hedging cost, so we used 12% as our cap.As of Wednesday's close, this was the optimal collar to hedge 1,000 shares of DDD against a greater-than-16% drop by mid-February while not capping an investor's upside at less than 12% by then.As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above, the cost of the put leg was $1,330, or 7.5% of position value. But if you look at the second part of the collar below, you'll see the income generated by selling the call leg was $1,230, or 6.94% of position value.So the net cost of this optimal collar was $100, or 0.56% of position value. A couple of notes on this hedge:"
3965607,59621,2016-04-15T14:58:39-04:00,"3D Systems has chosen Vyomesh Joshi to lead the company. Most likely, the company is rebooting.Probably, it will lose some visibility due to a low-profile strategy compared to the previous one.The strategy followed by the previous CEO had the mass-market allure which was one of the catalysts that brought the 3D printing industry to sky-high valuations.However, I believe the strategy based on business to business (B2B) can yield the best results during the next 3 to 5 years. Now, the question is: Can 3D Systems pull it off?","Photo credit: Creative ToolsAct 1 - The board of directorsThe past few months have been turbulent for the company. Back in October, Avi Reichental was dismissed from his post as 3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) CEO.The first question is: why was Avi fired? There isn't a clear reason. Yes, the company was going through some problems with receding sales and shrinking margins but this was common to the whole industry and, in the past, many CEOs have escaped from being sacked under similar conditions.At this stage, we have two main possibilities about what drove the directors: i) the board is short-term oriented or ii) the board no longer believed in the CEO's long-term vision for the company.I am led to believe the second is the right one. Avi was CEO for 12 years during which he led the company through an acquisition spree. This tactic always carries the risk of goodwill write-offs down the road. I am guessing the board didn't enjoy having the auditors telling them that half a billion dollar in assets are worth nothing.Additionally, the management seemed infatuated with the idea of reaching the status of a mass market brand. The company was frequently alluding to the potential of the consumer market for 3D printing. As the industry bumped into a recession, 3D Systems' faults became more evident. I'm led to believe the board saw the lack of focus as one of the main problems within the company. Additionally, since the stock price took a beat, a return to the M&A market is also out of the equation, therefore, the board opted to pursue a different strategy.Act 0 - What did Avi achieve during his 12-year tenure at the company?During the time Avi was the frontman at 3D Systems, he left his mark on the company. Though his departure bears some negative connotation, his 12-year long leadership will be seen at a more positive light if taken as a whole.Analysts might pinpoint an apparent uncontrolled addiction to M&A but I urge you not to forget that those acquisitions also brought incredible tech and products into the company. As you can see in Avi's presentation at TED, the potential of the current 3D tech is really impressive.Now, the company has to clear the air and define solid market segments for their tech. In my opinion, the safest way is to go with other businesses' needs. There are endless opportunities for 3D Systems to use its tech to help others improve their own performance. The company is already helping in dental restorations but there are plenty of opportunities in the medical space alone.All-in-all, Avi's reign at 3DS was not that bad. The company has built an impressive portfolio of products and technology and has already shown that it can be profitable.Act 2 - Why Business to Business (B2B)?The answer is pretty simple. So far what drove 3D Systems was technology. The tech has showed potential to become a whole new industry. At this stage, analysts following the sector are trying to guess which company will have the fastest and cheapest tech. They know this will play an important role in the future valuation of the companies.However, to my knowledge, seldom has the cheapest, fastest product won the war without some solid market segmentation supporting it. I've developed the rule of never investing based on the expectation that a given company will come out as the tech leader. The reason for my rule is specs alone do not bring loyal customers, good marketing does.The B2B approach can raise the level for 3D systems. The company has dozens of products and technologies that can easily aim at disrupting several industries. 3D Systems has the answer to the woes of several manufacturing problems. It just has to focus on the problems it can solve for other industries and show it to them. That's good marketing. Trying to be the fastest, cheapest consumer 3D printer in the market won't do any good for their margins. Showing companies how they can add value through simplification and flexibility can do a lot.Act 3 - And what now?The board has been really patient in choosing the next CEO. They've picked Vyomesh Joshi. He was best known for being the Imaging and Printing VP at HP. If the rationale I've laid previously is right, he will go with a B2B approach to 3DS but we will have to wait and see. I'm guessing he'll want to target some small and medium businesses (SMBs) but I hope he keeps it real. If he chooses to keep the consumer mass market non-sense, he might get the hype back but I doubt a solid business model will come out of it.The bottom line is 3D Systems has a lot of potential, it just needs the right direction to become attractive to investors once again. For now I'll be on the sidelines watching patiently.Disclosure: I've no positions in the mentioned stocks"
4012154,23998,2016-10-14T11:37:55-04:00,"Last month, we noted concerns about 3D Systems from Seeking Alpha contributor Investment Standard, and we presented a hedge for it.Since then, 3D Systems is down more than 16%.Here we show that hedged investors would have been down less than half that. We also discuss future courses of action for hedged longs.","3D Systems SlidesLast month (3D Systems: Time To Hedge?), we mentioned concerns raised by Seeking Alpha colleagues about 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and the market generally:We went on to present a cost-effective hedge for DDD. Since then, the stock has slid.Let's look back at the optimal collar hedge we presented for DDD last month and see how it has reacted to the drop.The September 28th Optimal Collar Hedge:As of September 28th's close, this was the optimal collar to hedge 1,000 shares of DDD against a greater-than-16% drop by mid-February while not capping an investor's upside at less than 12% by the end of that time period (screen captures via the Portfolio Armor iOS app).As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above, the cost was $100, or 0.56% of position value (calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls) when opening the hedge.How The September 28th Collar Responded To DDD's DropHere's an updated quote on the put leg as of Tuesday's close:And here is an updated quote on the call leg:How That Hedge Ameliorated DDD's DropDDD closed at $17.73 on Wednesday, September 28th. A shareholder who owned 1,000 shares of it and hedged with the collar above then had $17,730 in DDD shares plus $1,330 in puts, and if he wanted to buy-to-close his short call leg, he would have needed to pay $1,230 to do that. So, his net position value on September 28th was ($17,730 + $1,330) - $1,230 = $17,830.DD closed at $14.82 on Thursday, October 13th, down about 16.5% from its closing price on September 28th. The investor's shares were worth $14,820 as of 10/13, his put options were worth $2,250, and if he wanted to close out the short call leg of his collar, it would have cost him $535, using the midpoint of the spread, in both cases. So: ($14,820 + $2,250) - $535 = $16,535. $16,535 represents a 7.3% drop from $17,830.More Protection Than PromisedSo, although DDD had dropped by about 16.5% at the time of the calculations above, and the investor's hedge was designed to limit him to a loss of no more than 16%, he was actually down 7.3% on his combined net hedge plus underlying stock position by this point. As with the gold miners crash and the plunge in Alcoa (NYSE:AA) earlier this month, this illustrates the impact of time value on a hedge designed to protect based on its intrinsic value alone.What Now?Reader ""Mr. Balboni"" suggests 3D Systems is in for a bounce. Squeeze Metrics seems to agree (we have an affiliate relationship with Squeeze Metrics and are compensated if a reader joins the site). On Thursday, we received this email from the site:""DPI"" refers to the Dark Pool Indicator, which looks at the ratio between institutional buying and selling in dark pools (private exchanges where institutions trade): A high DPI means most of the dark pool volume is institutional buying, and a low DPI means most of the dark pool volume is institutional selling. But having a high DPI alone doesn't trigger one of those emails, the security also has to have had a one standard deviation increase in dark pool activity over its 120-day average. Logging into the site, we pulled up this chart:Thursday is highlighted, so you see the 67% DPI. The other figure you can see there is GEX, which refers to gamma exposure. GEX essentially measures how many shares of DDD option market makers will have to buy if the stock rises 1%. In this case, they would have to buy 52,614 shares (for detailed explanation of this dynamic, see this article on Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB)).If you're long DDD and are bullish based on this, you can sell your appreciated puts, buy-to-close your calls to eliminate your upside cap and use the net proceeds to buy more shares. But if you're concerned about Jeff Opdyke's warning, you may want to hold on to your DDD puts to limit your downside risk over the next several months."

From offices in the hipster haven of Brooklyn the company he co-founded, MakerBot Industries, produced the MakerBot, a device that dripped melted plastic globs onto a small ""build platform"" under the control of CAD software. As layers of plastic were added a small, plastic thing was created.It was exciting, it was new, and at a time when the U.S. economy was flat on its back it was hailed as the next PC revolution. Tech guru Tim O'Reilly made 3D printing the center of his Maker Faires, and a bi-monthly publication called Make, founded in 2005, that now promised to be the PC Magazine of the 3D printing revolution.Pettis became the face of the industry, and sold MakerBot to Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) in early 2013 for $400 million. 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) launched a rival product, the Cube. Analysts started drawing ""hockey stick"" graphs that showed 3D printers jumping out of their hobbyist niche and becoming a mass market product. Pettis was all over the media in 2013 and was even hailed at the White House.I should add here that I was as enamored as everyone else. I actually bought into DDD at $47 and urged readers here to ""double down"" on the space in early 2013. But the revolution didn't happen, and I quietly sold out later in the year, breaking even.The original products were just too limited, and the cost of moving into other types of material was prohibitive, at consumer price points. O'Reilly, no fool, spun out Make, and the Faires, even before Stratasys made its move. (In retrospect that should have been my ""tell,"" a signal to sell rather than buy.) The Makers went on to shinier objects, like drones.That do-it-yourself engineering impulse remains alive, so much so that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) went from sponsoring Science Fairs to engineering events last year, but it's no longer about melting plastic wires and dripping it onto plates. Pettis was spun-out by Stratasys into a new unit, Bold Machines, in 2014 and Bold Machines was then separated from Stratasys last year. Pettis' big ideas were forgotten and he grew a gray beard, having gone through the five phases of fame, from ""who is Bre Pettis"" back to ""who is Bre Pettis"" in just three years.The industry spent all of 2015 cleaning up the mess. Stratasys reported a loss of over $200 million in just the first quarter of 2015, and 3D bit the bullet later in the year, letting go of CEO Avi Reichental in October and writing off the Cube inventory. As of this writing 3D is still led by interim CEO Andrew Johnson, a lawyer. The company's losses for 2015 almost equaled its total revenue but its outlook was called ""surprisingly optimistic"" by 3DPrint, an industry web site, and for a few days after the results came out the stock went up.Makers now talk glowingly of ""epic fails,"" saying you don't learn anything from success but that something worked. ""Make, Fail, Learn"" is the new Maker mantra.But that's not the way business is supposed to work, not when hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in it. The industry needs to start again, from ground zero. Additive manufacturing, as it was called before Bre Pettis arrived and as it's often called again, will survive. But it has been badly burned, and leadership in the next wave could come from anywhere.*Image Source: Makerbot"
3959234,24276,2016-03-17T10:38:44-04:00,3D printing is reorganizing.The focus is now on niche markets such as medicine and case studies.Opportunities will develop over the next two years but not yet.,"While many people consider 3D printing dead, given what has happened to the stocks of industry leaders such as 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) and voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET), it's more accurate to say the industry has rebooted and is preparing for another run.This means the industry's excitement is now coming from college campuses and startups. As an investor you want to keep an eye on this, but withhold your investment.Industry leader 3D Systems has been drawing a bid this year as it undergoes a restructuring, bringing in more professional management, and dropping the Cube, its consumer printer, from the product line. For all of 2015 it reported a loss of $664 million, $5.85/share, on revenues of $666 million. The stock, which once traded as high as $96/share during the last boom, is now at around $13, but it had been as low as $6.42 in mid-January. Founder Charles Hull, 76, has been kicked upstairs to a Chief Technology Officer role.I would not buy arch-rival, Stratasys here either. The price action for that stock has been similar, down 60% over the last year but nearly doubling from a $15 base in February, only to plummet more recently to its present $23. I want to see some positive comparables before considering the company.The new buzzword is ""professional and industrial applications,"" based on case studies focused on medicine, space, energy and molds, where accuracy is the key. An investor who keeps an eye on the news, like a venture capitalist, is bound to find something worth buying over the next two years.iMCustom is one example. Following a test at Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) Sam's Club locations in the Southeast, the company is planning a national rollout of a system for orthotic shoe inserts using a Gelsight scanner and standard Fused Deposition Modeling printer that can deliver a finished product within two hours, at $249, half the price usually charged.Medical markets seem ripe for 3D printing, because the price of parts is high, accuracy is essential, and the relative speed of custom automation delivers cost savings. 3D printed ears, noses and knees are already entering the market.Medical applications are leading to new types of 3D printers, like the Fluidic Factory, from a company that specializes in microfluidic chips for medical testing. Fripp Design in England has a patent on 3D printing using silicone, which catalyzes and thus solidifies parts out of a silicone oil liquid.Verterra Energy's Volturnus, a small hydropower unit that can be dropped into a river and delivers 10 KWatts of energy without the need for a dam, is created using 3D printing. Its printer comes from a privately funded start-up, AlephObjects, which says it is growing fast but is still at just $15 million.Big companies haven't forgotten 3D printing, but their time horizons for it are lengthening and it's not considered material to their results.Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) still plans to ship its MultiJet Fusion printer by the end of this year. It no longer even calls it a 3D printer, however, saying that is a $4-$6 billion market focused on rapid prototyping. Instead, this is called a manufacturing machine, because that is a $1 trillion market. The bottom line is you don't buy HP stock today for the 3D printer - the money from this, if it comes, is five years away.Yet there remains there, here. General Electric (NYSE:GE) is now moving toward building entire jet engines using 3D printing. Under Armour (NYSE:UA) will release the UA Architech tomorrow, with a 3D printed midsole the company says has a lattice structure offering a springier heel strike.The current pause will refresh the 3D printing market and could result in solid investment opportunities within the next two years. Just not yet.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."

Vyomesh Joshi acquired from HP, Inc. has stimulated optimism and company resurgence.This may signal a turnaround for a stock that went stratospheric with the initial excitement over 3D printing five years ago, but had disappointing earnings during 2015.With proper reorganization, 3D Systems, with the broadest technology portfolio in the business, is ripe for expansion into diversified manufacturing sectors.This is happening as 3D printing is on the rise and considered by some to presage the Third Industrial Revolution.","One-Time High Flyer Awakens3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has a new CEO who has ignited interest in a stock that rose 10% on April 14. We may be seeing a come-back for this company and the industry at large after a turbulent recent history.High Rise and SetCourtesy of the AuthorThe chart above tells the story of the meteoric rise of DDD up through 2014.Investor optimism propelled gains like a rocket. With 50 acquisitions in 3 years, DDD defined itself as the ""everything 3D Printing Store"" with the broadest technology portfolio in the business. In 2013, revenue grew by 45%, 10% greater than the growing industry. At the time the 3D printing hype seemed unstoppable; the technology amazed. And then things began to fall apart.Although analysts warned that the P/E ratios were stratospheric; the news fell on many deaf ears.The rocket began a flame-out in 2014. Lackluster sales were a major issue. By December 2015, shares of 3D Systems had plunged by 68%. In general, the 3D manufacturing system became a victim of broader market weakness, as the company posted quarter after quarter of disappointing earnings and sales.CEO Avi Reichental ResignsMr. Reichental, who pioneered the development and growth of the company during a 12-year period, resigned on October 28, 2015. The company commenced a search to replace him.In April, DDD hired Vyomesh Joshi, executive vice-president of the imaging and printing business of HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), formerly Hewlett-Packard. The Street's Jim Cramer claims that Joshi is the main driver in the recent rally of 3D Systems.Vyomesh JoshiCourtesy of the AuthorJoshi earned high marks at HPQ and is now tasked with boosting earnings by improving operational efficiencies and refocusing investments at DDD.Optimism about Joshi's hiring was part of a positive research report by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan who upgraded 3D Systems stock to BUY from underperform, hiking his price target to 26 from 11. Mohan wrote, ""our BUY rating on 3D Systems is predicated on the strong likelihood that the new CEO will turn around the business through a new direction and strategy based on his experience as an executive of HP's established printing business.""Stock Pops for 2016Cramer added that ""the appointment was a really good hire"" with the change and anticipation creating a very good run for the stock this year. Year to date, the stock is up 115%.Courtesy of the AuthorDDD's Q4 2015 earnings revenue of $183.4 million was down 2% from the previous quarter, but grew 21% year over year. Full year revenue was up 2% at $666.2 million, while GAAP loss came in at $5.85 per share and non-GAAP earnings were $0.27 per share.April Upgrade and Downgrade HistoryLooking at the most recent data for April:The Citigroup downgrade on April 14 dampened expectation for DDD for 2016. The key concern was that an anticipated acquisition of 3D Systems by HP Inc. is less unlikely.3D Pops, DropsThe share price fell 6.2% on April 15, closing at $17.15 from a high of $18.28 the previous day. April 20, it is trading at $18.24 as I write.Courtesy of the AuthorUpgrades and DowngradesCurrently, there are 6 Downgrades and 2 Upgrades: 2 Sells; 1 Buy; 2 Holds; 2 Underweight and 1 Neutral. The two most recent April calls are a Buy and a Sell representing an extreme range of expectation between Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, respectively.It is important to note, that although it was rumored, news of Vyomesh Joshi taking over the reins occurred April 4, after the six earlier calls in the list below were made.The Big QuestionThe April Bank of America/Merrill Lynch BUY call and the Citigroup SELL call represent two conflicting views about a turnaround for 3D Systems. In my opinion, the HP Inc. acquisition of 3D systems is of short-term significance to future valuations. However, a critical management change at 3D and the company's greater range of possible printing applications for manufacturing are more significant for the longer term.Q1 earnings data will be reported on May 4 and could have a major impact for building greater confidence in a company, that was severely beaten down but appears to have turned a corner.On The Rise3D printing is what is known as a disruptive technology, and it's expected to become mainstream by 2017. It is a game-changer for many companies that now print everything from shoes to airplane parts.Medical applications are exploring possibilities ranging from a prosthetic hand to a customized tracheal stent. 3D printing has the potential to forever alter manufacturing, and in the process, make it far less expensive.The Wohlers Report 2016 forecasts that the 3D printing market for 2016 will grow 29% to $6.7 billion, rising to $8.8 billion by 2017. Wohlers Associates provides a list of articles and publications that cover the full range of 3D Printing possibilities for interested readers.Some people consider 3D printing to be the rise of the Third Industrial Revolution.3D Printing Could Become Mainstream Within Five yearsConclusionLike many innovative changes that attract investment, timing is critical. Many investors who jumped on these companies a few years ago were disappointed. But, the technology is here to stay, and it is growing and expanding in scope.At the least, investors should find it is worth their close attention; and for some, it may be time to get their feet wet. I plan an upcoming review of the other corporate 3D players; stay tuned."
3974705,59621,2016-05-13T01:06:52-04:00,"As the dust settles around 3D Systems, investors need to understand what will be the new company direction.The first quarterly conference call featuring Vyomesh Joshi provided good clues about the strategic vision for the company.The first impressions point to a shift in focus from tech to business model fine-tuning.However, the current cash levels will be a constraint for the new management team.","Investing in tech companies can be a lot of fun and can also be significantly rewarding. Daily, the wonderful tech produced around the globe awes you. Especially, now that specialized blogs can get real time information about the most secretive products in development. Investing in tech has been kind of democratized. Nascent companies are often better known than some well-established traditional organizations.Additionally, Silicon Valley has entered a new phase where entrepreneurs do not only look for creating entire new industries. They are reinventing old business models by applying new concepts and technology to old formulas. Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Airbnb (AIRB) are great examples of new opportunities arising in old industries.However, investing in tech doesn't come without some shortcomings. One of the biggest problems for investors is the occasional overhype around a company (or product). I have seen several bright minds betting on companies clearly trading on vapor.Management teams have learned what investors want to hear. Some managers don't lose an opportunity to give an interview explaining to the anxious audience how great the products in the pipeline are. I concede that sometimes this selling exercise is needed. Companies do need to attract capital and often the only thing they have is a good story. However, in the past, investors have lost money several times because of great pitching.3D Systems' caseThat said, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and the whole 3D printing industry is one of the most followed tech sectors. This sector has accumulated a lot of hope for great future accomplishments like a possible revolution in manufacturing. However, it has also accumulated a lot of criticism for being unreasonably overhyped.The last 18 months brought a lot of turbulence to the whole sector and specifically to 3D Systems. While the sector went through a recession, 3D Systems also decided to fire the CEO. Without an instant replacement, the company had to go through several months without a leader carrying a strong strategic vision. However, this has come to an end with the hiring of Vyomesh Joshi. VJ, as he is commonly known, is a HP (NYSE:HPQ) ex-executive with huge experience in the traditional printing business. 3D Systems' board is clearly looking to capitalize on that experience.Photo Credit: 3D Systems.Where do we go now?My first words were about the direction the company will take under VJ's guidance. As Carl Bass, Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) CEO, has put it:I agree, a sober strategy based on applications for other businesses like industrial and medical customers will yield the best results for the next 5 years. That's why it's so important to understand VJ's strategic vision for the company. Here's how he answered a question by Robert Burleson (Canaccord Genuity, Inc):Another interesting point in VJ's statements was the vertical business model. He believes the company has very good expertise in 3D printing software and this will be the determinant factor to define the winners within the industry. I had never put much focus on this matter but it makes a lot of sense. 3D printers won't be just hardware and people will need software to use them. Therefore, owning a user-friendly software will be key to breaking the anxiety from non-power users.The financial sideOn another note, investors should filter the extreme sentiments presently surrounding this company, and understand that 3D Systems is not far from having a decent financial performance. The company's gross margin was 43.8% in 2015 (Source: 3D Systems 2015 10-K), which is not bad, and can still be improved. Additionally, the company has already shown capacity to be profitable. If the right measures are taken to control SG&A expenses, 3D Systems should be capable of getting profit margins above 10%.The most worrying part stems from the balance sheet and the cash flow statements. The company got used to issue common stock to pay for investing activities. Last year, the company didn't issue any shares but had to pay for previous acquisitions and new property & equipment. This meant burning a lot of the cash reserves. At the end of 2015, the acid ratio stood at 2, though this is not bad, it isn't brilliant neither.All this means that cash will be tight during the next few years, unless the company proceeds to new stock issuance. At the present stock price level, it would mean a lot of dilution for current shareholders. The good news is the company has been capable of getting positive cash flow from its operating activities (slightly negative in 2015 and significantly positive in 2014 and 2013). Therefore, a thoughtful management team should be able to bring the ship back home.TakeawaysAs I was going through 3D Systems' 2015 10-K to complement this article's writing, I noticed that the growth strategy present in the document is in accordance with VJ's statements. This only means that the board already had the vision and it was just looking for the right person for the job. This alignment will be a valuable asset if things get turbulent at some point in the future.As for my first impressions, it was very positive that VJ avoided the tech-centered speech and focused on the business model. I have stated before that for 3D Systems to become a truly remarkable company, it will have to shift the focus from tech to improving its business model.For now, I will remain on the sidelines. I want to see more positive signs coming from the current management before seriously considering entering the company again. Additionally, the current cash levels, although not alarming, are not comfortable either."

But according to this year's edition of the industry's closely-watched Wohlers Report, total sales still grew at a healthy clip.Wohlers Associates estimates total additive manufacturing product/service revenue rose 25.9% in 2015 to $5.165B. The growth rate was below the 33.8% CAGR delivered during the prior three years, but nonetheless, contrasts greatly with some of the weak numbers 3D printing firms delivered for the second half of 2015.Desktop 3D printer salesMetal printing, a market 3D Systems has grown its exposure to via M&A, was a strong point. Desktop 3D printers, embraced by consumers/enthusiasts as well as firms doing smaller prototyping jobs, were also strong: Wohlers estimates desktop printer sales rose nearly 70% to 278,385. Terry Wohlers, the firm's president said, ""It's similar to when AutoCAD was introduced in the early 1980s. It could not do everything the expensive CAD software could do, but it did enough, so the value was good. The same was true with the early PCs compared to the more expensive UNIX workstations and mini computers from DEC and others.""At the same time, the desktop market has seen intense competition, as a quick look at some of the desktop printers that have launched at CES highlights. Stratasys has carried out multiple goodwill write-downs for its MakerBot desktop printer unit, which it bought for $403M in 2013. Meanwhile, 3D Systems announced in December it's discontinuing its $999 Cube desktop printer.MakerBot's Replicator desktop 3D printer. It sells for $2,499.Competition is also growing in traditional industrial printing segments, as strong growth and industry hype bring in new entrants and VC dollars. Wohlers states 62 firms sold ""industrial-grade"" additive manufacturing systems sporting $5,000+ price tags in 2015, up from 49 in 2014 and 31 in 2011.HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) plans to enter the fray this year via 3D printers using a proprietary inkjet process called Multi Jet Fusion: HP states the process can simultaneously operate 10,000 nozzles, and allow objects supported by the process to be printed more rapidly and cheaply than via existing approaches. An HP exec has suggested the printers will be priced at the low end of the $150K-$500K range that has existed for similar hardware.Source: HPStill, Wohlers' report provides much to be encouraged about for 3D printing bulls, given how bleak news flow for 3D printing firms was in late 2015 and early 2016. Things have looked a little better lately, with 3D Systems and Stratasys each rallying following their Q4 reports - 3D Systems' report was especially well received. Soft demand still clearly exists in many market segments after companies got carried away with their printer-buying in 2013 and 2014 (echoes of the 1999-2000 telecom bubble), but business adoption of 3D printing/additive manufacturing is still growing at a healthy clip."

Such is the case for 3D printing stocks. Their valuations peaked a few years ago, but these companies kept making acquisitions and growing their patent portfolio. Fortunately, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) have no debt, but they do face obstacles. 3D Systems may pique investors seeking deep value. The stock price multiple may still compress as markets price in lower growth, but it might prove itself as a survivor in a competitive field.3D Systems rose another 25% in the last month after reporting fourth quarter revenue that were not as weak as feared. Expenses flattened, while sales grew 21% sequentially. Favorable timing of orders from industrial and healthcare customers helped 3D Systems' revenue in the quarter. The company's headline GAAP loss of $5.85 per share, or $655.5 million, is due to massive one-time charges. The company booked goodwill, unsold inventory, amortization, and intangible impairment charges. This should mean 3D Systems should not make any more major write-downs in the future.Just as Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) is banking on revenue acceleration through the healthcare and related applications market, 3D Systems is doing so too. The risk for this strategy is low, but investors should expect deal closings taking time. In the last two quarters, business from the healthcare segments actually dropped. Delayed orders may also result in uneven revenue growth from quarter to quarter.The revenue figures have yet to prove 3D Systems will succeed in health care. Still, the healthcare technology center it opened in Denver, Colorado is the right step. The center will showcase Direct Metal Printing, Stereolithography, Selective Laser Sintering, ColorJet Printing and MultiJet Printing.A focus on the engineering and educational market should yield better results. As adoption for 3D printing improves over time, sales from these areas will go up, too.After doubling from its yearly lows, investors should hardly expect more upside in the stock. Revenue growth is not a sure thing. 3D Systems may cut its operating expenses if it needs to, next fiscal year. By defocusing on the consumer and targeting businesses, profit margins might hold the non-GAAP 45% and above.The outperformance of 3D Systems over Stratasys may revert to Stratasys holdings its gains and investors taking profits in 3D Systems.Stratasys trades at just over two times sales, compared to three times for 3D Systems. Earnings growth expectations are higher for Stratasys than for 3D Systems. Stratasys also anticipated some business contraction after 2014 after demand for smaller machines grew and profit margins fell. Stratasys adjusted its strategy by bracing for a drop in the rapid prototyping business, Stratasys' main business. As markets consolidate, Stratasys will strengthen its niche in the prototyping market:Source: Stratasys Q4 2015 Earnings Conference Call TranscriptYour takeawayExpect profit-taking in shares of 3D Systems, while Stratasys may not fall as much. If that happens, both companies are still ideal for value investors. The market may improve as the economy improves and industrial spending in R&D picks up."
3932046,24849,2016-02-25T18:13:44-05:00,The company's balance sheet will undergo massive changes.Was impressive Q4 revenue figures a one-time thing?How is the CEO search coming?What are management's plans for 2016?,"Next week, we'll get full Q4 results from 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). The 3D printing name has seen its stock hammered in recent years, as growth aspirations have faltered and the CEO left suddenly. With the CEO transition still in flux and investors looking to the future, management has a number of questions to answer next week.A couple of weeks ago, the company issued preliminary Q4 results. On the positive side, a huge revenue beat was announced, and the cash balance is holding up fairly well. On the negative side, the company announced a $27 million charge due to the shift away from consumer products, along with a non-cash charge of more than half a billion dollars after goodwill and intangibles impairment testing. The bear camp had been waiting for this massive write-down for some time, as 3D Systems had been very aggressive on the acquisition front in the past, but these purchases didn't result in tremendous business improvement.The first item investors are questioning is the business itself. The preliminary Q4 revenue figure of $183 million was well above the $160 million analysts were looking for, a giant surprise for a company that has disappointed tremendously in recent periods. Going into last year's Q4 report, the street was expecting more than 30% revenue growth for 2015, but the company will likely end up reporting a figure in the low-single digits. Interim CEO Andy Johnson stated that ""industry conditions remain challenging and demand may be uneven in the coming periods."" This leads me to believe that Q4 saw some one-time benefits, and revenues will come back down a bit in Q1. In recent years, the business has also been a bit seasonal, with more revenues coming in the second half of the year.The second question here relates to Johnson himself. He is the interim CEO, and it has been about four months now since the company's former leader abruptly stepped down. It would be nice to get some news on how the search is going, and hopefully, a new leader can be appointed in the first half of 2016. The longer this process drags out, the more investors will be concerned with the company's future strategy.Management's plans for the business will be in the spotlight as well. It has been a number of quarters since the company gave guidance, so investors probably aren't expecting to hear much on that front. However, with the business undergoing a number of changes recently, it would be nice to get some color on 2016. Does the executive team want to focus on a return to revenue growth, or is profitability (most likely non-GAAP) a more important angle? It would be nice to hear some sort of plan on the conference call, and not just a list of excuses for why the business is struggling.3D Systems shares currently trade for a little less than $10, a fraction of the nearly $100 they saw just a few years ago. For the stock to get going again, the company needs to get a permanent leader in place and lay out a plan for the business going forward. We've seen a lot of restructuring recently, including a number of major balance sheet revisions that were desperately needed. Now, it is time for the company to put the past behind it and focus on a return to revenue and profitability growth."

It is a good sign of revenue quality.The Chinese expansion may be the key for future growth. However, recent Asia-Pacific data show that things may not be a positive in that region.I issue a buy recommendation on this stock and set a target price range 6%-27% higher than the current price.","3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD) is a well-known company that operates in the business of manufacturing, designing, and selling 3D printers and providing linked services all over the world. In 2014, the company's revenue hit a level of $650M showing a 5-year CAGR of 40%+. However, LTM 2015 revenue is projected to be about $670M which shows that the company is slowing its growth. This is because the last quarterly results are rather unsatisfactory (Q4 revenue growth was -9%). The company has competitors in several markets: Stratasys Inc. (NASDAQ:SSYS) with revenues of ~ $1B, ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) with $130M in sales, and Voxeljet (NYSE:VJET) with revenues of around $77M. Hence, 3D Systems is the second-biggest company after Stratasys in terms of turnover in this market. The company follows an aggressive M&A strategy in order snap competition and stay on the cutting edge of technology. Despite that, it has also shown natural growth over the years.However, in 2013, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HP) announced that it would manufacture the first 3D printer based on a new MultiJet technology by 2016 (see Diagram 1). HP may be not be experienced in manufacturing 3D printers but it has one unique competitive point: it is much bigger and, therefore, has deep pockets. Hence, the entire market is going to see some major changes in the next few years.3D Systems has its competitive advantages as well. First of all, the company has been operating in this market for more than 30 years. This means that there is a lot of experience in the company.Secondly, it provides solutions not only to manufacturers but also to consumers. Unfortunately, the $1,019 Cube printers are going to be removed from the shelves as management is now focusing on profitability and considers it the only way to succeed in the future. However, the company will still offer products like the ProJet 1200 printer with a price range of $4,000-6,000 (depending on the country), which can be used by small business, start-ups, or primary customers in their needs.Thirdly, the company has developed its own valuable patents, which make the printers cheaper and help provide better usability. 3D Systems has become a well-respected brand.Finally, the company is going to enter the Chinese market. Despite the slowing economic growth, this new market is not widely occupied. The cost-efficient technologies that 3D Systems offers may become very popular in this region.Diagram 1Source: data - Morningstar.com, infographics by authorNevertheless, there are several points of concern I have to point out.The first point of concern is the bearish short-term trend on the 3D printers market. During the last nine months, the company's revenue has increased by only 3%, while Stratasys' revenue has declined by almost 15%. The decline in revenue growth has an impact on the level of inventories held on hand, especially on the finished goods inventory. As you can see on Diagram 2, the total inventory level has increased by 43%, the while finished goods' growth level was 10 percentage points higher (~54%).Diagram 2Source: company's Q3 filingsSecondly, Asia-Pacific sales, the second largest segment in the company in 2014, declined by more than 13% over the time period. The segment has become the second smallest after Germany. In view of this information, the Chinese invasion may be as unprofitable as many people think (see Diagram 3).Diagram 3Source: company's Q3 filingsThirdly, cash flows from operations are on a declining trend (see Diagram 4). The company's net income is underwater which makes it a major reason why cash flows are negative. The net working capital's increase due to unsatisfactory sales results and rising inventory levels is the second reason why the company burned cash in this time period. High depreciation is the only factor that caused the company to report positive OCF. However, keep in mind that capital expenditures offset cash savings depreciation and amortization benefits.Diagram 4Source: data - Morningstar.com, infographics by authorHowever, decreasing figures are followed by more rapid fall of the stock price. During the last two years, the company has lost nearly 90% of its value (see Diagram 5). This may be a good chance for those who want to buy shares of a company with the potential to become an industry leader for a cheap price.Diagram 5Source: Morningstar.comDCF analysisMy DCF model is presented in Diagram 6. In Diagram 7, you can see how different metrics of the company are expected to change during this period. I have made several assumptions, which can be easily seen in the ""Assumptions"" tab of my Excel file.My model shows that, after subtracting the market value of debt, minority interest and adding back cash and investments, the market value of equity is around $1.2B in the Base scenario. Consequently, the fair value per share is $10.77 per share. It is more than 13% higher than the current price ($8.61 per share).Diagram 6.Source: data - Morningstar.com, DCF model by authorDiagram 7Source: data - Morningstar.com, model by authorSensitivity AnalysisThe sensitivity analysis is presented in Diagram 8.

This price range represents a 6% - 27% upside opportunity.Diagram 8.Source: data - Morningstar.com, model by authorComparative AnalysisMy comparative analysis is based on two key ratios: P/S and P/BV (see Diagram 9). The P/E ratio is not meaningful because LTM earnings are negative. The P/S ratio shows that the stock is overvalued by 50% on average, while the P/BV ratio shows a 100%-plus upside opportunity. Taking into account the growing nature of the company, the current P/S ratio may underestimate its perspectives.Diagram 9.Source: data - Morningstar.com, infographics by authorOpinionDespite the fact that I consider myself a value investor who looks for a significant margin of safety, I think this 3D Systems offers a great opportunity to diversify one's portfolio with a growth stock. I recommend buying this stock and set a target price range of $10 - $12 per share. This price range can be translated into a 6%-27% upside opportunity for the stock. However, as with any growth stock, you should carefully study each quarterly report and investigate any points of concern.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

3892076,22775,2016-02-12T11:37:17-05:00,"Q4 revenue and net cash are reassuring.The next quarters will be crucial for the company, with both Carbon3D and HP expected to launch their long-awaited 3D printers.In a bull case, 3D Systems' stock price could double at least.In a bear case, 3D Systems would not be worth much ... unless the company seeks a merger with rival Stratasys.","At last, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) decided to write down most of its goodwill, with management anticipating to book a $510-$570m charge when it releases FY15 figures on February 29. This decision is hardly surprising. Valuations in the industry have collapsed and 3D Systems is in the process of streamlining some of its operations, suggesting that the real value of the businesses acquired over the years is well below book values.That said, even if goodwill writedowns negatively impact GAAP earnings and shareholders' equity on the balance sheet (3D Systems' equity will move to roughly $700m in Q4 from $1.25bn in Q3), they are non-cash items that do not have any impact on more important metrics such as cash flow and net cash (/debt).It turns out that the company's net cash position remained rock solid in Q4 at $156m (almost flat quarter-on-quarter), illustrating once again that the company is not burning cash in spite of weak earnings. In the current risk-off environment in which cash is of paramount importance, this gives time to 3D Systems to revive its top line and improve its profitability.Clearly, top line revival expectations could surface following the solid Q4 revenue number ($183m vs. a consensus of $161m), which points to slightly positive revenue growth at constant FX (vs. -2% reported). But in our view, it's a bit early to get carried away as this large beat follows a large miss in Q3, hinting at increased order/shipment volatility on a quarterly basis, as macro is uncertain and as competition is about to heat up.Indeed, the next quarters will be crucial for the company, with both Carbon3D and HP (NYSE:HPQ) expected to launch their long-awaited 3D printers. If these new competitors fail to disrupt the market, 3D Systems could end up the year on flattish or slightly down revenues and potentially sharply up earnings, thanks to recent cost-cutting initiatives (mid or high-single-digit operating margin). But if Carbon3D and HP are successful, 3D Systems' revenue will probably decline at a fast pace, impairing the positive impact of cost savings (we would expect an operating loss).In the optimistic scenario, 3D Systems would trade at only 6x 2016 earnings, suggesting in our view that the stock price could double, at least to reach a reasonable 12x P/E.In the bear case, 3D Systems would not be worth much ... unless the company seeks a merger with rival Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS). As detailed in a previous article, such a deal could be an astute way for 3D Systems and Stratasys to resist the industry downturn and increased competition. At first glance, 3D Systems and Stratasys could cut SG&A by $40-100m (20-50% of 3D Systems' SG&A), representing a 60-150% upside on the newco's operating profit in FY16! We also assume that the newco would not cut R&D spending and that the combination of both 3D Systems' and Stratasys' research efforts would enable the newco to come up with new products and features and to better compete with its rivals.In conclusion, we see the risk/reward on the stock slightly skewed to the upside. But we would like to see at least two quarters of top line and earnings resilience before becoming more aggressive on the stock."
3783326,98626,2015-12-30T12:30:00-05:00,"3D Systems will discontinue Cube and Cubify.com, its lower price consumer printer platform in a shift back toward manufacturing.The discontinuation is expected to lower revenue by 2% as well as result in write-down charges, a minimal impact on performance.In a low-growth environment and transition period, focusing on cost optimization and margin improvement I consider to be the right steps, especially after having been highly acquisitive.The long-term growth story, which focuses on the broad introduction of 3D printers and revolution of manufacturing processes, is unaffected by this development.","Overview3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) declined 9.24% and 4.51% on December 28 and 29, respectively, after its announcement to discontinue its $999 consumer 3D printing platform Cube in early 2016 (press release here). As a result, DDD expects a $19 to $25 million charge in inventory write-downs and a revenue impact of around 2%. After significant industry headwinds combined with subpar internal developments (issues with resellers and several printing technologies, specifically metal-based technologies) that effectively brought revenue growth to a halt despite numerous acquisitions, the stock is down 72% YTD in 2015.Basis for My AssessmentMy assessment of DDD is founded on the following:Recap of DDD's Recent HistoryI have followed the 3D printing (or additive manufacturing) industry since early 2014 after DDD and other industry leaders, including Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), posted outsized stock price appreciations. Despite the tremendous revenue growth DDD achieved from 2010 through 2013 (ranging 40-55% p.a.), DDD's valuation at its peak would only be reasonable if it maintained such growth momentum for the next 3-5 years - a highly unrealistic assumption. The stock decline of over 60% during 2014 due to slowing growth and contracting profitability appeared to be a logical consequence as the broader market and growth investors in particular were disappointed. A more realistic view of DDD and the industry as a whole began to settle in, putting an end to the hype.In 2015, the 3D printing industry cooled down tremendously. DDD was strongly impacted, with 2015 revenue currently expected to come in below 2014 levels ($653.7 million) despite the acquisitions of botObjects Ltd., Cimatron Ltd., and Easyway Design and Manufacture Co. I see two primary factors that drove this broader industry development:Driven by stagnant growth and consistently lowered forecasts, DDD and SSYS both were hit hard, with DDD and SSYS declining 72.3% and 70.2%, respectively, in 2015 YTD. In recent months I began building positions in DDD (and others) based on significant multiple contractions that pushed the stock into attractive territory and my long-term view that the current soft demand environment is temporary, with growth eventually to resume (currently I anticipate it to begin recovering in late 2016/early 2017 after HPQ's launch).In addition to its stagnant/declining revenue, DDD struggled to maintain profitability as it had to digest over 20 acquisitions since 2013, with SG&A growing by over 1700 bps since its 2011 low of 26.0% to 43.1% of revenue in LTM 09/15 (Source: CapitalIQ, Company filings; Note: SG&A as reported by DDD includes D&A).As a result of the significant increases in SG&A, EBITDA and EBITDA margin suffered, which in turn meaningfully impacted EPS.(Source: CapitalIQ, Company filings)Assessment - DDD is Taking the Right Steps in a Low-Growth Environment, Fundamental Story for 3D Printing Still IntactAs I stated previously, I believe that the soft demand environment in 2015 is a temporary occurrence driven by tremendous demand in prior years and the highly anticipated market entrance of HPQ, with demand growth to slowly recover in late 2016/early 2017, as long as the broader macroeconomic environment remains supportive. Many industry research agencies and consultants continue to predict a rosy future for the 3D printing space (studies quote market growth at CAGRs of anywhere from 20%-45% until 2020P - see here one example). I personally believe 3D printing has the potential to be no less than revolutionary for a vast array of end markets and their manufacturing processes, including aerospace, defense, industrial, construction/housing, automotive, and healthcare, among others. While there surely is great uncertainty regarding the timing and rate of 3D printing adoption, I believe fundamentally that 3D printing is here to stay, steadily becoming more important for manufacturing processes. As I invest with an investment horizon of 5-plus years in undervalued companies, I consider temporary low or no growth conditions and the corresponding low valuations the best entry points to gain exposure. As can be seen below, DDD valuations are at historic lows driven by the current low growth profile. In my eyes they do not adequately reflect the long-term prospects of the industry and an industry leader like DDD.(Source: CapitalIQ, Company filings)Furthermore, in light of the margin deterioration in recent years, I find it only sensible that DDD focuses on improving profitability at a time when top-line growth is hard to come by and cost-side improvements are much more easily to be realized.Similarly, I find the market's response to DDD discontinuing its Cube platform to be an overreaction as the value proposition of DDD has not materially changed for several reasons:ConclusionFor the majority of my time following this industry, I felt that the industry was hyped, and that its major participants were grossly overvalued. By now, reality has kicked in, and I have begun to slowly accumulate the stocks of leading 3D printing companies, including DDD, in light of the significant long-term potential.To use the words of Warren Buffett and Howard Marks: ""What the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end."" After two years of drastic stock price declines and a more realistic view replacing the investment fad, I think the stock has begun to be oversold. I view market sentiment for DDD as fearful, evidenced by in my eyes rather positive and financially immaterial news that may cause an aggregate 13% price drop over two trading days. I believe that the relationship between incremental downside risk and long-term upside potential makes DDD, as well as other leading 3D printing companies such as SSYS, one of the most interesting investment opportunities for an investor who feels comfortable to take a contrarian, long-term stance on a promising industry that has for now fallen out of favor.As with most contrarian investments, I believe there remains a risk that investors opening a position now may experience further losses as the price is largely driven by fearful sentiment and has yet to find a bottom. As such, I think over the next 3-6 months (timing may vary and depends on when channels indicate that demand growth resumes) attractive entry points should present themselves that I intend to use to further build my position in DDD and other leading market participants.Key Investment Highlights and RisksInvestment Highlights:Key Risks:"
3958408,24849,2016-03-15T00:42:07-04:00,"Shares surged after Q4 results, which had mostly been pre-announced.A lot of shorts have covered recently, extending the rally.With no guidance given, near-term future remains questionable.","One of Monday's biggest winners was a stock that had been one of the market's biggest losers in recent years. Shares of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) soared more than 25% after the company announced final 2015 results. While things aren't as bad as they seemed a few months ago, I'm a bit skeptical of shares currently, since they have more than doubled from their 52-week low.There were a lot of headlines on Monday discussing a huge beat for Q4 results. Unfortunately, that's mostly due to Street analysts. Last month, the company announced preliminary results, which included a revenue forecast of $183 million. As of Monday, some analysts had not changed their forecasts, so the Yahoo! Finance average revenue estimate had only increased to $166.4 million. The non-GAAP EPS figure of $0.03 was also mostly unchanged. Had the Street fully revised its estimates, the Q4 beat wouldn't have been as large.There were some parts of the conference call I'd like to touch on. First, management stated that Q4 saw some revenue tailwinds due to timing. Thus, I hope analysts don't overreact to the revenue number and hike estimates too much, which could force a miss down the road. Additionally, while management said the CEO search is making progress, we're now a number of months into that process.Finally, management did not give any meaningful guidance for the current quarter or the year, again saying that demand will be volatile and uneven. You might think management could have given Q1 guidance, given that there are only a few weeks left in the quarter. Investors have been looking for transparency from this company, but they haven't gotten a lot in recent quarters.It seems likely that part of this rally was due to more short covering. 3D Systems has been a favorite of short sellers in the past couple of years, with more than 35% of its float shorted at times. As you can see in the chart below, a number of shorts had started covering in recent months, but there are still a lot to go. At the end of February, almost 27% of the float was still short.Source: NASDAQ DDD short interest pageWhile 3D Systems announced a decent Q4 number, shares have already made quite a move. Many headlines will detail a large beat, but analysts didn't really react to the company's preliminary forecasts. The company is still looking for a permanent CEO and management failed to give any meaningful color on the business. With a number of shorts already covering, short-term upside seems limited until the company can prove that Q4 was not an outlier."
3958357,22148,2016-03-14T18:28:46-04:00,3D Systems easily surpassed Q4 EPS estimates.Organic revenue growth remains negative highlighting that business hasn't improved despite the big stock rally.The recommendation is to not chase the rally today as the lack of guidance regarding Q1 results is a huge negative.,"When I last wrote about 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) at the end of December, the stock clearly offered value, but the momentum remained too negative to own. After writing that piece, 3D Systems surged the first trading day in January before 11 consecutive down days. The stock hit a low of $6.Source: 3D Systems - ProX DMP 320 printerThe negative momentum clearly ended at that point. With the stock up over 25% following the Q4 earnings release, one now has to decide whether owning the stock after this huge rally is justified.Q4 results matched preliminary revenue guidance, but the surprise was earnings, which easily beat analyst estimates. The closing of the Cube 3D printer and shift away from consumer products helped improve profits.The problem though is that the business hasn't really turned around. Revenues were down YoY during Q4 despite the benefit of merger-related revenue additions from Cimitron of at least $10 million. Though the company didn't provide the number, organic revenue declined somewhere in the range of 6-7% from last Q4.Considering Q1 is about two weeks from closure, 3D Systems provided limited details on the expected results. The discussion focused on caution around a challenging environment and the removal of the consumer product revenue going forward that accounted for roughly $20 million in revenues last year. One has to wonder if the rally would hold if 3D Systems had provided Q1 guidance.The stock is now worth about $1.6 billion with a revenue run rate of around $650 million. The chart doesn't include Monday's big rally, but the enterprise value multiple of forward revenues is now stretched at over 2x. Competitor Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) provides a better value at an enterprise value of around 1.5x revenues.The key takeaway is that no signs exist that business has actually turned around. The stock was beaten down too far and the ability to show stable numbers justified a rebound from the lows below $10. At around $14.50, wait for 3D Systems to cool off as reality will settle in that business is not improving yet."
3785256,22148,2015-12-31T12:16:00-05:00,3D Systems continues to restructure the company for a profitable future.The company is moving to eliminate the consumer business without a permanent CEO.The momentum in the stock remains negative though DDD is bouncing around the bottom now.,"Anybody following 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) over the last few years knows how momentum plays a huge role in the stock price. About two years ago, the stock never deserved a price approaching $100. Now it might not deserve a price below $10.The problem is that the latest restructuring moves are disruptive to the momentum of the stock whether good for the company long term or not. With the exit of the founding CEO, the likelihood exists that more restructuring events will take place in 2016 that impacts the stock.Cube ImpactA couple of days back, 3D Systems made the decision to close the consumer 3D printer that the founding CEO was very fond of. The timing of the news is interesting considering the company is led by an interim CEO, but the move is highly necessary.According to the press release, the remaining $999 Cube printers will be sold from inventory before closing the product line. The cubify.com website will close on January 31, 2016. The key detail and the prime reason this move was long overdue was the following statement in the press release:So shutting down this high-profile 3D desktop printer has an immaterial impact to revenues and improves profits. Based on $645 million of revenue for 2015, the company is shuttering a business line that was generating no more than $13 million in revenues.Considering the problems with the more successful Makerbot unit at Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), it is clear that these companies focused on the industrial and manufacturing systems have a difficult time also meeting the limited demand for desktop 3D printers.Based on the reports from 3D Hubs, the Cube printer isn't wanted by the market.Source: 3D Hubs December 2015 trendsMore RestructuringConsidering analysts expect the company to skate around the profitability curve, it doesn't need large-scale restructuring. Of course, a new CEO might think differently and so far one isn't even in sight.Needham & Co. appears to think otherwise. According to analyst James Ricchiuti, 3D Systems needs to shut down Gentle Giant Studios 3D collectibles business, the scanner products, and 3D culinary applications.These other business lines appear logical and not impacting to the company other than possibly a small bump to profits. The key though is that 3D Systems needs to exit any business line that impacts the top line as soon as possible. The stock won't rebound until a turnaround is in place and constantly dripping revenues won't help market psychology.TakeawayThe stock is trading around the lows from early November suggesting the bottoming process is still in the works. Value exists with the stock below $10, but as my previous research predicted the restructuring process will kill momentum and a full-time CEO is a must before returning to the stock.At roughly 1.5x sales forecast, 3D Systems is a stock to watch in 2016. For now though, the momentum is still negative and investors are best off to continue watching for a reversal in the momentum."
3778896,24849,2015-12-28T12:24:13-05:00,The company is discontinuing production of Cube consumer printer.Revenue generation was already the company's biggest issue.A large chunk of the recent rally has been wiped out.,"On Monday morning, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) announced that it would stop production of its $999 consumer 3-D printer, the Cube. With the 3-D printing business not taking off in recent years as hoped, the company has struggled to grow revenues and is looking for better returns on investments and higher earnings. Unfortunately for the stock, another hit to revenues and the associated write down has eliminated a large chunk of the recent rally.I understand that the current management team, which includes an interim CEO, is looking for ways to improve the business. However, the consumer 3-D printing market was supposed to be a huge part of this industry's growth over the next couple of years. 3D Systems has underperformed in a significant way, with revenue estimates for this year coming down dramatically in the past year and a half.Source: Yahoo! Finance analyst estimatesIn the press release, management stated that revenues will be impacted by less than 2%. While that doesn't seem like much, we've seen the overall revenue estimate for this year come down by $287 million since July 2014. Now, the company is talking about taking off another $12.5 million or so of revenues, and this year was already projected to see a 1.4% decline. When your biggest problem is revenue generation, eliminating part of your business doesn't always seem like the best idea.Management says that the move will help with profitability, but that's after the huge write down of inventory. Don't forget, analysts are using non-GAAP earnings for their EPS estimates, as the company's true bottom line number is actually much worse. In 2016, analysts were looking for a non-GAAP EPS rebound to $0.28, after $0.13 this year and $0.70 in 2014. Part of Monday's news will help with that EPS rebound, but we're still talking about a business in much worse shape than it was in 2014, and we are only looking at adjusted EPS.I also believe that this announcement was poorly timed, as we had recently seen a shift in sentiment regarding this stock. Shares were looking to find a bottom, and a number of shorts were covering. In fact, as you can see in the chart below, short interest was at its lowest point since May 2014. That's despite a roughly 7 million share or 7% increase in the stock's float. The number of investors betting against this stock had finally started to turn.Source: NASDAQ DDD short interest pageAs the company looks to overhaul the business, management believes stopping production of the Cube will help with profitability, after taking out the necessary write down, of course. Unfortunately, this was a company that was struggling to grow revenues, so chopping off another 2% or so of the top line hits the company where it hurts most. Shares of the company had recently started to rebound from their multi-year lows, and short interest was continuing to fall, but about 30% of the recent rally has been eliminated thanks to this decision. This news puts an end to the company's dreadful 2015 year, but if we see more announcements like this in the coming weeks, it wouldn't surprise me if shares retest their 52-week low."
3705076,24849,2015-11-23T02:20:08-05:00,Shares down 24% since close on earnings day.Analyst estimates finally starting to reflect reality.Company needs to find a CEO and get back to growth.Support may not be found until 50-day line levels off.,"Earlier this month, I detailed how the Q3 earnings report from 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) was one of the worst during this earnings season. Despite terrible results, shares jumped on earnings day, probably due to some short covering, but they've fallen about 24% since. Now that shares are in single digits like I've been predicting for a while, I think the stock is finally getting closer to where it should be.For investors to have faith in the stock, one of the most important items is having realistic expectations. In the table below, you will see how analyst estimates have come down dramatically since the Q3 report. With the company continuing to disappoint, analysts have been way too positive in recent quarters. Now that the street is looking for a revenue decline this year, I think estimates are a lot more realistic than they were just a few weeks ago.*2016 revenue growth rate based on 2015 revenue estimate on that specific date.Part of this reality is getting the huge estimate ranges down. On November 5th, there was a $100 million difference for 2015 revenues between the highest and lowest estimate on the street. Given how the company's results haven't seen too much volatility on a quarterly basis, this range was way too wide. Now, the difference between the highest and lowest estimates is just $46 million, meaning there's a growing consensus on where the business is actually at. You might normally expect this given that we are now in Q4, but analysts can be very unpredictable.So what does the company need to do to regain trust with investors? Well, getting a permanent CEO in place would certainly help, and hopefully the company can do that by the time it reports Q4 results (probably sometime in February 2016). There will be questions about a return to growth until a new leader is chosen, because current management may be too busy looking for a leader to focus on a long-term strategy. If a new leader isn't found until the spring or summer of 2016, next year might turn out to be another lost year for the company.The second thing that must be done is a realistic examination of the balance sheet. 3D Systems, like some of its peers, made a lot of acquisitions in recent years in an effort to bolster future growth. Many of these purchases have not worked out well, and some 3D printing names have taken large write-downs on these assets. As of the most recent 10-Q filing, 3D Systems had about 60% of its assets based in goodwill or intangible assets. There are some out there that won't buy this name until some major write-downs come.Another part of the balance sheet process is to determine what to do with cash going forward. 3D Systems ended Q3 with $157 million in cash, while not having any debt. The company's market cap is under $1 billion thanks to the stock's fall, so about 16% of the business' value is in cash. Management needs to decide what to do with cash and potential debt going forward. Perhaps more acquisitions are needed, but if the company really believes in its future, maybe taking out some debt to buy back stock in this low interest rate environment might be worthwhile.As you can see in the chart below, shares of 3D Systems have not done well in recent months. The stock was not able to stay above its 50-day moving average after earnings, causing shares to head lower. We are now in the single digits as I predicted, and it will take another month or two for the 50-day line to level off. Once this key technical level flattens out, we should see some technical support for shares to start to build. It's hard for a turnaround to occur when your 50-day moving average line has been in decline for nearly two years.(Source: Yahoo Finance)In the end, I think the situation regarding 3D Systems has gotten a lot more realistic in recent weeks. Analyst estimates have dropped to a point where they make more sense, and the stock fell to a new multi-year low. Now, the company needs to make some key decisions about its future, not only in terms of management but long-term strategy. While I don't know if shares have truly bottomed yet, I'd be more confident buying at these levels than I would have been purchasing near $12 right after that terrible earnings report."
3753646,24849,2015-12-14T11:46:28-05:00,Shares have found support above $9 a share.Short interest at lowest point in more than a year.Analyst estimates begin to level off.,"A couple of weeks ago, I discussed how shares of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) were looking to find a bottom. The 3D printing stock has been one of the worst performing names in the market this year, and investors are hoping that a rebound will happen in 2016. With just a few weeks left in the year, it does seem that sentiment in the name is starting to shift. Now, it is up to the company's management to determine the future for this company and struggling stock.Shares of the stock have bounced a little more than 6% since my prior article, and that includes Friday's near 4% decline. With the stock recovering a bit, it has narrowed its gap with the key 50-day moving average line, seen in the chart below. If this stock is going to truly break out, it needs to break above the 50-day, and get this technical line moving higher. For now, the line is still declining, but not as fast as it was a few weeks ago. I've added the arrows below to show the date of my latest article on the name.Another major item in terms of sentiment is the number of shares short this stock. We recently received the end of November update from NASDAQ on short interest, showing a drop of more than 1.6 million shares. While this doesn't seem very large with short interest at nearly 33.8 million shares, this is the lowest we've seen the figure in more than a year. A chart below shows a two plus year history of short interest for 3D Systems.Note: last data point on chart is for settlement date of 11/30/15Since reaching the peak in March of this year, about 1 in 8 shares short have been covered. There still is roughly 32% of the stock's float short, which means it is still a highly shorted stock. However, investors should realize that short interest is at a more than one year low, and that's despite the float rising by more than a million shares since that point. With the stock falling into the single digits, it seems like some shorts decided to take profits.So what does the company need to do to help its stock rebound in 2016? I believe there are a couple of key items:It's been about a month and a half since former CEO Avi Reichental stepped down abruptly. While executive transitions like this usually take a number of months to sort out, I stated in my previous article that I hoped a new leader could be chosen by the Q4 report (most likely in February). The longer this process drags out, the more investors will be worried about the company's future.The second part is to determine how the company wants to proceed with its business in the near term. Thanks to currencies and a struggling industry, the company's revenues are forecast to decline slightly this year, with non-GAAP EPS plunging. The new management team needs to decide which to focus on most, revenue generation or profit generation. 3D had made a lot of acquisitions in recent years that really have not paid off, but management many need to make more purchases to get revenues growing again. With about $157 million in cash and no debt at the end of Q3, there is some financial flexibility here to make a small purchase or two.The third item, and this one is really important to investors and analysts, is the resumption of guidance. Management stopped giving guidance due to poor business visibility a number of quarters ago. Management would gain a lot of credibility with the street if it resumed guidance, even if it is only one quarter at a time. Even if the company were to give a large range, it would be better than providing nothing at all.At the moment, analysts are expecting a 4% rebound in revenues next year, and non-GAAP EPS are also expected to rise. But as we've seen this year, estimates can always come down if the company struggles. With no guidance to go on, analysts have been going quarter to quarter with 3D Systems. Fortunately, the dollar's rise has slowed a bit recently, alleviating one of the pressures on this company's top line. But if a Fed rate hike sends the dollar/euro to parity, 3D Systems will see more revenue troubles in 2016.Recently, we've started to see a shift in sentiment for shares of 3D Systems. The stock has bounced off its yearly lows and found a nice base above $9. Short interest has also declined to its lowest point in more than a year, despite a rising float. Now, it is up to the company to find a new CEO and determine a short-term strategy. With so many betting against this struggling sector, a return to growth in 2016 for 3D Systems could help this stock regain some of the massive losses investors have seen in recent quarters."
3659116,39301,2015-11-06T19:35:35-05:00,"3D Systems hasn't addressed the shortcomings in its product portfolio, and industry trends have not been accommodative.DDD needs a moonshot project to pan out, but given the slow progression of product development, a moonshot is unlikely.Much of the company's IP isn't that valuable anymore, as the company doesn't have a technological edge. Therefore, investors have to base their valuation assessment on tangible assets.When based on shareholder equity, the stock is trading at fair value, but I anticipate operating metrics to deteriorate even further, making the stock a value trap.","For the most part, I wasn't exactly impressed with 3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) earnings results, and while there's not as much risk in terms of goodwill impairment, the company is as exposed as ever to competitive threats within the 3D printing space. The company cites poor visibility for future earnings and has retracted prior estimates on future results. Therefore, investors have to be really careful here, because anything can basically happen according to the management team.In the past couple months, Carbon3D has made ample progress securing funding, as it was able to raise an additional $100 million. Google Ventures led the Class C round.Carbon3D, and not 3D Systems, has the right technological mix to drive further adoption of 3D printing as the technology can be modified to be sold both to consumers and enterprises. The prototyping capabilities of 3D Systems' metal series printers may offset some weakness in core printer sales, but there's no denying the high likelihood of weakening sales/earnings.Source: Amigobulls3D Systems is reacting the way companies typically respond to weaker revenue comps and high overhead. I don't anticipate these structural issues to be addressed through cost controls as the top line is unlikely to recover. Instead, the company needs to deliver a breakthrough technology rather than invest excessively into a product portfolio that's based primarily on stereolithography, or SLA for short. The technology is no longer competitive, and many in the manufacturing industry are looking forward to newer alternatives, and these alternatives are not offered by 3D Systems.Pacific Crest recently released a report to clients citing concerns with regards to materials revenue:It's fair to assume 3D Systems' pricing on materials isn't very competitive. The company often cited high gross margins when pertaining to material revenue, but those margins didn't seem sustainable given the number of competitors in the space. I anticipate both product and material revenue to decline going forward and that an inflection point may never materialize. Service revenue has continued to grow, and for now, it seems that it's contributing partially to the reduction in product revenue. The service model may work for a while longer, but I don't anticipate cost savings to be passed onto consumers when operating on inferior 3D printing designs. As such, there's very little durability to this specific business segment.The business mainly retains its value due to the assets - liabilities = shareholder's equity equation. 3D Systems holds some value because its balance sheet is still pretty healthy despite weakening fundamentals. Shareholder equity was $1.3 billion in the most recent quarter, whereas the market cap is currently $1.139 billion. The core business doesn't create any value in excess of whatever is being reported on the balance sheet because the intangibles don't carry a meaningful value.In other words, investors would do better distancing themselves or shorting the stock given the weakening product dynamics. While the company has pointed out issues pertaining to global macro, I don't think an industry as small as 3D printing is as susceptible to global investment cycles. Plus, many of the issues pertaining to 3D printing seem isolated to the industry itself. Without meaningful innovation, there's not a very compelling reason to replace fixed capital, and 3D Systems hasn't developed a strong enough product road-map to drive meaningful adoption from large-scale manufacturers or replacement demand from the current installed base.Furthermore, the recent departure of the CEO adds further worry or suspicion that things are likely to worsen. Maybe it's for the betterment of shareholders that he does leave, but I can't shake the nagging suspicion that the CEO knows something we don't.Furthermore, the company's revenue weakened sequentially from Q2. Typically, seasonality provides a bit of a lift in Q3, but even with seasonal strength, results were woefully awful.In my prior article, I anticipated the stock to reach $11.53, and quite frankly it's startling to see the stock already hovering at those levels. I reaffirm my prior price target and plan to lower my price target even further for FY 2016 as we near the end of the year. The stock remains a high conviction sell."
3651966,56262,2015-11-05T14:35:34-05:00,"3D Systems' earnings report paints a grim picture of the company's future.Slowing growth and increasing competition are red flags.The resignation of Avi Reichental came in too little, too late.The stock is still a short with 30% downside.","I have been bearish on 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) for over two years now, and as you can see from the image below, my bearish stance has yielded in 60% annual profits in the reference period.Source: TipRanks.comAlthough I have recommended shorting many 3D printing stocks, 3D Systems has always been my favorite pick. The company may have fallen considerably since my initial recommendation, but I still think the stock has about 30% more downside. Hence, I think investors should continue shorting the stock. Let's take a look at the factors that make DDD a short.Slowing growth and increasing competition3D Systems' latest quarterly report was abysmal and paints a grim picture of the company's future prospects. The company, yet again, missed analysts' estimates on earnings as well as revenue by a huge margin. What makes it worse is the fact that DDD's revenue fell 9.2% year over year. The company also reported that its organic growth rate, which determines its yearly revenue growth excluding acquisitions made within the last 12 months, plunged 22% (-15% after accounting for currency headwinds).Source: 3D SystemsFor a company that was supposed to ""revolutionize conventional manufacturing methods"" and was expected to become a market leader in a multi-billion-dollar industry, a slowdown in growth is a massive warning. In addition, 3D Systems hasn't guided for the upcoming quarter, and I could only assume that the growth will slow further due to the shortcomings of the 3D printing technology.As per several reports, the 3D printing industry is currently valued at under $7 billion. The expiry of many patents last year opened the door for many small competitors into the market. In addition, investors are also expecting the entry of HP (NYSE:HPQ) in the foreseeable future. All in all, many companies will be competing to gain an edge in a $7 billion industry, which is bad news for 3D Systems as the company's profit margin already stands at -3.24%. Moreover, a $7 billion industry is not big enough to accommodate so many companies, which is why I think 3D Systems will have a tough time maintaining its present market cap of $1.2 billion.All things considered, I am confident that 3D Systems' revenue and earnings will keep falling going forward.CEO may have departed, but the damage is already doneThe resignation of 3D Systems' CEO Avi Reichental was that best thing that happened to the company in the last few years. However, I think the resignation came in a little too late as the damage has already been done.Under Reichental's leadership, 3D Systems went on an M&A spree and acquired close to 50 companies in the last three years. On average, about 50% of M&A deals fail. However, I have always doubted the prospects of 3D printing, and I wouldn't be surprised if that figure is a lot more than 50% for DDD. The company will have to write down the value of all the failed M&A deals it sanctioned over the last three years in the near future.3D Systems' peer, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), took a total goodwill impairment charge of $910 million in the last quarter. However, given that 3D Systems has acquired more companies than Stratasys, the goodwill impairment charges are likely to be more.Over the conference call, SSYS's CEO David Reis stated that the prototyping segment ""has matured to an extent that our customers now have a wide selection of technology offerings to evaluate, resulting in lengthened sales cycles.""All signs point toward the slowdown in the 3D printing industry, which is why I think there's more downside to the industry as a whole. With the threat of goodwill impairments looming large, 3D Systems is the best candidate investors can use to benefit from this expected downtrend.ConclusionWith all due respect, Avi Reichental wasn't a good CEO and the 50 M&A deals sanctioned under his leadership will come back to haunt 3D Systems. The company's profits are already falling, and the impairment charges will make matters worse. In addition, increasing competition will put additional downward pressure on 3D Systems' margins. Considering all the troubles headed DDD's way, I think the stock is still a short."
3651236,22445,2015-11-05T12:17:37-05:00,"3D Systems has corrected almost 90% from its high. As bad as the recent quarter might seem, it is irrelevant because all the bad news is baked in.However, the sector is still growing. And while 3D Systems has hit a speed bump, it is still a fast growing company.As such, current valuations offer a very good entry point. My price target for the company is $20-$25 a share within 12 months.","So 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) had a bad quarter, right? Things have not turned out so good for the 3D sector, right? Does anyone remember what they were saying when 3D Systems was almost $100 a share? I'll tell you what they were saying. There was nothing but praise and how the 3D sector was going to change the way the world worked.Well folks, the above chart illustrates what happens when you buy a stock that will change the world, but disregard what changing the world costs.Disregard the current quarterSo if you are thinking of buying or selling 3D Systems based on the recent quarter, I have news for you, it's irrelevant. I repeat, it's irrelevant. And the reason it is irrelevant is because all the bad news (and then some) is already baked in the cake (the stock price). That's the reason why the stock is down almost 90% from its highs (chart above).There are basically three things that should concern investors about 3D Systems from now on, and the recent quarter is not one of them.Is the balance sheet intact?Looking at the balance sheet tells me if there is anything wrong with the company. If the balance sheet is intact, it means the company will have a chance to come back, even if at the moment it is down on its luck.Looking at the most recent balance sheet, I notice current assets of about $481 million and total liabilities of $219 million, and shareholders' equity of about $1.25 billion (yes half in goodwill).So overall, I think the balance sheet is holding up just fine, despite the fact that the company (and the sector) seem to have minor problems.What does the future hold for the sector?If one does just little research on the Internet, there is not one analyst or research firm that does not think the 3D sector will continue to grow at very high rates over the years to come.For example, Smithers Pira says that:Canalys, a market research firm, says:I could go on and on and on, but I think you get what I want to say. The sector as a whole has a very bright future and is still on track to grow at very high rates over the next several years. Make no mistake folks, this is not a sector where growth will slow anytime soon.Valuation - What are you paying for it?For those who follow me, I pay a lot of attention to valuation. It makes no sense in my mind to pay pie-in-the-sky valuations, just to be in a high-flying sector or a stock, in which the stock has discounted 10 years in advance what analysts are forecasting.How are you going to make any money if you buy a stock that has discounted what's going to happen 10 years down the line? In order to make any money, everything has to go perfect for those 10 years, and you will start to make any money on the 11th year. Well as the chart above shows, analysts and the market was wrong for paying so much.In 3D System's case, the stock is currently trading at about 2 times forward revenue (or a forward Price/Sales ratio of 2). When investing in a growth company, I am more concerned with growth than with profitability. So if the sector grows as many research firms say it will grow, my guess is that 3D Systems is a very good pick at current levels.I am not looking for the stock to go once more to $100 a share, but I can see the stock doubling over the 12 months with relative ease, if in the next 1-2 quarters we see improved profitability or a return to above average growth for the company.If that does not happen and the stock continues to correct, I am willing to take a 15% stop-loss if I am wrong, in exchange for the possibility of a 2X bagger if I am correct.Bottom lineGentlemen (and ladies), I did not tell you to buy 3D Systems or any other stock in the space at their highs, or even when they corrected by 50%. Quite the contrary, I told you to short them even then.However, when valuations change, we have to change with the times. Currently, the entire 3D sector is finally at down to Earth valuations. Yes, 3D Systems has rightfully corrected because things didn't play out like everyone thought; however, like I said, that does not mean that the sector is for the dogs. This is still a thriving sector even if currently it has hit a speed bump.I don't know if buyers of 3D Systems and the space will be buying at the ultimate lows right here; however, the slightest piece of good news for the space or 3D Systems, will definitely propel the stock much higher. My 12-month target, assuming that we do get any good news is $20-$25 a share."
3633806,59621,2015-11-02T14:26:30-05:00,"3D Systems CEO is gone. This might signal a negative surprise ahead of the quarterly earnings presentation.A negative surprise might be related with goodwill write-offs or revenue slumps.Either way, this means 3D Systems will have to redefine its business model and re-focus on the most promising market segments.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) just announced that the CEO is stepping down. A couple of things surface from this event. The most important fact is the company wasn't prepared for this or else Avi Reichental wouldn't be stepping down with immediate effect and the company would have announced a successor or a possible list. This is important because it indicates that a nasty surprise might be on the horizon.Since the CEO was suddenly fired, we are likely facing a recent event that provoked the board's act. One reason might be goodwill write-downs in Q3. The company has been a serial acquirer in the M&A market and it holds a significant goodwill amount in its books. The goodwill is dependent on the company achieving a determined profitability in order to justify it. With the downturn in the whole 3D printing sector, it might have happened that the financial auditors are pressing the company to post a write-down now that the profit and growth expectations are disappointing. Another possibility would be lower than expected revenue, which would mean that the CEO's strategy isn't playing out well. This could have pushed the board to act in order to re-focus in solid market segments instead of trying to sell 3D printers to everyone.Photo Credit: Creative ToolsObviously, all the mentioned possibilities are bad news in the short term and won't stop the downward trend on the company's stock price. However, let us take a fundamental look at the possible scenarios:The write-down materializesI believe that the worst case scenario would be cleaning the totality of the goodwill from the company's books (very extreme scenario). This is a non-cash charge, meaning that it would reduce the shareholders' equity by around $840 million to something like $450 million from the current $1,300 million. This figure might seem shocking but the fact is it doesn't change much. The main takeaway from a possible write-down is the statement that the company has overpaid by some of its acquisitions and returns won't happen overnight. In the following table I have estimated 3D systems balance sheet without any goodwill:Table 1 - Balance Sheet with zero goodwill compared with 2014 (Source: 3DS 2014 10-K)As we can see, 3D Systems still holds plenty of cash which will be enough if the company doesn't fall deep into unprofitability.The problem is revenue (and profits)Another negative surprise that might affect 3D Systems is the lack of growth in sales. The growth estimates have been slashed quarter after quarter since 2014. 3D Systems became somewhat addicted in acquisitions fuelled by a rising stock price that was based on a perceived growth in sales that seemed pretty solid. The current stall in sales and the downtrend in the stock price might have pushed the board into action.The revenue problem isn't an exclusive from 3D Systems. Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and other competitors have been dealing with the same problem, which indicates this is a structural problem in the industry.The vision is wrongIf the earnings presentation doesn't bring a negative surprise, we might be looking at a long-term revamp on the company's business model and market targets. I believe this to be the least likely scenario.This would imply that the board realized that Avi Reichental doesn't have the correct vision for the company. Avi was at 3D Systems as CEO for 12 years. That's a long time for the board to wake up one day and just decide to ditch him. But assuming that was the case, I believe that the challenge is to get a CEO that is able to define two or three market segments where 3D systems can excel. Additionally, it will be necessary to consolidate the recent acquisitions and to define a new growth strategy that it isn't based on an acquisition spree.TakeawaysThe current downturn is not an event exclusive of 3D Systems. Actually, it is affecting the whole 3D printing industry. In my opinion this is something normal. Enterprise consumers tend to go through periods when they freeze non-essential investments like 3D printers. For a still small industry, that means revenue hiccups. On the other hand, the announcement of a 3D printer by HP is the kind of news that can make enterprise consumers wait and see what HP is capable of delivering.Common sense says that the winner of this industry will be the company able to have the fastest and cheapest printing process. I refuse this overweight on the tech factor. Actually, I believe that the company that gets the marketing right will be the winner. The company that is able to profitably explore two or three market segments will be the one to get the funds to fuel R&D to keep developing the process and eventually spill over the tech to other market segments. 3D Systems has been doing this. I believe that the main problem has been lack of focus. The company has been exploring every segment from industrial appliances to printed food. Additionally, 3D Systems has not been able to avoid the seduction of addressing the mass market. I believe it's too early to try to focus on the mass market of individual consumers.That said, I think that in short term the stock might keep suffering. The financial community is now consensually negative on the sector. Therefore, I don't believe there will be great opportunities for gains in the short term.One last note: Looking at table 1 you'll see that the equity of the company excluding the goodwill is around $6.40 per share (diluted shares around 112 million). This might be a good estimation for the present liquidating value of the company. This might be a good reference point if the bearish sentiment keeps pushing the stock down."
3646366,24849,2015-11-04T16:22:01-05:00,"The company announced a large revenue and EPS miss.Management still has no visibility on industry conditions.The stock failed to hold the 50-day moving average, likely headed lower.","Investors were bracing for bad news from 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) this week after the company's CEO surprisingly stepped down last week. The 3D printing name has struggled mightily along with the rest of the names in its space, and shares have lost 84% of their value in the past two years. On Wednesday, the company announced its third-quarter results, and the numbers were worse than the most bearish analyst out there. As I've continued to state, this stock is likely to see single digits, and the Q3 report did nothing to change my opinion.For Q3, revenues came in at $151.6 million, a decrease of 9% over last year's period, or 3% when adjusting for currencies. This number badly missed analysts' estimates for $181.1 million, with even the most bearish number on the street calling for $167 million. The company reported a non-GAAP profit of one penny, falling well short of the 7 cents analysts were expecting.If results in Q4 mirror what we saw in Q3, it is possible that the company could report a revenue decline for 2015. When the year started, analysts were looking for more than 30% revenue growth. EPS estimates had fallen 75% into this report and will head much lower. Gross margins fell 90 basis points in the period.On the conference call, the interim management team basically repeated what we've heard for a number of quarters now. The company has no visibility on industry conditions and continues to be disappointed with its results. Management will be looking to streamline operations in an effort to reduce operating expenses. This is a necessity given falling revenues and pressured gross margins. In the first nine months of 2015, the company reported a GAAP operating loss of $76 million, compared to a $22 million profit for the first three quarters of 2014.I remain extremely bearish on the stock for a number of reasons, mostly the lack of visibility cited by management above. Results continue to disappoint tremendously, as the 3D printing space has not achieved growth as expected. Additionally, roughly 60% of the company's assets are tied up in goodwill or intangible assets, limiting the company's financial flexibility. The only bright spot here was that we did not see a goodwill write-down like we've seen with competitors, but perhaps management is evaluating that situation. 3D Systems has spent hundreds of millions on acquisitions in recent years, and they certainly have not paid off in terms of revenue growth. Perhaps the company is waiting to finish off the year and then evaluate these assets for its audited yearly 10-K filing.On Wednesday morning, shares of 3D Systems spiked, rallying as much as 19.25% at one time. I think there was some short covering here because shares did not fall below $10 a share. However, shares quickly came back down, unable to hold their 50-day moving average. As seen in the chart below, this key technical level has continued to follow the stock lower. With shares unable to breakout, I see this important trend line providing more resistance, part of the reason I see shares heading to single digits.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)In the end, Q3 ended up being a total disaster for 3D Systems. Not only did the company's CEO end up leaving, but results fell dramatically short of expectations. Management continues to turn over, but no one leading this name has any visibility on industry conditions. The consumer 3D printing space has not taken off as expected, leaving sputtering revenues and huge GAAP losses. Shares were unable to break above the 50-day moving average, and we are likely to see a lot of negative analyst notes in the coming days. Shares hit a new multi-year low of $10.01 on Wednesday morning, but these awful results reinforce my opinion that single digits will soon come."
3646856,22148,2015-11-04T17:03:57-05:00,"3D Systems reported an ugly Q315.The stock rebounded strong from hitting new lows as the bad results were built into the low valuation.The stock is clearly hitting bottom, but the lack of a CEO makes 3D Systems difficult to own.","Considering the exit of long-time CEO Avi Reichental and the warning from competitors, the ugly Q3 report from 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) was hardly a surprise to the stock market. The stock hit a new low before rocketing 10% higher.The recent price action in 3D Systems and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) both suggest the sector is now bumping along the bottom following the previous investment thesis. At the same time, expected industry disruptor Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) recently split into two companies with the 3D printing division now under HP, Inc. with the same ticker. The question is whether an investor should load up on 3D Systems prior to the announcement of a new CEO or the official entry of HP into the sector.For 3D Systems, the company reported Q3 revenues declining 9% over last Q3 to $151.1 million, but the organic growth rate was a horrendous 22% when excluding revenues from acquisitions like Cimatron.Before investors get too carried away with the weaker-than-expected results, 3D Systems was still able to generate a small profit when excluding charges. Business is bad, but the company is financially stable. The lack of visibility remains the biggest unknown to anybody wanting to buy stocks in the sector at the lows. The Stratasys CEO hinted at the prime issue possibly related to the new HP offering:In essence, the promises of the low-cost, fast printers from HP has the market pausing to evaluate the technology. The investment thesis still stands that HP is disrupting the sales cycle and not necessarily the product cycle. Read any news story, including one from 3DPrint.com, on the split of HP into two businesses this week and no details exist on when the company will release the new printers.While the sector is in the middle of the disruption of a combination of overspending during 2013 and 2014 and a pause to evaluate new technology, the stock valuation of 3D Systems is reaching rock-bottom levels. Based on an enterprise valuation in comparison to trailing revenues, the stock now trades at a meager 1.5 multiple. Investors amazingly paid a multiple of around 20 when the stock peaked at the start of 2014.The key takeaway is that customers aren't likely to return to 3D Systems in droves without a full-time CEO. Other sector players without the executive disruption are more appealing with an ability to take market share while this company has no proven leader. Likewise, the fears of HP disrupting the market is far greater than any possible reality. Customers are clearly pulling back for reasons, including a pause to evaluate what HP has to offer.The recommendation is to avoid the stock despite apparent signs of hitting bottom."

In one of the episodes, Marty McFly tries to get away from his bullying suitors by using a floating skateboard while finding himself above a little pond. Initially jazzed by the apparent new sensation of the disruptive toy, the sensation of being unstoppable starts to evaporate when the newly found mode of transportation starts to sputter, eventually leading to a more mundane way of peddling himself to the other side.3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) last week came out with 2Q 2015 earnings. Topline growth itself was 13% Q-o-Q compared to 2Q 2014 (22% constant currency). The real issue that drives the valuation conundrum of this company is the organic growth (stripped out for acquisitions done in the last 12 months) which was -5% Q-o-Q compared to 2Q 2014 (2% constant currency).A company that's a growth stock will have an issue with being valued as such if it cannot show growth or convey to the market that growth is imminent. Besides the search for topline, it was DDD's worst quarter in the last 10 years, with a net loss of $13.7m and negative cash flow from operations of $5.4m. No guidance was given for the remainder of 2015. My read of DDD management's view in short is: ""hope for the best,"" or in ""Back to the Future"" speak the ""oh (expletive) moment.""Below is an extract of some quotes from management (in italic) following the Q&A on the 2Q 2015 earnings call that give some clues to the view of DDD's leadership:""Overall, we're disappointed with our results. While a period of high growth enabled us to acquire strategic assets and build critical expertise, our rapid expansion permitted certain operating inefficiencies that we are currently addressing.""The market reaction to the earnings report was remarkable in the sense that the share price shot up 15% or so in the day, although it gave back some gains the day following the earnings call. Investors seem to confuse ""not as bad as anticipated"" with ""bad."" This will not be a bashing session of DDD. Its share price volatility has triggered some strong opinions, all imaginable considering the fact that it was trading at its peak only late 2013 at the handsome price of $93 per share (!).Rather, DDD has an exciting business. It is effectively a founding member of a new industry and it carries a disruptive quote from its website not all companies can stick on their front door:Some investment perspectives on the stock, at best adding some other views or angles to industry experts' opinions on this forum:From a prudent investment standpoint, the current valuation level is difficult to justify since there's no clear outlook of growth. Stepping in now is a speculative move on ""3D printing will be the future."" I hope to see a demand inflection point leading to progression on the adoption curve that would be a success story to the company and the industry. For the time being, I will stand on the sidelines and consider putting some capital into DDD upon a re-rating trigger confirming growth performance and outlook."
3422256,24849,2015-08-10T10:13:35-04:00,Company missed Q2 revenue and EPS estimates.Management still has limited visibility.A reset of expectations is necessary.It would be nice to see the 50-day moving average level off.,"Some of the worst performing stocks this year have been in the 3D printing sector. As growth in the industry has not materialized as hoped, these high valuation stocks have come crashing down. 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has seen a major fall, but the stock has bounced off its recent low a bit after the company's Q2 earnings report. While the report wasn't spectacular, it probably did enough in the short-term to keep this stock from plunging further.For Q2, the company missed revenue expectations by about $1 million, but missed by a nickel on the bottom line. Like most global names, 3D was negatively impacted by currency movements, with 9 percentage points of revenue growth being chopped off. Gross margins remained flat sequentially, which is positive since the company had an inventory write-off and higher than normal manufacturing variances.Going into this report, I was hoping that we'd see a little more positive tone from management, and perhaps get either some quarterly or full-year guidance. That did not happen, as management does not have tremendous visibility at the moment. Growth in the sector has not been great recently, so the company doesn't want to put out a forecast that it doesn't think it can meet. That was the major downfall over the past year, as the company was forced to warn a couple of times. As a result of the most recent report, analyst estimates have come down further, as seen in the table below.*Revenue growth percentage for 12/31/14 and 2/26/15 based on 2014 yearly revenue estimate on that day. All other growth figures are based on final 2014 results. All estimates can be seen here.We're finally getting to the point where expectations seem to be realistic. It was nice to see the order book rise 3% from the end of March. Additionally, management pointed out on the conference call that it still has over $171 million in cash on hand, and it has not used any of its $150 million revolving credit facility. In my preview article above, I discussed the possibility of a buyback, which may or may not come. It all depends on if the company wants to use its cash for a few more acquisitions, to boost revenues, or share repurchases, to boost EPS (and hopefully the stock).In terms of shares themselves, it will be interesting to see what happens over the next month or two. As you will see in the chart below, shares are still a few dollars below the 50-day moving average. It will take some time for this key technical level to stop declining, at which point shares could get a little support.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)While 3D Systems did not have a great Q2, it was good enough to stop the massive bleeding in this stock for now. Expectations have been reduced to more reasonable levels, and it is now time for the company to execute better. The second half of the year is where more revenues and earnings usually come from, so it is time for the company to show some growth. The stock has rebounded a few bucks from its lows, which I'm guessing is a bit of short covering. Whether or not that was the bottom will be dependent on what the company is able to do in the next few months, and if management can have a little more visibility into the future of this name."
3650796,22775,2015-11-05T11:10:09-05:00,"What do companies usually do in shrinking industries? They consolidate.As the 3D printing industry’s outlook remains gloomy, we believe 3D Systems will have no choice but to explore a merger scenario with Stratasys.At first glance, we see 40-90% earnings upside for the newco.","Our August Buy call on 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) was arguably a bit premature as the company reported once again ugly quarterly figures ($152m revenue and $0.01 EPS vs. a consensus of $181m and $0.07).The revenue shortfall (-15% organic growth in constant currency) was clearly surprising after the rather resilient Q2 performance (+2% organic growth) and suggests that customers are starting to hold off their 3D printer purchasing decisions ahead of the arrival of a new wave of printers, something we warned about earlier this year.Below the top line, the main operating metrics were decent, not to say reassuring. The gross margin was only slightly down (-90bps year on year), confirming our view that printers' ASP is under control. Operating expenses were flat sequentially, marking the end of a period of hyper-inflation.And importantly, the cash burn was very limited once again ($4m after $6m in Q2), leaving the company with close to $160m in net cash at the end of September and suggesting that bankruptcy will not be debated in a near future.That said, we believe that a return to high-single digit margins (after the 1% non-GAAP operating margin reported in Q3), which we view as the required catalyst for a stock rerating, is unlikely in the short term. Even if 3D Systems hinted at cost-saving initiatives, we believe they won't be enough to spark a sharp margin recovery given the weak/declining revenue outlook. Indeed, with Carbon3D expected to start shipping its printer by the end of the year and HP (NYSE:HPQ) scheduled to launch its long-awaited printer next year, we fear that 3D Systems' revenue will keep declining at a fast pace, impairing the positive impact of cost savings.So, the question is quite simple: what can 3D Systems (and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS)) do in a shrinking industry?The answer is quite simple as well: consolidate, as it is the only way to grow earnings through material cost savings and to fend off rising competition.Given that ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) and voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET) are rather small players and, as such, do not offer much interest in a merger scenario (limited synergies), we tend to view Stratasys as the most compelling merger partner for 3D Systems. In our view, both companies could easily explore such a merger scenario as they are in the same tough situation and as 3D Systems' CEO (and his ego) left.At first glance, 3D Systems and Stratasys could cut SG&A by $40-100m (20-50% of 3D Systems' SG&A), representing a 40-90% upside on the newco's operating profit in FY16!We also assume that the newco would not cut R&D spending and that the combination of both 3D Systems and Stratasys's research efforts would enable the newco to come up with new products and features and to better compete with its rivals.Obviously, such a deal would be done through a share exchange, meaning that 3D Systems' shareholders would be part of a new venture offering a much improved outlook."
3551406,24849,2015-10-05T13:47:53-04:00,"Stock down more than 75% in past year.September over, yet still no guidance from management.Single digits likely unless visibility improves and growth accelerates.","Over the last year, one of the worst performing stocks in the market is 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). The 3D printing name has lost more than three quarters of its value, as the company continues to post poor results and investors worry about the future of the space. Shares have recently fallen to a new yearly low, and management continues to be completely silent. In this article, I detail why I think this stock could see single digits quite soon.A major reason for this stock's decline late last year was management's overly optimistic guidance. Forecasts kept being cut, so the stock dropped. I'd like to take you back to the company's 2015 first quarter report, where we got the following statement from management regarding 2015:That statement came on May 6th of this year. We are now in October, and there still has not been an update on guidance. Given that the year is more than 75% over, you would think management would have a decent idea of where things stand. In my opinion, waiting until the Q3 report in late October or early November to give a new forecast would be wrong. The stock continues to see new lows each month, and investors are looking for reassurance from management. Since there hasn't been an update, analysts have been forced to use recent quarterly results for their estimates. As you can see below, that means that forecasts have continued to drop almost as fast as the stock.*Revenue growth percentage up until 2/26/15 based on 2014 yearly revenue estimate on that day. All other growth figures are based on final 2014 results. All estimates can be seen here.The most recent analyst note I can find is from mid-September, where Needham reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but cut its price target. The analyst noted that last year's slowdown seems to have continued in Q3, and that 3D's organic growth in the second half of 2015 will be weak. The analyst believes that the company's healthcare business can grow at 25% or more for a number of years, which will be needed to offset sluggish growth in other areas. Management also appeared to reaffirm that operating expenses in absolute dollars will decline next year.As seen in the estimates link above, analysts are looking for nearly 16% revenue growth next year, and non-GAAP EPS are expected to more than double from $0.32 to $0.66. With the company's share count continuing to rise, 3D will need substantial margin improvement to make that happen. Even so, the current projection for next year's non-GAAP EPS is still less than the 2014 value of $0.70 per share, and GAAP earnings will be less.In my most recent article on DDD, I detailed how the key 50-day moving average was continuing to decline. I bring this up because as the technical level has pushed further lower, so has the stock. In fact, as you will see below, 3D shares have not been able to regain this level, which has pushed shares lower. Since my last article, the 50-day line has dropped from $18.03 to $12.86.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)One of the most frustrating things for investors has to be all of the press releases we get from 3D. Throughout 2015, we've gotten announcements on new products and services, agreements with the Navy and other government agencies, etc. However, is the company generating any meaningful revenues from these products/deals? If so, why is management not coming out and saying how good the business is doing?With a stock trading at roughly 34 times this year's expected non-GAAP EPS, investors are paying a premium for a name that's expected to show a lot of growth. As management continues to be extremely silent, investors worry about the future of 3D Systems, especially as technology giant Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) gets ready to make a big move in the space. We are now through the third quarter of the year, and we still haven't received an update on guidance from the company. As a result, the stock continues to drop, with the 50-day moving average falling further and providing more resistance. Until this company reassures investors on the future of this business, I feel that this stock is likely headed lower."

The famous press conference of the entry of the tech giant into the 3-D printing space hasn't actually led to HP selling printers. The promise of the cheap and fast printers though are contributing to an unexpected pause in the investment cycle.3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) trades at multi-year lows and the downfall can be traced to the moment (see ""Is Hewlett-Packard Really A 3-D Printing Threat?"") that HP entered the sector with a product of the future. As predicted in the original thesis, HP hasn't actually done anything in the sector yet. The impact to the stocks of 3D Systems and top competitor Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) since that October announcement though are very visible in the chart. The stocks have seen total annihilation since the threat of HP became real.DDD data by YChartsThe odd part though is that the recent earnings report for HP had a key signal for the sector probably unnoticed by most. After closing up on the brutal market selloff on Friday, 3D Systems appears finally in a position to bottom around $12.HP SignalAnybody reviewing the quarterly financials of HP and the earnings call transcript might find an interesting exclusion. A quick search on the earnings call will find no mention of 3-D printing. The theory all along has been that the market gave the tech giant too much credit for a product that it couldn't deliver until some time in 2016.On top of that, the corporate split taking place on November 1 will undoubtedly cause the company to take the eye off a division that doesn't even contribute to the financials yet.The recent announcement of the BODs for the split companies of HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprises again lists 3-D printing as a market of the future. Again, it still remains in the distant future with nothing more than lip service by the printing giant.Internal ProblemsWhile the weakness in the 3-D printing sector and the distractions of the corporate split at HP helps reduce the competitive pressure, 3D Systems isn't doing itself any favor by reporting constant problems.As feared all along, 3D Systems is now facing integration problems from the numerous acquisitions that fueled growth in the past. The company continues having problems with product issues and operating inefficiencies contributing to missing Q2 estimates.Despite the horrible numbers and execution issues, the stock is bottoming due to valuation. At a market cap of $1.4 billion, 3D Systems only trades at roughly 2x the forecasted 2015 revenue of $722 million. The enterprise value is even more attractive, leaving it and Stratasys trading at multiples closer to 1.5x trailing revenues, a level usually around the trough.Organic growth is all but gone and the stock didn't collapse after the Q2 earnings. When a stock quits going down on bad news, it is a key signal.TakeawayWhile it isn't clear whether HP is still focused on the 3-D printing sector, the prediction that the company would lose focus is starting to come to fruition. 3D Systems trades at $12 due to a ton of internal and market reasons, but the HP angle on the slowing market probably doesn't get enough attention. When a tech giant in the printing space promotes a 3-D printer that is cheaper and faster, the customer base is bound to pause investment decisions. The quickest way to losing a job is investing millions into 3D Systems printers that don't match the quality and performance of HP.With these concerns built into the stock, 3D Systems is now at an attractive entry point. If the thesis that HP is more a fear than a real threat plays out, 3D Systems will be a solid investment for years. HP may not have signaled an all clear for the 3-D printing sector, but the stocks have already built in the worst-case scenario. It is time to start building a position in the sector."
3622816,24849,2015-10-29T18:56:10-04:00,CEO Avi Reichental has stepped down.Analyst estimates falling as 3D growth not materializing.Shares hit new 52-week low as earnings approach.,"On Thursday morning, we got very surprising news from 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), which announced that CEO Avi Reichental has stepped down. After more than a decade of leadership, his departure comes at a critical time for the company, as growth has not materialized as expected, and shares have fallen to multi-year lows. As part of this news, the company will immediately start a search for a new leader. This stunning announcement comes just days before the company's Q3 earnings release, scheduled for next Wednesday. As I detailed in my most recent article on DDD, we still have not heard from management on how the business is doing, leading analyst estimates to continue dropping as seen in the table below.*Revenue growth percentage up until 2/26/15 based on 2014 yearly revenue estimate on that day. All other growth figures are based on final 2014 results. All estimates can be seen here.With analysts already at their most bearish point, the departure of the CEO will only add even more worries to a name already finding many skeptics. The bearish side of me wonders if the Q3 report will be just as bad as recent ones. Now the company must go through a transitional period as it struggles to get its growth on track. The 3D printing space has been one of the most disappointing sectors of the market in the last year or so, and the most recent news has pushed 3D shares to new lows as seen below. A falling 50-day moving average will provide even more technical resistance to a stock attempting to find a bottom.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)In the end, the surprising departure of 3D Systems' CEO just days before earnings seems like a big red flag. Expectations have already dropped for the name, as it continues to miss growth targets, and management still has not provided an update on 2015 guidance nearly 10 months through the year. With the company looking to now find a new leader, its focus will be divided, which I think will hurt prospects for a major growth rebound in 2016. This name now seems destined to see single digits, with the only question now being how bad will next week's earnings report be?"
3413886,22775,2015-08-07T09:39:41-04:00,Gross margin surprisingly resilient in Q2.Cash burn under control.We raise our target price and recommendation to Buy from Sell.,"Following Stratasys' (NASDAQ:SSYS) poor quarterly report last week, 3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) Q2 results did not come as a major surprise. While revenues were in line ($170m, 2% organic growth), earnings fell short of expectations ($0.03 vs. a consensus of $0.08) as the operating margin collapsed due to high opex levels at acquired companies.Unsurprisingly, the company refrained from providing a Q3 or FY guidance as visibility on the short-term outlook remains extremely limited. That said, for the first time in a very long time (we have been sellers of the name for the last 18 months, see our initial SA article), we found a couple of encouraging signs in this report.First, the gross margin was resilient (flat year-on-year) for the first time in two years, it was even up when excluding inventory write-downs. While we have long been highlighting rising competitive pressures as a gross margin headwind, this sound Q2 performance suggests that gross margins have potentially reached a floor (at least in the short term) and that printers' ASP is under control.This gross margin resilience, combined with some cost reduction measures and a higher revenue base in the second half of the year, could enable 3D Systems to improve significantly its profitability levels over coming quarters (from a low-single digit operating margin in Q2 to a high-single digit margin by Q4 in our view), even assuming a depressed demand environment.Second, the company burned only $6m cash in the quarter. This cash burn level does not appear particularly worrying as 3D Systems has a comfortable net cash position ($171m) and could generate cash soon, should it succeed in preserving its gross margins and cutting costs over next quarters. We used to see bankruptcy as a plausible scenario, now it appears that 3D Systems got a significant lifetime extension!Clearly, 3D Systems is not out of the woods and the company will have to demonstrate in Q3 and Q4 that it can deliver at least high-single digit margins despite limited revenue growth. If the company executes, investors could be tempted to value the stock using more aggressive operating margin assumptions (between 10% and 15%).We have updated our DCF model (see below), using a 1.3x beta vs. 1.5x previously as we consider that the level of risk has declined. Our model yields a $15/ share valuation for 3D Systems (vs. $13 previously). While the upside does not appear significant, we would stress that the short-term valuation could benefit from improved sentiment and short covering and that any additional positive news flow in coming quarters could spark major upward revisions of our target price."
3408196,86806,2015-08-06T11:53:29-04:00,"Investors obviously got the long term trend of DDD wrong, but how so? And why?Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors.I provide a counter to a recent Seeking Alpha post arguing that its price/book ratio is attractive.After yet another expected whiff on Q2 earnings, despite a massive morning rise, DDD is still not a buy.","I never considered myself a ""value investor."" Value, ha, that's for the older crowd with their Microsofts (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBMs (NYSE:IBM) isn't it? Maybe after my lesson learned from 3D Systems it's not as outrageous a concept as I thought it might be. Some time ago, this way of thinking led me to buy some shares in perhaps one of the most infamously shorted stocks of the past 18 months - 3D systems (NYSE:DDD). 3D Systems violates just about every principle of value investing.In Part I of this article I analyze several things investors missed, and continued to miss quarter after quarter. In Part 2 I analyze a fellow Seeking Alpha writer's recent post prior to earnings arguing that 3D Systems is a Buy, and address his methodology error in valuing a company with such a high proportion of intangible assets with a price/book ratio. Despite a 25% rise as of this morning for reasons that might only become apparent on the conference call, 3D Systems continues to be an extremely underwhelming stock.A Quick Peek at the Numbers3D Systems reported a Q2 2015 loss of $13.7 million, despite reporting a profit in the same quarter in 2014. It also lost 12 cents a share, and made an adjusted 3 cents per share, under the expectations for 8 cents a share. 3D Systems also missed on revenue by about $8-10 million depending on what estimate you're using, coming in at $170 million. Revenue growth was 13% over the 2014 prior quarter. Organic revenue also declined by 5% (!!).CEO Avi Reichental summed up earnings with the comment he has used almost every recent quarter, stating that they are ""disappointed with the overall results"" and that there are still, somehow, ""operating inefficiencies"" affecting growth. The stock has been up and down this morning, rising to almost $15 (a near 30% gain), before falling to the low $14 at the time of this writing. This can probably be explained by satisfaction that at least 3D Systems didn't completely blow the ball on revenue. So is this a time to jump back in? I think not.Limit Your Selection to Stocks Selling Not Far Above Tangible-Asset Value3D Systems failed miserably on this metric during its stratospheric rise, as well as on its downward descent, and it continues to fail in this respect. Value investors limit themselves to companies selling not too far above tangible asset value, excluding intangible assets like goodwill, copyrights, trademarks, patents, and brands.3D Systems Form 10-Q filed for the recent quarterly period ending March 31, 2015 states that 3D systems goodwill and net intangible assets totaled just over $901 million of its $1.513 billion dollar assets. As of the end of that period, 3D Systems closed at $27.42, a massive drop from its near $100 price point just 15 months prior. Its market cap at the time was about $3 billion (down from about $10 billion at the top of its run), or about 4x tangible assets.Has any of this changed for the current quarter? No. 3D Systems reported $627 million in goodwill and another $287 million in net intangible assets. It's total assets were $1.526 billion, resulting in total tangible assets of $612 million. Thus, it currently trades just under 3x tangible assets. The pricepoint is certainly more attractive than ever before, but another big issue remains.Obvious Prospects for Physical Growth in a Business Do Not Translate Into Obvious Profits for InvestorsAt its peak the growth of 3D Systems was so obvious to the world. Canalyst predicted the global 3D printing market to grow to $16.2 billion by 2018, attaining a compound annual growth rate of 45.7% from 2013 to 2018. Even as the industry began its retrospectively obvious decline, Gartner predicted a compound annual growth rate of 106.6% in worldwide shipments of 3D printers from 2012 to 2018, and a revenue growth of 87.7% for this period. If an inflection point was coming, the market still seems to be waiting for it.3D Systems is not even close to matching market expectations when it comes to this level of growth. Their Q1 2015 Q/Q growth was a paltry 8.7%, and their Q2 2015 Q/Q growth was, as stated, 12.5%. Their organic growth actually declined this quarter - growth not accounting for acquisitions less than one year old. The company has simply failed to demonstrate, quarter after quarter, that it can generate consistent double digit revenue growth.When company growth consistently fails to meet expectations for industry growth, you have a problem on your hands. Those that spotted this earlier than others saved a lot of pain. With such large expected revenue growth, many expected at least some evidence of profits, yet 3D Systems continues to show losses, all while being unable to grow revenue even close to industry expectations.Minimize the Odds of Suffering Irreversible LossesThe classic saying goes that ""taking a foolish risk can put you so deep in the hole that it's virtually impossible to get out."" 3D Systems is the epitome of that stock, despite it looking like it can't go too much lower than the mid-teens. But with continued operational efficiencies, a lack of evidence that it can sustain any semblance of large double digit growth sufficient to warrant its price, and a lack of any evidence that the business can be profitable at any point in the near future, more losses may yet to come, despite the nice bump this morning.Is 3D Systems a Buy after Q2 Earnings?Fellow Seeking Alpha contributor George Kesarios recently wrote that 3D systems was a buy at $15 a share (it now sits near $13 by the way). He stated that ""[a]n added feature is that the stock is also trading close to book value, with the Price/Book ratio at about 1.3. So you are basically buying the stock at book, something very rare for a growth stock.""Mr. Kesarios's calculation is premised on including the nearly 60% worth of intangible assets that comprise 3D Systems. If we take out 3D System's intangible assets, and use 3D System's Price/Tangible Book Value (a more reasonable metric for this type of stock given its massive proportion of goodwill), its recently reported tangible assets are about $612 million, and its liabilities $230 million. Thus, it's tangible book value is $382 million. With a market cap of about $1.6 billion, we get a tangible price/book ratio of about 4.2. I leave the conclusion as to whether that makes it a buy or sell, but given 3D System's almost unnatural proportion of intangible assets on its books, I believe the tangible book value per share should be used when considering the stock, and that using the price/book ratio in such a straightforward manner may be somewhat misleading."
3411656,22445,2015-08-06T18:51:49-04:00,"3D Systems was ripe for a rally for many reasons I outlined in my previous article on the company.Citigroup's upgrade of Stratasys probably lended a helping hand, but it's not the real reason.And the answer is yes - it's time to buy, because if I'm right the stock has a long way to go.","On July 23 I wrote an contrarian article saying to keep 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) on your radar screen. I ended the article saying:Well that time is probably now.I must admit that to my amazement, the stock at the time was about $15 a share and it dipped all the way down to as low as $11.50 a share, before roaring back yesterday.The question is, what transpired to inspire yesterday's rally? The answer is nothing. Like I said in the previous article, the stock was ripe for a rally for many reasons, the most significant of all was that it was undervalued on a Price/Sales basis relevant to its growth prospects.I must admit that the upgrade of Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) by Citigroup analyst Kenneth Wong to a buy from neutral probably helped (though his 12-month price target is only $35), but I think this is more of a smokescreen.I'm also not going to get in the details of the earnings report, trying to guess for what a reason and why investors were overwhelmed, so as to bid the stock price as high as 25% yesterday because it makes no sense. 3D Systems' quarter was not good by any metric. And trying find a reason why the market got excited makes no sense.The reasons why 3D Systems rallied yesterday are as follows:1) As I said on my previous article, the stock was extremely oversold. Rarely does one find a stock with an RSI of 20 on a weekly scale that will not bounce at some point when analysts concur that it will still grow next year.2) The stock on a Price/Sales basis relevant to its growth prospects is cheap. Yes I know you don't hold that metric in high regard, but in my book it explains many strange behaviors.3) It also helps when about one-hird of the float is sold short. While we will have to wait to see what percent of those who were short covered, nevertheless I think it will be substantial.So is this a good time to jump on board? Yes, absolutely. And personally I think investors who didn't buy yesterday have not lost much because if I'm right, DDD and the entire sector probably have a long way to go.No I do not think the sector will reach its all time highs any time soon (at least for the next decade that is), but I could easily see DDD doubling from current prices over the next 3-6 months. And that's no small potatoes in any book."
3390495,24849,2015-08-03T11:59:18-04:00,Shares plunging to new lows.Estimates declining after Stratasys warning.Management may need to do something big.,"One stock that has really alarmed me in recent weeks is 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). The 3D printing name has been one of this year's biggest losers, and the stock is hitting new lows basically every day now. With earnings coming this Thursday, investors are hoping that the stock can finally find a bottom. With management continuing to be alarmingly silent, however, I'm wondering if the window of opportunity to save this stock has closed.One of the biggest problems here is the lengthy timeframe before the company reports. The company's Q2 period ended at the end of June, and on July 16th, we received a press release detailing earnings on the morning of August 6th. Since then, the stock has declined nearly 27%. Management pulled its 2015 forecast earlier this year, and hasn't said much since. The only news here is the numerous lawsuits against the company regarding shareholder losses. With disappointing results over the last year, management silence has led investors to believe the situation has not improved.Last week, 3D peer Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) issued terrible Q3 guidance and withdrew its 2015 forecast, leading many to worry about the sector's growth. As you can see in the table below, estimates for 3D have started to decline again thanks to the Stratasys warning. I wouldn't be surprised if the average forecast hits a new low by Thursday's report.*Revenue growth percentage for 12/31/14 and 2/26/15 based on 2014 yearly revenue estimate on that day. All other growth figures are based on final 2014 results. All estimates can be seen here.In my most recent article on the name, I detailed how I thought management was key to a turnaround. While Q2 results will be closely analyzed, I thought that 2015 guidance needed to be re-established. While we know that any forecast from the company will be lower than the original forecast, I would hope management has some visibility with more than 7 months of the year on the books. I'd rather see a full year forecast that is lower than expected than no forecast at all.However, given the fall in shares, I'm now starting to wonder if management has to do something bigger. As of Monday morning, the stock was trading for about 22.5 times this year's expected non-GAAP EPS, down from about 41 times back in May. Perhaps the company should now announce a buyback program, if it truly believes in its future? With a market cap of around $1.4 billion, even a $100 million buyback would be rather sizable, and it might help to chase some of that massive short base away.With just a few days until 3D Systems reports earnings, the stock has plunged to another low. Bad news later this week could put the single digits in play, for a stock that started the year in the low $30s. The chart below paints an ugly picture, and management really needs to step up. If results have not started to improve yet, perhaps we need a buyback program to give investors a reason to buy this stock again.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)"
3350325,22445,2015-07-23T12:42:30-04:00,"3D Systems has gone from almost $100 a share to under $15 a share, based on growth concerns.Metric wise however, there are not many differences today than when the stock was trading at its highs.Today 3D Systems is a great value, given that analysts still see 20% growth.One thing is for sure, opportunity knocks at both extremes, and today the stock is a screaming buy.","Contrarian investing is not easy. The problem with heard sentiment is that it's like a locomotive. You can not get in front of it, hoping to stop the train. You have to keep to the side and wait till it runs out of fuel and stops. Otherwise you will be run over.However, it pays to be a contrarian at the extremes. Meaning, when a stock is trading for bubble valuations, or when investors think the world is coming to an end after a very big correction, and everyone is throwing in the towel, even if the fundamentals warrant otherwise.Now that the huff and puff has been exhaled from the 3D space, Ι think it's time to reconsider the space as a whole. I think everyone was wrong when they were buying at the top, and chances are that everyone is wrong today, selling the space as if there is no tomorrow.Remember when everyone was buying the space hand over fist over a year ago? Remember when nothing could go wrong? Remember when analyst after analyst was seeing never-ending growth in the space, even as stock prices were running a decade ahead of fundamentals?Well today we are at the opposite end, and everyone is selling stocks like 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) like there is no tomorrow.If we look at the chart above, DDD today is trading at about $15 a share. Please note the last time DDD was trading at these levels, the company was booking about $80 million in quarterly revenue. Today DDD is booking about $160 million in quarterly revenue.However even more astonishing, is that when DDD traded for as high as $100 a share, it was booking about $150 million in quarterly revenue, and today DDD is trading at a fraction of that and is doing even higher quarterly revenue.My question is, what were investors thinking of when they were buying the stock at almost $100 a share, and what are they thinking of today, when they are selling it as if the world is coming to an end. Honestly, I don't know. One thing is for sure, opportunity knocks at both extremes.Why 3D Systems is an opportunityFirst of all, and irrespective of the reasons investors are so bearish on DDD at the moment (because I take for granted they are wrong), let's look at some of the metrics of the stock today.At today's prices DDD trades at about 2.4 times trailing revenue. And if analysts are correct about next year's growth, it is also trading at less than 2 times forward revenue.An added feature is that the stock is also trading close to book value, with the Price/Book ratio at about 1.3. So you are basically buying the stock at book, something very rare for a growth stock.Again, if analysts are correct, DDD is also trading at a forward P/E of 16. While not dirt cheap, it's a fair P/E for any stock with 20% growth.Technical picture is screaming for a relief rallyclick to enlarge)While I could mention a host of technical metrics, there is not one that is not screaming oversold. It's very rare to see a stock that is projected to grow over 20% to have a RSI of 20 on a weekly scale. Granted it has happened before, but from my experience, it is usually accompanied by a very big rally after some point.And the reason is simple. It's one thing for a stock to be this oversold because the market is discounting it will go out of business, and it's another for a stock with 20% projected growth, that is not going out of business, to be this oversold.I do not have a crystal ball to tell you from what point we will have a rally, but I can tell you that history tells us we probably will.Even if you are looking for a bounce to make a fast trade, you should keep DDD on high alert for signs of technical strength. I have rarely seen a stock this oversold that has not rallied after some point for no reason whatsoever.Today we are at the opposite end from 18 months ago Over a year ago I was screaming that DDD, along with the entire sector was a bubble, and that the stocks in the space could fall 70% and still be considered expensive. Please note, I was not saying this because I was worried about growth. It was a valuation call. Simply put, the stocks in the space back then were bubbles.Now I am telling you that DDD can double and still be considered a buy. Not because growth will resume once again to what analysts thought 12-18 months ago, but because DDD is oversold and a good value at these levels.Think of it, what's the main difference between the fundamentals of the company today and say several quarters ago? Not much if you ask me. The main difference is that investors have changed their view about the future growth prospects. Metric wise, there are not many differences.Bottom lineWhen extreme bearish sentiment occurs, even when the fundamentals have not changed much, then it is probably an opportunity. So keep DDD on your radar screen, and when you see technical strength, then is it probably a good time to jump in."
3344015,21798,2015-07-22T19:35:49-04:00,"3D Systems needs to overcome demand issues for improved revenue growth.The company needs to drive down operating expenses.Competition is a threat, which will put further pressure on the company.I don't see a margin of safety for the stock.","I am intrigued by the 3D printer industry. There are certainly a large number of applications for 3D printers across numerous industries. Applications in the automotive, aerospace, healthcare, architecture, and other industries ensure that there will be an ongoing future demand for 3D printers. However, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and others in the industry have been experiencing drastic challenges to their businesses and their stocks. I have my eye on the industry and 3D Systems in particular, but I need to see some improvement in a few things for the company to be a viable investment.Currently, 3D Systems' stock is taking a beating due to a large amount of short sellers. According to NASDAQ.com, the short interest for 3D Systems is 35% of the float. This makes the short trade quite crowded and puts short sellers at risk of a short squeeze on any significant positive news. For this reason, I don't have any desire to short the stock at this point. However, I would keep the stock on my watch list, and if a few things improve for the industry and the company, I may change my neutral position to positive.Overall Product DemandEstimates for the growth of the 3D printing industry vary widely. Depending on the research firm, the estimates for growth range from a 15.7% CAGR to a 103% CAGR over the next 3 to 5 years. Even the lowest estimate of 15.7% annual growth should lead to strong demand and revenue growth for the 3D printing manufacturers.One of the challenges that 3D Systems expressed in its Q1 conference call was that currency issues negatively affected the demand for its products. The decline in the euro and yen relative to the U.S. dollar led the majority of the company's customers to delay new printer purchases. The currency issues were attributed to negatively affecting the automotive, aerospace, and healthcare revenue. This led to a 7% decline in organic revenue for Q1.With such sensitivity to currencies, this is likely one of the reasons that the stock is being shorted. Traders are profiting by making 3D Systems a strong dollar/weak yen and euro trade. So, I would want to see a stronger euro/yen vs. the dollar or strong customer demand from the automotive, aerospace, and healthcare industries despite a strong dollar. Either scenario is likely to help change the negative sentiment and lead to a reversal in the stock price. The Q2 earnings report due on August 6 will shed more light on the demand from these industries.ROE Needs to ImproveAnother important thing that needs to change in order to cause a change in sentiment for the stock is the company's ROE (return on equity). ROE has declined since 2011 and is now negative due to the negative net income reported in Q1. I would certainly want to see increasing net income and a strengthening of the company's ROE before considering 3D Systems as an investment. If the ROE continues to remain low, the company will have trouble achieving its expected EPS growth rates. Consensus estimates are calling for the company to achieve 21% annual EPS growth over the next five years.The reason behind the negative net income for Q1 was a result of the SG&A, R&D, and cost of revenue all increasing at double-digit rates when total revenue only increased by 8.8%. SG&A increased the most at 51%. The increase in SG&A was attributed to compensation and acquisitions. R&D expenses increased at 29% while the cost of revenue increased at 14%. The company will need to sustain its growth in revenue with controlled costs. Frankly, I would like to see double-digit revenue growth on a year-to-year basis along with expenses that increase at a slower pace than revenue.Acquisitions sound great and strategic when they expand the company's product portfolio, but if expenses run out of control as a result, then they may not be worth it. So, we'll have to monitor the impact of acquisitions over the long term on the top and bottom lines.CompetitionThe largest threat to 3D Systems is competition from a new large player such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE:HPQ). HPQ has a lot more resources to develop and sell 3D printers. Currently, HPQ is expected to launch its multi-jet fusion 3D printing technology in 2016. Given the expected growth for the 3D printing industry, I think that 3D Systems, HPQ, and the other 3D printer makers can all exist simultaneously. However, I also think that HPQ could easily become the leader in the industry, thus putting pricing pressure on 3D Systems and the other competitors. HPQ is claiming that it will change the industry and be the low-cost producer. HPQ is also claiming that its multi-jet fusion printer can print 10X faster than anything currently on the market. If this becomes reality, HPQ is likely to gobble up a good portion of market share if its products are well adopted. If HPQ can produce 3D printers profitably, then it might emerge as the most investable player in this space.Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), and voxeljet AG (NASDAQ:VJET) also represent additional competition for 3D Systems. I don't see these smaller players as a huge threat to 3D Systems, but together they will eat up some market share for 3D printers. These competitors have also taken a beating on their stocks over the past year and a half.Another interesting competitor is not yet publicly traded, but claims to have groundbreaking 3D technology that prints in an entirely different way. The company, Carbon3D, has a technology that is known as CLIP (continuous liquid interface production). Instead of building a 3D production layer-by-layer like current 3D printers, CLIP technology grows parts from a pool of resin. This is claimed to be 25 to 100 times faster than traditional 3D printing.Ford (NYSE:F) has tested Carbon3D's CLIP technology against traditional 3D printing for making grommets. The testing discovered that the CLIP technology produced the grommets in less than one-third of the time and with material properties that were closer to the properties for the desired part. The parts produced with CLIP were strong in all directions, like injection molded parts.It is not known how quickly Carbon3D's technology will be commercially available. However, the breakthrough with the CLIP technology saves time with high-quality products. This will be a factor to take into consideration for the future.ValuationI wouldn't put too much emphasis on PE or PEG ratios right now, as I don't know if the analyst estimates that they are based on are all that accurate. The company has been having trouble meeting estimates, and management is holding off on providing its own guidance. So, I performed a DCF analysis to determine the company's intrinsic value. Using my required rate of return of 11% as the discount rate and assuming that the company was able to grow free cash flow at an average of 10% annually for the next 10 years and 3% annually thereafter, the intrinsic value for the stock is $5.25. With the stock trading at $14, there is not much margin of safety. I would prefer to invest in companies that trade below their intrinsic value or at least near their intrinsic value. The stock has been under a lot of selling pressure lately and the value still doesn't look attractive.Conclusion3D printing is an interesting technology, and I'll keep an eye on the industry. However, I would need to see an improvement in numerous metrics before considering an investment in 3D Systems. Growth in revenue, ROE, earnings, free cash flow would all have to significantly improve. Improvements in these metrics would be tied to an improved demand from customers and a large reduction in operating expenses. I would also like to see how HPQ impacts the 3D printing space as the company could grab a large portion of market share with its printer scheduled to be available in 2016. The stock is still not a bargain without a margin of safety. So, I will remain on the sidelines for now."
3297145,24849,2015-07-01T11:12:39-04:00,Shares hitting new lows under $20.Analyst estimates finally starting to increase.Management needs to provide guidance and be realistic.,"When it comes to 2015's biggest losers, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) certainly makes the list. The 3D printing company, which traded for nearly $100 right after 2014 started, now goes for less than $20. Poor business performance and a high valuation have hurt the stock. Overall, one of the biggest issues has been management, which has not been able to provide an accurate forecast. As shares hit new lows at Q2's end, it's time to look at the name again. In this article, I detail why management is key to this stock rebounding.I previously stated that 3D Systems had a lot to prove this year, and so far, the company gets a failing grade. At the Q2 report last year, analysts were expecting more than $931 million in revenues this year and non-GAAP EPS of $1.19. Right now, those numbers are a complete fantasy. When the company provided its original guidance for this year, management called for revenues of $850 million to $900 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.90 to $1.10. That forecast has since been pulled, as business did not materialize as hoped.In my most recent article on the name, I wondered if the stock and estimates were close to bottoming. The stock has fallen to new lows, but we have seen analysts become a little more positive. Some key business partnerships I detailed in my previous article may have helped. In the table below, you can see a history of 2015 estimates since the end of last year. You'll notice the small rise in estimates over the past month or so, and can view all estimates here.*Revenue growth percentage for 12/31/14 and 2/26/15 based on 2014 yearly revenue estimate on that day. All other growth figures are based on final 2014 results.Management pulled its guidance earlier this year, and has not provided a business update since. At this point, nobody knows how the business is doing, and that's what makes the Q2 report so important. The 3D printing space has been overhyped in the past couple of years, leading to big stock declines when expectations have not been met. Since February 27th, the average forecast for Q2 revenues has dropped from $204.47 million (35.0% growth) to $173.82 million (14.7% growth). In terms of non-GAAP EPS, the average has dropped from $0.22 to $0.09, versus the $0.16 reported in last year's period.The Q2 results will show whether or not business has improved from a disappointing Q1. However, the key to this upcoming report will be what management has to say (or not say) about the full year. Since the earnings report is estimated to come in late July, management really needs to provide new full year guidance. Investors and analysts will certainly be focusing on the number(s), but I think the key is whether or not we get number(s). If management still has no visibility on 2015 by the end of July, then the company and stock are in more trouble than originally thought. Providing a new set of guidance will allow management to attempt to restore credibility with investors and the street, given its last few forecasts have proven to be wildly optimistic.Additionally, management needs to convince investors that this is a business worth investing in and that organic growth will come. The company has made a lot of acquisitions to boost revenues, and it is time for those purchases to pay off. In the last year, we've heard all sorts of excuses for bad performance, and those need to stop. The company last October stated it couldn't meet robust demand for its products, but expectations continue to be missed. Since estimates have plunged, it gives the company a better chance to meet forecasts, but 3D has a lot to prove.Even though the stock has plunged, it still trades for a little more than 35 times this year's expected non-GAAP EPS. That's a rich valuation for a name whose growth forecasts have been slashed, and for a management team that investors are not in favor of. As you can see in the chart below, the 50-day moving average continues to drop, and the stock has yet to regain this technical level. Momentum continues to favor the downside at this point.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)Shares of 3D Systems have continued to hit fresh lows, and I believe that management is key to a turnaround. How the business does is important, but does management have any visibility into the future? By the end of July, they really should, meaning we better get a new 2015 forecast. With nearly 35% of the stock's float short, this stock is primed for a short squeeze if we finally get some good news. Unfortunately for investors, we haven't gotten anything but disappointment in the past year."
3304595,22148,2015-07-07T10:17:32-04:00,3D Systems hit a new multi-year low last week.The company remains a force in the 3D printing industry despite suggestions otherwise.The carnage in the stock should end soon as 3D Systems leverages higher R&D spending while any purchase delays related to HP will likely end soon.,"Seeing 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) plunge to a new multi-year low at the start of trading on Thursday had me wondering when the carnage in the stock would end. One can quickly see from the below chart that once a stock loses momentum it is very tough to regain.Of course, the issue with 3D Systems is two pronged. The stock went through a period of extreme valuation and now the company is going through a period of struggling to produce expected results. The importance for investors is to separate the two scenarios. The stock value can always be dealt with, but the key is always whether the company is solid.Company Remains On Solid FootingWhen reviewing the news headlines for 3D Systems, it caught me off guard seeing this stock compared to other big-time loser stocks. The author makes a clever play on the July 4 theme of independence, but he somehow includes this company with BlackBerry (BBRY) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). While one can quickly and easily appreciate the similar stock struggles of the group over the last year or so, the differences are vast.Both Blackberry and Advanced Micro Devices have seen their time in the sun come and go. These companies compete with vastly larger enterprises that control market share and little hope exists for a rebound.3D Systems is still generating growth and is a market share leader with Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS). MIT Technology Review even named it to the list of 50 Smartest Companies. It wasn't ranked toward the top of the list, but it rated higher than Snapchat and even Uber.Of course a lot of issues exist with the way 3D Systems acquired so many companies over the last few years. The ability to properly integrate all of those firms is partially at the heart of the current problems with operations.Regardless, 3D Systems is still leading its related sector unlike BlackBerry and AMD. 3D Systems the company still provides hope for the stock.Reason For HopeOne chart related to operations provides a reason for hope that 3D Systems will soon rebound. Of course, this assumes that Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) doesn't actually produce a market dominating 3D printer when it finally turns the announced product into production some time next year. With the impending split of the company into two on November 1, it has always been a theory that HP would struggle to truly innovate and capture the 3D printing market due to the lack of focus on the sector.In fact, analyst Bobby Burleson thinks the issue of the sector is related to customer investments delayed until better understanding the HP technology:The Q2 earnings call might provide some detail whether customers are still delaying spending, but it could be toward the end of year before any delay related to HP is resolved.One reason for hope and a big reason for the irrationally high stock price of 3D Systems to start 2014 was the shift in R&D expenses. Whether due to the purchased technologies or lack of competition, the company vastly under spent on development for a period from 2010 to 2013. For whatever reason, 3D Systems spent up to 12% of revenues on R&D in 2009 and saw the number slip as low as 5% in 2010. In essence, the company juiced profits in the short term by not spending on the future.Source: Capital Markets LabsNow 3D Systems spent nearly 14% on R&D in Q115 causing a hit to operating margins. The company spent a full 600 basis point more on the category than in the years prior to 2014 where R&D never topped 8% of revenues.Naturally this was a major reason the stock took a hit and provides hope that the extra spending will lead to a stronger future. For now though, analysts such as Canaccord are warning that 3D Systems and the 3D printing sector as a whole could miss Q2 estimates due to a lack of visibility.TakeawayIt is hard to imagine that more carnage could take place with the stock of 3D Systems. Yet the company still remains a force in the industry despite the struggles of the stock. The higher spending sets 3D Systems up for a better future though a lot depends on whether HP can effectively disrupt the sector. The prediction remains that HP is more of a threat that disrupts the stocks, but the inability of HP to get a printer to market until late 2016 is a prime example of why it likely fails to disrupt the 3D printing sector.Since 3D Systems remains an innovative company, the carnage in the stock should end soon, making the current stock price attractive. The stock though needs to show some stability before stepping into it."
3227376,86976,2015-06-01T14:02:50-04:00,The stock has not had any substantial dips since I last argued against selling it short.There has been mixed news about the company over the last few weeks.3D Systems has a history of strong second halves of the year.Strong performance over the next few months should support the stock price.,"I wrote my first article about 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) at the start of May. My article was mainly in response to the calls to short the stock at that time. Over the last three weeks, the stock has not had any significant dips and my call for not to short at current price levels holds. There are a number of factors that need to be considered before making an investment decision in volatile stocks like 3D Systems. The technology is in its nascent stages and there is certainly growth potential.3D Systems is a mixed bag at the moment - good news is accompanied by not so good news. Over the last few weeks, there have been concerns about the changes in the top management and why these changes are happening. There are a lot of theories but the instability at the top level has also played a role in the stock price remaining volatile.On the other hand, the company has had some good news which relates to a small contract by the U.S. Air Force. The scale of the contract is small but the implication is significant. This contract again shows that the applications of 3D technology are growing and the industry is not far from entering the mainstream manufacturing. The level of precision and accuracy provided by 3D technology will certainly put it in direct competition with some of the mainstream manufacturing industries.Another piece of news, or a rumor, which pushed the stock price up was regarding the takeover by General Electric (NYSE:GE). There were rumors that 3D Systems had hired Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to advise on the bid from GE at $30-34 per share. Rumors of this kind have emerged before and while a partnership with or a takeover by the larger manufacturing company remains a possibility; these rumors again seem to have been just rumors.The short interest ratio of the stock also remains near the higher end. At the moment, almost 36 million shares have been sold short and it will take about 11.6 days for the short sellers to cover their positions based on the average daily volume. The short interest has in fact come down slightly over the last 3-4 months further showing that the stock is close to bottom. With such a large short interest, if any substantial piece of good news comes 3D Systems' way, we might see a strong short squeeze which will push the stock up.3D Systems have historically had a stronger second half of the year. The company reports better performance during the last two quarters, which further leads me to believe that the stock price will start to move higher over the next few months. Therefore, selling short at current price levels is risky and the upside from this trade is limited. 3D Systems has a fairly strong balance sheet with no long-term debt which makes it an attractive pick for an acquisition along with its impressive portfolio of patents and 3D printing technology.Having said that, 3D Systems remains one of the most volatile stocks in the market and it should only be considered by the investors with a strong appetite for risk. Traders on the other hand, love this volatility and are making substantial gains. The industry certainly has an attractive growth profile and 3D Systems has a strong position in some of the key areas of the industry. The competition is still not stiff and some of the new players will take time to build their operational scale. In my opinion, 3D Systems should not see any major dips over the next few weeks and the stock is close to bottom.Disclosure: I am not a registered investment advisor and the views expressed in this article are my own.

3211426,39301,2015-05-26T11:48:06-04:00,"3D Systems doesn't deserve a premium market multiple.I'm not really convinced in the long-term viability of their business model as they are not a very innovative organization.They borderline imitated Carbon3D's CLIP printer and also mentioned that their future R&D roadmap was going to be based around continuous 3D printing.Based on projections, it's likely that the company's market share will shrink in comparison to the total market.Investors are aggressively discounting the intangibles of the business, which is why I reiterate my $11.53 price target.","From what I saw, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) looked borderline clumsy at its analyst day conference. I felt that the company's management team looked sincere, but was overly confident in their R&D, top line sales and marketing. They have legitimate competitors right over the event horizon, and quite frankly, they retaliated against the most innovative development in the 3D printing space with a spoof video of terminator, with dramatized sounds effects and concluded with ""the innovator.""Yes, it was funny, and was borderline ""The Daily Show.""This goes back to the TED presentation in which Joseph DeSimone (one of the co-founders of Carbon3D) would base their continuous liquid interface production technology around the Terminator from the second movie of the famous Terminator trilogy. Now for the rare few that forgot about Arnold versus a continuously morphing terminator, the basic idea behind the second Terminator was to take a liquid and convert it into a solid structure. So basically, this robot would morph from liquid to solid and vice versa. The second terminator was tough to kill, making it difficult for the former California governor to throw down some of his cheesy lines like, ""I'll be back, and hasta la vista baby."" In any case, I'm starting to sound like a Rotten Tomatoes review, so I'm going to get back on topic.Carbon3D designed a printer that generates air bubbles to create space between molecules as they pull a 3D printed object out of a pool of resin. That's where they get the Terminator 2 reference from, and that's what the executives over at 3D Systems were making fun of, while creating a gimmicky offshoot of the same technology.Continuous SLA is 3D Systems counter to CLIP, and it sort of made me laugh. Why this is called ""stereolithography"" is beyond me as they never really offered much of a technical explanation. However, they did brag about the future capabilities of the technology as if they're the first group of engineers who came up with the brilliant idea.Here's a pretty important quote from the analyst day conference:3D Systems has developed a solution that's extremely similar to Carbon3D's. This begs the question of whether there will be patent litigation and whether other 3D printing companies will attempt to create a variation of CLIP. In either case, it almost seems as if management laid down its poker cards and what they have is a straight flush whereas Carbon 3D holds onto the royal flush.3D Systems' technology is still inferior to Carbon3D. However, they have a fully developed sales channel and a software ecosystem. Carbon3D on the other hand will get both partnership and investment from Autodesk (the company that owns AutoCAD). So over the long haul Carbon3D will neutralize 3D Systems software advantage as AutoCAD is a well-established software product that's well understood by various mechanical engineers and designers.The other problem I have is the lack of financial guidance. In a prior earnings conference call, analysts asked why 3D Systems was facing trouble with generating orders, whereas smaller competitors were gaining customer wins left and right. Clearly, the problem is less economical, as it's hard to blame the economy this early into the product adoption cycle. There are various markets that can still be developed and disruptive use cases that have yet to be explored.I've sat on countless conference calls where management would whine about the economy. Like for example, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) tend to take turns blaming the economic environment rather than the lack of execution in various software and product verticals. It wasn't the economy that was the issue. The market they were serving was shrinking due to different devices taking a larger share of consumer spending. Or in the case of IBM, a shift in the business model away from full system sales to hybrid cloud and public cloud systems.Likewise, blaming the economy in this case obfuscates the real issue at hand. Perhaps 3D Systems is losing orders to competing products, and instead of admitting that they have run short of expectations, they continue to reiterate their dominant market position. The market, however, isn't fully developed yet, and there's further room to expand the size of the 3D printing market depending on the type of technological solutions that are created.At present, Wohlers Associates projects the 3D printing market to reach $7.5 billion by 2016 (approximate). In FY 2014, 3D Systems generated $654 million (on slowing growth). Analysts' consensus estimates for revenue is $745 million for FY 2015 and $888 million for FY 2016. So, while broader projections indicate rapid adoption, the company that's supposedly leading the charge is reporting a declining growth rate driven by economic factors. The projected market share of 3D Systems is 11.84%, which is not the sign of a dominant competitor.Perhaps 3D Systems itself will shrink in a rapidly developing and growing market. In other words, outward projections indicate that 3D Systems doesn't have the edge that it proclaims to have. With a huge market premium built into the stock on the basis of non-tangible factors it will be interesting to see those non-tangibles trade at market for what they're truly worth.I would never buy a stock for 3.7x sales until I felt comfortable with the niche a business occupies and the long-term trajectory of the aforementioned business. The capital structure of DDD has significantly degraded in quality, which diminishes the viability of absorbing every promising 3D printing start-up. At some point it will have to confront an able-bodied competitor that has significant capital, better products and a strong product ecosystem. Management seems slow to adapt to this reality as the management team overly emphasizes their ability to utilize cost levers, acquisitions and its pre-existing patent portfolio to generate value for shareholders.When markets become more competitive, profitability declines, and business losses can mount quickly over a short period of time. In this case, 3D Systems has not developed enough of a competitive advantage to indicate to shareholders that earnings are in fact durable.To justify a high market premium, the company must operate, as if it has a time machine into the future and is bringing to market products that should not exist at the present moment in time. Everything about 3D Systems screams of a mature tech business that's incapable of developing a significant ramp-up of revenue. Therefore, any of the long-term forecasts made by 3D Systems in past shareholder and analyst day meetings may as well be thrown out from capital asset pricing models or alternative pricing models. The stock no longer carries the implied premium that it once had and further degradation of value is even more likely given the set of circumstances.I continue to reiterate my sell rating and $11.53 price target."
3160126,24491,2015-05-08T11:54:36-04:00,"3D Systems announced disappointing results for the first quarter of 2015 and pulled forward guidance.We've never been fans of 3D Systems, and while we love its technology competitive forces will be fierce in the years ahead.The firm's share price has taken a hit. So does that mean we have warmed up on its investment prospects? Let's have a look.","By Kris Rosemann3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) announced first quarter results in disappointing fashion. The firm cited several factors for its failure to meet expected production, including the decline of the euro and yen relative to the US dollar and the aftershock of lower oil prices. These factors directly affected 3D's customer base, including those in the aerospace, healthcare and automotive industries, which then reduced their spending on 3D's products. The firm claims to have been ""surprised and disappointed"" by the weakened customer demand.Nevertheless, management is optimistic for the firm's outlook and has been encouraged by its belief in its portfolio strength. At last update, bookings in the second quarter are ahead of the pace of the first quarter, and the company expects that many of the manufacturers that deferred their orders in the first quarter will make up for them in the near future as they reassess their exposure to foreign currency rates. 3D's share price has taken a hit since the release, but the firm's share price has been historically volatile. Let's be sure to keep this in mind as we walk through the valuation process.3D Systems' Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• 3D Systems is a leading provider of 3D content-to-print solutions including 3D printers, print materials and on-demand custom parts services for professionals and consumers alike. The company was founded in 1986.• What once seemed like a pipe dream is now a very powerful means of production. 3D Systems is seeing strong demand from manufacturing customers, and the firm's consumer products have recently hit shelves with positive reception.• 3D printing is an exciting business, but competition should not be taken lightly. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) has entered the business in a big way and is pricing aggressively. This is not welcome news at all, and HP won't be the last to make a go at profiting from the technology.• Companies like 3D Systems can get investors in a lot of trouble. Investors should understand that it's not about how good 3D Systems' products are, but instead, the investment decision rests on future free cash flows and whether they are already factored into the share price.• 3D Systems has already exhibited wild share price volatility. The company's shares almost touched $100 before being cut by a third. There's one thing guaranteed about 3D Systems' future: its share price will be volatile.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. 3D Systems' three-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 29.7%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 11.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation rating of EXCELLENT.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid gray line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. The firm needs to continue to improve upon its first quarter results if it expects to keep creating value at an excellent rate.Cash Flow Analysis3D Systems' free cash flow generation has slowed significantly over the past three years in part due to increased capital expenditures. We classify firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% as cash cows. 3D Systems' free cash flow margin has averaged about 7.1% during the past three years, and as a result, we'd rate the firm's cash-flow generation as relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company.At 3D Systems, cash flow from operations decreased about 4% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded significantly over the same time period. Management alludes to this dramatic increase in capital expenditures as efforts to accelerate its planned integration, productivity and efficiency measures.Valuation AnalysisThe most necessary part of our analysis, the valuation analysis, puts together the pieces of our work as we find our fair value estimate. Our discounted cash flow model indicates that 3D Systems' shares are worth between $21-$45 each. This is a huge margin of safety but we think it is an appropriate one - especially in light of the company's volatile equity performance.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's HIGH ValueRisk rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $33 per share represents an astronomical price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and an lofty implied EV/EBITDA multiple. The firm's current share price is ~$22, including the drop in reaction to the announcement of preliminary results. It's just starting to get on the cusp of what we would consider ""interesting"" from a valuation standpoint.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 22.1% during the next five years, a pace that's lower than the firm's three-year historical compound annual growth rate of 22.7%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 19.6%, which is above 3D Systems' trailing three-year average. Beyond year five, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 9.7% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For 3D Systems, we use a 11.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisThe margin of safety is especially important when modeling companies that have inherently volatile intrinsic values. Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $33 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock, which in this case is high. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for 3D Systems. We think the firm is attractive below $21 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $45 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate 3D Systems' fair value at this point in time to be about $33 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of 3D Systems' expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes also is subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $46 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $33 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield.The fact that management was somewhat blindsided by the weak performance of the company in the first quarter is a troubling sign. Orders that were deferred in the first quarter have begun to pick back up, but we do not have a great deal of confidence in the firm at the moment. Competition cannot be ignored within the 3D printing market, and 3D's historically volatile share price does not sit easy with us. Though management is confident that the firm's business fundamentals and strong portfolio will eventually shine through, the risk is not worth the reward for us in this scenario.How to Think About Large Fair Value RangesOne of the most important concepts of our methodology (and valuation in general) is the understanding that the value of a company is a range of probable valuation outcomes, not a single point estimate. Even well-seasoned stock analysts are guilty of saying that a company's shares are worth exactly $25 or a firm's stock is worth exactly $100. The reality is that, in the first case, the company's shares are probably worth somewhere between $20 and $30, and in the latter case, the stock is worth somewhere between $75 and $125.Why? Because all of the value of a company is generated in the future (future earnings and free cash flow), and the future is inherently unpredictable (unknowable). If the future could be predicted with absolute certainly (knowable), then a stock analyst could say a company's shares are worth precisely this, or that a firm's stock is worth precisely that. Not because he or she would know where the stock would be trading at, but because he or she would know precisely what future free cash flows would be (and all other modeling facts-not assumptions in this case) and arrive at the exact and non-debatable value of the firm.But the truth of the matter is that nobody knows the future, and analysts can only estimate what a company's future free cash flow stream will look like. Certain unexpected factors will hurt that free cash flow stream relative to forecasts, while other unexpected factors will boost performance. That's how a downside fair value estimate and an upside fair value estimate is generated, or in the words of Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham how a ""margin of safety"" is generated. Only the most likely scenario represents the point fair value estimate. Any stock analyst who says a company is worth a precise figure - whether it's $1 or $100 - falls short of understanding one of the most important factors behind valuation.But why the large range in many cases? Well, there are many firms in our coverage universe that have a very large range of outcomes in their future free cash flow growth. And because discounting free cash flows is an integral part of calculating the fair value estimate of a company, the range of fair values will also be large. To illustrate this point, let's take a look at the difference between the levels of free cash flows in Year 20 under three different future growth rates: 10%, 15% and 20%. Though the growth rate between each scenario is but 5 percentage points, the magnitude of the free cash flow difference is astounding many years into the future, and our discounted cash-flow process considers the long-term intrinsic value of firms.Under these future free cash flow scenarios, under this completely hypothetical example illustrating only this concept, if we assume an 8% discount rate and 100,000 shares outstanding (and no debt), the difference in the fair value estimate between the upside case (green line) and downside case (blue line) is $68 per share ($82 per share less $14 per share) - all because of just a 10 percentage point difference in a future free cash flow growth assumption. For firms that are growing cash flows at 200% or 300% per annum, a large range of fair value outcomes is not only inevitable but also very reasonable.In other words, the Valuentum framework provides an avenue to quantify the upside and downside risks investors are taking in high uncertainty and fast-growing enterprises - think Green Mountain (NASDAQ:GMCR), LinkedIn (LNKD), Questcor Pharma (QCOR), and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), which all boast very high ValueRisk ratings.To really hit this point home, here's a quick slide of LinkedIn's revenue. The green line (mapped to the right axis) shows LinkedIn's revenue growth rate. Let's assume revenue expansion translates into similar free cash flow growth expectations (not exactly a precise assumption, given the leverage in LinkedIn's business model), but bear with us for simplistic illustrative purposes.Image Source: LinkedInWill LinkedIn's revenue/cash flows expand at a 20% rate, a 40% rate, or a 60% rate (or an even greater pace) through year 20? It's a very, very difficult question to answer. Remember how significant that 10 percentage point spread was in the hypothetical example above? Well, it's even more significant for LinkedIn. We know LinkedIn's free cash flows will expand, and expand fast, but just how fast is certainly debatable.All things considered, we're looking for firms that are trading outside of their respective fair value ranges. A firm trading below the low end of its fair value range is undervalued while a firm trading above its fair value range is overvalued. The fair value range for each company captures the inherent uncertainty of the trajectory of that firm's unique future free cash flow stream.PerformanceIn the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of the Best Ideas portfolio has stacked up in previous years. Past results are not a guarantee of future performance. Thank you for reading!"
3201376,24849,2015-05-21T02:09:36-04:00,"Analyst estimates provide more realistic view.
        Company has announced two new partnerships.
        Gap between shares and 50-day narrowing.","A couple of weeks ago, I wondered whether shares of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) were close to a bottom. Q1 results weren't as bad as feared, and management seemed a bit more realistic about its situation. The company has disappointed a lot over the past year, resulting in a large drop in shares. However, things are starting to look better, and I'm confident that a bottom may be forming.One of the items I mentioned in my previous article was the decline in analyst estimates. Management had originally guided to revenues this year in a range of $850 million to $900 million. This guidance has since been withdrawn, with management wanting to wait for more visibility on sales. Perhaps we'll get new guidance at the Q2 report, but that still would be about two months or so away. Estimates continue to drop, as seen in the table below.*Revenue growth percentage for 12/31/14 and 2/26/15 based on 2014 yearly revenue estimate on that day. All other growth figures are based on final 2014 results.About a month ago, I was really worried about 3D Systems, and at that point the average 2015 revenue estimate was over $857 million. Now that we are under $746 million, the situation has become a lot more realistic. In the first quarter, revenue growth was 9% over the prior year period, or 17% when adjusting for currency movements. The currency situation has improved a little in recent weeks, and if the dollar stays where it is, the currency hit won't be as bad in the back half of the year. When analysts were expecting 31% revenue growth, I was highly skeptical. Now that the consensus is for just a 14% increase, 3D may finally be able to meet estimates.Recently, 3D Systems announced two key partnerships. First, a cooperative R&D agreement was reached with part of the US Navy's Sea Systems Command. The two entities will jointly develop and evaluate 3D printing technology and materials for military uses. 3D Systems hopes that it can help modernize the US defense industrial base, playing an integral part in the Navy's future. The second deal was a reseller agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO). Under this deal, Thermo Fisher will offer 3D's portfolio of products to K-12 educators. 3D will look to get its products into the classroom, to help future leaders in the fields of science, technology, and healthcare.When 3D Systems announced its major Q1 warning, I detailed that the drop in shares would force the 50-day moving average to start declining again. In the past month, this key technical line has dropped by about $2.50, and should be just above $26 by the end of May. If shares remain near current levels, it will probably be another month or two before the 50-day gap completely closes. At that point, investors are hoping that shares can start to tick higher and the 50-day can follow. The following chart shows the stock over the past three months, with the 50-day provided for reference.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)In the end, shares of 3D Systems seem a bit closer to finding a bottom. The company inked two partnerships that should help down the road. Analyst estimates have dropped further, meaning the street should be more in-line with the business. With more than 37 million shares short at the latest update, one piece of good news can send this stock sharply higher. While I'm not ready to go all-in on this name quite yet, I think the situation regarding 3D is improving."
3168606,86976,2015-05-11T10:24:37-04:00,"The growth in the sector is expected to remain strong over the next few years.3D Systems will need to tackle its internal issues in order to capture this growth opportunity.At current levels, downside is limited for 3D Systems, in my opinion.","There has been a lot of volatility in the 3-D printing universe. The lure of holding a breakthrough technology stock has exposed a number of investors to considerable losses. At the same time, savvy traders have made millions due to the stock price volatility. 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has been one of the most volatile stocks in the sector and it also is one of the pioneers. During the last year, 3D Systems hit its all time high of $97 - however, since then, the stock has been in free fall and currently trades close to $22.There are still calls for shorting the stock as a number of people believe there's still room for downside. To some extent, these investors might be correct as the stock will likely continue to suffer in the short-term due to the issues on the cost side. However, the downside is limited, in my opinion. I believe the bottom for 3D systems is near and shorting it at current price levels might not bring a substantial gain.The first factor that we need to consider is that the growth in the 3-D printing industry remains robust and the estimates from the industry experts indicate there is no fear of a slowdown in the medium term. The independent research firms continue to forecast that the 3D printing industry will surpass $20 billion over the next five years.The growth reported by major players in the sector also indicates that the growth in the sector is strong. However, it is important to understand that high growth in the sector does not always translate into high growth for all the participating companies. It will depend heavily on 3D Systems' ability to capture this growth opportunity. The company has faced some production issues in the past which has created doubt in the minds of shareholders about its ability to capture this growth opportunity.One of the major stumbling blocks for the 3D printing industry is the slow printing speed. However, Carbon3D has come out with a printer considerably faster than already available models in the market. This will create some stern competition for 3D Systems. Carbon3D also is a young business and there are concerns about its production capabilities. However, if any of the big guns take it over and develops the production facilities then this might create a problem for 3D Systems. Nonetheless, it looks like the competition is getting stronger as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) also has decided to enter the market.Although there's a prospect of tightening conditions in the market, we are still at a point in the industry lifecycle where all these players can gain substantial market share. 3D Systems needs to sort out its internal problems and establish better channels in order to capture and sustain the market share. During the most recent earnings call, management did not give any guidance due to the uncertainty in the market. However, CEO Avi Reichental did mention that the second half of the year was expected to be stronger than the first. 3D Systems has been performing better in the second half of the year historically. One of the key reasons for the better performance in the second half has been a reduction in the restructuring expenses and the integration of acquisitions. As 3D Systems has been making a number of acquisitions, the restructuring expenses have been eating into the profit of the company. Avi also said this:These figures translate into more than 3% in revenue losses for the quarter. This further highlights the fact that the company needs to streamline its operations and work efficiently in order to capture a larger market share. When competition is strong, customers might not wait for the deliveries of their printers if there are other options available. For this reason, 3D systems needs to enhance its channels and establish better relations with its customers.The valuation of the stock is a different matter altogether. Investors usually do not look at the multiples while investing in hyper-growth stocks. You pay a premium for the future growth and the breakthrough technology. Also, high-levels of volatility in earnings practically renders the multiples approach useless in the case of hyper-growth stocks. This is one of the key reasons investors have been ignoring the sky high P/E ratio. However, a forward P/E ratio of 24 looks more reasonable. Regardless, sky high P/E was not responsible for the fall of the stock price - it was the mixture of speculation and poor performance on the part of the company.So to sum it up, I would say that it is not too late for 3D Systems and it might not be a good idea to short the stock at current price levels. The downside is now limited as the company has a relatively stronger balance sheet. In my opinion, we are close to a bottom and it also looks like management is looking to solve the internal issues - mainly production related. Some of the key factors to keep in mind are: continued high-growth in the sector, growing competition, strong patent position of the company, a focus to eliminate production issues and declining restructuring expenses. In my opinion, 3D Systems will be able to weather this storm and come out stronger.Disclosure: I am not a registered investment advisor and the views expressed in this article are my own.

3162846,24849,2015-05-09T04:23:57-04:00,Q1 final results weren't as bad as feared.Management withdrew guidance instead of lowering it.Plunge in analyst estimates makes situation more realistic.,"Last month, I warned investors to be cautious with shares of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). The 3D printing name saw its stock rallying, which I didn't buy into given a number of recent disappointments. Just a few days later, the company announced a large Q1 warning, which sent shares dropping to new yearly lows. Now that final Q1 results are in, it is time to examine where things stand.When we got final results from the company for the quarter, they were a little better than previously thought. Revenues of $160.7 million came in above the company's $158 million to $160 million preliminary range. This was 9% growth over the prior year period, which would have been 17% if not for the large currency issue I mentioned in my warning article. Earnings per share, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, came in a penny better than the high end of the company's respective ranges.Because of the preliminary results reported by the company, the final results were not going to be the biggest part of this report. Investors wanted to hear management's guidance update. Initially, the company was looking for revenues of $850 million to $900 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.90 to $1.10. Here is the main part of the company's guidance as detailed in the Q1 press release:The bearish side of me says that things must be really bad for management not even to give a forecast. However, after being overly ambitious for 2014 and now 2015, I think management has learned a bit of a lesson here. Perhaps it is a better idea to wait a few more months before giving another forecast for the year. Analysts have become increasingly bearish, with estimates dropping to new lows as seen in the table below.*Revenue growth percentage for 12/31/14 and 2/26/15 based on 2014 yearly revenue estimate on that day. All other growth figures are based on final 2014 results.With the stock closing at $32.50 when I wrote my warning article, I was a bit bearish and wasn't opposed to investors shorting the name. At that point, analyst estimate averages were towards the lower end of the company's original 2015 guidance. Now, the stock is about $10 lower, and estimates are well below the company's initial ranges. There seems to be at least one analyst estimate that has not been updated since the warning, so I wouldn't be surprised if we see the overall averages come down further.Given the drop in the stock and analyst estimates, I think 3D Systems is at a more realistic point now than it was a few weeks ago. For those that shorted this name in the low $30s, congratulations, and I wouldn't be opposed to taking your profit here. However, I'm not ready yet to say that investors should rush in and buy the stock. I do feel we'll see more analyst estimate cuts coming, and then another evaluation of the name will be due as we get closer to the second quarter's end. We also need to see how the dollar moves in the coming weeks, as the company's growing international business is heavily dependent on currency movements. I do think this stock is a lot closer to a bottom now, but I'm not going to definitely say that we've seen that point just yet."
3199206,39301,2015-05-20T11:54:23-04:00,"3D Systems will continue to fall in value following the retraction of guidance.3D Systems faces a more structural problem as it has demonstrated a deficit in innovation, which has led to exposure to competing 3D printing platforms.3D Systems needs to increase efficiency on a logarithmic scale, which is unlikely given the limitations of stereolithography.To bet on 3D Systems would imply that Sequoia Capital is wrong. But Sequoia's selection of investments is top notch, as they have funded Apple, Oracle, Google, LinkedIn and PayPal.Not only does Sequoia Capital have significant AUM, they have demonstrated that they can quickly scale start-ups, and fund them with enough capital to operate at significant economies of scale.","My skepticism toward 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has only grown following the preliminary earnings announcement for Q1' FY 2015 results. The official earnings announcement retracted full-year earnings guidance, which indicates that management has limited foresight into the current business environment. Various factors can affect demand for 3D printing systems, but of them, I believe competition will be the biggest mitigating factor for demand. For example, Carbon3D, a non-pubic company, has attracted significant attention from the 3D printing community and has gained funding from one of the best VC funds on planet earth.Capital spend on industrial 3D printers is a long-term investment. The expectation that the capital outlays will pay off over a given set of years implies that buyers of industrial grade 3D printers are highly sensitive to pricing. When selling industrial grade products, purchasing managers will look to maximize the return on invested capital. To drive another cycle of upgrades, 3D Systems will need to develop a cutting edge solution that generates improvement to productivity relative to the capital outlays for industrial grade printers. The average industrial grade 3D printer costs $75,000, but can go up to $ 1,000,000 for manufacturing grade printers.At that scale, 3D printers are an investment. The main use cases for 3D manufacturing are driven by the incredibly complex geometries that can be printed via a 3D printer but cannot be manufactured by plastic/metal injection molding technologies. By utilizing an industrial grade 3D printer, manufacturers are able to operate at greater economies of scale while manufacturing higher value products. Sometimes the product needs to be customized for a specific use case (bone implants) or the product needs certain structural qualities to be useful for mechanical engineering cases. So if the product needs to be sold on the long-end of the tail, or a highly complex engineering solution has to be developed, you can bet that a 3D printer will fill in that hole.I'm very optimistic of 3D printing as an industry, but I can't share that optimism with 3D systems shareholders.Clearly, 3D Systems will need to justify the cost of these printers by demonstrating that they have the most cost effective solution for manufacturing or rapid prototyping. Improving efficiency lowers cost, and assuming a 3D printer can rapidly create complex parts it's possible to replace various machine set-ups.3D printing is useful, and finding specific markets to sell the technology required extensive market research and development. Over time the press and various publications caught onto the idea of 3D printing as a major disruptor to the 21st century. Consumer grade 3D printers soon went into production but fell short of large-scale market adoption due to the slow print rates and the limited number of materials and applications.3D Systems is highly confident in its sales force and its ability to create unique use cases with pre-existing technologies. I don't doubt that, but what I do doubt is the long-term viability of stereo lithography (3D Systems has built a large part of its organization and top-end solutions around SLA).Avi Reichental goes on to mention on the Q1 earnings conference call:When it comes to technology, any firm is exposed to disruptive products that are better on a logarithmic scale. I don't care if you have the best sales force on planet earth or the most convincing CEO. When a competitor devises a vastly superior solution, you get creamed. Look at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) versus IBM (NYSE:IBM) in the 1980s. Not only was the Mac less expensive than other personal computers, it had a superior interface (the graphical user interface).What happened to IBM? It fell off the face of the earth, and then it targeted the enterprise for both computing and software needs. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) used its perpetual software license model to create an alternative ecosystem from IBM mainframe computers, and the rest is history. Microsoft is the biggest provider of enterprise software and services (in terms of revenue). Azure (infrastructure as a service) has better gross margins than selling fully assembled mainframe systems.As far as I'm concerned, 3D Systems is IBM. It's one of the biggest companies in a small yet rapidly growing space. Engineers from every corner of the world have taken an interest in the nascent and growing business opportunity. The market is highly competitive and has room for smaller firms to out maneuver the big guys. The industry leader hasn't developed enough of a technological/business lead to render all the small guys ineffectual.In an earlier article, I mentioned that Carbon3D could put an end to 3D Systems' dominance. Am I delusional? I don't think so. I don't think I'm crazy for saying this. Not only does Carbon3D print at a significantly quicker pace, the properties of the prints are simply better, and there's viability for a broader range of materials. 3D Systems on the other hand has a continuous, high-speed, fab-grade printing platform. Now, from what I saw, they mentioned something on the scale of up to 50x faster. However, the guys over at Carbon 3D mention that its technology can scale to 1,000x faster, and I honestly believe them. They printed a plastic ball on stage in five minutes. If they improve that by 10 times, you're talking about a process that operates on the time scale of seconds.The company raising capital funding rounds for Carbon3D is Sequoia Capital, which is arguably one of the best VC firms in Silicon Valley. It has funded Apple, Electronic Arts, Oracle, Cisco, Nvidia, Google, Yahoo, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, PayPal and Instagram in early rounds. They really know how to find the few disruptors worth investing capital into. The combined market value of Sequoia Capital's portfolio of companies is $1.4 trillion (the bulk of that coming from Apple and Google). Sequoia Capital is known to invest aggressively into more traditional PC and mobile plays, but jumped immediately on Carbon3D.I'm fairly certain that the folks at Sequoia Capital are masters of their craft. They also get directly involved in the management of their portfolio companies. That spells a whole lot of bad news for 3D Systems because it's fighting against a VC firm that has billion of dollars in AUM. 3D Systems doesn't have that large of an economic moat, which they lavishly brag about on conference calls.They can lose, and lose badly, as VC firms tend to fund cash-burning start-ups, so as long as the market potential is significant and the management team is competent at executing on the long-term vision. Carbon3D has a superior product, so assembling all the pieces necessary to create a formidable competitor to 3D Systems is only a matter of time.In other words, to bet on 3D Systems would imply that Sequoia Capital is wrong. But from what I've seen, Sequoia usually knocks it out of the ballpark. If Sequoia is right, everyone betting on 3D Systems and the durability of their business model is wrong. A significant technology lead can create a winner-takes-all environment, and quite frankly, 3D Systems doesn't have the most superior technology. 3D Systems could be in a lot of trouble, and that's the view that's shared by some of the best VC guys in the world.3D Systems is heavily overvalued. The company doesn't have a major technology lead in comparison to peers, and I think that will weigh heavily on its market value going forward.I continue to reiterate my sell recommendation and $11.53 price target."
3381255,22775,2015-07-31T06:39:30-04:00,The stock is now trading in-line with our $13 target price.3D Systems could be a tempting trading buy.But industry conditions remain extremely tough.,"As most SA readers know, we have long been negative on 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), setting a $26 target price when the stock was trading around $75 and then cutting our valuation to $20 in November and to $13 in April. But believe it or not, lately we have been thinking about the opportunity to call 3D Systems a Buy as the stock has been trading close to or in-line with our target price.Following Stratasys' (NASDAQ:SSYS) Q2 earnings release, it appears that it's still a bit early to turn positive.Yesterday, Stratasys reminded investors that industry conditions have dramatically changed, with the company reporting -5% organic growth, operating margins near breakeven and $16m cash consumption in the quarter and anticipating continued weakness in Q3. In our view, 3D Systems is unlikely to fare much better than Stratasys when it reports its Q2 figures next week as its competitive position has been weakening for a while, as explained in our previous articles.Some investors will probably argue that most of the bad news are priced in following Stratasys' warning. They could be right, 3D Systems stock price could pop if Q2 is not a kitchen-sink quarter (with a huge goodwill writedown for instance).That said, we find current profitability weakness in the industry (merely positive margins) worrying, as it suggests that 3D Systems and Stratasys do not benefit from any safety buffer while major competitive threats are just around the corner (HP (NYSE:HPQ), which is expected to ship a 3D printer in early 2016, and Carbon 3D claim they have developed breakthrough technologies). Should these threats become reality (HP and/or Carbon 3D take significant market share), then 3D Systems' pricing power and gross margins would collapse (from ~50% to 30-40%), sending the company's operating margin and earnings sharply in the red.In our view, this scenario is becoming more and more likely but, surprisingly, is not yet discounted in 3D Systems' stock price. In the DCF model below, we show that a $13 stock price factors in 5-10% top line growth over the next 10 years and non-GAAP operating margins around 11% on average.Source: AtonRâThese assumptions are not realistic in view of the industry's current growth momentum and 3D Systems' profitability (~5% margin in Q1). We will review our 3D Systems valuation after next week's earnings report but what we can say for sure now is that 3D Systems stock price could go well below $13.Even if 3D Systems is a tempting trading buy, we remain on the sidelines for now."
3208866,59621,2015-05-26T06:38:40-04:00,"3D Systems has underperformed the whole market by a wide margin, offsetting all the gains since hitting the NYSE.A closer look reveals a very good organization performing poorly on the income statement, but prolific in terms of creating new products and services.In my view, the current price is attractive for a company that is a top competitor in a very promising field.The company is still very young and exposed to several risks. Any investor considering a possible investment should integrate this holding in a well-diversified portfolio.","Every time that I start looking for stocks, I can't avoid searching for some evidence of value. That is why the following graph has a pattern that shares similarities with many others that can be found in my analysis:Graph 1 - 3D Systems vs. S&P 500 1-year Returns ComparisonThe graph clearly states that 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has underperformed the broad market (NYSEARCA:SPY) by a wide margin. The reason why this happened and why this configures an interesting fact is what we are going to see next.3D as a growth stock in a fashionable industrySo I am a particular kind of a tech enthusiast. I like to analyze the market potential for a new tech or to understand the rationale that a given company used to go with one kind of tech instead of the other. This way, I end up keeping a good track of the main developments in several segments of the tech industry.Therefore, it didn't take me much to realize that 3D printers were the new kid in town. And everyone knows what happens next: hyper-inflated valuations! So, I didn't even bother much trying to find a fairly valued company within the 3D printing industry. I guessed all of them would be enjoying the bonus level. I just kept one or two names that I thought were the most promising in order to check them out during the next bear market. However, as you can see in graph 1, that day has come sooner than expected - and not in the form of a bear market.3D Systems is one of the companies that I've kept in my shortlist. As you can see in graph 1, 3D started taking off since it joined the NYSE. Thanks to the attention from mass media, 3D printing technology is now seen as a mainstream tech. Which helps in getting that extra valuation multiple, and it also helps in sales getting that extra push.So everything was going like the American start-up dream canvas is supposed to. Only, when the earnings shrunk, sales didn't top expectations and panic started spreading.So what provoked the profit slump?The management team has claimed that we are seeing a pause in the industry's growth. This is quite possible, as we have seen in other industries before (for example, the PC industry in the '80s).Since the 3D printing industry is still very young, even the biggest companies in the market are highly sensitive to drops in orders. The customer companies buying the 3D printers are not doing it out of necessity, but mostly out of curiosity. This means that when some external turbulence hits, the customer companies tend to have short-term scares and end up postponing non-essential investments. In the 1Q15 conference call, management confirmed this view:At the same time, the company had to put in place a significant effort to strengthen its structure, in order to have enough resources to answer to future demand. This a growth symptom that Peter Drucker addressed so well in some of his books.Summing up, we have two negative drivers simultaneously pressing down 3D Systems. At this stage, we cannot be absolutely sure that the company is going to overcome all the issues mentioned. However, my research indicates that 3D has been able to build a good organization, which increases the likelihood of correctly addressing its current problems.A Lean company insideOne common characteristic that I found in US-based companies founded during the last 20 years is the tendency to rely heavily on lean management principles. These companies tend to have management philosophies very close to the ones professed by Edwards Deming in the late '80s. This is true of 3D as well. For instance, the procurement department focuses its efforts on dealing with the fewest suppliers possible for each outsourced product:The original theory behind this approach is the idea that different suppliers produce different versions of the same product, which increases friction in the assembly line. By choosing one trustworthy supplier and by increasing communication, it is expected that both companies can work together to reduce friction in the assembly line, therefore reducing production times and increasing the quality of the final product.Sensitiveness to external feedbackI have noticed that 3D is a company uncommonly receptive to external feedback. We can observe this in the wide variety of market segments that the company has been able to develop during its still brief existence.The current 3D Systems growth strategy focuses in leveraging its key asset: additive manufacturing solutions. The company does this by tailoring its products and services to the following segments:The company could have chosen to go with one or two of these segments, but instead, decided to go the extra mile by serving every segment that was available to it, therefore creating a huge operational leverage.What else can go wrong?One obvious risk is competition. Suddenly, one competitor might bring a better solution to the market and steal significant market share from 3D. The biggest protection that I have identified against this threat is the company's organization. As I've stated before, 3D is lean inside and sensitive to external feedback. This is the best protection. In the tech industry, you don't want to compete spec by spec - you want to have the most comfortable solution that suits the customer.Another significant risk that I have identified is the possibility of the issuance of significant quantities of new stock in the next couple of years. This would mean that the positions of current shareholders would be highly diluted. The company has issued new shares: 6 million in 2014 and 8.6 million in 2013. Although the current volume of new stock is not highly dilutive, we must weigh the possibility of this trend getting more pronounced in the future.Another problem might be goodwill. 3D Systems has significant amounts of goodwill in its books, and the downturn in profits might trigger some panic reactions in the external auditors. They may want to reflect the lower profitability of the current assets through a goodwill write-down. I am just speculating at this point, but this might have something to do with the fact that the previous CFO resigned after only 5 months on the job. I repeat, I am just engaging in a theoretical exercise, but this should be something to keep under watch going forward. Just for the record, as of 31st December, 2014, 3D Systems had $589 million and $251 million accounted for as goodwill and intangibles, respectively.ConclusionThis is not my usual investment, but it fits very well in my investing strategy: the company had a huge devaluation, and after proper research, I see a very good organization and lots of potential in a market segment that is just taking off. The devaluation being provoked mainly by drivers that, in my opinion, are not problems ingrained in the company's structure.Therefore, I see this as a suitable investment in a well-diversified portfolio. 3D Systems has a huge potential, but we should also consider all the risks involved in investing in a young company competing in the high-tech playground. This means that I completely object to putting an overweight sum of the portfolio solely on this stock. Any investment in this stock should occur under the protection offered by a well-diversified portfolio."
3146506,22775,2015-05-06T09:15:44-04:00,"Organic growth of -7% and gross margin down 200bps to 49.1% in Q1.3D Systems does not provide a new FY15 guidance, acknowledging total lack of visibility.Consensus expectations need to be reset again.We stick to our negative stance and $13 target price.","Pressure on prices and margins unlikely to ease soon3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) delivers in Q1 $161m revenue and $0.05 non-GAAP EPS, slightly above its pre-announcement two weeks ago ($0.02-0.04) but well below initial consensus expectations of $183m and $0.17. The two most important Q1 operating metrics are highly disappointing with -7% organic growth (after an already poor +7% in Q4) and a 200bps gross margin decline (to 49.1%).We have long been claiming that 3D Systems is losing market share, as reflected by its weak organic growth numbers last year. But the sudden industry-wide slowdown in Q1 [peer Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) also materially lowered its FY expectations last week] suggests in our view that the breakthrough technology announcements made in recent months by the likes of HP (NYSE:HPQ) and Carbon3D are already delaying customers' purchase decisions as it appears that the incumbents' technology could soon be obsolete. We initially expected this to happen in H2 this year (see our article).Against this backdrop, significant pricing pressures are not surprising, as illustrated by 3D Systems' Q1 metal and consumer printer revenue growth of 39% and 65% respectively on shipments up 46% and 169%. Given the operating challenges ahead, gross margins should keep declining and we assume that in a worst-case scenario (HP and Carbon 3D retail a breakthrough 3-D printer), 3D Systems' gross margin could collapse from ~50% to 30-40%, sending the company's earnings sharply in the red. Just think of Nokia (NYSE:NOK) after the iPhone release a few years ago...No guidance due to low visibility, consensus expectations out of reachAs widely expected, the company withdraws its previous FY15 guidance. But more surprisingly, 3D Systems does not provide new guidelines due to low visibility.We remain convinced that, despite easier comps in coming quarters, the Street expectations ($784m revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70) are out of reach given the company's recent execution issues and lack of revenue traction and rising competition. The consensus forecast implies 23% revenue growth over Q2-Q4, vs. 9% in Q1… And the $0.70 EPS in 2015 (roughly flat vs. 2014) implies significant earnings growth over that same period after the -67% reported in Q1.Valuation still far from being a bargainA 34x 2015 P/E does not make sense in our view for a company expected to deliver 10% organic growth and flattish or slightly down margins (hence organic EPS growth around 10%) in a best-case scenario, or to be a bankruptcy candidate in a worst-case scenario.As explained in our last article, the next two years will be crucial for 3D Systems as the company will have to demonstrate better execution and handle increasing competition. Even assuming depressed financial metrics, the balance sheet risk would be manageable until 2016. Beyond that date, the risk of bankruptcy would be significant if 3D Systems is not able to stem its operating difficulties.We stick to our negative stance and $13 target price."
3135486,67695,2015-05-04T11:10:03-04:00,"Even after shedding 75% of its market cap, 3D Systems is still expensive by every measure of value.Price performance has been brutal recently, TTM EPS growth saw a massive decline, and profitability is extremely weak. Even revenue growth is decelerating.Short interest is extremely high. We think this indicates further downside rather than a possible squeeze.3D has already taken the earnings day hit by essentially pre-announcing their earnings. Still, the company has missed EPS estimates five times in a row and revenue three times.We expect huge underperformance from 3D Systems over the next twelve months.","A) Introduction3-D printing is an amazing breakthrough in manufacturing, and is likely to be a growth industry for years to come. Nevertheless, it is extremely difficult to pick the individual winners in these types of fast-paced industries. The excitement generated by novel technologies, such as 3-D printing, often leads investors to trade reason for hope. History has shown that these new ""glamour"" industries are prone to irrational overvaluation. 3D Systems Corp (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) are prime examples of this, as they were both darlings of Wall Street almost exactly a year ago. Since then, 3D has shed almost 75% of its market cap, falling from about $100 to it's current price of $25. This was punctuated by 3D's premature earnings warning last week, that sent the stock price down over 10%.In determining whether a company will be a good investment now, we look to the past for guidance. What the past tells us is that valuation, price momentum, earnings momentum, and business quality are the best metrics in predicting future stock returns. At this point, 3D Systems falls flat on every single measure.B) Value BreakdownWe take a quantitative approach to investing, preferring to focus our analysis on a certain set of metrics that have a strong predictive ability. This means that we only look at metrics that have an academically tested track record of predicting returns in the past. We'll start by analyzing 3D's value profile. This is important to look at as ""Value stocks (with low ratios of price to book value) have higher average returns than growth stocks (high price-to-book ratios)"". 3D's valuation profile is shown below:SourceBesides its solid book value multiple (2.16x), 3D looks expensive by every measure of value. Both its sales (23.26%) and earnings (0.43%) yields are way below the overall market, sector, and industry group averages. Both metrics are calculated using trailing twelve month revenue/net income over market cap. It's tough to find stocks with worse earnings yields than the current 10-year treasury yield, but 3D qualifies.Free cash flow yield (2.63%) is pretty terrible as well, and less than half the industry group average (5.5%). Based on each of these metrics, 3D systems is rated as ""Moderately Overvalued,"" and comes in the 11th percentile of all stocks based on these valuation metrics. Based on the average returns of stocks with a similar valuation rank, we expect significant negative ex-ante alpha due to valuation over the next twelve months (-7.13%).C) Growth & Momentum BreakdownNext we'll look at 3D's growth breakdown, specifically focusing on price momentum, EPS growth, and profitability efficiency. Price momentum is particularly important, as the momentum anomaly is almost as strong as the value anomaly (see here). EPS growth & profitability also have predictive power to a lesser degree, as initially outlined in James O'Shaughnessy's seminal book ""What Works On Wall Street."" Companies with expensive valuations can still be good investments if growth is strong enough. 3D's growth breakdown is shown below:With such an expensive valuation, one would think that 3D would have strong growth and profitability metrics. As we can see from the chart above, 3D falls in the bottom 30% in every growth metric. Particularly worrisome is the stock's weak price momentum, with the stock dropping 35.53% over the last six months and 47% over the last twelve. This is during a period when the average stock in the overall market gained 5.2%, and the average stock in the sector gained 9.68%. While many falsely believe that what goes down must come up, history has shown time after time that momentum and price trends are very good predictors of mid to long-term future returns. The trend in 3D points to even lower levels.3D's net income also fell dramatically over the last 12 months, declining 73% from a ttm basis (comparing the sum of the last four quarters to the previous four before that). 3D managed a weak 0.99% return on equity and 0.85% on assets, both well below the industry, sector, and overall market averages. Overall, our model ranks 3D's growth/momentum profile in the 5th percentile of the entire market. We expect significant ex-ante headwinds from here given its ranking, and how stocks with these type of growth profiles have historically performed versus the market.We should mention that we know that 3D is generating huge revenue growth at the moment, with the last three quarters averaging out to a 23% YoY gain. It's just that revenue growth is not a metric that predicts future stock returns. Buying a basket of stocks with the top 10% highest revenue growth rates would not have meaningfully differed from buying the overall market. Thus, it does not factor materially in our overall thesis. And even if it did, revenue growth has been decelerating for 5 straight quarters.Business Quality BreakdownAnother key metric to watch is the quality of the company's earnings and business. In a world that is overly fixated on the short-term bottom line, investors tend to put a greater emphasis on earnings quantity rather than earnings quality. This leads to artificially high prices for companies that have low quality earnings. 3D's business quality is shown below:The company spends a solid amount on research and development, with R/D making up 11.53% of sales over the last twelve months. This is right in line with the industry average (11.75%) and ahead of the overall market. R/D spending suppresses income in the short-term but leads to long-term benefits, so its a good sign that 3D has maintained R/D spending.What is really interesting from this chart is 3D's extremely high level of external financing. External financing (trailing twelve month debt + equity issuances) now makes up 60% of the company's assets, versus 2% for the average stock in the market. High levels of external financing are bad in the long-run, because of future interest payments & equity dilution.Overall, our quality model rates 3D's business and earnings quality poorly, placing it in the 19th percentile of all stocks based on these metrics. Once again, holding everything else equal and based on how stocks with similar earnings quality have performed in the past, we expect moderately negative ex-ante (-3.59%) alpha over the next twelve months.""Smart Money"" BreakdownNow that we've broken down 3D's valuation, growth, and momentum profile, we'll look at how the ""smart money"" is playing the stock. To do this, we'll analyze the short float and institutional transactions, as historical testing has shown both to be good predictors of subsequent future returns (see here & here). 3D's ""smart money"" breakdown is shown below:For the most part, company insiders and institutions have mostly maintained their 3D positions over the last few months. With that being said, short interest is still at an astronomically high level at 36.26% of the total float - more than 10 times the market average. This is a worrying sign as short sellers have a good track record of predicting declines when they crowd into a trade. While some may argue that this is fuel for a potentially squeeze, historically, it has meant further downside. You don't want to let the ""smart money"" make your decision for you, but the fact that it confirms a sentiment is a good sign. Overall, we'd classify the ""smart money"" as bearish on the stock.Earnings Momentum BreakdownEarnings momentum is a critically important, yet underfollowed metric. We've noticed that almost no one pays attention to it, yet stocks release earnings every three months and see their stock price swing wildly based on the results. Essentially, we've found through historical backtesting (and common sense) that stocks that have a track record of beating analyst expectations are much more likely to beat again in the future. The following breakdown shows 3D's earnings momentum breakdown:3D missed EPS consensus estimates by 35% last quarter, extending its streak of misses to 5 straight. 3D has only beaten the EPS consensus 2 out of the last 10 quarters. On the revenue side, 3D missed consensus by 8.85% last quarter, marking its third miss in a row. 3D has only beaten the revenue consensus 4 times in the last 10 quarters. We also like to look at growth rates, as stocks with strong growth rates tend to beat estimates more often. 3D's EPS declined 18.75% last quarter on a YoY basis, while revenue increased 21.1%.Analysts polled by Zacks expect $0.01 in EPS and $159.28 million in quarterly revenue. Based on what we talked about above, our earnings model puts the probability of an EPS beat on the consensus estimates at 0-45%, and expects 3D to miss. We put the probability of a beat on the revenue consensus at 55-65%, and expect a small beat (0-5%).This info may seem outdated to investors now that the company has already lowered guidance ahead of earnings - which sent the stock down over 14%. While the stock may not see another decline now that it has already lowered expectations, it's key to remember that this is a stock with decidedly negative earnings momentum. If the company fails to beat even its lowered guidance, then expect the stock to get crushed further.Conclusions & SummaryPsychologically, its tough to short a stock that has already come down 75% from its peak. With that said, by using metrics with an extensive historical track record of predicting future returns, our analysis clearly points to further downside. At the very least, investors have to know that they are betting against the odds in holding on to 3D right now. While not everyone puts as much weight in quantitative analysis as we do, it's key to know that the quantitative profile of the stock is unequivocally bearish.Our conclusions on 3D Systems are summed up in the box below:3D Systems combines an expensive valuation, horrible growth profile, bad earnings quality, and heavy short interest. Additionally, the company has disastrous earnings momentum, with 5 straight EPS misses and 3 straight revenue misses.Overall, our model expects -24.7% of ex-ante 12-month alpha from 3D Systems. This means we expect it to underperform the returns of the S&P 500 by 24.7% over the next 12 months. Thus, adjusted for beta, if the S&P 500 returns 10% over the next twelve months, we would expect 3D Systems to return -14.7% based on its risk profile."

Luckily, in the process, I was able to help several Seeking Alpha readers avoid the same mistake current DDD investors continue to make, which is insisting that the ""market has this story wrong."" Some call this view stubborn, I call it the best way to lose money.Here's what I said last week:Wednesday, after yet another tough quarterly performance, DDD stock is not as expensive as it were last week. Unfortunately, that's because the shares suffered more punishment, closing Wednesday at $22.90, down 5.41% from Tuesday's close.For those of you keeping score at home, that marks a 12.4% decline since my sell recommendation was published here on Seeking Alpha. No, I'm not here to throw salt on any wound. But it's time to evaluate the prospects of DDD and the entire 3D-printing industry. The way I see it, there's no point in owning DDD stock or any of its 3-D competitors.The fundamentals of this industry and the approach taken by these companies don't support their valuation, given the money it's costing these companies to build out their technology. In the case of DDD, even with Wednesday's decline and the year-to-date stock loss of 30%, DDD stock is still expensive at 212 time trailing earnings. That 10 times higher than the average stock in the S&P 500.In other words, if DDD stock was valued on par with the rest of the market, the shares would trade today at around $15, not $22 and certainly not $26 when we last discussed the company. And after the disappointing first-quarter earnings results, I'm now convinced that DDD stock is a solid short to $20 per share and lower.Why? Clearly analysts and the entire market once overestimated the company's potential. After 3D systems posted a 75% decline in earnings for 2014, estimates as low as 40 cents per share imply a 2015 decline of around 43%. Even the highest estimate of 65 cents per share still presume a 7% earnings decline for 2015.In other words, projections are all over the map. And that's not what investors should want for a company that is struggling with execution and has an expensive valuation. Consider, even with Wednesday's 1-cent beat in earnings per share, it still marked a 66% year-over-year earnings decline, suggesting that DDD still has a long way to go before becoming fully profitable.In that vein, there is less risk in shorting the stock here than going long. Why? The bears are now in control of DDD stock and they've been the only ones making money over the past year. So until both revenue and earnings can begin an upward trend, DDD will remain a losing bet, meaning the only way to profit is to bet against it."
3116096,39301,2015-04-30T11:11:58-04:00,"3D Systems never found the holy grail to 3D printing, instead, that company was Carbon3D.Time and time again, technological breakthroughs have rendered old or non-existent tech companies into dinosaurs.3D Systems has fallen victim to this, and quite frankly, the rather generous valuation cannot be supported by any sound rational.The over-generalized comments made by the CEO of 3D Systems on the economic environment is incorrect, its entire business model is compromised, that's why sales have slowed.I think the stock is a phenomenal short candidate, as I have initiated a $11.53 price target (55.9% downside from current levels).","Wow, basically everything that could go wrong with 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) went wrong. The management team retreated behind comments like ""economic factors, changes in the business environment, strength in innovation, improving efficiency."" But realistically, the 3D printing technology that DDD markets is obsolete (selective laser sintering), which is basically referred to as additive manufacturing.In competitive markets like this, technological innovation creates a winner-takes-all environment. Not so surprisingly, I believe that DDD's technological edge has been mitigated so significantly, there's no basis for valuing DDD at these stratospheric levels. The business doesn't merit a premium valuation, and various efforts to improve profitability aren't long-term solutions to a more deeply rooted problem with regards to DDD's culture, management, and product development process.Carbon3D, a recently launched start-up, has not only achieved significant funding levels (Sequoia Capital, Spark Investment fund, and various other funds have funded the business with $51 million to date), it has also attracted a lot of attention for its 3-dimensional process that results in way faster speed, and higher tensile strength.Here are some of the advantages to CLIP (Continuous Liquid Interface Production Technology), according to Carbon 3D:The TED presentation generated over 1 million views, so anyone who follows the topic of 3D Printing more or less knows that it's another one of those ""David versus Goliath"" stories. ""Would be competitors"" will need to defeat the technical solution that Carbon3D has devised, i.e. the CLIP (Continuous Liquid Interface Production Technology), which uses a tunable photochemical process. Joseph DeSimone (founder of Carbon3D) goes onto state that the technology could scale from 100 to 1,000 times faster than traditional 3D printing. Which means that not only is the portable version going to be better than the low-end models from 3D Systems and Stratasys, the industrial grade printers are going to be inferior by a factor of 1,000.To think of it from the context of semiconductors, imagine if Intel was running at 5nm FinFETs while everyone else were using planar nodes at 45nm. Something crazy like that could never happen, because the market is an oligopoly, and firms come up with roughly the same technology within a six-month to a one-year window from one another. Sometimes the difference spreads by around two-years, but anything beyond that, and it literally becomes impossible to close the cost to performance ratio. That's why IBM gave up on its foundry business ages ago.Well, in the case of Carbon3D the difference in performance, and its comparable ability to raise capital from private investors give it quick scalability, and an early mover advantage. It's a winner-take-all approach, which will put downward pressure on sentiment in established 3D printing names. Not to mention, various business and environmental factors have negatively affected earnings.Here's some commentary from the 3D Systems earnings conference call:Overall, where do I even begin to address the problems in the comments made by management? First, SLA (stereo lithography) is slower than just about any other competitive offering by a wide margin. And CLIP is light-years ahead. The difference is so big, we might as well draw the comparison to sci-fi, and warp through time fields and travel distant stars trillions of light years away creating our own non-fictional narratives of Spock and Darth Vader. Yes, the difference is quite literally that big.Source: Carbon3DSecond, the comment on economics and foreign exchange, aren't the main reason investors are fleeing for the exits. Everyone knows the market potential of 3D printing, but only if the technology were to develop into an end-to-end manufacturing solution in which mechanical engineering and productivity could be better utilized.I know, I'm using a ton of metaphors in this article, but I can't help it. The difference is just that bad.Let's address the issue of foreign exchange, and economic environment a little closely. 3D systems' loss of sales wasn't really driven by seasonal patterns relating to broader economics, it was mostly driven by the overall inferiority in its product portfolio, which has resulted in falling orders, as there are competing technologies that are better than SLA outside of CLIP.Source: J.P. Morgan Global Manufacturing PMICalling into question DDD's claims of a ""weakening economic environment"" seems reasonable in light of recently released Q1'15 global PMI data by J.P. Morgan. Not only is every category expanding, almost all of them are expanding at a faster rate, which indicates that it's not the economy that's bullying DDD, it's a combination of competitive and business-specific factors. The loss of orders is happening as a result of competition, and lack of interest in DDD's current product portfolio.Source: Morgan StanleyBased on the currency projection, the greenback is going to stabilize a little against the Yen, but in the case of the Euro and Yuan, things could worsen. Since China and Europe are big export and import markets, the impact on 3D Systems from currency could in fact worsen. So there's the ""real"" bad news on the macro environment.I believe that infant technologies like CLIP could change the dynamics of the market, and increase both demand and scalability of 3D printing. Because Carbon3D is a competitor to 3D Systems, it's hard to think of any alternative other than to short 3D Systems.Not only has the business environment worsened, but the company doesn't have a viable business model any more. Management is more focused on reducing costs, while creating hype around stereolithography, which is almost due for a 30-year anniversary. The industry was ripe for disruption, and 3D Systems never came away with the breakthrough needed to take 3D printing from some niche opportunity into main stream. It lost.I don't believe in comeback stories, as I'm fairly confident that the VC-backed Carbon3D is going to compete with the intent of taking the whole market over. They have the patents, and they are working with some of the finest VC guys in Silicon Valley. I also anticipate Carbon3D to utilize standard business practices to rapidly scale production for its 3D printer units. Carbon3D doesn't have to price products for profit maximization, so it has some flexibility to adjust price points to be more directly competitive with industry-stalwarts. Needless to say, DDD has really high gross margins, so there's plenty of room for Carbon3D to fight with pricing.Source: YChartsOverall, I'm extremely bearish on the stock, and I believe there's further room for earnings multiple contraction; especially after Stratasys' (NASDAQ:SSYS) recent quarterly earnings miss. If I had to intrinsically value the business, I'd base it on total equity, as sales and earnings are not sustainable whatsoever. I think that even if the stock were to trade below book value, it would remain speculative and a value trap.3D Systems doesn't have a viable business model in 3D printing anymore, and any attempt at improving profitability over the short run is only going to create fanfare around vanity metrics. The bigger strategic problem isn't going to be addressed. And, since it won't be addressed, issues like declining profitability and falling revenue is right over the event horizon.In other words, the high valuation is only the tip of the iceberg. Over the long run, a bankruptcy scenario like in the case of Eastman Kodak could result due to technological obsolescence and poor management.Therefore, I'm initiating a price target of $11.53. I believe the value of the business is strictly tied to the value of its physical assets. All of the intangible value will soon seep out from underneath the rather generous valuation DDD still trades at."
3115156,22786,2015-04-30T08:50:58-04:00,"Stratasys Ltd. just issued a profit warning and lowered forecasts.3D Systems has warned, too.The stocks are off sharply from their highs, and trade lower every day.Valuations are explored.","When 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) peaked at $96.42 on December 30, 2013, investors valued the company at a forward P/E north of 70. Likewise, Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) peaked at $136.46 that day, with similar forward multiples. It is easy to scoff at irrational investors and recognize short sellers were right, but is there any value in these firms? Stratasys is down another 17.6 percent in after-hours trade, while 3D Systems will re-visit yearly lows.ValuationThe market is still lowering the price multiples assigned to the 3D printing firms. The consensus forecast for Stratasys was earnings of $2.10 per share this fiscal year and $0.71 per share for 3D Systems. This would mean a forward P/E of 20 and 35, respectively. Applying Stratasys' $1.20-1.70 per share forecast, the market is assigning a value as high as 35 times forward earnings on the stock.The firms are clearly still too expensive even after the drop, but neither firm has any significant levels of debt. With growth shrinking, both firms will make cost-cutting a priority over any future acquisitions.3D Systems' quarterly cash level is on the decline:Source: Kapitall ($ million)By comparison, Stratasys has more consistent quarterly cash levels:No more hype: End of ""Momentum"" phase3D printing stocks were momentum (""momo"") plays. Volume peaked in 2014. Looking ahead, investors should expect both firms will trade on their valuation and growth prospects:SSYS data by YChartsAsset write-downsStratasys wrote down $102 million for its acquisition of Makerbot, and may write down more (as much as $200 million). Similarly, 3D Systems spent $345 million in acquisitions over the last two years.Both firms will recognize impaired assets in the next few quarters. This will ultimately benefit them both, because it lowers uncertainty in the true value of the assets. The companies will generate tax-loss carryforwards, while holding valuable patents and technological expertise in the sector.Takeover candidateThe extreme drop in Stratasys and 3D Systems will attract value investors. For example, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) has $12.9 billion, which is enough cash to acquire either firm:In $ millionsHewlett-Packard is applying inkjet technology that allows the firm to leverage its printing expertise to the 3D market. Still, the firm is targeting the manufacturing market. Acquiring 3D Systems or Stratasys would broaden Hewlett-Packard's addressable market in the growing sector.Buying on the dipWith big write-downs expected and negative momentum accelerating, Stratasys and 3D Systems will no doubt reach new yearly lows. Eventually, the selling will stop and bargain hunters will decide on a reasonable valuation for these firms. There are no expectations from investors that either firm will grow revenues anytime soon.By applying five valuation models, the average fair value for 3D Systems is $33.73. The models used are: LTM EPS, LTM EBITDA, Projected EBITDA, Projected EPS, and LTM Revenue. Here are the detailed calculations for 3D Systems.Historically, Stratasys was more profitable, and grew profits at a faster pace than 3D Systems. To err on the side of caution, investors may assume similar multiples but higher profit margins for Stratasys. The average fair value of the company is $49.07. Here are the details in the price modeling for Stratasys.Bottom line3D Systems and Stratasys will fall sharply in the short term. Eventually, the selling pressure will end as bearish traders close their short positions. As the firms restructure operations to lower costs, earnings will ultimately improve. It is too early to buy either firm, but a buying opportunity will arrive soon."
3114916,24400,2015-04-29T07:55:15-04:00,"After 3D systems posted a 75% decline in earnings for 2014, the stakes are high.There is nothing about these shares today that screams value.With shares trading at around $26, there's a lot of future performance tied to 3D System's P/E of 242, which is almost 12-times the average P/E of the S&P 500.","With shares down 20% year to date and almost 50% in the past twelve months, it would seem 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) is one-dimensional -- at least as an investment. It's true, the 3-D printing industry may take off at some point in the future. Whether or not 3D Systems emerge as a leader remains the question.What we do know, however, is that the market for 3-D printing is not what experts thought it was. And it may not be for a long time. And that's what is hurting competitors like Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), which announced preliminary first quarter results and 2015 guidance after the market close Tuesday. Given that Stratasys' numbers were well below street forecasts, Stratasys stock plummeted 20%, from around $51 to $41.Stratasys now expects first-quarter revenue in the range of $171 to $173 million, against consensus of $199 million. And Stratasys now expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of 2 cents to 4 cents. Even the high range assumes 85% shortfall of street expectations of 28 cents.Essentially, both 3D Systems and Stratasys are playing the game called, ""if we build it, they will come.""That may eventually be the case. But the space is going to get more crowded once Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) enters the mix next year with its own 3-D printer. Do you suppose Hewlett-Packard knows a thing or two about printing technologies?Why not, then, bet on the world's printing leader that has enough cash at its disposal to truly disrupt the market? It seems to make more sense. And guess what? Investors can own HP stock today at just 12 times trailing earnings and eight times next year's estimates of $3.82 per share, and both metrics suggests huge discounts to the S&P 500. Plus, in the process, HP stock pays a 2.20% annual dividend.And here's the thing, these struggles aren't new for the 3-D printing industry. After 3D systems posted a 75% decline in earnings for 2014, the stakes are high. The market wants to believe in this company. And if 3-D printing does become the ""new frontier"" in mock-ups, architecture and product development, it's tough to see how 3D systems will be left out. But for now, the Rock Hill, SC.-based company is struggling with execution. And there is nothing about these shares today that screams value.With shares trading at around $26, there's a lot of future performance tied to 3D System's P/E of 242, which is almost 12-times the average P/E of the S&P 500. Sure, we can toss the valuation out of the window and argue that the company is ""building for the future."" We have to, then, call this speculation, not an investment. And that the shares are down almost 50% over the past year suggests that speculative buyers have been wrong.What's more, analysts are also showing that they've been wrong. How else do you explain that consensus estimates for the just-ended quarter had been revised lower by 73%, down from 22 cents per share at the start of the quarter to 6 cents per share as of Wednesday's results.And as for the June quarter? Consensus is down 43%, from 23 cents per share to 13 cents per share. Wait, there's more. This means full-year estimates of $1.03 per share is now projected to be 70 cents per share, slashed by 32%.Why are estimates coming down? Obviously, 3D System's own performance is to blame. In fairness, while the company is doing what it can to develop a business that will pioneer the 3-D printing evolution, the market for its products doesn't yet exists.Bottom LineInvestors have been trying to time the bottom on this stock for a while and have failed. And it certainly hasn't helped that analysts haven't been able to pin-point what's going on with the company and how it can become profitable. The best play here is to sell 3D Systems and wait for the company to issue outlook for the rest of the year."
3115946,56262,2015-04-30T11:03:21-04:00,3D Systems recently issued a Q1 2015 warning.3D Systems will continue to struggle due to the shortcomings of 3D printing technology.Increasing competition will eat into 3D Systems' margins.3D Systems is a strong sell.,"Given the amount of times 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has failed to deliver on its promises in the last few quarters, it isn't surprising that the stock has lost over 50% of its value in the last 12 months. 3D Systems has continued down that path as it recently issued a big Q1 2015 warning. 3D Systems has been one of my best short calls and I still believe the company has more downside to offer. However, given the massive drop in valuation, I would recommend investors to cover their short positions and stay clear of the stock. Nonetheless, let's take a look at the reasons why I think 3D Systems is still a sell.The major problems still existThe primary reason behind the 3D printing hype was the technology's potential to replace the traditional ways of industrial manufacturing and production. There's also the consumer segment, however much of 3D printing industry's growth was, and still is, expected to come from the industrial sector. While investors may still expect 3D printing stocks to bounce back, I don't think it will happen anytime soon as the technology is still far off from revolutionizing industrial production.I have previously highlighted three factors that may restrict the adoption of 3D printing in the industrial sector. The factors were high time consumption, strength and extremely high costs, and these problems still exist. Despite advancements in 3D printing technology, the industrial manufacturing process is still a lot faster and cheaper.In addition, there are many other problems such as limited materials and increasing competition. In order to replace the traditional manufacturing process, 3D printers need to print products in mixed materials. As of now, 3D printers can only print in certain metals, plastic and resins. However, most of the things we use today are produced by a combination of materials.In addition, 3D Systems isn't making any headway in the consumer segment. A review of 3D Systems' third generation Cube 3D printer on InvestorPlace.com perfectly highlights why the technology is still years away from becoming mainstream. The review said:Looking at these problems, it isn't surprising that 3D Systems has consistently disappointed investors. 3D Systems has to find a way to significantly improve its printers' speed and reduce the ASP in order to thrive. Achieving this goal will take years of R&D. Hence I think 3D Systems is still a sell.Increasing CompetitionThe 3D printing market is getting increasingly competitive and this will hurt 3D Systems' margins going forward. The threat of Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) entry into the 3D printing space is looming large. However, HP isn't the only company that's threatening the dominance of 3D Systems and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS). A bunch of smaller companies like NewMatter, Formlabs, Stacker and FlashStorage are set to enter the space. The overabundance of 3D printing companies will eventfully lead to a price war. This will have a big negative impact on 3D Systems' margins going forward.ConclusionLast year, when shares were trading above $70, I recommenced shorting the stock multiple times because of reasons like increasing competition and shortcomings of 3D printing technology. Although those problems still exist, 3D Systems' valuation is at a more reasonable level now. Despite the massive drop in share price, short interest in 3D Systems is on the rise, which makes the stock prone to a short squeeze. Hence, I believe investors should lock in the gains by covering their short positions.While I no longer believe the stock is a short, I still think it's a strong sell and investors should stay clear of it. Due to the reasons mentioned above, I don't believe that 3D Systems will bounce back in the foreseeable future. The increasing competition will take a toll on 3D Systems' margins, as a result of which I expect the company to struggle in the months to come."
3106486,22148,2015-04-27T15:29:58-04:00,3D Systems provided a major warning for Q1'15 earnings.The 3-D printing manufacturer continued a trend that now includes missing estimates in three of the last four quarters.Investors should avoid the stock until the company regains the ability to accurately forecast quarterly results.,"When trading at a relatively rich multiple and coming off several warnings, a company in a fast-growing industry just can't keep reporting weak results. That is the case for 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) as it again warned the market this past Friday of dismal Q1'15 results.Previous research looked into the potential investment in the stock beaten to a pulp since the highs back at the start of 2014. After the latest warning, the stock sits at multi-year lows. This time investors shouldn't expect the stock to rebound for the numerous reasons listed in this article.Dismal Preliminary ResultsThe quick takeaway from the results is that 3D Systems has no clue what's going on in the market. At the very least, the company is incapable of predicting results only a month out. Somebody is taking market share or the Piper note on weakness in the sector is accurate. In addition, the company highlighted in the earnings release some internal weaknesses that hurt sales:Sure the economic headwinds and currencies didn't help, but good companies don't have major earnings misses due to these issues. Also, it doesn't seem plausible that healthcare companies curtailed purchases due to lower oil prices. Possibly aerospace and automotive saw a slowdown, but economic cycles shouldn't cause a 3-D printing company fueled with acquisitions to only produce 9% revenue growth.The CEO was clear on the earnings call that this level of overall revenue growth won't lead to organic growth for the quarter. The company closed on the Cimatron deal back in November that alone added over $10 million in quarterly revenue. Now, 3D Systems isn't sure it can meet the original target for the year of 20% organic revenue growth.The worst part of the story is that research from Canalys previously guided to 56% industry growth for 2015 suggesting more credence to the issues with printers and materials, than anything related to the economy.For what it is worth, the company stated that orders returned during the first few weeks of April. Investors should trade off those statements very cautiously. Remember that 3D Systems was unwilling to provide updated guidance for the rest of the year and specifically for Q2. At the time of the Q4 report on February 26, management guided that all was fine with the company for 2015 despite missing those EPS estimates by $0.04 and revenue by an incredible $14.9 million.Declining EstimatesEven prior to the warning last Friday, analysts were reducing the EPS estimates for 3D Systems. Several analysts like Piper mentioned earlier had already lowered estimates due to weak channel checks. At the same time, the company had missed estimates in two of the prior three quarters.Source: Yahoo Finance analyst estimatesAnalysts now forecast somewhere around $0.80 for 2016. At $26 now, 3D Systems actually appears rather expensive at over 30x forward earnings after missing estimates in three of the prior four quarters.TakeawayAs the previous research warned, though 3D Systems was approaching a valuation that might appear attractive, the company needed to prove it could operate within targets. The latest results continue a trend suggesting the previously cobbled together businesses aren't functioning correctly. Investors should remain very cautious regarding the statements of improving results for the first few weeks of Q2. It is very common for a company that has orders pushed out to see positive results in the following weeks, but none of the comments from 3D Systems suggest a real rebound in the business.The mounting excuses for missing estimates are not acceptable. Investors need to stay away from the stock until the company can achieve goals despite currency headwinds or economic issues."
3105816,24849,2015-04-27T12:34:50-04:00,Company issued a large Q1 warning.2015 guidance will be reduced at earnings report.Shares likely to see new lows.,"Just last week, I warned investors that it was time to be cautious with shares of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). Shares of the 3D printing name had been on the rise in recent weeks, and I was skeptical given recent poor business performance. Just a few days later, the company issued a massive Q1 warning, continuing its recent pattern of extreme disappointment. In this article, I examine the latest news from the company, detailing why investors should continue to favor the short side of this trade.Anyone that has followed my articles lately knows I've been heavily detailing the sharp rise in the dollar. This is one of the reasons why I was worried about 3D's yearly guidance, especially since the company was looking for growth to accelerate. In Q4 2014, 3D reported a $6 million hit to revenues from currency movements, and I figured that would be larger in Q1 2015. The quarter's hit turned out to be double that, $12 million, according to management.The company blamed weak economic conditions in certain regions due to currency issues as well as the aftershock of lower oil prices for its horrible quarter. Q1 revenues are expected to be in a range of $158 million to $160 million, well below analyst estimates for $182.8 million. Non-GAAP EPS were forecast to be between two and four cents, while the street was looking for a non-GAAP profit of $0.17. I turned heavily negative on this name after its bad finish to 2014, and it appears that things got even worse in the new year.With analysts near the bottom of the company's guidance to begin with, I apparently wasn't the only one who was skeptical of the 2015 forecast. 3D was looking for revenues of $850 million to $900 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.90 to $1.10. After such a poor start to the year, the question now is not if, but by how much, the forecast comes down. The company will report on Wednesday, May 6th, at which time management will provide a new set of guidance. By that day, we'll be five weeks into Q2, so the company will have some visibility into how things are looking for the current quarter. As of Sunday, analysts had reduced their average estimates to $836 million and $0.90, respectively. Those numbers will come down further in the coming days and weeks.Those on the long side can only hope that things improve later this year, and that seemed to be the rhetoric with 2014 as well. Thanks to the company's awful EPS number in Q1, I now think 3D might have a hard time achieving non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 this year. At a premium valuation of 30 times that number, which may be too high given another large disappointment, the stock would only be worth $22.50. I think that's an appropriate fair value for the name after another bad quarter, and I'm actually surprised shares did not hit a new 52-week low on Friday.In the end, 3D Systems disappointed again with a major Q1 warning. As currency issues continue to pile up, management obviously does not have a good handle on the business, given three straight huge quarterly disappointments. I'm even more convinced that a short position works now, and I expect shares will make a fresh 52-week low rather soon. As seen in the chart below, the 50-day moving average will be on the decline again, which will add a new level of resistance to shares in the near-term.Source: Yahoo! Finance"

Sitting in the American Legion after taking Aunt Patty to Bingo last night, I had somebody walk up to me and ask, ""Hey, what do you think about 3D Printing stocks? I think it's going to be the next big deal.""The first time someone asked me about them, about four years ago, I thought it was a novel idea. But here we sit in 2015, these stocks are about to headline my Bear of the Day. I mean, I get it. I understand the enthusiasm. The thought of being able to download a file and instantly manufacture something on the spot is an exciting idea. I think that the first several generations of this technology are going to build on each other exponentially. Eventually, these companies could do very well.But right now, things aren't looking so great for Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). In addition to the Zacks Rank, it's also carrying a Value Style score of F and Momentum Style F. That's an easy way to look at this stock and realize that it's not making any money today and the stock price is falling. What is the catalyst for all this?Take a quick look at the recent earnings estimates revisions over the last thirty days. Two analysts have dropped their estimates for the current quarter and next quarter, and four analysts have dropped their numbers for the current year. This bearish attitude has crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimates for these periods. Current year consensus has seen a drop from 89 cents all the way down to 73 cents. That drop is part of the reason for the sell-off in the stock.Since the start of the year, there has been an overall downward trend for the stock. After starting the year trading in the low $30s, choppy trading brought the stock down into the $27s at the beginning of February. A rally off of that bottom to test the top end of the range failed miserably in mid-February, and the stock has been gasping for air ever since.Coincidentally, the spike up in mid-February was the last time the stock's Commodity Channel Index was in overbought territory. Fading that spike, the shorts have made plenty of money on the downturn. Currently, the stock is sitting below its 21-day moving average, which is negatively sloped. The CCI is bearish at -63, but has yet to reach oversold levels, implying there could be more downside to come.Investors looking for an alternative stock in this space should look beyond the 3D printing industry. DDD's competitors are struggling to make money in this area as well. Even Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), the tech giant, that's recently entered this market, is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)."
3120446,22775,2015-04-30T04:51:23-04:00,3D Systems’ fundamentals continue to deteriorate at a fast pace.We cut our target price.And we update our bankruptcy risk analysis.,"In a recent article, we explained that the FY15 targets set by 3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) management were totally out of reach. Hence, we were not specifically surprised by the company's Q1 warning last week ($158-160m revenue, $0.02-0.04 EPS vs. a consensus of $183m and $0.17, respectively).While both 3D Systems and rival Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) blame a poor economic environment for their recent earnings disappointments (note this does not mesh with macro data: ""interruption in customer demand late in the quarter from several economic factors"", ""a decline in relevant capital spending within certain regions and industries, particularly in North America""), we suspect their operating issues reflect deteriorating fundamentals. Notably, we believe that 3D Systems is losing market share at a fast pace (the company had negative organic growth in Q1!) due to rising competition, and is hit by significant pricing pressures with an immediate impact on gross margins (on a downward trend for the last five quarters).While comps will be easier in coming quarters, we remain convinced that organic growth could remain depressed as new competitors such as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Carbon 3D pop up on a regular basis and take share and as the company's low level of capex and R&D investments compared to several peers is likely to weigh on its competitive position. While we understand 3D Systems' soft spending intentions for 2015 (both at the opex and M&A level) after a streak of profit warnings, we believe that the company is taking the risk of being sidelined in a near future if it is not able to come up with revolutionary products at a time when rivals are investing heavily.Given this negative view on the company's revenue outlook, it's quite hard to be constructive on its profitability prospects. The operating margin was under huge pressure in Q1 (we guess a mid-single digit margin vs. a 15-20% consensus expectation) as the gross margin continued to deteriorate (49%, down 250bps year-on-year) and as the integration of acquired companies came with higher opex. Looking forward, cost control could help but this could be insufficient if revenues keep disappointing.In addition, 3D Systems has no real control over its gross margin which has been worrying for several quarters due to increased competition and pricing pressures as mentioned above. In a worst-case scenario (it is confirmed that HP or Carbon 3D have breakthrough technology), 3D Systems' pricing power and gross margins would collapse (from ~50% to 30-40%), sending the company's earnings sharply in the red. Just think of Nokia (NYSE:NOK) after the iPhone release a few years ago...On May 6, 3D Systems will update its FY15 guidance. Given management's tone during the Q1 preliminary results conference call, it's quite obvious the company will stick to its usual communication policy and promise to get revenue growth and margins back on track soon.For now, consensus is still incredibly high despite the Q1 warning as it expects a $0.70 EPS in 2015 (roughly flat vs. 2014), while Q1 EPS of $0.02-0.04 is expected to be down ~80% year-on-year. This forecast, which implies solid earnings growth in Q2, Q3, Q4, does not make any sense in our view given the company's recent execution issues and lack of revenue traction. In addition, new products and technologies (from HP notably) are expected to hit the market soon and customers will probably hold off their purchase decisions to gauge these new products.In the table below, we detail our forecasts (way below the Street) and new DCF valuation for 3D Systems. Using a 11% WACC, we get to a $13 valuation (vs. $20 previously).Source: AtonRâNow, let's talk about the worst case for 3D Systems. We weighed the company's bankruptcy risk barely two months ago, and it's already time to update our assumptions.As mentioned above, we believe that if HP, Carbon 3D or any other start-up comes up with a breakthrough technology, 3D Systems' pricing power, shipments and gross margins will collapse, leading to an operating margin around -20% (we guess the margin was around +5% in Q1) and operating loss of $150m. Hence, 3D Systems would probably burn close to $200m cash a year.In the short term, that would not be a major issue as the company's balance sheet appears rock solid with $200m net cash and $1.3bn equity. But should 3D Systems burn cash two more years ($400m) and write off some of the goodwill on its balance sheet (say $400m, with an immediate impact on its shareholders' equity), its financial situation would become uncomfortable ($400m net debt for $900m equity) and 3D Systems would probably find it hard to get financing at decent conditions. This would probably spark bankruptcy bets.In conclusion, the next two years will be crucial for 3D Systems as the company will have to demonstrate better execution and handle increasing competition. Even assuming depressed financial metrics, the balance sheet risk would be manageable until 2016. Beyond that date, the risk of bankruptcy would be significant if 3D Systems is not able to stem its operating difficulties."
3029236,24849,2015-03-26T00:58:27-04:00,"Short interest has topped 38 million shares.
        More than 36% of float now short.
        Stock near 52-week low as company continues to disappoint.","While US markets are close to their recent highs, one name that is close to its 52-week low is 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). The 3D printing company has not been able to meet expectations, which has made me lose a lot of confidence in the name. Investors are also getting fed up, and that's evident in more than just the stock price. Today, I'll look at how short interest for the name recently hit a new high.A new high in short interest:Those that have followed my coverage of the name know that I track short interest extensively. The previous high was set in the middle of December, when I stated this name had a lot to prove in 2015. At that update, nearly 37.4 million shares were short, which is a considerable amount. The next couple of updates did not see any major changes to short interest as things bounced around within a couple of million shares. However, sentiment has clearly changed as seen in the chart below.At the middle of March update, more than 38.6 million shares were short, the highest amount I've seen in data going back to June 2013. Since the end of 2013, short interest in this name is up by a whopping 162.63%, including a 43.62% increase in the past twelve months. Those that have seen my past updates might notice a change to the chart above. I had to increase the upper bound as the 38 million share mark was crossed. Even though shares are near their 52-week low, investors were obviously not satisfied with the company's most recent report. A new high in short interest shows that a growing number of investors believe this stock will go lower.Looking at the float and peers:To look at short interest in a different light, many investors like to know what percentage of the stock's float is short. Many large cap tech names, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), have about 1% or 2% of their float short, which is not a lot. Generally speaking, I start to become intrigued in a name when we see the number reach double digits, and I start heavily following the stock when the percentage of float short number crosses the 20% mark.If you look at the data provided by Yahoo Finance, 3D Systems has a float of 105.32 million shares. That means that at the mid-March update, about 36.65% of the float was short, which is a lot. Since there are a couple of other 3D printing names out there, I've decided to compare 3D against some peers. In the chart below, I compared the percentage of float short number for 3D against Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), Voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET), and The ExOne Company (NASDAQ:XONE).Right now, 3D comes in second place in terms of most shorted, with ExOne as the leader. Interestingly enough, Exone's short interest is about 28% off its late 2014 high. This is certainly one sector that investors are betting against, as the four names above average about 28.4% of their float short. If 3D Systems sees another new high in short interest at the end of March, it could pass ExOne and become the most shorted name of these four.Final thoughts:Investors are losing confidence in 3D Systems as short interest hit a new high in the middle of March. With the company having a poor finish to 2014, the stock has dipped to new lows, and analyst estimates have come down for 2015. Management again expects business to pick up as the year progresses, but I'm not sure investors will wait if the year gets off to a slow start. When compared to peers, 3D is nearly the most shorted, and it could easily get to that top spot at the next update. Over the last couple of months, I've lost a lot of faith in this name, and it is obvious that investors have as well."
3085816,24849,2015-04-21T11:07:32-04:00,Stock up 23.6% off 52-week low.Currency issues could provide significant revenue pressure.Ambitious guidance may need to be lowered.Shares expensive on a GAAP basis.,"One of the best performing stocks in recent weeks is 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). Shares of the 3D printing company have rallied almost 24% off their 52-week low. It seems that investors may have some increased confidence in the name, but I'm not sure this is the best way to proceed. Given the recent strength in the US dollar, I feel that the company's revenues may be at risk, and so now is the time to be cautious on 3D Systems.In 2014, the company reported revenues of $653.65 million, up $140 million or 27.3% from the prior year. 3D Systems guided to 2015 revenues of $850 million to $900 million. The company noted that the discontinuation of legacy products would reduce historical revenue contributions, and that currency issues would hurt into the second half of this year. Given those statements in the Q4 release, some might find the company's guidance aggressive. The range is an increase of $196 million (rounded) to $246 million, up from a $140 million increase in 2014. Additionally, the percentage range of the increase would be 30.0% to 37.7%, up from 27.3%. So even though the company is working off a higher base amount, management is looking for an acceleration in both dollar and percentage terms. Given the number of disappointments we've seen from the company in recent quarters, this does make me a little skeptical.One legitimate fact that hurts the company is the rise in the US Dollar. When management provided guidance for the year, the Dollar Currency Index (""DCI"") was around 94-95. As I write this article, the DCI is approaching 98, and it was over 100 a few weeks ago. Management stated that in Q4, the unfavorable currency impact on revenues was $6 million, and that was with a total quarterly figure of $187.4 million. The dollar strengthened substantially between the end of the quarter and the Q4 report, so I assume management took that into account when issuing 2015 guidance. However, with another 3% or 4% rise in the DCI, it makes things even harder for the name.Additionally, 2014 showed more revenue coming from outside the Americas, which could mean an even larger currency impact. According to page 35 of the company's 10-K filing, just 51.1% of 2014 revenues came from the Americas, down from 55.4% in 2013. Asia Pacific revenue growth was 30.4% last year, and EMEA revenues were up 46.6%, both much higher than the 17.3% growth rate reported by the Americas segment. If the ex-Americas segment(s) continue to grow at faster rates, it means the company will be more dependent on revenues from countries where currency issues come into play. Apparently, I'm not the only one concerned, as the analyst average estimate for revenues is $857.43 million, towards the bottom end of the company's range. That average is down about $15.8 million since the Q4 earnings report.In the end, I think investors need to be a little cautious with shares of 3D Systems. Shares are up about 8% since the Q4 report, which was quite terrible, and even more from the 52-week low. Currency issues seem to be getting larger, and there might be some who thought management's guidance was a bit optimistic to begin with. With the company trading at more than 30 times non-GAAP expected earnings for this year, and almost 90 times GAAP earnings, this name is very expensive. After a series of disappointments in late 2014, 3D Systems has a lot to prove in 2015. The recent rally in the stock makes me even more skeptical, which makes it start to creep back into the short ideas bin."
2990096,22775,2015-03-10T18:53:49-04:00,Equity analysts continue to stick to the company’s guidance.Targets set by management (notably 30% organic growth in Q4 vs. 7% in the last quarter) are completely unrealistic in our view.Earnings and valuation downside risk remains significant.,"Despite several warnings and disappointing figures from 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) in the last twelve months, equity analysts continue to stick to the company's guidance. Consensus now expects $863m revenue and $0.95 EPS, in the low end of the guidance range ($850-900m and $0.90-1.10).This is all the more surprising given that the targets set by management are completely unrealistic in our view (remember we had a similar stance on the FY14 guidance in August last year). During the Q4 earnings conference call, CEO Avi Reichental commented: So organic growth, which has averaged 10% in the most recent quarters, should recover to 20% over FY15 with a peak at 30% in Q4.Source: 3D Systems, estimates by AtonRâ based on 3D Systems' commentsThis guidance would be plausible if 3D Systems was ready to ship a new, revolutionary product. Unfortunately, this is not the case as management claims:As a reminder, metal and consumer printers were a source of disappointment very recently (specifically in Q3) and we struggle to figure out why their revenue growth would rocket by end 2015. As for healthcare, which has long been a driver of the group's performance, it is unlikely to materially accelerate in 2016 from current high growth rates in our view.Also, we are worried to see a 30% growth target for Q4 while we have said many times that Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) could announce the pricing and full details and features of its 3D printers in late 2015 (ahead of their commercial release in early 2016), potentially leading many customers to hold off their 3D printer purchasing decisions in the second part of 2015.In all, organic growth in the low teens in 2015 and ~$800m revenue would make much more sense than 20% and $850-900m, respectively.Now, if we assume a flat gross margin in 2015 (the positive impact of the Cimatron acquisition being offset by slightly declining margins in the core printer business), flat or slightly down SG&A (20% of revenue) and $68m R&D costs (we assume they will not fall below the low end of 3D Systems' guidance range, even if revenues come weaker than expected), we get to $160m operating income vs. consensus around $182m.Hence, the earnings downside remains significant at 12% in 2015, hinting at a $0.84 EPS and a 33x P/E multiple. This is way too expensive for a company delivering only 20% year-on-year EPS growth (much of it being fueled by acquisitions), leading us to reiterate our negative stance and $20 target price on the stock."
2959896,22148,2015-02-27T15:35:39-05:00,"3D Systems reported dismal Q414 results.The feared threats by HP appear far overstated, based on the distractions from the corporate split.3D Systems is now attractively valued, but difficult to own until operations improve.","On Thursday, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) reported horrible quarterly earnings, but investors should pay attention to the more pertinent information of the last week. Clearly the 3-D printer manufacturer has a lot to prove to investors in 2015, but the fears regarding Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) entering the sector in a big way are quickly dissipating.While 2014 was highlighted by a stock peaking over $95 at an outrageous valuation followed by ramped-up expenses to fend off increasing competition, 2015 will feature 3D Systems proving it can turn into a mature company that effectively operates vast operations. While the 3-D printing sector is still in its infancy, the company expects to achieve 2015 revenue in excess of $850 million and EPS approaching $1. The questions of bankruptcy and goodwill impairments (see article) of the last couple of weeks, will quickly be replaced by discussions of the appropriate valuation for an industry leader.HP StrugglingOn Tuesday, HP released a horrid quarterly report. The stock sank to multi-month lows and the company reminded investors of the difficulties and distractions of splitting apart one of the largest corporations in the world. Previous research informed investors that the threat of HP to the 3-D printer manufacturers was completely overstated, based on the history of product delays and the corporate split.According to the summary information, HP missed FQ1 revenue estimates by $510 million and guided down FY15 numbers. The most disturbing guidance was that cash flow would fall to $3.5 billion-$4 billion from prior expectations of $6.5 billion-$7 billion. Possibly the best quote, to sum up the scenario facing HP for the rest of the year came from the CFO:More related to 3D Systems and the 3-D printer market was the general lack of discussion around a sector that the company hyped up in 2014. The quarterly information was mostly sparse on the subject and interestingly news leaked that HP was looking to acquire enterprise Wi-Fi provider Aruba Networks (NASDAQ:ARUN), taking the focus completely away from 3-D printing. Instead of aggressively buying into a market with relatively smaller competitors like 3D Systems and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), HP is apparently looking to make a move to compete against the giant Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO).Results Must ImproveWhile the news from potentially the biggest threat to the 3-D printing sector was encouraging for the existing market leaders, 3D Systems needs to improve results on its own, if it hopes to recapture investors' attention. The quarterly results were dismal with an earnings miss and a more shocking revenue miss by nearly $15 million. The resulting numbers only generated 21% YoY growth, despite numerous acquisitions during the year.Hope is not all lost. The company had several pockets of strength with healthcare and direct metal printing that grew 96% and 178% over the prior Q4, respectively. On the flip side, 3D Systems spent aggressively on technology and growing the sales and customer support organizations to better prepare for the competitive landscape. If anything, the company had underspent on research and development, with only $16.6 million spent during Q413. 3D Systems spent $22.5 million on technology upgrades during Q4, or 12% of sales. This was up from only 10.6% last year and follows a good trend highlighted about Stratasys here.3D Systems does forecast a reduction in the reliance on mergers and a goal to return to profitable growth. Analysts forecast earnings nearly doubling from the $0.70 earned in 2014, to $1.31 in 2016.The biggest issue with the stock, despite a nearly 70% decline in price, is that 3D Systems still trades at 23.5x 2016 earnings estimates that are difficult to forecast. HP could still end up a competitive threat, if not a margin headache, by pushing down prices.TakeawayUntil the management of 3D Systems proves to the market it can operate a grown-up company commingled from many acquisitions, the stock is difficult to buy despite the lower price. The news from this week continues to support the theory that HP isn't the large threat feared by most. The valuation on the stock is much more attractive now, especially for those wanting to own the space. For now though, I'm waiting for better execution by the company."
2976906,24849,2015-03-05T13:40:52-05:00,Q4 miss has analysts skeptical.Estimates dropping toward low end of guidance.Stronger dollar will hurt revenues in 2015.50-day moving average declining again.,"Last week, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) had a very mixed earnings report, which had me declaring the company needed to do better. Despite 2015 guidance being fair, the company reported a huge Q4 miss on both the top and bottom line. This has analysts losing confidence in the name and it is possible that investors will soon follow. Today, I'll explain why things are not looking good at the moment.Company now in ""show me"" mode:3D had a bad second half of 2014, featuring big revenue misses, a large warning, and a sharp drop in the stock. The company guided to the following headline numbers for 2015:The company stated that it expected about 44% of this year's revenues in the first half. Management also had some concerning statements regarding this above guidance, which I detailed in the article linked in my opening. After the large Q4 miss, and the numerous disappointments seen in 2014, analysts are becoming a bit skeptical of the company. In the table below, you can see how analyst estimates have come down a bit in just a couple of days.*2016 revenue growth rate based on 2015 estimate on that day.Analysts are now $15 million below the company's revenue midpoint for the year and a nickel below the non-GAAP EPS midpoint. The highest estimate on the street is $882 million, so there is not a lot of faith that the company will come in at the high end of its range.An analyst from Deutsche Bank put it perfectly, stating that 3D in the near term is a ""show me story."" The firm cut its price target on 3D from $43 to $33, noting that the company needs to prove itself. The company might be projected for a decent amount of growth, but we can't keep hearing about execution issues quarter after quarter. Back in July 2014, analysts were looking for almost $932 million in revenues this year from the company. If the recent pattern continues, the company won't see that number on a trailing twelve month basis until mid 2016 most likely.Currency issues could get worse:One issue that many companies are dealing with right now is the sharp rise in the US dollar. 3D Systems noted that Q4 2014 revenues were negatively impacted by $6 million thanks to currency issues. With revenues expected to rise sharply this year, the company could be even more impacted by currency movements. According to the company's recently filed 10-K, 55.4% of revenues came from the Americas in 2013. Last year, that number was down to 51.1%, and this makes sense given North American results falling short of expectations.Unfortunately for 3D Systems, and a lot of companies, the US dollar has continued its rise recently. The Dollar Currency Index topped 96 on Wednesday, setting another new 52-week high. In the chart below, you can see how sharp the rise has been just in the past six months. A year ago, the Dollar Currency Index was just above 80.(Source: CNBC.com)If the Dollar Currency Index continues to head toward 100, it would not surprise me if the average revenue estimate for 3D in 2015 continued lower toward that $850 million bottom bound. Remember, the DCI was mostly lower in Q2 2014 than it was in Q1 2014, so figure that 3D could face its largest currency impact in the June ending quarter.50-day declining again:One key item investors need to watch is the stock's 50-day moving average. This key technical level had been in decline for a number of months, but was flattening out into earnings. On the morning of the earnings report, 3D Systems jumped nearly 8% at its high to $32.40. With shares a bit higher, it seemed as if the 50-day could start to rise again. Unfortunately, the stock has fallen since, below $29 again, and that means that the 50-day has started to decline again. Until this stock can make a sustained move above this technical level and get the 50-day to start rising again, I feel that the moving average will provide a bit of resistance, helping to push the name even lower. A chart with the 50-day is below.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)Final thoughts:A sour Q4 report from 3D Systems has analysts losing confidence in the name, with estimates declining toward the lower end of the company's guidance range. This skepticism is thanks to a bad finish to 2014, and now has the company in ""show me"" mode. Thanks to the dollar's continued rise, we might see further estimate cuts given the large part of 3D's international business. The 50-day moving average also has started to decline again, and this key technical level will probably provide more resistance. I've lost a lot of confidence in this name in recent months, and it would not surprise me if we see a new 52-week low in the near future."
3013356,24276,2015-03-20T09:17:24-04:00,3D printing stocks have fallen due to limitations in their technology.HP's MultiJet and start-up Carbon3D's CLIP technology promise to revolutionize the industry.Can the present industry leaders get on this train in time?,"So far in 2015 3D printing has not been the place to be.The two leaders in the industry, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), have gone nowhere but down. Stratasys is down 29% after reporting a bad quarter in January, but 3D is down 16% as well. This followed 2013's wild ride upward, during which Stratasys came public through the merger of a U.S. company by that name and Objet, an Israeli outfit, while 3D split 3-2 and more than doubled in price.One reason for the 2014 fall, which continued into this year, is that both stocks were overbought by speculators. Booms bust and then we move beyond. Another reason was the FUD - Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt - caused by Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) announcement it will offer a new print technology called MultiJet Fusion next year, which some think will blow the older methods out of the water.Mainly, it's an acknowledgement of how limited present technologies are in terms of speed and capability. Today's printers either deposit tiny drops of heated material onto a platform, which is called deposition, or on a platform combine liquid or powdered metal into precise shapes, which is called sintering. Both methods are highly accurate, creating niches in areas like making teeth or turbines. But they're also slow, too slow for mass production. The low-end plastic deposition machines like the Cube and MakerBot seem to have no industrial use cases at all. They're more like the homebrew PCs of 1974, filled with dials and beeping lights.A start-up called Carbon3D is hoping to change all that with a technology called Continuous Liquid Interface Production. The idea is to use ultraviolet light and oxygen to ""pull"" new objects from a polymer - the light solidifies and the oxygen prevents solidification.The technique comes from Joseph DeSimone, a University of North Carolina professor who nevertheless moved to Silicon Valley to prove his concept. Right now the technique is just a TED Talk and a science paper, but the system is 25 times faster than deposition, it can in theory work with any liquid polymer, and the resulting objects have the consistency and accuracy found with other techniques.Carbon3D has raised $41 million in venture capital, which means it's open to being acquired by one of its larger rivals, and 3D would seem to be the likely choice, given its location in Rock Hill, SC. A factory to make the printers in Silicon Valley would suffer from high land costs, while South Carolina would match lower land costs with abundant engineering talent.Financially, growth at 3D is stalling, with fourth quarter revenues ""just"" 21% higher than the previous year, and with margins having narrowed to a profit of $4.23 million $1.55 per share, on revenues of $187 million for the fourth quarter. Its balance sheet still shows almost no debt, just $9.6 million, on assets of $1.53 billion.3D has always grown by acquiring smaller companies and integrating their work into its larger framework. It's worth just about $3 billion, and in theory would seem to have the ability to deliver current Carbon3D investors a ""home run"" of 10 times their investment, or $410 million, right now, or at least arrange to buy a piece in order to bring the technology east and scale it up.So why hasn't this happened yet? Why did DeSimone have to head west, and into the lap of venture capital, in the first place? It's clear that, between Carbon3D and MultiJet, the 3D printing space is being transformed. Can 3D, which still lists the deposition technology's founder, Charles Hull, as its chief technology officer, make it in this new age? Or are we moving from the equivalent of mainframes and minicomputers to PCs, an age where the methods Hull pioneered are obsolete?When the answers to those questions become clear we'll know whether the 3D industry is out of its slough of despond, or whether the current leaders are headed back into the investment ooze from which they sprang. You can speculate on 3D at these prices, but know it's just a speculation."
2959866,24849,2015-02-27T15:30:38-05:00,"Q4 revenues and non-GAAP missed estimates.2015 guidance fair, but do we trust management?Is this a dead cat bounce for the stock?","Earlier this week, I discussed how 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) needed to prove itself a bit with its upcoming earnings report. After a series of warnings and disappointments in late 2014, shares dropped tremendously. I discussed how this year was going to be a critical one for both the company and the entire space, and that process started with 3D's Q4 report. The company did report on Thursday morning, and the results were very mixed. While shares initially rose on the news, they pulled back later in the day, closing almost flat. Today, I'll discuss the report and detail why shares may not move much in the near future.Q4 results:For Q4, the results were a complete miss. The company reported revenues of $187.4 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.21. Both of those numbers were well below analyst estimates for $202.32 million and $0.25, respectively. While the company did end up within its revenue and earnings range for 2014, it was near the bottom of the revenue range and at the bottom of its EPS range. The company did note that Q4 revenues were negatively impacted by $6 million in the quarter, due to currency headwinds. The stronger dollar has been an item mentioned in several earnings reports this quarter.Unfortunately for the company, execution issues are still lingering. When 3D warned back in October 2014, management stated it was unable to meet demand. In the Q4 earnings release, it was stated that North American channel productivity fell well short of expectations, restricting organic growth in the quarter. The company was again unable to capitalize on the strength of its portfolio, and thus revenues came in well below what analysts were looking for, even if you exclude the currency hit.Examining 2015 guidance:I mentioned that 2015 guidance would be extremely important, especially given the warning a few weeks ago from peer Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS). Since July 31st, 2014, the analyst averages for revenues and non-GAAP EPS declined from $931.79 million to $873.20 million and $1.19 to $1.02, respectively. Here are the key points from the company's 2015 guidance:Overall, the revenue guidance midpoint was slightly ahead of the analyst midpoint, with the non-GAAP EPS midpoint a little below the Street. On the conference call, management expanded on some of these points. First, roughly 44% of the year's revenues are expected in the first half of the year. Second, those legacy products could impact revenues by as much as $20 million. Given the company's recent troubles and the Stratasys warning, I'm guessing that many investors were bracing for a forecast that was a bit worse. I believe that's part of the reason why shares were up for most of Thursday.However, you have to wonder if management can be trusted, given the number of recent warnings and revenue shortfalls. For 2014, the company had initially guided to $680 million to $720 million in revenues and non-GAAP EPS of $0.73 to $0.85. That forecast proved to be a bit aggressive, and don't forget that the company actually raised its revenue forecast at the Q2 2014 report. In the end, 3D ended up with $653.7 million in revenues and $0.70 in EPS. Even at the low end of the company's 2015 guidance, revenues are expected to grow by 30%. That's up from 27% in 2014, and you are working off a higher base number, so you can see why some may be skeptical.Other items to consider:I also found it interesting that the company stated it would moderate its M&A activity. One criticism of 3D is that the company has relied on acquisitions to drive revenue growth, so a lack of purchases this year might hamper those efforts. As found on page 31 of the recently filed 10-K, organic growth was just 7.2% in Q4 and 13.3% for the full year. In 2014, the company paid over $345 million for acquisitions, up from $162 million a year earlier. A couple of weeks ago, 3D completed its acquisition of Cimatron, at a cost of nearly $100 million.The company has only generated about $76 million in cash from operations in the past two years, and capital expenditures have totaled about $30 million. As a result, the company has issued a lot of stock, generating over $570 million from sales of shares in the past two years. If the company moderates its M&A spending this year, it should not need to go out and raise more funds. Don't forget, shares are down big in the past year, so raising a similar amount of money would be even more dilutive.I also mentioned in my preview article that the stock's 50-day moving average was starting to level off. When 3D shares had rallied early in the day, it looked like the 50-day would start to rise again. However, with shares falling to about $30 by Thursday's close, the moving average is stuck for the moment, and shares are again below the line. In my opinion, the failed rally on Thursday was a bit of a red flag.Final thoughts:3D Systems reported a terrible fourth quarter, missing on both the top and bottom lines. After a promising start to 2014, the company did not have a good finish, with multiple warnings and revenues falling way short of analyst expectations. 2015 headline guidance was fair, but management provided a number of worrisome statements with its forecast. 3D is again hoping for a strong second half of the year, but that didn't happen in 2014, and the pace of acquisitions is expected to slow. The stock also fell late in the day, falling below the key 50-day moving average. In the end, this was a ""blah"" report, and I don't see this stock moving tremendously in either direction, until we get more clarity on how 2015 will turn out."
2926486,22775,2015-02-18T10:19:10-05:00,"A goodwill writedown could spark increased scrutiny of 3D Systems’ balance sheet.In the short term, the company’s balance sheet appears rock solid.But in the next two to three years, 3D Systems could face financial difficulties should it fail to handle rising competitive threats.","Fellow SA author Illuminati Investments recently published an interesting article on 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) in which he argued the company would have to write down a significant part of the goodwill on its balance sheet (more than $500m) following the $100m goodwill impairment announced by rival Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS).We fully agree, 3D Systems will have no choice but to write down some of its goodwill as its operating performance (and obviously those of the companies it has acquired over the years) has been well below expectations in the last four quarters.Even if goodwill writedowns negatively impact GAAP earnings and shareholders' equity on the balance sheet, they are non-cash items that do not have any impact on more important metrics such as cash flow and net cash (/debt). That said, they are likely to be perceived negatively in 3D Systems' case.First, they could suggest the company has bought overvalued and/or struggling businesses and thus highlight management's poor use of the cash raised over the years (notably last summer).Second, they could spark an increased scrutiny of 3D Systems' balance sheet and raise concerns over the long-term viability of the company should its shareholders' equity (currently $1.3bn) take a serious hit.Having a closer look at 3D Systems' balance sheet over coming yearsWe do not believe 3D Systems faces a bankruptcy risk in the short term as its balance sheet appears rock solid: Probably above $300m net cash at end-2014 (or above $200m when factoring in the recent Cimatron (NASDAQ:CIMT) acquisition) and $1.3bn equity.That said, it's worth recalling that many once-successful (and cash-rich) tech giants ended up in financial trouble in the last two decades: Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Blackberry (BBRY) and Palm to name a few.With this in mind, we decided to run a couple of assumptions on 3D Systems.Base case assumptionsPrinter makers have been under-investing for years, but it's now time to become more serious ahead of the arrival of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and other rivals.Under this scenario, 3D Systems would burn less than $200m cash in 2015-16 and have a positive net cash position at end-2016 (and more than $1bn equity).In all, the company would remain in a comfortable financial situation.Bear case assumptionsUnder this scenario, 3D Systems would burn close to $400m cash and have a net debt around $150-200m at end-2016 while its gearing (or net debt/equity ratio) would reach ~20%.This is not a specifically worrisome level, but given poor operating performance and competitive headwinds, 3D Systems would probably find it hard to get financing at decent conditions.And should 3D Systems burn cash one more year (say $100-200m in 2017), its financial situation would become extremely tight and probably spark bankruptcy bets.ConclusionIn conclusion, the next two years will be crucial for 3D Systems as the company will have to demonstrate better execution and handle increasing competition.Even assuming depressed financial metrics, the balance sheet risk would be manageable until 2016. Beyond that date, the risk of bankruptcy would be significant if 3D Systems is not able to stem its operating difficulties.We reiterate our negative stance on the stock and our $20 target price."
2938596,22148,2015-02-23T09:46:44-05:00,"3D Systems faces many threats in the 3D printer market, but goodwill charges and bankruptcy aren't part of that discussion.
        A large goodwill writedown could occur with the Q4 report.
        Valuation metrics are turning more positive after starting 2014 at outrageous levels.","For whatever reason, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is attracting a lot of attention regarding a likely writedown of goodwill and the potential of bankruptcy. One issue isn't meaningful to the valuation of the stock and the other is very improbable considering the current financial situation. The important issues are new competitive threats and margin compression that are reducing the valuation multiples of the sector to more normal levels.3D Systems spent the last year collapsing from the irrational highs reached in the past. With the stock trading at $31 and now worth only $3.5 billion, the following reasons are why investors need to ignore goodwill and bankruptcy fears and focus on competition.Goodwill ImpairmentIlluminati Investments highlighted that 3D Systems was in line to take an impairment charge against the large goodwill balance on the balance sheet. The issue popped up due to the Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS)$100 million writedown from the MakerBot acquisition. The suggestion is that any writedown would have a detrimental impact on 3D Systems valuation.Investors need to understand the goodwill concept and the reason it exists on the balance sheet in the first place. Even more importantly, why it never matters to investors. According to Investopedia, the definition of goodwill is the following:In essence, 3D Systems built up a sizable goodwill position of $515 million at the end of Q3 due to the numerous acquisitions that are well documented and questioned. The prime reason an impairment charge of goodwill doesn't matter to investors is that it's a non-cash charge based on an intangible asset never considered in the valuation equation by the majority of the market.Most investors value 3D Systems based on a multiple of Price to Sales or Price to Earnings. Fast growth companies are rarely valued based on book value so any hit to an asset that reduces book value rarely matters. Not to mention, most investors eliminate the goodwill asset from any book value calculation, especially those assets accumulated from acquisitions.According to Illuminati, any writedown will have a detrimental impact on the stock considering the goodwill amount at the end of Q3 of $515 million makes up 40% of the book value of $1.3 billion. Sure a writedown of $250 million would drop the book value down to $1.05 billion, but most investors already consider the book value closer to $800 million by assuming that goodwill is virtually worthless.No Chance Of BankruptcyA few days ago, AtonRa Partners wrote about the bankruptcy risk of 3D Systems. Even seeing a headline regarding the bankruptcy risk of this stock was surprising considering the company remains very profitable with operating margins above 10%. One only needs to look at the recent bankruptcy of RadioShack (OTCPK:RSHCQ) to see how difficult it is to actually accomplish that feat without fraud being involved. RadioShack struggled for years before ultimately succumbing to that financial outcome. 3D Systems had non-GAAP net income of probably around $80 million for 2014. Hardly the signs of a company with any impending bankruptcy risks.The theory of that article is that the arrival of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) into the sector along with other competitors will potentially push operating margins down to breakeven or lower. Along with that move, 3D Systems will increase capex and quickly burn through existing cash. The company had roughly $377 million at the end of Q3 and recently spent $97 million to close the Cimatron deal. Now 3D Systems has around $280 million in net cash depending on Q4 cash flow and access to a $150 million credit line.The missing detail in this story is that 3D Systems would easily obtain equity financing considering its position in the 3D printer space. Though any requirement or scenario that would require a share offering would result in a lower stock price regardless of bankruptcy.The real issue is whether Hewlett-Packard causes more competitive pressures that further push down margins. 3D Systems is already expected to post a lower EPS in 2014 compared to 2013. Operating margins were down to 11.8% in Q3 from 19.3% in the prior year. The reason for the declining margins are the higher operating expenses to beef up research and development and increase sales efforts prior to the upcoming competition from HP. If anything, 3D Systems might improve margins heading into 2016 depending on how the threat from HP turns out.Valuation Turning AttractiveAnybody following my articles on the 3D printer space knows from this call at the start of 2014 that the enterprise value multiple of revenue is crucial to the valuation story. 3D Systems is now down to trading at only 5x trailing revenue and an even lower 4x estimated 2015 revenue. This number has collapsed from the outrageous levels at the start of 2014. These more normalized levels for 3D Systems and Stratasys make both stocks more intriguing.DDD EV to Revenues (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsTakeawayThe goodwill and bankruptcy concerns just aren't issues impacting 3D Systems. Investors don't value 3D Systems based on an inflated book value that includes the $515 million of goodwill and bankruptcy isn't a risk for a profitable company. So many scenarios could occur in the next few years that crush the stock without even encountering a bankruptcy risk. The issue is the competitive threat of HP and required higher expense levels.While a large goodwill charge might initially hit 3D Systems when it reports on February 26 before the market opens, the stock is more of a buy than sell assuming it holds the 52-week low of $27."
2953366,22775,2015-02-26T10:23:38-05:00,"Business as usual: weak organic growth, deteriorating gross margins in Q4.Guidance as usual: weak first half, but (management claims) a strong second half.Recommendation as usual: Sell with a $20 target.","History repeats itself …In many of our previous articles, we said that 3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) FY14 guidance was at risk and that, contrary to the company's statement, demand was not that robust and was affected by either slowing demand or increased competition. Therefore, we do not view the Q4 miss as a surprise.The two most important Q4 operating metrics (data from company's earnings press release) are highly disappointing with 7% organic growth, failing to recover from the already poor +12% reported in Q3, and gross margin continuing to deteriorate (47.9% vs. 51.7% one year earlier). The gross margin trend has been worrying for several quarters now and suggests the company's long-term earnings power will be much lower than initially expected due to increased competition and pricing pressures across the industry, in line with our initial thesis.At first sight, the FY15 guidance is not that bad and roughly in line with the Street ($850-900m revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $0.90-1.10 vs. a consensus of $873m and $1.02). That said, consider the following.First, it's not clear whether Cimatron (NASDAQ:CIMT) is factored into consensus estimates, while the recently-acquired company is included in 3D Systems' guidance.Second, management's tone is not encouraging:Third, 3D Systems' guidance will be back-end loaded once again (""a greater percentage of revenue generated during the second half""). We have said many times that customers could hold off their 3D printer purchasing decisions in the second part of 2015 ahead of the commercial release of Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) products in early 2016.In all, the FY15 guidance is clearly at risk. It was already the case last year with the FY14 guidance.Management's comment that it plans to keep its 2015 capex at 3% of revenue (~$25m) and to moderate its M&A activities could save the day. But this could also suggest 3D Systems is at risk of being sidelined in coming years as it invests well below peers (Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) guides for more than $160m capex this year) and that the company is getting concerned about its long-term survival and its cash burn (despite its current $285m net cash).The stock's valuation (30x 2015 EPS) does not make sense for a company expected to deliver 10-20% organic growth at best and flat-to-deteriorating margins (hence organic EPS growth around 10-15%). We stick to our $20 target price."
2887716,68135,2015-02-05T10:19:04-05:00,Earnings and cash flow far outruns SSYS.Big players do not automatically win in a new market.Law of large numbers and production and design efficiencies will improve earnings and margins.,"This past Tuesday was an epic pounding of 3D printing company stocks brought on by the dismal announcement that came out of Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS). If you look at the action in these stocks you would think there is no future for any of these companies and being in them is a fool's errand. The analysts piled on too, writing off the entire sector until Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) shows its hand in terms of the products it will be launching early next year. Clearly there is no reason to own the smaller players when the 800-pound gorilla is entering the market.Rewind back to 2000-2001 when the Internet bubble was bursting in a very spectacular fashion and everyone was writing off the Internet plays indiscriminately. Clearly they were not winning against the brick-and-mortar companies and there was no visible path to profitability. The logic goes that the barrier to entry was next to none and all the big retailers would knock off the newbies, so pure Internet plays were worthless. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a case study in this line of reasoning. In September of 2001, AMZN traded at around $6. Clearly they were not making any money and they had no moat to protect their business model. Big players were coming into the online market in hoards and there was no reason to own this pure Internet play. Needless to say, the net return on that stock from that point to today was close to 25,000%, not to overstate the upside.The problem with Mr. Market, as Benjamin Graham would put it, is it is basically schizophrenic. It has no notion of moderation especially when it comes to high-beta stocks (arguably Graham wouldn't be in high-beta stocks anyways). Today there is no reason Mr. Market can find to be in 3D printing stocks given all the negative sentiment that has built up. Lets review some of those negatives for 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD):The problem with 3D printing is the same as the problem the pure Internet retail plays or the networking companies had in 2000 (remember Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) north of $400), which is that the market got ahead of itself rather than the technology getting ahead of the market. The valuations were sky-high and justified until the rhetoric could be sustained without any evidence to prove otherwise. The moment there was evidence to indicate that the inflated valuations might not come to fruition tomorrow; the house of cards comes crumbling down. While the sell-off is not unjustified, the pendulum invariably ends up swinging in the opposite direction. (That would be JNPR at $5 in 2002).The 3D printer stocks are progressively getting to that point. At $95 and a forward P/E of over 100, DDD seemed like a great investment with a bright future. But at $28 and 28 times earnings there is no way anybody on the street wants to own this stock anymore. This is the irony in the thought process of many investors.So let's highlight the positives to owning the stock for the long run and by long run I am referring to a 10-year time horizon in the spirit of the AMZN comparison.As in the case of AMZN in 2001-2002, DDD seems to be in a space were all hope is lost in terms of investment sentiment and yet the industries have not even begun to catch up to the technology that has been created. Over the next decade 3D printing will be pervasive in the industrial and manufacturing space. This is a growth of enormous potential just as was the case for Internet retailing. But this growth will not happen linearly. There will be bumps on the way as the various applications of the technology get adopted in mass scale. The first movers will have the advantage of being already recognized in the space and established distribution channels. The question is whether we have the stomach to hold on.Wednesday felt like capitulation day for 3D printing stocks with incredibly heavy selling followed by a moderate rebound. It just might be 2002 all over again for these stocks."
2877416,22775,2015-02-03T06:18:16-05:00,"Stratasys, 3D Systems’ main competitor, issues a poor FY15 guidance mainly attributable to increased spending.It seems that HP’s entry into the 3D printing industry is pressuring revenue growth and margins, in line with our thesis.3D Systems will have to announce a pretty cautious FY15 guidance when it reports its Q4 earnings: the current EPS growth expectation (above 40%) is not realistic.","Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), 3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) main competitor, pre-announced last night Q4 and FY14 figures well below expectations and issued a highly disappointing FY15 guidance, expecting revenue of $940m-$960m and non-GAAP EPS of $2.07-2.24, vs. a consensus of $1.01bn and $2.91. These poor figures are mainly attributable to low growth in the consumer segment (only 7% year-on-year in Q4) and to a significant uptick in operating expenses for the next two to three years.The read-across is worrying for all 3D printer makers and specifically for 3D Systems. First, there is absolutely no traction in the consumer business while 3D Systems based its expectation for a Q4 revenue pick-up on metal printers and… consumer products.Second, Stratasys' opex (and capex) investments are broad-based (sales and marketing, product development and infrastructure). So, either Stratasys considers it has a huge opportunity ahead (but this is unlikely in view of slowing revenue growth) or it sees Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) 3D printing technology as a game changer and needs to invest in R&D and sales & marketing in order to survive (much more likely). We have long been saying that HP's entry into the 3D printing industry would pressure 3D Systems' revenue growth and spark increased spending and believe the Stratasys guidance confirms our view.In all, we remain convinced that 3D Systems will have to announce a pretty cautious FY15 guidance when it reports its Q4 earnings. Terry Wohlers' endorsement of HP's printers and HP's early engagement program (trial phase with key customers in 2015) suggest that many customers will hold off their 3-D printer purchasing decisions in the second part of 2015 (ahead of the commercial release of HP's products in early 2016) until HP announces the pricing and full details and features of its 3-D printers. In light of the expected HP disruption, we believe it's fair to assume organic growth will not pick up in 2015 and could even continue to decelerate, specifically in the second half of the year.Margins are also unlikely to improve in 2015 as 3D Systems will have to speed up its R&D projects and try to come up with revolutionary technologies and features amid a tough competitive environment (now both HP and Stratasys are investing heavily).Assuming 15% organic revenue growth over coming years and slightly declining margins due to rising competition, EPS growth would stand at around 10% or 20-30% when factoring in potential contribution from acquisitions. Hence, the earnings downside risk remains significant as consensus currently expects 3D Systems to deliver EPS growth above 40% in 2015."
2942686,24849,2015-02-24T00:15:23-05:00,3D Systems is ready to report.Expectations lowered after 2014 troubles.Sector concerns will increase if report bad.,"When this year began, I believed one name that had a lot to prove was 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). The 3D printing company had some bad earnings reports in the second half of 2014, which sent shares plunging to yearly lows. The company will report final 2014 results Thursday morning and is expected to provide 2015 guidance. Today, I'll discuss why this report is important not just for 3D Systems, but the entire sector as well.Expectations lowered:When the company reported Q3 results a few months ago, it reiterated its forecast for 2014. That included revenues of $650 million to $690 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70 to $0.80. Thanks to a couple of warnings in 2014, analyst estimates were forced lower, as seen in the table below.At the moment, analysts are currently a little below the company's revenue midpoint and two cents below the EPS midpoint. That makes sense given the company's recent struggles. Also, we've seen a little more pessimism after a warning from peer Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS). It was that other name's warning that sent shares of 3D Systems to its current 52-week low of $27, but 3D has rebounded a few dollars since.Industry importance:There have been a lot of non-believers in the 3D space in recent years, and with tech giant HP (NYSE:HPQ) about to enter in a big way, things could get tough over the next couple of years. 3D Systems has a window here, but the company needs to prove itself. Analysts are looking for more than 30% revenue growth for 2014 and 2015. Anything less would be a disappointment.If 3D has a good report with solid guidance, the stock should start to rebound, and there is a major amount of short interest in the stock, which could lead to a squeeze. Beyond this one stock however, a good report would help the spirits of the entire space, which were hit a bit with that Stratasys warning. A lot of these names, including Voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET) and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), are much closer to their 52-week lows than their highs. Should 3D Systems not live up to expectations, I think it will cause another leg down in all of these names. The bearishness will only increase.Even though these names still are projected for a bit of growth, the valuations still seem steep to some. At Monday's closing price, 3D Systems traded at more than 42 times expected 2014 non-GAAP EPS. If you look at GAAP earnings, the valuation is a bit more. Stratasys went for more than 31 times its expected 2014 figure. Investors won't continue to pay these premium valuations unless these names can keep their growth stories on track.The important 50-day moving average:This earnings report comes at a very interesting time for 3D Systems, the stock. As investors know, shares have been in a downtrend for some time. While they are off their lows, shares have been headed lower for a number of months. As you will see in the chart below, the 50-day moving average has finally started to level off. This key technical line has been headed lower for a while, and in my opinion that has helped to push this stock down further. This earnings report will have a large say as to which direction the 50-day moves in next, up or down.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)Final thoughts:2015 is a critical year for the stock of 3D Systems as well as the entire space this company operates in. A number of revenue and profit warnings in recent quarters have led to doubts over the growth of these names, sending many of these stocks lower. 3D Systems has a chance to chase away a number of shorts and put some optimism back into this sector when it reports this week. The stock is at a crucial junction as well, now that the 50-day moving average has leveled off. This is an important earnings report for the 3D printing space, and I'll be back after the report to analyze where things go from here."
2954306,28151,2015-02-26T12:59:58-05:00,"Despite the planned discontinuation of several legacy products, 3D Systems did not feel the need to take any of the goodwill writedowns I anticipated.If fact, goodwill actually increased due to the acquisition of botObjects at the end of last year, and will likely increase further with the closing of the Cimatron deal.Without these acquisitions, organic revenue growth was down to single digits, and continued adjustments to net income for ongoing acquisition costs is making non-GAAP earnings appear higher.Revenue also continues to be affected by currency headwinds that are likely to continue into the future, yet management reaffirmed revenue growth rates above last years levels.Given that guidance has proved to be overly optimistic in the past, I would take the stock's positive reaction to this as an opportunity to short the stock.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) reported earnings and revenues well below expectations due to continued product delays and currency headwinds, something I warned about in several comments yesterday. However, they did not take any of the goodwill impairment charges that I anticipated they would need to in my last article, despite continued poor performance and the discontinuation of several legacy product lines.Rather, after an additional 10 acquisitions in 2014, culminating in the botObjects acquisition in December to bolster their struggling Cube consumer focused lineup, goodwill has now risen to almost $600M, 45% of their total book value. For the year, these acquisitions added a staggering $259M worth of goodwill while only acquiring a corresponding $19M in fixed assets and $127M in other intangible assets.Shockingly, not a single penny of goodwill was written down, other than adjustments for currency exchange rates, even though management said they considered a ""variance in results of operations from projections, and additional acquisition transactions in the industry that reflect a lower control premium"". Guess they didn't notice that actual results have continually come down from their guidance and that of competitors like Stratasys' (NASDAQ:SSYS), and stock prices in the sector have been cut in half.These continued acquisitions are also masking tepid organic growth, which was 7% in the most recent quarter and 13% for the year, down from 34% and 29% over the same time periods last year. By continually buying most of their revenue growth, the company is distorting their actual results, especially since they continually adjust net income to account for supposedly one time acquisition costs even though it is clearly a major necessary part of their business strategy.Without these adjustments, GAAP net income for the full year was only 11 cents, putting DDD's PE ratio at a stratospheric 290. Even based on the midpoint of the perhaps overestimated earnings guidance for this year, the forward P/E is 80, which seems high for a company that may not have as much actual growth as expected.Given DDD's history of providing overly optimistic guidance that then needs to be taken down, I would take this opportunity to short the stock since it is trading at a high growth multiple but may not have any real growth due to ongoing operational issues, sector weakness, and currency headwinds."
2849956,40031,2015-01-27T11:27:18-05:00,"3D Systems has been one of the worst performers in 2014 with its shares down 64.5%.Poor execution and margin pressure were the main culprits for the poor stock performance, but they might become tailwinds in 2015 and beyond.Uncertainty is still high, but there are indications that the situation might get better in 2015.","2014 was a very bad year for 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) as the company failed to take full advantage of the significant growth opportunities in the 3D printing market. Availability gaps were blamed for poor Q2 and Q3 numbers and management has stated that they are not going to be an issue going forward. Some improvements are already visible in the Q3 report and the full-year revenue guidance implies a pickup in revenue growth in the fourth quarter. While the uncertainty is still high, I believe that the situation might get better in 2015 and that 3D Systems should bottom in the next couple of weeks.Last year's headwinds to become this year's tailwinds?Poor execution and margin pressure were the main culprits for 3D Systems' steep share price correction in 2014 as well as over-promising and under-delivering. The company is quite far from the $1 billion revenue target for 2015 that it promised in early 2014. Analyst estimates have been trending down since early August 2014 which was the time when I turned bearish on 3D Systems (admittedly, I was late to turn, but better late than never). The company increased full-year revenue guidance in June and reduced it just 50 days later, which was odd considering the acquisitions that should have increased the future expectations. Delayed shipments of consumer printers and manufacturing constraints in the direct metal printer business had a negative impact on growth rates, and CEO Avi Reichental said the company took ""decisive measures to remediate the remaining performance gaps"" and that the ramp up in production in the second direct metals facility should be enough to meet the rising demand in Q4 and beyond.The other part of the story that negatively affected 3D Systems' share price is margin pressure. The company has significantly increased investments in the last couple of quarters to capture the significant opportunities in the 3D printing space and the margins have trended down as a consequence. This heavy level of investing should level off in 2015 and we should see margin improvements going forward. So, in essence, the headwinds that hampered the company's top and bottom line performance and its share price should become tailwinds in the following quarters.Valuation is attractive given the growth potential3D Systems is currently trading at 29x its 2015 earnings and 22x its 2016 earnings. Although these estimates might continue to trend down going forward, I believe that we are near the end of the negative earnings expectations cycle and that estimates might even improve in the following months. There are several reasons for this optimistic statement:1. Availability gaps and manufacturing constraints have been resolved.2. Q4 revenue guidance implies a higher revenue growth rate than in Q3 and management might have learned a lesson to not over-promise anymore, and they might have shared a conservative view on Q4 figures, which might leave room for upside surprises going forward.3. The company's aggressive acquisition strategy might provide some upside to current revenue estimates.3D Systems' management seems to think that the current price is attractive as insiders have been buyers since November, which is encouraging.Short interest - an important factor for future share price performanceI believe that the high short interest is currently a double positive for 3D Systems' potential upside potential. As the valuation is now way off bubble levels, I believe that the shorts might start covering as they become satisfied with their gains. This should provide some downside protection and maybe we are seeing some evidence to support this thesis since the short interest has declined by 3 million shares in the second part of December. The other part of the equation is the potential short covering on rallies, especially if the company delivers Q4 revenue and EPS ahead of expectations.What can go wrong?I believe that the main risk for the bulls is the execution risk. The company might continue once again to fail to deliver on its promises, which would be detrimental for its share price. Competition and integration of the numerous acquisitions should also not be ignored and should be closely monitored.ConclusionIn my last article on 3D Systems, I said that we should expect more selling pressure and that the stock might find a bid around $30. Although there is still a lot of uncertainty, I believe that the risk/reward ratio has turned to the long side and that we might see a strong rally if the company delivers Q4 revenue and earnings ahead of expectations. The Q1 and FY 2015 revenue and margin guidance also will be of great importance. If we get good news, we might see the stock trading 30% to 50% higher in the next three to six months. Management also might strive to get their credibility back and I think that they will provide conservative guidance that they can beat going forward, which should result in less uncertainty about execution."
2883946,28151,2015-02-04T14:05:26-05:00,"3D Systems declined 5% Tuesday in sympathy with weak guidance from fellow 3D printing company Stratasys, but the selloff still might not be over in this over-hyped sector.These companies seem to be continually cutting their revenue and earnings forecasts as 3D printing struggles to enter mainstream manufacturing.Of particular concern is the $100M goodwill impairment charge that SSYS took on its MakerBot acquisition, given that DDD has made many similar purchases over the past several years.Any writedown would have a detrimental effect on DDD's valuation, since more than half a billion dollars in goodwill it has makes up 40% of book value.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) declined more than 5% Tuesday in sympathy with a huge decline from fellow 3D printing company Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS). While DDD bulls might be tempted to buy the dip caused by supposedly unrelated weakness, I'm actually surprised it's not down more and would caution against buying in now since I believe this is just a preview of more struggles to come in this once hot sector.First off, even after these stocks have been cut in half over the past year, they are still not cheap by any metric. Stratasys still trades at 4 times estimated 2014 sales and 3 times the reduced revenue projections for 2015. 3D Systems is even higher at 4.8 times the company's most recent sales guidance for 2014 and 3.7 times analyst estimates for 2015, which may come down further if the recent guidedowns are any indication.While 30% revenue growth might still seem strong, much of it has been bought through acquisitions. Organic growth has been declining at both companies and is down to 25% in the most recent quarter for Stratasys and only 12% for 3D Systems. In addition to the MakerBot acquisition, since 2012, Stratasys has made several other large acquisitions that have contributed to 50% YOY revenue growth, but also added more than a billion dollars of goodwill to the balance sheet.DDD has also been in empire building mode over the past several years, with 5 acquisitions totaling over $190M in just the most recent third quarter to bring the total to 7 so far this year. It has also bought no fewer than 20 businesses for a cumulative total of $345M over the prior 2 years, giving it a total of $515M of goodwill on the balance sheet.Given the elevated valuations of 3D printing stocks, it seems likely that at least some of these purchases were at frothy valuations during what is now looking like the peak of the 3D printing bubble. Therefore, a significant portion of this goodwill will likely have to be written down at some point and could have a major impact on share price because the company already trades at an elevated 2.5 ratio of price to book value, of which the latter is 40% comprised of this inflated goodwill.This is especially worrisome since Stratasys just announced a $100M goodwill impairment charge related to its 2013 purchase of MakerBot. Sales growth from this division that targets the home printing market slowed much more than expected on weak demand and product reliability issues. This prompted the company to write down a quarter of the $400M purchase price of just a few years ago. A similar writedown in value of the goodwill assigned to all of 3D Systems' acquisitions would result in a 10% reduction in book value.DDD bulls might argue that a non-cash charge related to goodwill reduction should have no effect on the company's valuation, but it would suggest it overpaid for a significant amount of its growth, which may now be slowing as demonstrated by Stratasys. Of course, they might also say that these issues are isolated to the consumer segment of the 3D printing market, but despite the fact that the company has pivoted away from this area through numerous disparate acquisitions, sales of its Cube home-printing system and related accessories still contribute 7% of DDD's revenues, compared to the 12% that MakerBot makes up for Stratasys.Also, according to the company's 2013 annual report, in 2013 ""three of the acquisitions were related to building our 3D consumer and retail products and services"" and in 2012 ""three were building blocks for our consumer growth initiative."" Even though these were mostly smaller purchases and won't lead to goodwill writedowns as dramatic as with MakerBot, there's no evidence that the values of larger industry-focused purchases held up much better.In the latest 8K the company tried to explain away poor results as being not demand-related, but rather supply-constrained such that the ""revenue shortfall that resulted from the company's continued manufacturing constraints for direct metal printers and the delayed availability of its newest consumer products."" Yet in almost the same breath the company went on to say in the included investor presentation that the ""effective integration of acquisitions is already delivering synergies and expanded margins in our Quickparts and health care division,"" despite the fact that gross profit margins declined across the board in products, materials, and services.Clearly all these wide-ranging acquisitions, both geographically and functionally, have not been as easy to integrate as anticipated, so some of the value given to supposed synergies from being both vertically and horizontally integrated are probably overstated. Since the company has repeatedly stated in financial reports that ""Factors considered in the determination of goodwill include synergies, vertical integration, and strategic fit for the Company,"" it seems likely that a fair portion of the goodwill assigned for these reasons needs to be reevaluated in the face of actual results.Continued slowdown in these segments that were once promised to hold vast riches illustrates how the potential of 3D printing so far has been repeatedly overstated. Bulls seem to breathlessly latch on to ever evolving stories ranging from a 3D printer in every home (or every room, if you believe DDD CEO Avi Reichental) to its potential to disrupt traditional manufacturing through advanced techniques for printing everything from metal to graphene, and someday even human organs.Since 3D printing in general, and the acquisitions of individual companies in particular, has not begun to come even close to living up to this potential, I would avoid all related stocks until the coming goodwill writedowns from shotgun acquisitions made during the recent bubble have blown over. After these run their course on the balance sheets, we can begin to better evaluate these companies based on traditional valuation techniques, and not the non-GAAP nonsense they have relied on lately.With Stratasys still posting huge GAAP losses and 3D Systems not faring much better with only 18 to 28 cents of net income expected for 2014, only a third to a quarter of what it reports in non-GAAP numbers after adjusting for stock based compensation and acquisition costs. These supposed one-time expenses certainly seem to be an ongoing, major part of its roll-up strategy, so it seems absurd not to include them, which results in a P/E that is still in the triple digits.When 3D Systems reports later this month, we will get a better idea of whether issues in this sector have been fully reflected in the most recent guidance reductions or whether things continue to slow down. If they do and DDD still refuses to take a prudent goodwill reduction to reflect what is becoming apparent from the recent guidance and associated stock price declines, I would take this as a warning sign that it refuses to acknowledge its mistakes and is continuing to try to grow its way out of its troubles through more reckless acquisitions, a strategy that does not appear to be working.No matter how much potential you think this sector ultimately has, I would hold off on buying these stocks until you get one last kitchen sink quarter where all the goodwill from recent acquisitions is legitimately evaluated on its current merits. It will most likely be marked down to much lower values, which may finally mark a bottom on which these companies can begin manufacturing additive gains again."
2800285,22775,2015-01-06T08:54:45-05:00,"3D Systems acquires the desktop printer maker botObjects.As explained in our previous articles, we view the current acquisition spree, at a time when 3D Systems is plagued with competitive and execution issues, as a major short-term threat.New operating issues could appear soon as 3D Systems tries to integrate and manage this patchwork of software, hardware and services businesses.","Yesterday, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) announced the acquisition of botObjects, a U.K.-based 3-D printer maker. botObjects' full-color 3-D desktop printer will join 3D Systems' Cube line and thus strengthen the company's position in the consumer segment. While 3D Systems claims the deal will be accretive in 2015, we believe there are few (if any) reasons to cheer.We often commented in previous articles that 3D Systems' M&A frenzy was a source of concern due to inherent integration risks. The current acquisition spree [close to $200m spending in Q3 and $97m acquisition of Cimatron (NASDAQ:CIMT) in November], at a time when 3D Systems is plagued with competitive and execution issues (market share loss, sinking gross margins, manufacturing capacity constraints for direct metal printers, delayed availability of new consumer products…), is a major short-term threat in our view. It suggests that new operating issues could appear soon as 3D Systems tries to integrate and manage this patchwork of software, hardware and services businesses. Also, this move into the consumer segment with botObjects could raise concerns about 3D Systems' strategic direction as the company put the focus on medical and metal a few months ago at the expense of consumer printers.In all, we remain wary of 3D Systems' M&A frenzy and, more globally, we believe that 2015 could be another tough year for the stock (and its peers). Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) early-2016 entry into the 3-D market could prompt customers to hold off printer purchases in the second part of 2015 and pressure organic growth in the industry. It could also spark increased R&D spending from leading printer makers trying to compete with HP's ""breakthrough"" technology.

2789125,58641,2014-12-30T17:49:24-05:00,"The 3DMe Photobooth is a promising concept for retail 3D printing, particularly during special events like weddings and birthdays.The wedding/birthday events service industry is almost recession-proof.People like getting married and having birthday celebrations.Current DDD investors can average down while the stock is still below $40.","The photobooth business is still booming here in the Philippines. When I was still employed, my company's photobooth units were in demand for weddings, debuts and birthdays as well as corporate and political events. Competition has made photobooth rentals very affordable and most special occasions have a photobooth and a video karaoke to entertain guests.I am therefore glad that 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has released the 3DMe Photobooth product in the U.S. and European markets.Unlike the old photobooth system that can only print out 2D photographs, the 3DMe will be an instant, unique must-have product that wedding planners and events coordinators will love.The 3DMe Photobooth will print out 3D figurines with personalized faces of guests. The printouts from 3DMe are therefore great giveaway tokens for attendees. 3D Systems is therefore making the right move to profit from people's addiction to getting married and celebrating birthdays.Investors should note that the wedding and birthday events service industry, like the death service business, is nearly recession-proof.The Photobooth Industry Is BoomingThe photobooth concept became popular because it was a cheap way to entertain and distribute wedding giveaways to guests. Instead of buying expensive wedding tokens for 300 or more people, wedding planners prefer to use a photobooth system. In our case, we used to print out 400 to 900 prints in a three-hour wedding/debut reception.We charge 8,000 pesos ($181) for a three-hour photobooth service. The package includes unlimited reprints. Unfortunately, starting around 2013, competition decreased the number of customers who can afford our service. It is therefore a welcome opportunity for my old Fil-Chinese boss to buy a 3DMe Photobooth unit.Even if my old boss charges double or triple the rental fee, I opine that wedding planners and event coordinators will likely prefer to rent the unique awesomeness of a 3D printing photobooth. Kids will love 3D printed superheroes that come with their own faces.(click to enlarge)The Cost Of OwnershipI am not privy to the final retail price of a 3DMe Photobooth, but when we bought our first 2D printing photobooth in 2009, the unit cost was 185,000 pesos ($4,204). It was expensive to own a photobooth system because the Photoboof software license per unit cost was $600. The Mitsubishi CP-8000DW dye sublimation printer cost more than $2,500 in 2009. The Canon DSLR and the laptop to operate the 2D-only photobooth were also very expensive.The 3DMe Photobooth may retail for more than $5,000, but I opine that it is still a good investment. 3D Systems' product is a self-operated photobooth machine that will not require a dedicated human operator. Hiring a photobooth operator adds to the overhead. Wedding and events firms will find the 3DMe Photobooth as a long-term moneymaker.Source: 3dsystems.comThe 3DMe comes with free bundled software and cloud connectivity and is easy to transport. I do not know the average rental fee for a photobooth in the U.S., but since 3DMe is a unique product, I say retailers will be justified if they double the rental fee. Contrary to the claims of long printing time for 3D printed products, the 3DMe photobooth can output prints in 15 seconds - faster than the 20 second print time of a 4x6-inch photograph from the Mitsubishi CP-8000 DW dye-sublimation printer.Furthermore, 3D Systems is offering revenue sharing to resellers and retailers who purchase a 3DMe photobooth. This share-the-money scheme will encourage more resellers to market/promote the 3DMe. The resellers will work harder because they are not limited to a fixed sales commission percentage.Why It Matters3D printing will only gain the respect of the stock market once retail customers start using 3D printing products on a regular basis. 3D Systems, like other 3D printing stocks, was beaten down black and blue this year because mainstream adoption never materialized.I hope 2015 ushers in substantial retail usage of 3D printers/3D printed products. The 3DMe Photobooth is also ideal for malls, restaurants, groceries, sports arenas, casinos and other commercial places where there are lots of people.3D Systems can bounce back big next year if it continues its focus on retail-centric (not enterprise) additive manufacturing printers.My RecommendationI opine that long-term DDD believers now have this great opportunity to average down and acquire more shares while the price is below $40. The overall pessimistic view of 3D printing stocks is never permanent. The emotions of the market will definitely change over time.3D printing tickers will only become stock market darlings once mainstream retail adoption happens. The sky-high valuation of 3D Systems last January was due to pure speculation of greedy investors. First, there was the boom rush to $90+ and then the boom crash down to the $30s.3D Systems is a consistently profitable company with no debt handicap. Myopic investors who whine about the big fall of DDD this year should look beyond the surface. There is often great opportunity in bottom fishing.I recommend that investors should wait for the bears to make DDD cheaper before averaging down. The technical indicators are very negative. StockTA's recent candlestick analysis (December 26 and 29) warns of Bearish Harami and Bearish Engulfing for DDD. The technical indicators of BarChart Opinion also gives DDD only an overall average score of 24% Sell.Contrary to the technical indicators' warning, five analysts from BarChart still rate DDD as a Strong Buy as opposed to only two analysts who are screaming Sell DDD.Disclosure: The author is long DDD."
2786715,24849,2014-12-30T00:19:14-05:00,This was one of 2014's worst stocks.Revenues and earnings growth must come in strong.Short interest continues to hit new highs.,"We keep hearing about how the US market did extremely well in 2014, and that fact is true. However, not all names participated in this rally. When you look quickly at the chart below, you may think I'm showing you the fall in oil or gas prices. Well, if my title didn't give you a hint, the chart is actually of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). Yes, the 3D printing company has been one of the worst performing stocks in 2014, which makes it a potential bounce back candidate for next year. Today, I'll discuss why the name still has a lot to prove, and why if it does, it could be a big winner for shareholders.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)Results cannot disappoint again:The second half of this year was not pretty for the company or the stock. The company's Q2 earnings report was a big disaster, and that started the snowball rolling down the hill. Big revenue and earnings misses led to a guidance takedown, and thus, we've seen a drop in analyst estimates. In the table below, you can see how much these estimates have declined since late July.In 2013, the company reported $513.40 million in revenues and $0.85 in non-GAAP EPS. That meant that analysts were looking for almost 40% revenue growth in late July, and now, the forecast is for about 30%. The bottom line forecast has gone from a 4 cent decline to a 12 cent non-GAAP drop. As a result, analysts have also had to reduce their hopes for 2015. With estimates falling, the stock has as well. The company must issue a decent 2015 forecast when it reports its Q4 2014 results, and it would be nice if there could be a Q4 beat as well. The worst possible scenario would be another major warning, which is what happened a couple of months ago. We are likely to get a very wide range for revenues and non-GAAP EPS from the company early in 2015, but the midpoints of those forecasts must be at least close to current estimates.A reasonable valuation?One criticism of the entire 3D printing sector in 2014 was that these stocks were extremely expensive. When 3D Systems was at much higher share prices, obviously, the valuation was a lot higher. The question now is are you getting enough growth for what you are paying? In the table below, I've compared 3D against the larger Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), and two smaller names, ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) and voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET). These are current analyst forecasts for each, with the valuations based on those estimates as well as Monday's close.*P/E and EPS are non-GAAP. ExOne and voxeljet are both forecast for losses, so there are no P/E values for these two names.Trading at more than 30 times expected non-GAAP earnings per share for 2015 seems a bit expensive for many. With the overall market trading at 15-20 times earnings, investors might find this valuation troubling. There are two items to consider here. First, you are getting a lot more potential growth, so the valuation does seem somewhat reasonable in that respect. On the other hand, GAAP earnings are much lower. For 2014, 3D forecast non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 to $0.80 per share, but only $0.18 to $0.28 for GAAP earnings. Using GAAP, that makes the valuation substantially higher.The good news is that 3D and Stratasys are profitable on a non-GAAP basis, unlike the other two names detailed above. 3D is expected to show the least revenue growth at this point, although 30% plus is nothing to shy away from. Since voxeljet and ExOne are losing money, they do not have an EPS growth rate. 3D is currently projected for more EPS growth than Stratasys. Overall, I don't think 3D is that expensive for the given level of growth, when looking to the comparison names above.Another way to look at these names is what the professionals think. In the table below, I've compared analyst opinions for each. The average rating goes on a scale of 1.0 to 5.0, where 1.0 is a strong buy and 5.0 is a sell. A 3.0 rating would be a hold. The potential upside amount represents the potential increase from Monday's close to the median price target.At the moment, 3D comes in as a slight buy, which isn't surprising given the disappointing results in the second half of 2014. Overall, however, analysts seem to believe that all of these names offer considerable upside. While $43 a share might not seem like much for 3D investors that saw this name above $90 early in 2014, it would represent significant upside from where shares trade currently.Short interest hits a new high:3D Systems made it to my radar because it was a highly shorted stock. Stocks like this, because of their tremendous growth and high valuations, often find a number of non-believers. Short interest in this name has continued higher in recent months, and those betting against the stock have done quite well. In the chart below, you can see a history of short interest over the last 18 months.We recently received the mid-December short interest update, and it showed another new high. More than 37.38 million shares were short the name, about 350 thousand shares more than the previous high a month earlier. Based on float data provided by Yahoo, the percentage of shares short is now 35.49%, which is also a new yearly high.A lot of investors are clearly bearish when it comes to this name, and that means that a short squeeze is definitely possible if this company could finally report some good news. The days to cover ratio at the latest update was over 16. That means that it would take more than three full weeks of trading volume for all shorts to cover their positions, which is a tremendous number. If 3D is able to prove itself in 2015, a massive amount of short covering could push this name substantially higher.Establishing a base of momentum:Since 2014 was a really bad year for the stock, especially in the second half, the name is stuck in a down trend for the moment. All of the momentum is going the wrong way, with the 50-day moving average line continuing to decline each day. In my most recent article on 3D Systems, I noted how the 50-day was crossing into the high $30s, and now it is under $35. You can see this moving average over the last two years in the chart below.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)When the stock was rising in 2013, the moving average mostly helped to provide support on pullbacks. This year, we've seen the opposite, with the trend line providing resistance as shares have gone lower. Shares did break above the 50-day during the middle part of this year, but the move was short-lived because more bad news sent the stock lower, and the moving average soon joined.With the stock stabilizing in the low $30s, the 50-day moving average line should start to level off rather soon, although it still has a little lower to go. This is another reason why the company needs to prove itself in 2015, because it needs to get positive momentum back on its side. Investors want to see this trend line turn higher, and right now, it would take a move back into the high $30s or low $40s for that to occur.Final thoughts:After a terrible year for shares of 3D Systems in 2014, potential exists for the name to be one of 2015's winners. The company is projected to show a large amount of growth, and the stock does trade at a more reasonable valuation than it did earlier this year. Analysts believe there is significant upside, and a large short interest amount could lead to a short squeeze. However, as the case has been for this name all along, results cannot disappoint anymore. This name warned and took down its forecast a couple of times in the second half of 2014. If results can actually come in above expectations next year, this name could see large gains."

It seems that the company is not printing the shells of project Ara's modular phones. 3D Systems, last year, signed a deal with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) to make smartphone enclosures and covers. But, Google's director of Project Ara recently pointed out in an interview that the company is not deploying 3D printing for manufacturing shells for its smartphones. He said that they looked into it but ""as it turned out, there is a little ways to go in the 3D printing space."" Surprisingly enough, the stock counteracted to register 7.92% gain during the Friday session.It is, however, unclear for now that whether the company is discarding 3D printing altogether, or is it just the case for the printing of shells? Note that, in the original deal, 3D Systems was supposed to print modules also. Project Ara's director explicitly mentioned ""shells"" but didn't speak about the modules. The director said,3D Systems has been collaborating with Mellon University to develop conductive inks, which would enable modular functionality. Nonetheless, the loss of shell-manufacturing is a major setback for 3D Systems. There can be tons of explanations why Google is not using 3D printing. But, the most probable explanation is 3DS' inability to print in high volumes. Cost of printing can also be the driving force of this decision. Anyhow, the key thing to consider here is whether 3D Systems is still printing the modules?If Google is avoiding 3D printing altogether, this will adversely affect 3D System's stock price. I was quite bullish about 3D Systems in the past, but integration problems related to acquisitions and, now, Project Ara's setback is more than enough to change my opinion. Project Ara could have provided a life line for 3D Systems in the current scenario. 3D Systems is a sell for now. $20-$25 could be a better entry position for long-term investors.Recent Coverage: 3D Systems - Earnings Highlight Integration HeadwindsValuation Details: 3D Systems - Still Overvalued?"

It can survive the transition to consumer-fueled 3D printing.Intel's strong influence on OEMs means more tablets and notebooks with RealSense technology will be released in the future.,"CES 2015 revealed some positive developments that will benefit 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). I appreciate it that Dell has released the Venue 8 7000 Series Android tablet. This $399 tablet comes with Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) revolutionary RealSense 3D technology. I opine that Intel's aggressive move to popularize depth-sensing capable camera sensors on tablets and laptops will help 3D Systems printers and software gain more mainstream acceptance.The Dell 8 7000 Series is an 8-inch Android tablet that uses an Intel RealShot SnapShot camera that makes it easy for users to photograph real world objects for 3D design and printing. 3D Systems and Intel signed a partnership deal where Intel-powered notebooks and tablets will get free 3D scanning software from 3D Systems.Affordable tablets are now available to let people quickly scan objects for 3D printing. 3D Systems' proprietary Sense scanner software will allow any owner of RealSense-enabled tablet (like the Venue 8) to scan objects for 3D editing/design and printing.As a professional photographer, I appreciate the power of Dell Venue 8's RealSense SnapShot Camera. A depth-sensing camera allows photographers to refocus photos they already have taken. The depth-sensing, distance-measuring capabilites of a RealSense-enabled tablet allows ordinary people to make 3D models out of real-world objects.Windows Notebooks Are Also Getting RealSense 3D TechnologyAcer, another leader of global computers, also used CES 2015 to unveil its 3D-printing friendly laptop, the Aspire Nitro V 17. This gaming/productivity laptop from Acer sports top-caliber technical specs in addition to its RealSense 3D camera. People who are more seriously into 3D modelling and additive manufacturing will appreciate the Acer Aspire Nitro V17's quad-core Intel Core i7 CPU and up to 16 GB of RAM.In addition to the free Sense 3D scanning software, 3D Systems is also bundling a copy of the 3DMe program that allows people to scan their faces. After which, people can superimposed their scanned 3D faces on famous 3D characters. The idea of creating personalized Ghostbusters and Star Trek characters is now easy to do with RealSense-enabled laptops.The issue of cost -per-print of 3D printing will be addressed later. The important thing is that Intel (and its OEM partners Dell and Acer) is making affordable hardware to engage more people to try additive manufacturing.I remain adamant that 3D Systems will only get the respect of the stock market once 3D printing becomes as convenient and easy as using an inkjet or laser printer.3D Systems Acquires Another 3D Printing CompanyThe efforts of Dell, Acer, and Intel to bring 3D printing to the masses are also being reinforced by 3D Systems' latest acquisition. U.K.-based botObjects agreed to be taken over by 3D Systems earlier this month. 3D Systems is now using botObjects PlasticJet Printing (PJP) full-color desktop 3D printing technology to release the CubePro C.The CubePro C will retail for $4,990 which should appeal to some home-based hobbyists or additive manufacturing entrepreneurs. There are other cheaper 3D printers available on the market today but botObjects produced the world's first full color desktop- size 3D printer- the ProDesk 3D. The CubePro C will likely be the same (or improved) version of the ProDesk 3D which already boast printing speed of 125mm/sec.The proprietary technology of botObjects allows a ProDesk 3D printer to output products which are of higher resolution than the original STL files. I like and approve 3D Systems' merger & acquisition style of growing its business. Inorganic growth is great in making allies out of potential rivals.I look forward to botObjects helping 3D Systems create a $1000 version of the CubePro C. I look forward to Acer and Dell using RealSense as a way to encourage people to replace their older laptops. According to IDC, Dell and Acer are the world's No.3 and No. 4 leaders in global PC shipments.(click to enlarge)Source: IDCThe point is that 3D Systems stands to gain a lot from Acer and Dell's strong support for Intel's RealSense technology.ConclusionI agree with the Hold rating of Alpha Omega Mathematica (AOM) for DDD. In spite of the huge short interest of 3D Systems, the high-math algorithm of AOM still sees some potential in DDD. The Hold rating is mainly due to the decent Growth Valuation scores of DDD.Source: getaom.comWith Intel's massive influence on major OEMs, I expect more RealSense-enabled tablets and laptops to be released in the next two years. Intel's aggressive contra revenue tactic to steal mobile chips market share from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and MediaTek means $200 tablets with RealSense cameras is not too far off in the future.I expect 3D Systems to greatly benefit from Intel's mighty call for notebook and tablet vendors to create RealSense-enabled tablets and laptops.DDD loyalists should appreciate that the more 3D-printing friendly tablets that are sold, the more people are exposed to the beauty of home-based 3D printing.3D Systems is not burdened by debt and is still profitable.It is still worth holding on to.

2728555,77085,2014-12-03T16:50:52-05:00,"The amount of hedge funds and special situations funds inside the deal is a very good sign of success.
        Vertical integration: the deal makes a lot of sense for 3D Systems that will use Cimatron's software.
        A lot of alpha: Small investors should profit from deals like this since the large merger funds cannot enter (lack of liquidity).","Review3D Systems agreed to acquire the leading international CAD/CAM Software Company, Israel's Cimatron , for ~$93M. The deal is quite logical since if the merger is consummated 3D Systems will profit from the Cimatron's products used for its 3D productions molds (CimatronE and GibbsCAM). The merger will be paid with cash in hand and its subject only to regulatory approvals. The Extraordinary General Shareholders meeting is expected to be on Jan. 9, 2014.There are very good articles about the valuation of this company in SA. Congratulations if you bought it some months ago… I will not review the valuation, I will only talk about the merger.The thing that I like the most about this deal is not what I read in the agreement but what I see before. There is a huge volume the year just before the announcement. It is true that most part is because of the 3D printer's fever. But ,in my opinion, inside trading can be an important reason too.In this case of mergers with a non U.S. company and little market capitalization inside trading is free money since there won't be many investigations. In addition, if you are in Europe or somewhere else the SEC cannot catch you. We see the volume highlighted in the following graph:Source: Yahoo FinanceAlso, if we take a look at the top shareholders we find a lot of hedge funds and special situations investment managers:Source: Yahoo FinanceThis suspicious volume and the fact that these investors bought the stock are very good signs. This kind of funds and insiders buy before to profit at the acquisition, so there won't be any problem to clear the shareholders' approval condition.Regarding the symmetry of the investment 3D will pay $8.97/share, a 47.5% premium which is actually quite big (maybe not so much in the technological sector). The spread today is 3.34% (13.36% annualized) which is not little either. In my opinion, the size of the spread in comparison with the premium is appropriate and fair. Since it is going to be a fast merger (shareholder's meeting in Jan. 9 plus 30 days to finish) we can afford it.In addition, small investors can profit from a lot more of alpha since large merger funds are not interested in this micro-cap mergers (lack of liquidity).Investment idea and conclusionThis is an opportunity since it is a simple merger (no complicated conditions) with affordable risk/reward ratio and fast. In addition, the fact that is a small merger means a lot of alpha for the small investor since the big merger funds won't care about this deal.Finally, the fact that there are several hedge funds and special situations funds inside is a very good sign. The merger is free money.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."
2756875,67775,2014-12-15T15:10:19-05:00,Strong position in 3-D printing industry.Recent collapse in price.High risk in niche market.LR model shows stock is overvalued.,"A darling of the 3-D printing industry3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is one of the largest and most popular companies in the 3-D printing industry. DDD currently has the most diverse set of products in this industry with seven different product lines. It currently holds 18% of the industry market share and is expanding through mergers. In November, DDD acquired Cimatron, a developer of 3D CAD/CAM software, for approximately $97mm and an implied EV/LTM EBITDA multiple of 10.6x. Investors are excited about this company because it holds a strong position for this potentially lucrative market.Recent collapse in share priceAll this excitement over DDD's growth prospects pushed its share price to $96 at the start of the year. Since then, the price has steadily fallen to $30, as of December 12th, 2014. Even its current price implies aggressive growth and margin expansion projections. The company needs to start showing investors that it can improve margins significantly to justify a higher share price. DDD's EBITDA margin was approximately 21.5% for FY 13' while Q3 14' year-to-date EBITDA margins have fallen to approximately 13%.3-D printing far from a guarantee and competition is loomingMost analysts are bullish on DDD now that its share price has fallen so much. They believe that the company will be able to improve its margins thanks to its strong product line and superior product development through acquiring competitors. I'm not as sure as 3-D printing is still a niche and fairly unproven industry. I understand the potential but I'm not completely sold on the company's prospects just yet, especially when DDD trades at a 35x LTM EBITDA.Another issue is that since this is such a new industry, change happens quickly. DDD is in a strong position now but could lose ground quickly to new competitors. That's not to say the company's growth prospects are not solid. The problem is they need to be amazing to justify a higher share price. I feel similar about Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), a leading producer of 3-D printers which I recently wrote about. These are decent companies that have been overbought because of the hype behind the 3-D printing industry.Levered Returns valuation modelMy Leveraged Returns model implies DDD is still slightly overvalued at its current price of $30. I used aggressive revenue growth rates projecting 35% growth in 2014, 30% for 2015 and 2016, and 25% going forward after that. In addition, I assume margins expand to reach 23% by 2017.ConclusionI would recommend value investors not purchase DDD at its current price. At $30 per share, investors assume the company will achieve strong growth and aggressive margin expansion. I look forward to your comments and thoughts on my analysis below."
2784415,47691,2014-12-29T08:22:36-05:00,,"By Sarah Roden3D printing is taking the tech sector by storm, from NASA using the new technology to print tools in orbit, to labs experimenting with 3D prosthetic legs. 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is a key player in the 3D printing industry as a company that designs and manufactures 3D-printed products.Although most are optimistic about the future of 3D printing, 3D Systems has had a rough year. DDD began 2014 with shares around $95 each, but shares last closed slightly above $30 on December 16th.Last year, 3D Systems announced that they would be working with Google on Project Ara; an effort to create a phone that runs on different modules so it can be customized by the user. Project Ara is scheduled to be launched in January of 2015, but it was recently announced that Project Ara will no longer be using materials printed by 3D Systems. Paul Eremenko, director of Project Ara, explained that ""there is a little ways to go in the 3D printing space"" and they will be using other materials instead.3D Systems announced on December 18th that it will be showcasing ""its entire consumer and prosumer 3D printing capabilities at the 2015 International [Consumer Electronics Show] in Las Vegas"" next month. It will also use the event to announce innovations such as ""new hardware and software developments in desktop full-color 3D printing, 3D printing food, and software for design and gaming.""On December 26th, analyst Ananda Baruah of Brean Capital maintained a Hold on 3D Systems though he did not provide a price target. The analyst noted that the CES conference ""could be an important event for DDD, particularly given the recent concerns around the Consumer Solutions segment."" As for the stock, Baruah noted, ""DDD's Consumer operational headwinds are likely behind us, and we look to CES for a fresh look at what's in store"" for consumers in 2015. ""Moreover, we note that DDD's recent hiring of Peter Theran from Bose Corp., where he managed reseller, retail, and online businesses - which included product management, marketing, and sales operations.""Ananda Baruah has rated many technology stocks, including Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Xerox Corp. (NYSE:XRX). He has proven successful with both companies. The analyst has rated Hewlett-Packard 11 times since May 2010 with a 89% success rate recommending the stock and an average return of +23.3% per HPQ recommendation.Similarly, Baruah has rated Xerox 9 times since April 2012 with an average return of +22.5% per XRX recommendation.Overall, Baruah has a 65% success rate recommending stocks with a +7.6% average return per recommendation.Will 3D Systems continue to struggle into 2015, or will the company turn around and reap the benefits of the rising popularity of 3D printing?The analyst consensus for DDD on TipRanks is Hold."
2745355,77085,2014-12-10T09:07:46-05:00,"The new information shows that this merger is a good opportunity to earn money with merger arbitrage.The absence of market-check is explained because the merger is not in the U.S.Obtaining the regulatory approval will take a long time and so we recommend to exit after obtaining the shareholders approval (Jan. 6, 2015).","IntroductionAs noted in a previous article, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) agreed to acquire the Software Company, Israel's Cimatron (NASDAQ:CIMT) paying $8.97 per share in cash (47.5% premium).I will not review again here the main reasons - which were noted in my last article - to do merger arbitrage in this deal. Instead, firstly, I will include some new information about the transaction that was released recently; the background of the merger, the conditions, the termination fees… Secondly, we will discuss if, taking into account this new information, the arbitrage makes sense.Deal DetailsIn order to make a quick review of the terms of the transaction, I have prepared the following table including: the type of buyer and the type of target with links to find information about them, the conditions, the potential profit and the expected termination.The most remarkable conditions are first of all the 5% termination fee that Cimatron will have to pay in case of accepting another offer or contacting another party (""No solicitation of transaction"" condition). Secondly, the regulatory approvals that include the German authority and the Israeli Companies Registrar - which will actually make the transaction very long - .Background of the mergerThe background of the merger is released by the target to explain the process before the announcement of the transaction. It is very useful to see whether the Board of directors contacted third parties and also if many players were interested. This was not the case in this merger agreement. Two groups started conversations two years ago and one of them offered $8 per share. However, these conversations were not the result of a go-shop period in which the company contacts several players. In the U.S., shareholders would sue the board for a breach of its fiduciary duty. In the EU and in Israel, this is a normal procedure and the board of directors is never truly independent.You can take a look at the previous discussions with other parties:Previews contacts and absence of market-check (Source: SEC)The fact that the market-check did not exist does not mean, outside the U.S., that the target will likely receive another offer. The M&A market in Europe and Israel is actually pretty different from the U.S. and the probability of other bids is very low.The background of the merger notes that the negotiations with 3D Systems started in Aug. 4, 2014 and that the first non-binding offer was proposed in Sep. 5, 2014. Finally, following a meeting on Nov. 23, 2014 the Board accepted the Merger Agreement which was announced a few days later. The stock price graph with the process is below:Negotiation with 3D (Source: SEC)The background of the merger is not very detailed in terms of negotiation. In addition, the negotiations only took less than 15 days which is a very short period. Due to this last fact and that the market check was not done, I think the price obtained per share is low.Investment idea and conclusionWe have to understand that this is a merger outside the U.S. to review it. The background has shown that the market-check was not done and that the Board is not truly independent - which is actually expected - but this does not mean that another party will be interested (also, no judge will care much about the shareholders).However, we do not see any complication in the process or any special condition to be afraid of. We recommend the merger arbitrage in this case as the reasons of the previous article still apply.Finally, there is a very good remark that one of the readers commented: since the regulatory approvals will be long (German and Israel) I think that, once the shareholders approve the transaction (Jan. 6, 2014), taking the money and investing somewhere else is not a bad option.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

2760295,22148,2014-12-17T15:47:11-05:00,Gartner predicts that 3D Printing will become a strategic technology for 2015.The HP threat in the 3D Printing space is over stated due to a history of delays and a corporate split.Investors should increasing turn bullish on 3D Systems as further stock losses turn us bullish on the stock.,"The recent massive selloff in 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) might finally provide a buying opportunity in the once highly over priced stock. With the 3D printing sector generally under massive pressure due to fears of the entrance of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) into the sector, the current selloff provides opportunity.The real question is where the opportunity lies with the stock dropping on an almost daily basis.HP Threat ScareLots of investors see HP as a major threat in the 3D printing space due to its massive size and experience in 2D printing. The technology leader announced the entry into the sector back in October with the suggestion that the designed 3D printer is faster and cheaper than anything on the market. One major hitch existed with the HP announcement - the company hasn't actually shipped the product yet.According to an interview with Zdnet, Ramon Pastor, vice president and general manager of the large format printing unit, proclaimed that HP wouldn't really enter the market until the second half of 2016. HP plans to work with partners throughout 2015 to establish a network and work on materials. The entry into the market nearly two years away does bring major questions as to whether HP can actually deliver on the claims of a cheaper and faster printer.On top of the large delay in entering the market, HP is in the middle of splitting into two entities. The distractions from a corporate split up will further complicate the entry into this new sector and provide further opportunity for industry leaders like 3D Systems and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) to expand market dominance.Strategic Technology For 2015The ironic part of plunging 3D printing stocks is that major research firms remain very bullish on the technology. Gartner ranked it as the number three technology trend for 2015. The research firm predicts that the technology will turn strategic for enterprises next year.Valuation Turning AttractiveThe biggest downfall to the valuation of 3D Systems over the past couple of years is that the soaring stock over valued the company based on organic growth. The growth forecasts aren't changing, but the valuation of 3D Systems is down substantially, making the stock more appealing now.DDD EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsWhile the valuation for 3D Systems is more attractive after the stock plunge, the below chart shows more potential downside. It is entirely possible that the stock over corrects on the downside similar to how the valuation became extreme on the upside.TakeawayAfter first warning about the extreme valuation of 3D Systems at the start of the year with an EV of around 20x trailing revenues, the stock is now more attractive at 4.8x revenues. Ironically though, the prospects for 3D printing haven't really changed during this time period.It is practically impossible to predict a bottom in the stock of 3D Systems. Investors should consider initiating a position if the double bottom holds at $28 with the intent of buying more shares on further losses. If anything, the stock is extremely over sold based on fears of an HP threat that is far over stated at this point. Investors should turn increasingly bullish on 3D Systems."
2723915,25106,2014-12-03T07:43:38-05:00,DDD shares are down more than 55% since my initial sell recommendation.DDD valuations are now somewhat less extreme.Short interest has continued to increase making a short squeeze more likely.Difficult times for 3D printing companies could lead to industry consolidation.,"Since my initial piece, 3D Systems Corp: A Strong Sell, published on March 3, 2014, shares of 3D Systems Corp (NYSE:DDD) are down more than 55%. Since, I reiterated my negative view on March 24 in a piece entitled 3D Systems: Updating My Outlook shares are down more than 40%.DDD data by YChartsValuationIn my initial piece, one of the main reasons why I was bearish on DDD was the valuation. At the time of my previous piece, DDD was trading at 15 times sales, 8.26 times book value, and 63 times forward earnings. Currently, after a considerable drop in share price, DDD trades at 6.3 times sales, 3 times book value, and 37 times forward earnings. While DDD is still an expensive stock based on almost any measure, DDD is now trading in line with its closest competitor Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS).DDD PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsDDD PS Ratio (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsCompetitionIn addition to high valuations, I was also bearish on DDD because I had been worried about increasing competition, especially from HP. After HP formally announced it was entering the 3D printing space, shares of DDD and all other 3D printing stocks started to move lower. In the wake of this news I wrote my follow up piece in which I suggested that DDD would continue to fall on analyst downgrades. In late October, Deutsche Bank downgraded DDD to a hold from a buy and lowered its price target to $43 from $80. In mid November, Cowen dowgraded DDD from a buy to market perform. Given the major decline in DDD shares, I believe the reality of significant competition is now reflected in the stock price.Short Interest Continues To IncreaseAs shown by the chart below, short interest in DDD has continued to increase despite the significant fall in share price. With a short interest now approaching 40% of the float, DDD is ripe for a short squeeze on any positive news.DDD Percent of Float Short data by YChartsIndustry Consolidation Becoming More LikelyGiven the difficult time for the entire 3D printing sector over the past year, I believe industry consolidation is becoming more likely. DDD has itself been a major acquirer of smaller 3D printing companies over the past few years. Most recently, DDD announced plans to buy 3D printing software producer Cimatron for $97 million. In my initial piece, I noted that DDD was unlikely to be a takeover target due to its high valuation. However, due to the significant drop in share price DDD could now be a takeover target. In particular, I believe a merger with Stratasys or a bid from IBM or HP is possible. Alternatively, due to the significant drop in share price of two smaller 3D printing companies, ExOne and Voxeljet, DDD could make a move to acquire one or both of these struggling companies.ConclusionIn March when DDD was trading above $70 I was confident that shares were a strong sell for a number of reasons including DDD's valuation and the threat of increasing competition. However, the situation has changed and I no longer believe DDD is a strong sell. DDD's current valuation is still high but 37 times forward earnings is much more reasonable than 63 times forward earnings. After HP's formal announcement that it is entering 3D printing, the idea of increasing competition has now been priced into DDD shares. Despite the significant drop in share price, short sellers have not locked in gains and instead short interest continues to increase. This suggests that sentiment is extremely negative on DDD and a short squeeze is likely on any good news. Even if DDD does not receive a takeover bid, even somewhat credible rumors could be enough to send DDD shares significantly higher due to the high short interest. While I no longer believe DDD is a strong sell, I am not ready to declare the stock a buy. I remain skeptical of the company's acquisition growth strategy. While a takeover might be becoming more likely due to DDD's low stock price, at this time, I am not convinced that a takeover bid is likely enough to warrant buying the stock."

2716505,24849,2014-11-28T02:47:14-05:00,"An important acquisition was recently announced.
        Estimates continue to decline.
        Short interest hit a new high.
        Here comes the 50-day moving average.
        Shares trying to put in a bottom.","2014 has definitely not been a good year for shares of 3D printing company 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). A couple of earnings disappointments have put in question the long-term future of the name, and shares are just a few dollars off their 52-week low. Recently, the company announced some important news, which investors seemed to cheer. Today, I'll detail the latest news, and detail why shares are trying to find a bottom.Recent news:The company recently announced the completion of its acquisition of Robtec, which will create 3D Systems Latin America. 3D acquired 70% of the shares of Robtec with the remainder transferring on the 5th anniversary of closing. Robtec is recognized as the most trusted and knowledgeable Latin American 3D printing technology resource to the manufacturing sector. Here's an important quote from 3D's CEO on the deal:Additionally, 3D Systems also recently announced a definitive agreement to acquire all the outstanding shares of Cimatron (NASDAQ:CIMT) for nearly $9 in cash. The deal will total about $97 million, inclusive of net cash. The combination of Cimatron's products with 3D's portfolio will help to strengthen 3D's place in this ever growing and competitive space. 3D expects the acquisition to be immediately accretive to its cash generation and non-GAAP earnings per share upon closing. Here is the CEO quote regarding this deal:Investors are certainly used to 3D making acquisitions, as the latest 10-Q filing shows over $244 million in net cash used for acquisitions through the first nine months of 2014. These latest deals should certainly help 3D strengthen its position in the space, and the Robtec deal helps form a base in Latin America.Estimates going lower:Results have not been great for the company in recent quarters, and the Q3 warning definitely surprised some investors. As a result, we have seen another drop in analyst estimates. Don't forget, the large Q2 miss sent estimates lower a few months ago as well. In the table below, you can see a recent history of 2014 and 2015 analyst estimates since late July.We've finally seen the analyst average for 2014 get to the company's midpoint of $670 million for revenues, as given at the latest report. Some estimates are still towards the high end of 3D's range, so it will be interesting to see if these analysts revise their numbers down a bit given the recent weak performance. There's obviously a much better chance of 3D beating if the analyst average is at $660 million rather than $670 million. In terms of non-GAAP EPS, the latest guidance was for $0.70 to $0.80 per share, so analysts are towards the bottom end of that range.A new short interest high:When it comes to 3D, one item I have tracked extensively is short interest. This stock is highly shorted, meaning if we actually could get some good news, a short squeeze could be possible. We recently got the mid November update on short interest. As you can see from the chart below, another new high was set.Short interest is now above 37 million shares, up about 152% so far in 2014. Just when it seemed as if shorts were really starting to leave, the last three updates have seen increases, a total of about 3.4 million shares. Additionally, we are back above 35% of the stock's reported float short. With the company's weak results in recent quarters, that may not be a surprise.How are the technicals?This stock has been one of the worst performers this year, and that will certainly happen when results disappoint. Shares recently hit a 52-week low of $32.64, and they've been trying to find a bottom. With the latest warning pushing shares lower, we've seen the 50-day moving average go lower as well. The chart below shows the stock year to date against the 50-day.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)In the next couple of trading days, we will start to see the 50-day moving average push into the high $30s. If the stock can basically hang around where it is now, the 50-day should start to level off soon. That should help shares a little, and if we could see a recovery into the $40s, the moving average could eventually start to rise again. Of course, another warning from the company would push the stock lower, and that would send the moving average further lower.Final thoughts:While 2014 has been a disappointing year for shares of 3D Systems, investors are hoping that the stock is currently trying to find a bottom. The company recently detailed some acquisition news, which should help strengthen the company's product portfolio and expand the business. Analyst estimates have continued lower recently, but are currently well within the company's yearly guidance. Shares are only a few dollars off their 52-week low, which will mean the 50-day moving average is headed into the $30s. At the same time, short interest has hit another new high.For investors that believe that 3D shares are near a bottom, now might be an interesting time to look at the name. A good finish to 2014 and strong 2015 guidance could help this name rally over the next couple of months, and with a tremendous amount of shares short, good news could spark a short squeeze. With the company disappointing in recent quarters, however, I almost prefer at this point that investors change their strategy regarding the name. Instead of buying shares, I think buying at the money $36 calls for February 2015 might be a better play. You can get these for about $2.75 or so currently. While your upside may be reduced a bit if shares do rally back to say $45 or $50 into early 2015, your downside will be limited if this company disappoints again and shares fall into the $20s.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

2706735,24276,2014-11-25T09:56:46-05:00,"Growth across the 3D printing area has stalled.3D is buying Cimatron, which makes design software used by manufacturers.Marrying manufacturing software to one-off production may restart growth.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) stalled out at the start of the year and has been falling ever since, as investors have seen the limits in what 3D printing can do at the present level of technology.The handwriting should have been on the wall a year ago when CEO Abe Reichental sold 25,000 shares at a price of over $80/share, netting himself over $2 million (subscription required). The stock has been falling ever since.What 3D Systems and the entire 3D printing marketplace needs is to, in a sense, return to the drawing board. In 3D's case, this means improving manufacturing processes rather than making plastic gimcracks off PC designs, which is what the industry is known for today through 3D's Cube and rival Stratasys' (NASDAQ:SSYS) MakerBot.So 3D has returned to the drawing board with its purchase of Cimatron (NASDAQ:CIMT), a smaller Israeli-based company that produces Computer-Aided Design software. Cimatron, too, enjoyed a vogue early in the decade, but the stock stalled out at $10/share early this year. The price 3D is paying, $8.97/share, is well short of those highs.Cimatron may be the medicine 3D needs to get growing again. Cimatron's customers use its software to create molds, tools and dies for mass production of parts, while 3D systems' ""printers"" are used to create parts one at a time. If the two concepts can be married - if 3D printers can be used to build better molds, and if Cimatron software can be integrated into the world of one-off production, spontaneous growth may recur.Full disclosure. I invested about $10,000 buying 3D shares starting in late 2012, but sold out my position in March at a profit of roughly 50%. I am presently looking for a new entry point in the stock, and this may be the catalyst for one.While competitor Stratasys is worried about regulation, 3D is worried about re-starting the growth engine. Co-founder Charles Hull, 75, who returned as Chief Technology Officer after finding retirement a bore, is now likely to find a kindred spirit in Bill Gibbs, Cimatron's North America president, who has been working in Computer-Aided Manufacturing almost as long as he has, since 1972.It's pure speculation to think an injection of Israeli-management (Cimatron is based in Israel, as is Stratasys) and software, along with a second old hand to work alongside 3D's co-founder, could lead to a spike in innovation for a company based in Rock Hill, SC, which is south of Charlotte.But stranger things have happened. While 3D seeks breakthroughs in using different materials, in speed and in price, matching its software to something mass production facilities actually use may be the right way to go.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

2708135,22148,2014-11-25T18:07:04-05:00,"3D Systems paid a 47.5% premium for the shares of Cimatron.Cimatron is a 3D design firm that recently reported only 8% revenue growth and flat EPS numbers over the prior year period.The deal is accretive, but the value add is questionable considering the lack of growth and several other recent software acquisitions.","Before getting too excited about the deal by 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) to buy Cimatron (NASDAQ:CIMT) for a 47.5% premium, investors should understand why the stock floundered prior to the merger. 3D Systems rallied some 7% following the news of this deal despite the minimal impact that the $97 million deal will have on a stock with a $4.2 billion market cap.Cimatron is a 3D design firm with slow growth and a weak stock price prior to the agreement with 3D Systems. Though the deal is accretive, the question is whether it actually adds long-term value. The software design firm has slower revenue growth than the 12% organic rate generated by 3D Systems in Q3. To create any long-term value, the Cimatron assets will have to accelerate growth via the combined larger sales force. With all of the other software acquisitions, one has to wonder if any of benefits will be realized or if Cimatron gets lost in the shuffle with all of the moving parts at 3D Systems.Deal Terms3D Systems agreed to pay $8.97 per share in cash to buy Cimatron for a total value of $97 million. Cimatron closed on Friday at $6.08, providing for a 47.5% premium to that closing price. The stock is currently trading at $8.65 suggesting the market doesn't expect a higher bid.3D Systems suggests the deal is immediately accretive to cash flow and EPS. Considering the use of cash, it doesn't take a significant amount of income to exceed the interest income from cash in this low interest rate environment. It doesn't though suggest that the accretive numbers are meaningful to the financials of 3D Systems.The deal is expected to close during Q115.Slow GrowerThough Cimatron is a solidly profitable company, it has anemic revenue growth. For Q314, the 3D software developer only grew revenue 8% on a constant currency basis to $11.2 million. With gross margins of 88%, net income hit over 10% of revenue and reached $1.2 million. Due to higher taxes and substantially higher diluted shares outstanding, the 27% increase in operating profit led to earnings per share flat YoY at $0.11.In general, analysts forecast limited growth for Cimatron in 2015. Revenue growth of 5% will produce one additional penny of EPS to $0.54. These numbers are exactly why the market wasn't impressed enough to buy the stock despite the promise of using the design technology in the 3D printing field.With forecasts for annual net income at Cimatron in excess of $5 million, it's a simple equation for the deal to become accretive. The bigger question is whether a business that generates slower growth than the existing organic numbers at 3D Systems actually produces any value.For Q3, 3D Systems produced revenue of nearly $167 million and net income of nearly $20 million. In the prior year period, the company earned over $26 million suggesting the roughly $1.2 million added by the Cimatron deal is relatively immaterial. Even worse, the growth rate at 3D Systems from all of the acquisitions will quickly dilute the impact of the very slow growing Cimatron.TakeawayWhile buying Cimatron adds a solidly profitable business to the folds at 3D Systems, it doesn't justify a higher stock price. The slow revenue growth and flat EPS numbers provide little to excite investors. It is possible that 3D Systems jumped nearly 7% on the day due to the new printing platform that includes a PC app with cloud-based tools.If anything, investors should be concerned that 3D Systems paid a huge premium for a public company that couldn't inspire the stock market. In addition, the biggest concern is whether the company can successfully integrate these new services into other software purchases including Geomagic, TeamPlatform, and Rapidform. At this point, investors need to see the company produce strong organic growth and another acquisition further distracts the management team from being productive with existing assets. Accretive or not, it is difficult to see how the deal adds any long-term value.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

2693475,22775,2014-11-18T19:05:39-05:00,"Back in February, we valued 3D Systems at $26 in a bear-case valuation.Since then, expectations for the 3-D printing leader have come down.It’s now time to update our valuation model.","Back in February, when 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) was trading above $70, we valued the stock at $26 in a worst-case scenario. This bear case soon became our base case as concerns mounted over 3D System's growth and margin outlook.Since then, expectations for the 3-D printing leader have come down as organic growth has slowed significantly (to 11% on average in the last two quarters from 28% in Q1) and as margins have been hit by rising competition and R&D spending. Moreover, the June equity offering changed the company's capital structure and share count.It's time to review our valuation.As explained in our February article, valuing companies in a booming industry is always a difficult task. But in our view, a DCF (discounted cash flow) valuation is well suited to this kind of mission as it enables to capture the long-term potential (revenues and margins) of any company. Therefore, we have decided to perform once again a DCF valuation. Please note that, this time around, we do not perform a bull-case valuation as 3D Systems' operating outlook is highly uncertain.In our updated DCF valuation, we use a discount rate of 10.1% (with a 1.3 beta) and make the following assumptions:- Organic revenue growth (close to 20% in FY14) gradually moderates as competition increases, prices decline and the technology matures.- By 2024, 3D Systems generates $2.5bn revenues (vs. $670m expected in 2014) and still delivers a comfortable 10% revenue growth (that compares to 12% in Q3 2014). We expected more than $4.5bn revenues in our previous valuation.- Non-GAAP operating margin is unlikely to recover to past levels (above 20%) due to rising competition. Notably, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) could become a major player as soon as 2016. That said, 3D Systems' non-GAAP operating margin remains healthy around 18%, in line with the profitability of HP's printing division and with the assumptions made in our previous valuation.- Stock-based compensation gradually declines as the business matures. While a non-cash item, stock-based compensation has been included in our DCF as it reflects future share dilution.- Growth rate in perpetuity is 3%.Source: AtonRâWe get to a $17 valuation, or ~50% downside. That said, we acknowledge that our model does not take into account future acquisitions while 3D Systems is expected to remain very active on the M&A front (close to $200m M&A spending in Q3 alone!) thanks to a still significant net cash position (above $300m by the end of 2014). So, we have decided to factor in the potential impact of future acquisitions in our valuation.Figuring out the value creation potential of M&A deals is a pretty difficult task. Hence, we simply tried to figure out the likely EPS accretion in relation with these potential transactions. Assuming 3D Systems spends its whole net cash position on M&A and acquires businesses with similar margins at a 15x P/E, the impact on EPS would be around 20%.That leads to a ~$20 valuation for the stock. In conclusion, the downside remains significant (~40%) despite the -60% year-to-date performance."
2668785,80135,2014-11-12T05:37:52-05:00,"3D Systems registered revenue growth of 23% but earnings witnessed negative growth of 30%. Non-GAAP EPS surpassed analysts’ estimates, thanks to downward revisions in earnings.3D Systems is a hold until the company resolves integration issues, and also the healthcare and metal segments deliver consistently.It was mentioned previously that healthcare will drive the company’s revenue going forward. However, I was wrong about the integration and synergistic benefits. The company is yet to show such benefits.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), a 3-D printing pure play, posted revenue of $166.9 million, registering 23% year-over-year growth. In contrast, the company posted non-GAAP earnings of $0.18 resulting in a year-over-year decline of 30%. However, analysts were expecting the same result in the light of guidance warning issued by 3D Systems in the recent past. The company managed to beat earnings estimates by $0.01 while missing revenue estimates by $0.81 million. Note that the estimates were subject to frequent downward revisions in the previous month. Earnings estimates fell from $0.20 to $0.17 since the company released its guidance warning. For the full fiscal year, 3D Systems is guiding for revenue in the range of $650 million-$690 million and non-GAAP earnings of $0.70 to $0.80. The guidance is in line with the Wall Street revenue and earnings estimate of $672.8 million and $0.73 respectively.As expected, the revenue growth was fueled (pdf) by healthcare and direct metal segments; healthcare revenue grew 121% year-over-year and 36% sequentially. Despite healthy growth in these segments, overall growth of 23% is disappointing. 3D Systems' continued manufacturing constraints for direct metal printers and the delayed availability of its newest consumer products hindered the revenue growth. Though, it should be noted that explosive growth of healthcare and metal printing will eventually impact the overall growth of the company. There is another problem highlighted by the earnings report; revenue growth is not translating into earnings, thanks to increasing operating expenses. OPEX increased by 67% on a year-over-year basis. The increase in expenses is most likely because of the integration problems as 3D Systems has been very active in the acquisitions department lately. In the wake of the problems, 3D Systems recently appointed Mark Wright as the COO, who can be of real help when it comes to the integration of the business. For detailed management commentary on earnings see the earnings call transcript.To sum it up, given the forward PE of 34, 3D Systems' top line is not growing as it should. Healthcare and metal printing have to deliver consistently in order to drive the growth upwards. But, more importantly, healthcare and metal acquisitions should be integrated in a proper and timely fashion. Healthcare and metal printing are set to grow but whether 3D Systems manages to integrate these segments is the primary question. Investors should closely watch for OPEX going forward. The company has the products and the intelligent acquisitions, but the problems mentioned above need to be resolved in order for 3D Systems' profitable growth. I remain bullish of 3-D printing but as far as 3D Systems is concerned, prospective investors should remain on the sidelines. 3D Systems is a HOLD until healthcare and metal segment consistently deliver for the next few quarters and the company shows some progress on the integration front.For details on recent acquisitions see ""3D Systems: Dissecting Acquisitions"""

From a strategic standpoint, this transaction makes sense as we have said multiple times since the beginning of the year that design software was likely to become key in printer makers' offerings and drive 3-D printing adoption thanks to easy-to-use functionalities, notably in the consumer segment.And from a financial standpoint, the price paid for Cimatron (~17.5x 2014 EPS) is not shocking as it is in line with the M&A assumptions we made in our 3D Systems valuation model last week (15x EPS) and will enable immediate (albeit very limited) EPS accretion.That said, 3D Systems will find it hard to impose its own design software standard as Cimatron is a niche player in an industry dominated by Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) and Dassault Systems (OTCPK:DASTY). Notably, Autodesk launched earlier this year an open-source software platform called Spark as it seeks to become the 3-D printing standard by offering free software to printer makers (see our May article). Autodesk's long track record in the design software business is likely to make Spark more reliable and more user-friendly than proprietary solutions and the open-source nature of Spark will save printer makers R&D costs. Hence, we continue to bet on the success of the Autodesk platform.If Spark enjoys wide adoption, it could transform printer makers into plastic box makers with much lower profitability numbers, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) did with PC makers 30 years ago.In all, 3D Systems has made a smart and necessary move but it's clearly too early to call the Cimatron acquisition a success.

2664305,22775,2014-11-10T09:48:08-05:00,"Q4 is expected to run smoothly but will deliver only 31% revenue growth at guidance midpoint, or 15-20% organic growth according to our calculations.
        Without saying a word, 3D Systems is gradually reducing its organic growth expectations that were closer to 30% earlier this year.
        HP’s entry into the industry will be an additional headwind in 2015-16.
        Consensus expects 3D Systems to deliver 42% EPS growth in 2015. In view of softening revenue growth and continued margin pressure, the downside risk remains significant.","3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) Q3 figures were globally in line ($0.18 EPS one cent above) with the forecasts provided in the recent warning. As we expected, organic growth was weak in the quarter at 12%, very slightly above the depressed Q2 level of 10% and a far cry from the 30% organic growth expected by the Street earlier this year, and gross margin fell 480bps year-on-year.When the company warned in late October, management blamed manufacturing capacity constraints for direct metal printers and the delayed availability of new consumer products. We were not convinced by these explanations as 3D Systems was well aware of its manufacturing capacity when it updated its guidance in late July and as the consumer segment is a very small business for now.We are still skeptical today. 3D Systems claims it brought online a second metal printers' manufacturing line and began shipments of its latest consumer printers but guides for only $204m revenue in Q4 or 31% growth at the midpoint of its guidance. This forecast suggests only 15-20% organic growth in Q4 vs. 28% in Q1 and 34% in Q4 2013 and strengthens our view that the company has been affected for months by either slowing demand or increased competition and that poor execution only added to 3D Systems' woes.Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) entry into the 3-D printing industry will be an additional headwind for 3D System's top-line performance going forward, as explained in our recent article (""3-D Printing: Could 2015Be Worse than 2014?""). Terry Wohlers' endorsement of HP's printers and HP's early engagement program (trial phase with key customers in 2015) suggest that many customers could delay their 3-D printer purchasing decisions ahead of the commercial release of HP's products in early 2016. We are not saying HP's products will necessarily be a hit, but that customers will probably hold off in the second part of 2015 until HP announces the pricing and full details and features of its 3-D printers in order to better compare the different products. In light of the expected HP disruption, we believe it's fair to assume organic growth will not pick up in 2015 and could even continue to decelerate, specifically in the second half of the year.In all, 30% organic growth is clearly a thing of the past and 15% is probably a more realistic assumption for the business. Assuming 15% organic revenue growth over coming years and slightly declining margins (continued margin pressures due to rising competition), EPS growth would stand at around 10% or 20-30% when factoring in potential contribution from acquisitions. Hence, the earnings downside risk remains significant as consensus currently expects 3D Systems to deliver 42% EPS growth in 2015."

Looking at the state of the 3D space, one might conclude DDD is a great buy given how far the stock has fallen. However, even using an optimistic Discounted Cash Flow (NYSE:DCF) model, it's clear DDD is fairly valued, at best, and, until the status quo changes, should not be owned.DDD Year to Date Total Returns data by YChartsDiscounted Cash Flow (DCF) ModelIn trying to value DDD, I used a DCF, or Discounted Cash Flow, model, which essentially estimates all future cash flows and discounts them to the present providing an estimated fair value for the company. While not perfect, DCF models give investors a ballpark of the price a company's stock should be trading at.1) I assume revenue growth for the coming years to be an average of almost 27%. I projected peak revenue in 4-5 years from now because it is clear 3D printing has a ways to go before universally adopted. Therefore, revenue growth has yet to peak. As Piper Jaffray wrote, SSYS shareholders should be patient, given how the entire industry is being forced to spend more than the industry is currently growing. The spending should pay off in a few years when demand accelerates, but for now investors cannot assume growth will outpace spending.2) The cost of capital, being very generous, is 7% on average over the next 10 years, using an industry beta of 1.3 and a cost of borrowing at roughly 6%. I also broke down revenues geographically to calculate the estimated market risk premium, which came out to ~5.75%3) These inputs result in a share price of $34.90, which is roughly 2.5% below Wednesday's closing price. Keep in mind this was using optimistic inputs, so the actual value could realistically be lower.Competitive OutlookHewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) confirmed it will enter the 3D printing industry. Within the last two weeks, the company elaborated on their plans for the 3D space. The announcement caused panic in the 3D printing industry, sending stocks down. Investors should already be concerned that there isn't enough demand for 3D printing (yet) and, given a formidable company has entered the sector, this should result in less demand for each existing company. Forbes summed up the announcement perfectly, saying the company's entrance could send rivals ""out of business.""Stratasys's Wednesday earnings report proved that such fears are not unfounded. Stratasys slashed full year guidance. As such, I would expect all 3D printing companies to struggle until the status quo changes. Given how SSYS is the dominant player in the industry, it is unlikely DDD will deliver significantly better results when it reports Monday. I would not consider a pullback a buying opportunity until the industry as a whole starts meeting expectations."
2615225,24849,2014-10-30T02:55:29-04:00,"Shares hit a new 52-week low after HP's announcement.
        Analyst estimates continue to drop after Q3 and 2014 warning.
        Short interest has recently declined off highs.
        Company's window to prove itself is closing fast.","About a week ago, I detailed the major warning from 3D printing company 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). The company issued preliminary Q3 results that were worse than expected, and lowered its forecast for 2014 as it was unable to meet customer demand. Shares dropped on the news, and they have continued to do so after a recent competitor announcement. Today, I'll detail how the company's window to prove itself is closing rapidly, and why investors need to be more cautious than ever before.Analyst estimates dropping:We're about a week past the company's big warning, and the actual earnings report won't be until November 10th. As you can most likely guess, analyst estimates have already started to drop. In the table below, I've tracked estimates for Q3, 2014, and 2015 since the company's Q2 report.The company stated that Q3 revenues would be in a range of $164 million to $169 million. The analyst average is still above the top end of that range, as not all analysts have adjusted their forecasts yet. On the estimates link I provided above, the high estimate is currently over $195 million. As more estimates change, the analyst average will hopefully drop into the company's range.The company also guided to non-GAAP EPS of $0.16 to $0.19 for the third quarter. Analysts are at $0.18 currently, so the average is within the company's range. Again though, there is a high estimate on the street of $0.21. There's obviously a better chance of a beat if the average comes down another penny or two.With the company already warning, investors and analysts might not really focus on the Q3 headline numbers. The Q4 guidance might actually be more important. Here's a summary of where analysts were for the December-ending quarter since the warning. Again, these EPS estimates are non-GAAP.You might be a bit worried that the EPS average has not dropped more than a penny despite the large drop in revenue estimates. I noted in my warning article that the company's full year EPS warning wasn't as bad as the revenue warning. This hopefully means that margins aren't doing as bad, but that means that there is more room to the downside for EPS estimates as opposed to revenue estimates. For the full year, the company expects revenues of $650 million to $690 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70 to $0.80. Analysts are at $676.90 million and $0.74, respectively.The big competitive announcement:Shares of 3D took another hit on Wednesday after an announcement from HP (NYSE:HPQ) on its new 3D printing tech. Here are the main points from the above linked Seeking Alpha market current:As a result of the HP announcement, it was a rough day for shares in the 3D printing space. The important part here is that these printers from HP won't be widely available until 2016, meaning there still is time for other names in the space to prove themselves. The good news, as Gartner projects, is that this space is expected to show rapid growth in the next couple of years. That means that there is probably room for a couple of names to co-exist.A decline in short interest:One of the reasons why I've followed 3D Systems is that short interest for the stock has been very high. In late August, I provided an update on why a squeeze was more likely. Of course, to get this squeeze, you need good news from the company, which we have not gotten lately. We have seen short interest come a little bit off its yearly high, as seen in the chart below.At the latest update, a little more than 33.7 million shares were short the stock, about 8.6% off the August peak. Still though, short interest is up nearly 22% over the past 12 months. If you use Yahoo's float number for the stock, roughly 32.2% of the float is short. That's still a very high percentage, meaning a squeeze remains possible. However, again, we need good news from the company for this to happen. Otherwise, you can see a short interest decline while the stock declines as short sellers take their profits, which at this point are adding up.Where do shares find support?It has not been a great 2014 for shares of 3D Systems. The first third of the year was very ugly, as you will see below. When I first started talking about a squeeze, shares were around $50, and they took off, rallying to the upper $60s. Since then, it has been another downhill ride. In the chart below, you can see the stock year to date against its bollinger bands.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)The stock was basically at its lower bollinger band at Wednesday's low, and shares did bounce a little as the day went on. Shares are currently near this level of support, but it would be nice to see this lower band start rising for true support to kick in. Yes, it would also be nice if the company doesn't disappoint on November 10th, because that should be the next true test for shares.Final thoughts:Shares of 3D Systems hit a new 52-week low on Wednesday after the big announcement from HP. While this seems to be a negative for 3D in the long-term, it may be a year or two before results could be impacted. Analysts have reduced estimates on 3D thanks to last week's warning, and we may see more declines into the company's November earnings report. With a large short interest number, I'm still a bit positive on the name, but the company needs to deliver. There will be no short squeeze if the news out of 3D continues to be negative."

These shocks can be both positive and negative and can disrupt the economy as well as the financial system, producing what legendary investor, George Soros, has called far from equilibrium situations.Introducing the positive Black SwanThese destabilizing and unpredictable shocks which create ""far from equilibrium situations"" are referred to by Nassim Taleb as Black Swan events. Black Swan events have three characteristics: they are extremely rare, extremely impactful and highly unpredictable. Most people discuss negative Black Swans, leading to financial market upheaval and economic as well as political havoc, but far fewer discuss what happens when positive Black Swans rear their heads.Great stock market bubbles typically involve a Black Swan technological breakthrough, which has broad implications spanning across many different industries. The new technology is always incredibly important, and because it was unexpected and market participants have no clear way of fully understanding the potential implications for the breakthrough technology, it leaves the doors wide open for speculation.-Stock Market Bubbles: Beware the Positive Black SwanIn a Seeking Alpha article from May of this year, I detailed three such Black Swan technological breakthroughs - the electricity, electronics and Internet booms. Please refer to that article for background. In this article, I consider a fourth...The 3D printing Black Swan technological breakthroughThe 3D printing industry carries all the potential markers for a positive Black Swan shakeup. It's a revolutionary technology still in its infancy. The future applications for 3D printing are still highly uncertain and varied. The trajectory this technology will follow is unpredictable. That being said, 3D printing is a rare breakthrough in the sense that, like electricity, electronics, or the Internet, it has the potential to reorganize the entire economy.It does not take a fantastic imagination to see how 3D printers - as costs come down and the technology rapidly improves - could reshape how manufacturing is done in the West. In the early days of computing, a computer cost millions of dollars and took up multiple rooms of storage. Not too long after, this technology was available for a few hundred bucks and could fit inside someone's pocket. If 3D printing follows a similar path (in terms of scope and speed of improvement) it could also completely transform home life. Imagine printing keys, locks, nails, door handles, cutlery, dishes, instruments etc.It is often said that once a new technology begins to really take off, people almost always overestimate its short-term impact and underestimate its long-term impact. This could explain why price-to-earnings ratios skyrocket to 100X+ (as investors overestimate the short term) and then plummet (as investors underestimate the long term). In the short term, people know the industry will be revolutionary, but they overestimate how the stock will fundamentally perform in the near future.The redeemer here is that 3D printing has not yet reached the masses in the sense that only early adopters currently own them. Perhaps when they become more accessible to the average person we will see the real boom in 3D printing stocks. But remember the lessons of history. Just because eToys.com went from $4 billion to $8 billion in the market (before completely collapsing) does not mean that eToys.com was ever actually worth $4 billion in the first place. Purchasing it at $4 billion would have worked out wonderfully as a short-term speculative gain, but terribly as a long-term investment holding.Innovation, competition and consolidation: Do you want to buy a lottery ticket, or a sound investment?The technology is still in its early infancy. 3D printers are going to change dramatically over the next several years as the technology is refined and improved. The big guys currently in the space are extremely likely to be displaced over the medium- to long-term. And, given sky-high valuations, reminiscent of dot-com stocks even with recent share price collapses, it's not a given any of the larger players will be acquired at current prices.Indeed a large player is already getting involved - Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ). HP intends to be a leader in 3D printing and is making substantial investments to bring a next generation 3D printer to market by 2016. Hewlett Packard's leadership has also explicitly stated that they wish to avoid large acquisitions in this space (likely due to the extended valuations as mentioned).Who's to say whether or not Hewlett-Packard will be successful? They have a competitive edge in the printer business and considerable resources, but haven't demonstrated themselves to be very innovative over the last several years. The key point here is that this is the start of larger tech companies entering the 3D printing space.There will come a time of incredible competition in 3D printing after the technology and profits start to accelerate and draw more tech firms into the space. Consolidation and destruction of the less capable and innovative firms will continue until clear industry leaders emerge. Until that point in time, it is nearly impossible to pick who the long-term winner of 3D printing will be. The industry is currently subject to speculative gambling. Automobiles revolutionized transportation, but that didn't stop hundreds of car manufacturers from going bust.Do you want to buy a lottery ticket, or a sound investment?In sum, due to the clearly exciting implications and potential of 3D printing, I believe many investors are falling prey to the cognitive bias of substituting the question of ""Is this an attractive investment?"" with the question ""Is this an attractive industry?"""
2667815,24849,2014-11-11T00:12:20-05:00,"Q3 revenues were in company's range.Non-GAAP EPS beat by a penny.2014 forecast reiterated.If this forecast holds, bottom could be put in.","On Monday morning, we received Q3 earnings results from 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). The 3D printing company had already warned for the quarter, so we had an idea of where things were headed. The company also reiterated its full-year forecast, which can be seen as a good sign because it wasn't a warning. Today, I'll recap the results and look at where the stock is now.Q3 ResultsA couple of weeks ago, 3D Systems announced a major Q3 warning on revenues and earnings, and lowered its full-year forecast. As a result, shares dropped and analysts quickly scrambled to lower their numbers. The table below shows a history of recent estimates with the last numbers being where estimates stood going into Monday's Q3 report.For the quarter, the company reported revenues of $166.9 million. Yes, that technically is a revenue miss of almost $1 million. However, I must note two items: First, the reported number was well within the company's lowered range of $164 million to $169 million. Second, a quick look at analyst estimates reveals that the highest estimate on the street was over $187 million. Obviously, there was at least one analyst who did not really revise his/her forecast after the warning. If you take out this high estimate, the company would have beaten by about $0.3 million.On the bottom line, 3D Systems reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.18, which beat the analyst average by a penny. This beat was well within the forecast of $0.16 of $0.19. 3D Systems also detailed that its order book increased by $14 million, or 44% sequentially, to $46 million, and included a $4 million increase in printer orders in hand compared to the second quarter book.2014 GuidanceThe company reiterated its full-year forecast for this year, detailed in the following guidance statement:In the table I included above, you can see that the analyst average for 2014 revenues is currently at $672.68 million. That's a little above the $670 million midpoint in the company's guidance. I would personally like to see the analyst average come down a bit more. Between the company's Q3 warning and the big miss in Q2, I'm not as confident as I used to be. An average of $660 million would be much easier to beat than one where it is currently. Analysts are at $0.73 for the full year, towards the lower end of the company's guidance, so I'm a bit more confident there.Repairing The Technical DamageThis stock has been hammered in recent months and that's probably not a surprise given two bad quarters. As a result, the stock's moving averages have been trending lower. In the chart below, you can see how the stock has performed against its 50-day moving average.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)DDD is still quite a bit under the moving average, which will be a line of resistance until we get a major breakout. The 50-day will continue to go lower for some time, and won't start rising unless this stock puts in a major bottom.Final Thoughts3D Systems reported Q3 results, and they were basically in line with what was expected after the company's quarterly warning. More importantly, the 2014 forecast was maintained. I see that as a good thing, given a number of warnings recently. This means that, presumably, the business has not deteriorated further. Shares have popped from their recent lows on the news, but have still been hit hard in recent months. It will take a lot to build technical support. Overall, this report was not bad, which given what has happened in recent months for this name, means it was rather good."

2586995,22775,2014-10-23T06:11:25-04:00,"As we expected, 3D Systems cut its FY guidance.
        We are not convinced by management’s explanations.
        Poor execution and financial communication (three warnings year-to-date) are likely to raise concerns about top management's grip on the business.
        We reiterate our negative stance.","Another quarter, another warningIn our recent articles on 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), we said that the company's FY14 revenue target was clearly at risk as it implied that second-half growth would accelerate to 40%-50% from 25% in Q2 despite tough comps (+50% growth in Q3 13 and +52% in Q4 13). Therefore, we are not surprised by 3D Systems' Q3 warning and FY14 guidance cut, with revenue and EPS now expected around $650-690m and $0.70-$0.80 respectively (vs. $700-740m and $0.73-0.85 previously).What is more surprising is the justification given by 3D Systems for this warning. Indeed, the company blames manufacturing capacity constraints for direct metal printers and the delayed availability of new consumer products. That's weird as 3D Systems was well aware of its manufacturing capacity when it updated its guidance in late July and as the consumer segment is a very small business for now. Contrary to 3D Systems' statement, we believe that demand is not that robust, that the company has been affected in recent months by either slowing demand or increased competition and that poor execution (regarding the production of metal printers) only added to 3D Systems' woes.Looking into the detailsThe two most important Q3 operating metrics were highly disappointing. According to our initial calculations, organic growth was probably in a 5-10% range in the quarter, in line to slightly below the Q2 level (that was already extremely weak). This is a far cry from the 30% organic growth expected by the Street earlier this year.And gross margin fell 400-500bps in the quarter. Even if part of this margin decline can be attributed to the above-mentioned manufacturing issues (adverse revenue mix, lower volumes), the gross margin trend has been worrying for several quarters now and suggests that the company's long-term earnings power will be much lower than initially expected. We have been highlighting this risk since the beginning of the year and our article ""Competition To Heat Up As Key Patents Expire, Earnings Risk On The Downside."" Our thesis is that the expiry of key patents between 2014 and 2017 is sparking increased competition and pricing pressures across the industry. Further, the consumer business takeoff is likely to put additional pressure on margins due to lower ASPs and intense competition from Asian low-cost printer makers.ConclusionWe have long been saying that analysts and investors need to revisit their long-term assumptions on the company. The time has come and the sell-side will probably slash 2015 revenue and earnings expectations today.Poor execution and poor financial communication (three warnings year-to-date) are also likely to raise concerns about top management's grip on the business. Against this backdrop, we would expect investors to remain on the sidelines for an extended period of time, until a potential management reshuffle.In all, we remain Sellers of the stock and will soon revisit our $26 valuation, which we set back in February when the stock was trading around $70."
2583105,24849,2014-10-22T09:52:46-04:00,3D warned for both Q3 and 2014.Company unable to meet demand.Hopefully this is a kitchen sink treatment.,"Last week, I detailed how 3-D printing company 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) was one of 5 tech stocks I was currently watching. Shares were near their 52-week low, and the company had just inked a new credit facility to provide funds for its growth strategy. I detailed how the highly shorted stock was looking for a reason to bounce, and that the Q3 report would be crucial after last quarter's flop. Unfortunately, things have did not play out as expected, so I must now cover the latest warning from the company.On Wednesday morning, the company pre-announced Q3 results and lowered its 2014 forecast. Here are the key details:These numbers were not good, as analysts were looking for $186 million in Q3 revenues and Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.21. In the pre-announcement, we got the following quotes from the company.Analysts were also looking for more than $707 million in revenues for the full year and $0.78 in non-GAAP EPS. We will certainly see a lot of revenue estimate cuts, although the earnings forecast isn't as bad as many may have expected given the large warning. Jim Cramer laughed at the above comments from the company, as the company seemed overly positive about not being able to meet demand. Obviously, there is a major issue here since this is the second large miss in a row.As a result, 3D shares dropped about 15% early in Thursday morning trading, and a new 52-week low was set just above $36 a share. This is a huge disappointment for this stock, which was in the highs $60s just a few months ago. While this is still a highly shorted stock, the shorts have definitely been winning lately. The company will issue final quarterly results on November 10th, and investors will need a better outlook from the company for shares to get back into the $40s."
2584195,22148,2014-10-22T13:14:08-04:00,3D Systems releases preliminary Q314 results.Investors should avoid the stock. .The original thesis warned investors to tread lightly into the stock until improved operations despite the more attractive valuation. .,"Prior to the open, 3D Systems (DDD) warned that Q314 numbers would fall far short of estimates. The company suggested that direct metal printer production failed to achieve scale. The news continues a pattern of the fast-growing 3D printer manufacturer disappointing investors.3D Systems forecasts that Q314 revenue will hit on average $166.5 million that compares unfavorably to the $186.0 million estimate of analysts. Worth noting is that the revenue is a sequential increase over the $151.5 produced during Q214. Also, the company reduced EPS estimates to the range of $0.16 to $0.19 with analyst estimates at $0.21. In the prior year period, 3D Systems earned $0.26. The company now expects only $670 million and EPS of $0.75 for the full year. The numbers are a large drop from the July 31 forecast of a revenue range of $700 million to $740 million and EPS of $0.73 to $0.85. The interesting part is that although the company dropped revenue estimates for the year by $50 million meaning that Q4 numbers will miss as well, the EPS numbers didn't plunge in the face of the huge miss. In fact, the updated high-end estimate of $0.80 exceeds analyst forecasts at $0.78. One has to wonder if 3D Systems is conservative enough with guidance considering the large revenue miss.The original investment thesis in the article ""Is Now The Time To Buy 3D Systems"" recommended that investors start looking at the stock. With the inability of the company to execute and meet guidance in the recent quarters, it was suggested that investors avoid the stock if it didn't hold technically back at the end of September. With the stock immediately failing technically and falling, even bullish investors should've had no more than a starter position at this time. Until operations turn around and the company starts meeting or exceeding forecasts, the stock should be avoided. With earnings estimates for the year below $0.80 and all of the operational issues, the stock isn't attractive until at least a drop to $30."
2556995,22775,2014-10-13T08:45:09-04:00,"Short interest was down 6% in late September.Since then, HP has announced its plan to become a major 3-D printing player.And a tricky Q3 report is just ahead.Short interest is likely to rise again. We reiterate our negative stance and $26 target price.","Is 3D Systems close to the bottom?After a 2% decline in early September, short interest in 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) dropped another 6% in late September to 33.63m shares (31% of the total number of shares and 32% of the float). This could suggest that some short sellers started to consider that the bottom was close as the stock price reached $45 vs. a $97 high early this year.As SA readers know, we have had since our February article a much more aggressive target price for 3D Systems ($26). We see no reason to change our mind as the competition risk keeps rising in line with our scenario. Notably, HP (NYSE:HPQ) announced last week its plan to become a major 3-D printing player (see our recent article).HP's entry into 3-D printing is obviously a major threat for 3D Systems and peers as the company has a large printing patents portfolio, a huge distribution reach (businesses and consumers) and claims it has developed a breakthrough 3-D printing technology. We reiterate that the expiry of key patents between 2014 and 2017 will spark increased competition and pricing pressures across the industry, with a significant impact on revenues and margins.HP and Q3 report are likely to raise short betsIn all, we believe that short interest is likely to rise again following HP's announcement. Many investors could bet that the unveiling of HP's 3-D printers will have a negative impact on 3D Systems if HP delivers on its ""breakthrough technology"" promise.Short interest could also pick up ahead of the Q3 report, which is likely to be seen as a major short-term risk. In a previous article, we explained that 3D Systems' FY14 revenue target ($700-$740m) implied that second-half growth would accelerate to 40%-50% from 25% in Q2... despite tough comps (+50% growth in Q3 13 and +52% in Q4 13). The company claims a record backlog, new product introductions and the contribution of new acquisitions. Fine, but the bar is nevertheless set extremely high at a time when industry conditions have become much tougher.If 3D Systems misses expectations in Q3 and/or is not able to materially improve its organic revenue growth after the Q2 disappointment (only +10%), investors will probably revisit their long-term assumptions on the company and put additional pressure on its valuation multiples."
2586915,40031,2014-10-23T05:22:47-04:00,"3D Systems announced disappointing preliminary Q3 results and full-year revenue guidance.
        The company is experiencing manufacturing constrains in its metal printer business and delayed availability of its new consumer products.
        Gross margin and non-GAAP EPS outlook are good considering the lower revenue outlook.
        Reducing my price target for 3D Systems on lower growth expectations.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) announced disappointing preliminary Q3 results and guided lower full year revenue and earnings. The company stated that the ""strengthening sales of the company's design, manufacturing and healthcare products and services were not enough to overcome the revenue shortfall from the continued manufacturing capacity constrains for its direct metals printers and delayed availability of its newest consumer products."" CEO Avi Reichental was disappointed with the company's failure to fully capitalize on the robust demand for its direct metal and consumer products during the quarter.The company also stated that the availability gaps have been closed and that the company began commercial shipments of its latest consumer printers. A new direct metal manufacturing line was brought online at the end of third quarter and management expects the growth rates to pick up in Q4 and beyond. The preliminary Q3 report implies 22.7% revenue growth rate at mid-point, which is the lowest since 2009. However, the growth in Q4 should pick up to 32% if we take the mid-point of the new full-year guidance.Another positive aspect of the announcement is the fact that the gross profit margin should remain flat sequentially despite the lower than expected revenue growth rates in Q3. The materials' gross profit margin rebounded in Q3 and the Quickparts' gross margin expanded sequentially despite the acquisitions in the quarter. Higher margins in materials and Quickparts and higher sales volume should offset the higher costs of investments, leading to flat gross margin in Q3. And if we dissect the non-GAAP EPS expectations for FY 2014, we can see that management expects some upside to the bottom line. If we take the mid-range of the preliminary Q3 report and the full-year non-GAAP EPS, we get to Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.26, which is 42% above the Q4 2013 level. This means that margins should start to expand in Q4 and beyond. These expectations are mostly in line with prior comments of 3D Systems' executives, as they stated that the margin headwinds should subside in the following quarters.Although there are some positive developments coming from the preliminary Q3 report, the revenue miss and lower guidance should put more pressure on 3D Systems' share price in the short-term. I previously stated in my Q2 update that investors should avoid 3D Systems and that the stock might revisit its early May lows and even go lower. I am reducing my price target on 3D Systems from $55 to $46 to reflect the lower expectations for 2014 revenue. Additional downside seems likely, and I would remain on the sidelines until we see some signs of improvement in the growth outlook. I would look for a potential bottom around $30 and I expect that the high short interest should offer some downside protection, as the shorts become satisfied with their gains and as the valuation becomes less inflated. I still prefer Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) over 3D Systems despite the sharp drop in 3D Systems' share price, as Stratasys has proved to be more efficient and focused with its growth efforts. On the bright side, 3D Systems' margin compression seems near its end, and margins might turn higher in Q4 and in 2015. Margin expansion and higher revenue growth going forward are the two things 3D Systems desperately needs to get back on the right track."
2550095,22775,2014-10-09T06:57:58-04:00,The new HP outlined plans to expand into 3-D printing and will soon have much more flexibility to make acquisitions.We believe that HP is more likely to focus on the acquisition of small 3-D players.And stick to our view that M&A is not a likely exit opportunity for 3D Systems shareholders.,"The announced split of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) could spark a new wave of M&A speculation around 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and peers, following previous rumors in early July and September.Indeed, as the new HP outlined plans to expand aggressively into 3-D printing and is set to become a standalone company with increased flexibility (more focused management, opportunity to fully use the balance sheet), many analysts and investors could assume that the PC and printer maker will try to speed up its expansion through acquisitions. Several SA readers have already commented about that on our previous articles.That would make sense. Nevertheless, we stick to our view (see our August and September articles) that 3D Systems will not be a takeover target for HP First, that would be a massive deal for HP, valued around $30bn according to initial analyst estimates and highly indebted (debt load of $19.8bn at the end of July), as in a takeover scenario, 3D Systems would probably be valued around $6bn at least ($5bn current market cap and 20% premium).And importantly, that would be a risky one as we suspect that 3D Systems would not be easy to integrate due to its M&A frenzy. We are pretty sure that HP executives still have in mind the $12bn acquisition of Autonomy which has been a nightmare and don't want history to repeat itself.Second, we struggle to figure out why large tech player such as HP or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) would spend billions to acquire 3D Systems as the barriers to entry are gradually coming down in the industry. Patent expiries make it cheap and relatively easy for any tech company to design a 3-D printer.Third, the financial benefits (EPS accretion, value creation) of such a deal are not obvious due to 3D Systems' high valuation multiples.ConclusionIn all, we believe that HP is more likely to focus on bolt-on acquisitions in order to expand its portfolio of technologies and that smaller companies such as Arcam (OTCPK:AMAVF), ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) and Voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET) could be potential targets.We reiterate that M&A is not a likely exit opportunity for 3D Systems shareholders and stick to our negative stance on the stock. We consider that the Street's expectations for 2015 (23% non-GAAP operating margin vs. 18% in 2014) are way too high in view of rising competitive pressure."

With shares of the 3D printing company losing almost half of their value this year, investors might be losing faith in the stock. In addition, with 38% of 3D Systems' share float short, it looks like there are many who are betting against the stock.The primary grouse is that 3D Systems has failed to deliver earnings growth, even though its revenue is growing at a solid pace. But, in my opinion, 3D Systems is doing the right thing by chasing revenue growth at this point in order to improve its standing in the 3-D printing industry, which is estimated to become as big as $16 billion in the next four years, growing at an annual rate of 45.7%. In order to capture a large size of the 3D printing industry, the company has focused aggressively on acquisitions.The good part is that 3D Systems' acquisitions are focused in the right areas, and they can help it deliver earnings growth in the future. Let's take a look.Why acquisitions are important for long-term growth3D Systems recently acquired Medical Modeling, which not only provides customized surgical treatment planning, but also offers personalized patient specific medical devices. Medical Modeling also provides complete 3D printing medical device capabilities that will improve 3D Systems' digital presence in the arena of personalized medical services. 3D Systems didn't announce for how much it bought Medical Modeling, but this acquisition can have far-reaching effects on the company's performance in the future if we consider the size of the medical 3D printing market.As per 3DPrint.com:Since 3D Systems gets almost half of its revenue from healthcare, this acquisition will power its largest revenue-generating segment higher going forward.In addition, 3D Systems has also acquired Simbionix in a deal worth $120 million. Simbionix provides 3-D virtual surgical simulation products. 3D Systems expects this acquisition to become profit accretive and add value to its overall growth. Simbionix is known for its synergistic technologies, and has a wide global sales channel with strong clinical relationships. 3D Systems believes that this characteristic will allow it to cross-sell its products and services more effectively, and further enhance the delivery of its 3-D printed procedures and medical devices. This strategic relationship will also improve its 3-D simulations, training, and virtual surgical planning platforms.Simbionix also has strong advanced product lines. According to management:More positivesApart from these acquisitions, the company is also working on boosting its 3-D production speeds on the back of advancement in its high speed fab-grade 3-D printer platform. In addition, development of conductive materials and related polymer are also expected to facilitate a comprehensively better platform for 3D Systems to offer fast services to many industrial and consumer goods companies.In addition, 3D Systems is planning to open a manufacturing facility in Rockville, South Carolina, to improve its manufacturing capabilities. 3D Systems expects this facility to start operations in the beginning of calendar year 2015.ConclusionThus, 3D Systems is making impressive moves. Though the company's bottom line isn't in the best shape now, it cannot be denied that it is moving in the right direction to capture a bigger pie of the growing 3-D printing market. Moreover, over the next five years, it is estimated that 3D Systems' bottom line will grow at an annual rate of 20%. So, as the acquisitions bed in and 3D Systems expands its reach in the medical market, its earnings performance should improve. Thus, it might be a good idea to buy shares of 3D Systems on the drop as the company can get better in the long run."

As we anticipated in our previous article, short positions were only slightly covered following recent takeover speculation, suggesting that short-sellers do not believe in the M&A scenario (short interest is just 3% below its record high). Indeed, a bid from a large tech player such as HP (NYSE:HPQ) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) does not make sense in our view. The barriers to entry are gradually coming down as patents are expiring, making it cheap and relatively easy for any tech company to design a 3-D printer. And from a pure financial standpoint, the benefits of such a deal would not be obvious as 3D Systems is trading at demanding valuation levels (38.5x 2015 EPS).Since our January article ""Competition To Heat Up As Key Patents Expire, Earnings Risk On The Downside,"" we have been Sellers of the stock, saying that the expiry of key patents between 2014 and 2017 would spark increased competition and pricing pressures across the industry, with a significant impact on revenues and margins. The fact that short interest is up 143% year-to-date and close to its record high despite M&A rumors and a -47% stock price performance suggests that many investors now share our view and do not feel comfortable with 3D Systems' organic revenue growth outlook. If 3D Systems is not able to deliver ~30% organic revenue growth in Q3 after the Q2 disappointment (only +10%), investors will probably revisit their long-term assumptions on the company and put additional pressure on 3D Systems' valuation multiples.Even if a short-term short squeeze is always possible, we believe that the impressive short interest does not bode well for the stock price. It suggests that investors have growing concerns about the company's outlook and valuation and that the stock price decline year-to-date does not yet fully capture fundamental issues. We reiterate our negative stance on the stock."
2522785,44981,2014-09-26T08:11:09-04:00,"The current short interest in DDD is close to all time high levels, and over 35 million share are sold short.Declining average trading volume means the short interest ratio/days to cover has gone up despite a fall in the overall short interest in the stock.There is a possibility of short squeeze happening as I believe the company will come out with better than expected results at the end of the next month.Full integration of Phenix Systems will allow 3D Systems to report impressive organic growth numbers.Unexpected contract from GM will also result in pushing the total revenues for the quarter up by about 2-4%.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) was one of the most actively traded stocks in the market - elevated levels of trading took the stock price to over $95 at the start of the year. However, since then, the stock has fallen considerably and currently trades close to $50 per share.Since the start of May, DDD has been range bound with a considerable level of volatility - the stock has been trading in a band of $45-65 over the last five months. During this time period, the company has come out with less than impressive financial results, which has played a role in keeping the stock range bound. Another interesting point to note here is that during the same time period, the short interest in DDD has been around its all time-high levels. The image below shows the short interest in DDD at September 15.Source: NASDAQAt the moment, the short interest ratio stands slightly below the levels at the end of the last month, showing that some short sellers have covered their positions. Nonetheless, the short interest still stands close to the all time highs for 3D Systems. There is another interesting factor to note here - the average daily volume has been falling steadily over the last two months and currently stands at the lowest level during the current year. On average, 2.5 million shares of 3D Systems are currently being traded every day. As a result, short interest ratio has gone up substantially and currently stands at the highest level over the last nine months. So, despite a fall in the short interest over the last 15 days, the ratio has actually gone up. Higher ratio should result in a quick short squeeze as the company come out with some positive news. At the moment, short sellers will need about 14 days to cover their short positions if the short squeeze happens.3D Systems has about 110 million shares outstanding and the majority of the float is held by institutions - over 52% of the total float is held by institutions - and the recent activity shows that the institutions are growing their positions. About 32% of the total float is currently sold short - this means that in case of a short squeeze, DDD stocks might not be easily available and demand might outweigh the supply by a large margin - if this happens, then the short squeeze will push the stock price up rapidly. Although the volume has been falling over the last few months, I believe a short squeeze might happen soon due to two reasons: First, the company will likely report better than expected results for the quarter at the end of the next month. And the second reason is that the use of 3D printing technology is continually growing in the manufacturing sector.3D Systems reported less than its targeted 30% organic growth figures at the end of the last quarter, which caused some panic in some sections of the market. For the current quarter, I am expecting the company to take its organic growth figures again close to 30%. The main reason behind this will be the full integration of Phenix Systems and the growth in the company's metal 3D printing. For a long time, 3D Systems has been portrayed as only being good in the consumer printing segment. However, full integration of Phenix Systems and increased use of its other industrial printers will show that 3D Systems is becoming a strong player in the professional market as well. I have explained the prospects of Metal 3-D printing here and 3D Systems' expansion in other segments here.Furthermore, there are rumors that 3D Systems has secured a contract with General Motors (NYSE:GM), worth $6-8 million - this contract is worth around 3.9-5.2% of the total quarterly revenues of the company. If this deal happens then we might see a positive surprise from the company. As I have said previously, the use of 3-D printers is growing rapidly in the manufacturing process, which bodes well for the company. Professional printing segment will be a key area of growth for the company as these printers are high-priced items and carry a larger profit margin.Bottom LineI believe the possibility is there for a short squeeze in 3D Systems over the next few weeks. The company is likely to report better than expected results as the growth in the professional printers segment as well as the Metal 3-D printing remains strong. Full integration of Phenix Systems will also push the organic growth numbers higher. All these factors can result in inducing a buying activity and pushing the short sellers to cover their positions. I also maintain my position that 3D Systems will prove to be a solid long-term investment, regardless of the short-term price fluctuations - and I believe the long-term pattern in price will be upwards."
2530425,22148,2014-09-30T05:51:24-04:00,Stock weakness combined with the passage of time makes 3D Systems more attractive.The scary chart of the past is now more reasonable for long-term investors.Investors need to confirm that Q2 earnings were indeed the trough with a large rebound in store for 2015 before the stock becomes an ultimate bargain.,"Over the course of this year, Stone Fox Capital has remained critical of the valuation of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). The stock of the 3D printing company reached a paramount valuation back in early January when this article suggested that a certain chart should scare investors. A follow-up article in March suggested the stock was still too high considering the focus on revenue growth and not profits.Now some six months later, 3D Systems is more interesting considering it trades near yearly lows. The valuation might remain a stretch, but the rising short interest and declining sentiment definitely makes the stock the most attractive it has been in years. Not to mention, a roughly 50% decline in a stock always helps out the valuation equation.Q3 Earnings Report PreviewA major factor in the stock slump is that despite forecasted Q314 revenue growth of 37.4%, analysts expect EPS for the quarter to drop to only $0.21. 3D Systems earned $0.26 in the prior year period. Analysts forecast that earnings in Q4 will return to growth. The forecast for $0.26 in Q414 will only return the company to the level earned back in Q313 prior to the present ramp up in spending that has reduced earnings and smashed the stock.A confirmation of the growth numbers places the stock back in play and makes the target for rebounding earnings in 2015 back to reality. Without at least stability in estimates and not an outright rebound, the stock is currently extremely expensive at 42x 2015 estimates that continue to collapse.Once Scary Chart Now Back To NormalThe previously scary enterprise value to revenue ratio is now back into normal growth levels. At the time of the original chart back in early January, 3D Systems was trading with an EV of nearly 20x trailing revenues. Competitor Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) offered the more compelling valuation on a relative basis. Now 3D Systems is actually the cheaper stock based on this ratio alone. DDD EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsStock Chart At Pivot PointAfter a couple of years of substantial gains, 3D Systems finds its stock in a precarious position. The stock is down 50% from the highs at the start of the year and it trades at major support levels. The below chart very much suggests that the stock could rally on a rebounding margin scenario or collapse if the numbers are missed and cut going forward.TakeawayThe key to these numbers and charts is that it only suggests that 3D Systems offers a decent value if the numbers due in fact turnaround. Investors no longer need the company to produce outsized growth to justify the stock price. At the same time, the chart is scary considering any disappointing numbers would see the market flooded with traders selling due to technicals. For those long-term investors wanting to get into the 3D printing sector now might be the time, but the best way to play it is with a starter position and the remaining held back to confirm the company is on solid footing with margins and earnings growth."
2529915,56262,2014-09-30T02:56:00-04:00,3D Systems has been on a terrible run in 2014 and I expect the downfall to continue.Acquisition spree will eat into 3D Systems' profits.The expiry of patents will add to the company's woes.Investors should stay away.,"Despite reporting strong growth in revenue and operating in an industry that's expected to become the future of manufacturing, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) shares have dropped tremendously this year. I've recommended investors to sell or short 3D Systems multiple times in the last few months. 3D Systems' share price has fallen consistently as investors seem to be worried about the company's ballooning losses and aggressive acquisitions, as these factors are dragging the company down.Expecting better times3D Systems recently announced that it would acquire Simbionix, a 3D virtual reality surgical simulation company, for $120 million in cash. This is expected to help the company to expand its presence in personalized medical services, and it is also the company's second-largest acquisition. Other acquisitions during the quarter included Medical Modeling, which added virtual surgical planning, guiding, and 3-D printing of medical devices to 3D Systems' portfolio.In July, the company commenced commercial shipments of its new CubePro printer and iSense scanner, and began shipping the new Cube printer in August. It expect these products, and additional new consumer products planned for later this year, to lead to better revenue in the second half of the year.A look at the problemsThere is no doubt that the 3D printing industry has a bright future, and that the company's 3D printers could deliver on volume expectations. But, the company will face tough competition as some key patents of the company have started to expire, and this will continue happening for three more years, affecting the average selling prices and the gross margin of 3D Systems.Not only did the company miss analysts' estimates last quarter, its stock also dropped because its organic growth and gross margin both fell short as compared to the prior year quarter. Organic growth came in at 10%, which is way less than 30% that was reported in the second quarter of the previous year, and certainly was below expectations. This decline in organic growth is blamed on the delay of some new product launches. The gross margin for the second quarter, as mentioned above, was down from 52.1% in the year ago quarter.Too many acquisitionsThe company still hasn't learnt from its mistakes, and has continued its acquisition spree. The company recently acquired metal 3D printing company LayerWise, in addition to Simbionix and Medical Modeling, for $120 million. This is not the first time that 3D Systems has acquired a company in the healthcare or metal printing space, and up till now, the company has been unable to successfully integrate those acquisitions into its core business. Another unsuccessful acquisition will increase the odds of 3D Systems missing the consensus estimates on earnings yet again.Moreover, the high number of acquisitions has destroyed shareholder value as 3D Systems' outstanding shares have doubled since 2011. The revenue growth hasn't resulted in any significant profits and I expect this trend to continue.Many research firms have realized this problem and have downgraded 3D Systems in the last few weeks. The company was hit with 4 downgrades when it misses the analysts' estimate on earnings in the last quarter and was further downgraded by Pacific Crest this month. The downgrades have taken a toll on 3D Systems' share price and I expect this trend to continue.ConclusionThere remain a very few options for 3D Systems to recover because even if the company delivers on revenue growth expectations, it will find it difficult to grow the EPS due to the money that it is burning on acquisitions.According to estimates, the company's bottom line is expected to decline 19% in the ongoing quarter and 8% this year. Additionally, the stock is expensive at 122 times last year's earnings. Since its earnings are expected to decline going forward, it doesn't make sense to invest in 3D Systems at such a high valuation. Hence, it will be wise to avoid this stock as more downside cannot be ruled out."
2496735,67473,2014-09-15T17:19:19-04:00,,"By Vikas Shukla3D Systems Corporation's (NYSE:DDD)'s Q2 results shocked most investors. The 3D printing company had been targeting 30%-plus organic growth rate. But organic growth plunged to just 10% in the second quarter. However, company management believes that it was a function of timing. 3D Systems CFO Damon Gregoire told Morgan Stanley analysts Scott Schmitz and Katy Huberty that he was confident the company would achieve a 30% organic growth rate over the next couple of years.3D Systems margins expected to improveMorgan Stanley analysts initiated coverage of the stock with an Equal weight rating earlier this month. Gregoire said at the International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago last week that new products, channel leverage and addition of metals to organic growth calculation should fuel growth in the current half of this year.Operating leverage also is expected to improve thanks to a rebound in the growth rate and controlled OpEx investments. The company spends 30% of its sales on OpEx. However, Morgan Stanley said the operating leverage improvement is already factored into expectations. Wall Street expects the company's Q3 and Q4 operating margins to come in at 19% and 20.8%, much better than 15.4% in the June quarter. Morgan Stanley expects OpEx investments to affect margin improvements in the long term.Execution risk remains high for 3D Systems3D Systems favors a broad product portfolio as there are different processes to serve different use cases. Overlapping technologies reduce the amount of required R&D compared to investing in many separate processes. Moreover, the company has an aggressive acquisition strategy. It usually targets early stage businesses that help it build vertical expertise. It may hamper short-term earnings but offers more favorable valuations in the long run.3D Systems' new product launches, broad portfolio and expanding distribution may help it grow. The company management's way of explaining its strategy makes sense. But Morgan Stanley analysts are skeptical about the acquisition success rate due to high execution risk.Sign Up For Our Free NewsletterDisclosure: None."

        Rising competition suggests that 3D Systems’ ASP and margins will keep going down.
        Consensus expectation of a strong operating margin recovery in 2015 (23% vs. 18% in 2014) is not realistic.","Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) announced yesterday that it would split into an enterprise solutions company (called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise) and a PC and printer business (called HP Inc.). According to the press release, 3-D printing will be an area of focus for the new HP Inc., confirming that the group plans to become a major player in the field. Meg Whitman announced a few months ago that HP researchers had developed a breakthrough technology expected to improve the quality of substrates used in 3-D printing (a positive for the quality of finished products) and to speed up the process. And more recently, it was reported that HP could disrupt the industry with 3-D printed glass.Admittedly, HP's June announcement/event about 3-D printing was cancelled and the company has not yet unveiled any 3-D printer. But things could change pretty soon as the new HP Inc. will have to ""sell"" an attractive equity story to institutional investors who are unlikely to be impressed with the growth outlook of traditional PCs and printers. We believe that HP's first 3-D printer presentation is just around the corner.We have been saying since our January article ""Competition To Heat Up As Key Patents Expire, Earnings Risk On The Downside"" that the expiry of key patents between 2014 and 2017 would spark increased competition and pricing pressures across the industry. HP's entry into 3-D printing is obviously a major threat for 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and peers as the company has a large printing patents portfolio, a huge distribution reach (businesses and consumers) and claims it has developed a breakthrough 3-D printing technology.We reiterate our view that the ASP of printers is likely to fall sharply in coming quarters, suggesting continued pressure on 3D Systems' gross and operating margins going forward: prices go down, but costs remain high due to continued marketing and R&D efforts.The Street expects 3D Systems' non-GAAP operating margin to recover significantly in 2015 (23% vs. 18% in 2014). This is not a realistic assumption in view of rising competitive pressures and we would expect consensus to keep cutting EPS forecasts. Assuming a flat margin in 2015, the stock would trade around 45x earnings. That remains extremely demanding and we reiterate our negative stance on the stock."

These movements were in stark contrast to Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), which has delivered outstanding growth rates in two quarters on high growth rates in all of the company's business segments. Although I was expecting Stratasys to outperform 3D Systems since early March 2014, I was not expecting to see 3D Systems' growth deteriorate in such a way, which prompted me to reduce my price target on 3D Systems to $55 after the Q2 earnings report. I continue to believe that Stratasys will outperform 3D Systems in the near term, and the only way to a higher share price for 3D Systems is for the growth to pick up significantly in the second half of the year, and for the growth rates to come closer or to exceed Stratasys' going forward.Deteriorating growth and margins lead the way to a lower share price3D Systems has delivered two disappointing earnings reports in the last six months. Revenue growth has decelerated from 52.4% in Q4 2013 to 44.7% in Q1 2014 and just 25.4% in Q2 2014, while the organic growth rate in Q2 was just 10% compared to 28% growth in Q1. Gross margin fell 370 basis points sequentially and 400 basis points year-over-year in the second quarter. The disappointments in the second quarter report were numerous, but management expects the growth to pick up in the second half of the year. On the bright side, backlog rose 29% sequentially to $31.9 million and healthcare revenue grew 46% year-over-year. 3D Systems continues to spend money on acquisitions, but the strategy is so far generating lower returns, and Stratasys has shown that its more concentrated approach is paying off quite better. In the table below, you can see and compare the main growth metrics to get a better sense of the execution of both 3D Systems and Stratasys in the first half of 2014.Source: Stratasys Q2 report, 3D Systems Q2 reportStratasys should continue to outperform 3D Systems unless growth picks up significantlyGiven the growth and execution in the first half of the year as well as future expectations, I continue to believe Stratasys should outperform 3D Systems in the near term. Previous earnings surprises also bode well for Stratasys, as the company is delivering on its promises, while 3D Systems has disappointed its investors in the previous six months. I do not expect this to change going forward, but there is one way for 3D Systems' share price to perform better in the rest of 2014. Growth needs to pick up significantly and to be above analyst expectations in Q3, and the company must provide a bullish Q4 revenue guidance. I would expect to see lower margin pressure in the second half of the year to get bullish on 3D Systems, since Stratasys has managed to sustain the margin pressure much better than its main competitor in the first half of the year. However, the higher than expected growth should not come as a consequence of the continued acquisition spree, and we need to see higher organic and services growth as opposed to higher growth based on acquisitions.High short-interest should help protect the downside3D Systems' short interest remains very high at 36.6 million shares (35% of free float), and it might help protect the downside going forward as the shorts might start to cover their positions if the price starts to go down. On the other hand, the high short-interest might serve as a significant catalyst for the share price if the company delivers what is needed for the share price to go higher in the near-term. Accelerating (organic) revenue growth, higher Q4 guidance and easing margin pressure might propel the share price higher, and high short interest should drive the higher demand for shares.ConclusionI continue to believe 3D Systems should underperform Stratasys in the near-term as the company's growth and execution is significantly lower and as its margin pressure is more pronounced. Accelerating organic growth and the end of margin compression in Q3 along with a better outlook for Q4 might prove to be a great catalyst for the share price in the next couple of months. However, given the poor execution in the first half of 2014, I believe that this scenario is less likely, but not impossible."
2490725,22775,2014-09-12T10:08:22-04:00,"Short-sellers did not take their profits in August after the Q2 earnings miss, suggesting that they expect more bad news in coming quarters.It looks like many investors now share our view that the expiry of key patents is sparking increased competition and pricing pressures across the industry.Recent takeover speculation is unlikely to spark a massive short covering, as short-sellers do not seem to believe in the M&A scenario.We reiterate our negative stance on the stock and our $26 target price.","Short interest in 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) remained close to its record high in late August, at 36.67m shares. This represents 33% of the total number of shares and 34% of the float. Year-to-date, short interest in the stock is up 150%. As we said in our previous article, short-sellers have not been tempted to cover their positions and to take their profits after the Q2 earnings miss. This clearly suggests in our view that they do not feel comfortable with the company's FY guidance and that they believe that 3D Systems is likely to keep missing expectations.Since our January article ""Competition To Heat Up As Key Patents Expire, Earnings Risk On The Downside,"" we have been Sellers of the stock, saying that the expiry of key patents between 2014 and 2017 would spark increased competition and pricing pressures across the industry, with a significant impact on margins and earnings. The fact that short-sellers do not cover their (impressive) positions while the stock is down 43% year-to-date suggests that many of them now share our view. Recent takeover speculation has probably sparked some short covering in early September but we would not bet on a material impact. There was already takeover speculation in late June and that did not prompt any short covering (mid-July short interest was flat vs. mid-June). This suggests that short-sellers do not believe in the M&A scenario. As we explained in a previous article, we struggle to figure out why a large tech player such as HP (NYSE:HPQ) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) would try to acquire 3D Systems. The barriers to entry are gradually coming down as patents are expiring, making it cheap and relatively easy for any tech company to design a 3-D printer.

2495815,68535,2014-09-15T12:06:07-04:00,"Forecasts for 3D printing market growth and opportunity vary widely across market research firms and analysts.3D Systems is pursuing an aggressive growth strategy through numerous acquisitions aimed at covering all market opportunities that are emerging in 3D printing.Even if the success of current strategy will secure 3D Systems a significant role in the 3D printing market, the stock price is currently overvalued.","Introduction3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) is ""a leading provider of 3D printing centric design-to-manufacturing solutions including 3D printers, print materials and cloud sourced on-demand custom parts for professionals and consumers alike in materials including plastics, metals, ceramics and edibles."" (definition from 10-K).The market for additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing market, as it is commonly named, has experienced tremendous growth in recent years and looks poised to continue the trend.In a recent article published by Forbes a list of market forecasts and estimates for 3D printing by market research firms, equity analysts, wealth management firms and 3D printing companies is presented.The forecasts provided by these firms vary widely with expected global AM market compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the next years ranging from 45.7% (according to Canalys) to 18% (according to JP Morgan) and expected market size for 3D printing products and services by 2020 ranging from $7 billion (JP Morgan) to $10 billion (Wohlers Associates) up to the most bullish forecast of $21.3 billion (Morgan Stanley).Growth StrategyThe growth strategy of 3D Systems Corporation is focused on five main strategic initiatives (source 10-K):In the last 4 years, 3D Systems pursued its growth strategy through an aggressive acquisitions campaign, investing more than $650 million and acquiring more than 35 companies. This allowed 3D Systems to achieve a CAGR during the period of over 40% (effect of organic growth included). The numerous acquisitions range from start-ups to more established businesses, operate in different sectors (from aerospace to healthcare) and focus on different market segments (professional, industrial of consumer).To simplify the analysis of the long list of acquisition, their fit with the five main strategic initiatives, and the identification of the area of revenue contribution within the company, I have listed in the following tables (one table for each year) the various acquisitions highlighting the class of product and service revenue (in the columns) into which the acquired operations have been integrated.Each single acquisition in the tables is also mapped to the strategic initiative to which it relates (color code).(Source of the information reported in the tables: 3D Systems 10-K reports)Year 2014In 2014 (year to date), 3D Systems performed a total of 8 acquisitions for a net consideration of $189 million (partial value as for many acquisition the terms of the transaction were not disclosed).Five of the acquisitions were related to expanding global Quickparts services, two of the acquisitions were related to healthcare solutions, and one acquisition was related to building 3D consumer and retail products and services.Year 2013In 2013, 3D Systems acquired eleven businesses for a net consideration of $179.6 million.Four of the acquisitions were related to accelerating 3D printer penetration, three of the acquisitions were related to building 3D consumer and retail products and services, two of the acquisitions were related to expanding the global Quickparts services and two acquisitions were related to reinventing the engineer's desktop.Year 2012In 2012, 3D Systems completed nine acquisitions for a net consideration of $191.4 million.Two of the acquisitions were related to Quickparts services, three were building blocks for the consumer growth initiative, two acquisitions were related to accelerating 3D printer penetration, one was related to healthcare solutions and one was related to reimagining the engineer's desktop.Year 2011In 2011, 3D Systems acquired twelve businesses for a net consideration of $90.65 million.Five of the acquisitions were related to global Quickparts services, four were related to building 3D consumer and retail products and services and three acquisitions were related to accelerating 3D printer penetration.From the analysis of the tables, it clearly appears that 3D Systems tried with its acquisition approach to secure a presence in every market of the 3D printing business that is emerging.While this type of strategy will pose challenges in terms of integration of the numerous businesses acquired, it should be noted that the level of overlap among the businesses is very limited, either because they operate in different geographies or because they operate in different market segments, thus mitigating the risks of integration failure.Besides the aforementioned risk, which has already been analyzed by analysts and discussed in various articles, I wish to highlight that many of the acquired businesses are start-ups or companies in the early stages of the life-cycle and to achieve growth in future years, in their respective geography/industry, they will require additional investments.Due to the unavailability of detailed financial data on each single business acquired, it is impossible to calculate their value (through a DCF model) and thus determine if they represented, at an individual level, an appropriate use of capital by the company.It is worth noting that all these acquisitions are creating a substantial amount of goodwill on the books, rising considerably the possibility of impairment charges in case of failure in the execution.Additionally if the returns on the acquisition investments will not be higher than the cost of capital generating extra-profits during the growth phase, we will have a clear case of suboptimal use of capital by the company.Intrinsic ValuationFor the calculation of the intrinsic value of 3D Systems, I used a discounted cash flow (NYSE:DCF) model to determine the value of the operating assets.The value of equity in common shares is then obtained by subtracting the debt and the minority interests, and by adding the cash (estimated value as of today) to the value of the operating assets.Dividing the value of equity by the number of shares outstanding provides the value per share for 3D Systems.Hereafter are described the assumptions underlying the model.Base year dataThe following table provides the base year operating data obtained from last year 10-K by subtracting the values for the first six months of last year (10-Q June 2013) and adding the values for the first six months of this year (10-Q June 2014).Revenues growth ratesGiven the wide range of forecasts regarding growth rates and market size for 3D printing in future years, I will calculate the intrinsic value under two scenarios, a best case scenario (Scenario 1) and a more conservative scenario (Scenario 2).In Scenario 1, represented in the table below, I assume the most optimistic forecasts for the 3D printing market with a CAGR close to 45% (Canalys) and a market size by 2020 of around $20 billion, which is close to Morgan Stanley forecast.In this scenario, I assume that 3D Systems will maintain through the years a global market share of around 20% (calculated using the market size estimate by Wohlers for 2013).This is an optimistic assumption as the 3D printing industry does not have strong barriers to entry and other players from the computer peripherals or the manufacturing industries could enter the market increasing the pressure on 3D Systems' revenue growth and margins.In Scenario 2, represented in the table below, I assume a CAGR of 18% for the 3D printing market in the next few years, leading up to a market size of around $8 billion, which is close to JP Morgan forecast.This is definitively not a worst case scenario, but a more conservative one as it still assumes some healthy growth rates for the market.In this scenario, I assume that 3D Systems will maintain a high revenue growth rate, though lower than the previous scenario.This is still an optimistic assumption, in light of what was noted previously, as the CAGR expected in this scenario will allow 3D Systems to increase its market share from 20% to 25% in a ten-year period, thus assuming that the competition will not heat up so much in the sector.Pre-tax operating marginThe pre-tax operating margin in the base year is 18.01%, this value has been calculated using the adjusted EBIT that takes into account the capitalization of R&D expenses and future operating lease commitments.I assume that as 3D Systems evolves towards the stable growth state, the operating margins will tend to decrease towards the industry average, which is currently 15.88% in the US.The margins of 3D Systems have already shown a decreasing trend lately and as competition in the industry heats up fueled by the entrance of new competitors, and in the absence of strong barriers to entry pressure on prices and margins will further increase.Cost of capitalTo determine the initial cost of capital, I used a risk free rate of 2.55%, a beta of 1.50 (higher than the industry average of 1.28, but lower than the regression beta of 3D Systems of 2.21) and an equity risk premium (ERP) of 5.66%, the latter calculated weighting by the revenues the ERPs of the geographical areas in which 3D Systems operates.The pre-tax cost of debt used in the valuation is 6.91% (same as in last 10-K).(Debt includes present value of operating leases)As per the table above, the initial cost of capital used in the DCF model is 11%, which is a fairly moderate value for a growth company like 3D Systems.In the DCF model, I assumed that this initial value for the cost of capital will gradually decrease, as the company grows and makes the transition to the stable growth phase which is characterized by a lower risk, converging to a value of 8% (the average for the industry).R&D costsIn the model I have capitalized R&D expenses with an amortization period of 3 years.(dollar values in the following table in millions)The result is a positive impact on the operating income (EBIT) in the base year of plus $42.64 million.Other assumptionsThe sales-to-capital ratio, which I used to estimate the reinvestment needs each year based on the expected revenue growth, is very low in the base year (1.11) compared to an estimated industry average of 2.45 in the US.The difference is due to the intensive use of capital during the recent acquisition spree of 3D Systems, which still has to translate into higher revenues.To allow for the materialization of the benefits of past acquisitions, in terms of higher revenues, I assumed that the Sales/Capital ratio will gradually increase till reaching a value of 5 (typical of industries with low capital needs). This is a really strong assumption as with it I am incorporating into the model an ever more efficient use of capital by 3D Systems, in relation to revenue generation, till reaching a value in year 10, which is more than double an estimated industry average of 2.45.Through the previous assumption I also allow the after-tax return on capital invested (NYSE:ROC) to increase from the value of the base year (<12%) to an estimated industry average of 29.7%, which is reached in the stable growth phase.The growth rate in the stable growth is set equal to the risk free rate (2.55% as of 09/11/14).The Results - Scenario 1(base year EBIT adjusted for capitalization of R&D expenses and operating leases)In this scenario, the estimated value per share is $39.25, which is 25% lower from the closing price of $52.79 (as of 09/11/2014).This is an extremely optimistic scenario as it assumes that the 3D printing market and 3D Systems will keep growing at explosive growth rates in the next years, that 3D Systems will be able to maintain a healthy operating margin and pricing power, and that it will use capital in an ever more efficient way.The Results Scenario 2(base year EBIT adjusted for capitalization of R&D expenses and operating leases)In Scenario 2, the estimated value per share is $24.77, which represents a downside greater than 50% from last closing price provided before.This scenario has been defined ""conservative"" in the sense that it foresees more moderate growth rates for the market and 3D Systems in future years while keeping many of the optimistic assumptions of the previous scenario.ConclusionThe 3D printing market is an extremely innovative and interesting space that has experienced and will continue to experience tremendous growth in future years.3D Systems is currently one of the leaders of the sector and is working to secure a foothold in all the growth areas that are emerging.Despite the enormous opportunities there seems to be a clear disconnect between the price that the market is currently giving to 3D Systems and its intrinsic value.Under both an extremely aggressive best case scenario (where everything has to go right) and a more conservative (but always optimistic) scenario, the shares of 3D Systems look overvalued with the potential downside ranging from 25% to 50%."
2489015,62463,2014-09-11T16:47:57-04:00,"While definitely a technology lover, this columnist is often bemused by the hype surrounding technology launches and;The financial media’s focus on the medium-term outlook for the shiny new thing.As Warren Buffett and others have noted, many industries that disrupted the status quo didn’t make much money for their shareholders.","By Steven CarrollWhile the headlines are dominated by Apple's new payment solutions, watch and the iPhone 6's giant, Samsung-killing screen, we thought we'd focus on another fascinating part of the technology space - 3D printing and 3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD). This Rock Hill, S.C.-based holding company makes 3D printers, print materials and on-demand custom parts services for professionals and consumers. It also offers creative content development and design productivity tools.Yin/yangLooking at the chart, it's clear that the company has already gone through a full cycle of elation/deflation. From its peak in the high 90s, the stock now hovers around $50. That, by the way, leaves the five-year return for shareholders at a cool 1,706% (it was over 3,000%). Hedge funds are still obviously skeptical of the opportunity - DDD is in the bottom 1% on the StarMine short interest model - which is a measure of reported short positions in the marketplace, accounting for the free float and potential for a short squeeze.Watch those expectationsOther factor models are also suggestive of extreme caution - analyst sentiment is deteriorating (admittedly from a euphoric starting point), valuation multiples aren't yet compelling (P/E chart below) and the market is implying a five- year EPS growth rate of 27.7% over the next 5 years. In the context of its trailing five-year performance of 131%, maybe that's achievable, but it certainly is a hurdle that needs careful monitoring. As a reminder - that's the threshold for the current stock price to be ""fair."" In order to be a shareholder, you should be hoping for higher returns than that.Margin problemsRecent market focus has been on disappointing margins. As seen below, operating and net margins have declined sharply and are now below industry levels (the thin lines). Gross margin remains above the industry level.Circling sharksFrom a quantitative perspective, the company certainly has some red flags at the moment - poor analyst revisions, a challenging valuation both compared to its own history and from a fair value perspective. The hedge funds are smelling blood.When one adds the qualitative challenges - declining margins and the execution risk of ingesting recent acquisitions - it's clear that more is required than simply being a leading player in a fast growing industry segment. We understand the desire to own the ""new new thing"" but perhaps the investor should wait for further disappointment before seeking an entry.After all, the Sage of Omaha has noted that net wealth creation in airlines since Orville Wright has been zero and out of dozens of U.S. auto companies, there now remain only three. The lesson? ""Investors would have had to not only identify the right companies, but also identify the right time."""
2485895,71095,2014-09-10T17:38:14-04:00,"3D Systems released desktop 3D printers in 2013.3D Systems is increasing focus on metals, following the Phenix Group acquisition.3D Systems is expanding and diversifying, representing the entire 3D printing market.","3D Desktop Printing:The global 3D printing market is projected to grow from $2.2 billion in 2012 to $11 billion in 2021, a 19% compound annual growth rate. 3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD) is trying to capture as much of a share of that as possible. Goals have been to produce 3D printers from the personal desktop size of the Cube 3 (6x6x6 in3) all the way to sizes that can be used in factories, like the ProX 950 (59x30x22 in3). Not only does DDD offer a wide variety of printer sizes, but also its printers can produce objects made out of metal, plastic, ceramics and even sugar. 2013 was a huge year for 3D printing, with DDD climbing 100%, competitor Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) rising 65% and smaller industrial printer Exone Co. (NASDAQ:XONE) ending the year up 128%.DDD data by YChartsConsumer printing drove some of the most publicized 3D printing news. SSYS purchased MakerBot in 2013, obtaining the Replicator printer line to compete with DDD Cube line. DDD countered by partnering with Staples Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLS) in May 2013 to distribute Cube line desktop 3D printers, and in April 2014, SPLS placed 3D printers in two locations in Los Angeles and New York City.Metals and Beyond:Although consumer 3D printing was very popular among investors in 2013 and has great future potential, DDD is focusing on other areas as well. From the end of 2013 until now, DDD has been building up capabilities for metal 3D printing. Demand for metal printing grew 76% in 2013, driven by large orders from companies like General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE) to produce parts for its aviation division for the LEAP aircraft engine. With the acquisition of Phenix Systems in June of 2013, DDD gained systems that were able to print in metals. Being able to print in metals increased DDD exposure to the aerospace and medical industries. Earlier in 2014, DDD announced the acquisition of Medical Modeling Inc., a firm specializing in custom surgical equipment and medical devices. The Medical Modeling acquisition further extended the DDD reach into the medical industry, where it could apply its direct metal printing to the $135 billion medical equipment market.Extending Manufacturing and Services:This year, DDD also acquired several companies to extend its services' reach. Announced in August, DDD acquired American Precision Prototyping and American Precision Manufacturing to expand aerospace capabilities. To further expand the manufacturing reach, a new 200,000 square foot manufacturing/distribution facility in South Carolina is being constructed, expected to be operation in 2015. To further underline DDD's expansion into metal printing and manufacturing/services, in September, the acquisition was announced of the Belgian metal printer/service provider LayerWise, a provider of equipment to medical, dental and aerospace customers. LayerWise machines are capable of delivering 99.98% part density, which is important for metal manufacturing, since higher densities bring higher strength, and can be produced from lower-weight materials such as titanium or various metal alloys like the Inconel alloy made with varying compositions of nickel.Future Growth:DDD obtains most of its revenue from either products or services. Q2 2014 brought in $150 million in revenues, up 25% from Q2 2013. In Q2 2014, $100 million was attributed to products, up 20% year-over-year, and in Q2 2014, $50 million was from services, up 37% year-over-year. Services are expanding quickly in the present, due to lack of expertise in 3D manufacturing. During 2013, services brought in $157 million, 27% over the year. Were services to continue growing at that rate, 5 years from now, DDD might bring in as much as $650 million.Source: DDD, Chart by AuthorIt is easier for a company to pay another company to manufacture products by 3D printing in the short term than it is to have employees learn 3D printing and purchase machines for them to use. This will likely change as 3D printing becomes more widespread, causing printer sales to grow faster. The market for printers is projected to grow at a 50% compound annual growth rate through 2018, while services are projected to grow at 44%. Growth prospects for both are robust, and DDD maintains a balance between products and services.Printing Partnership:In November of 2013, DDD announced a partnership with Motorola to manufacture phones for Project Ara, which includes the manufacture of modular smartphones. The project continued with Google (GOOG, GOOGL), after Google sold Motorola in January 2014. The DDD partnership is to manufacture and mass produce modules that can be interchangeably inserted into a smartphone to customize it to the user's preferences. To produce large amounts of modules and prepare to make many varied features, such as colors of materials or even textures, DDD developed a continuous printing method which is fast and geared well toward mass production. When an object is being printed in 3 dimensions, the printer jet generally will speed up or slow down material deposition, in order to give a greater degree of precision and structural cohesion. Continuous printing allows objects to travel along a conveyor belt, where they are exposed in turn to printer jets, each of which do a particular task. Because the printer jets no longer need to change speeds, the process is faster overall. Continuous printing has the same potential to improve manufacturing as Henry Ford's assembly line transformed mass production. Manufacturing modules for smartphones is a proving ground for technology that can be used for much larger things like cars in the future.Final Points:DDD has further branched out from the consumer printing popularized last year. With acquisitions, it has expanded to metal 3D printing to allow access to the aerospace, medical and dental markets. Further acquisitions have expanded the DDD reach into services and manufacturing. One such high-profile manufacturing partnership is with Google working on Project Ara. Set to launch in early 2015, the success of project Ara would greatly help DDD moving forward. However, DDD is still set to benefit, even if Project Ara doesn't please consumers. The continuous printing being used during Project Ara can be adapted for other manufacturing projects, eventually other machines, or tools or even cars.Pacific Crest downgraded DDD in early September 2014, citing the numerous acquisitions as weakening DDD. However, it can be said that it is the acquisitions that strengthen DDD by allowing it to cover so many areas. Acquiring other small companies, DDD can get a start on diversifying into a new area by gaining personnel that are skilled in the area. When DDD purchased Phenix Systems, a solid platform of metal printing was acquired, which DDD has since used to expand into metal printing for the aerospace and medical industries. The many facets of DDD help it to represent the entire 3D printing industry. Investors looking for an entry into the 3D printing market should take long positions in DDD, to gain exposure to the entire spectrum of the 3D printing market. For investors buying shares of multiple 3D printing companies, DDD is a good long-term cornerstone due to its large comparative size and diverse product/service offerings. As the 3D printing market grows, DDD is positioned to grow along with it."
2456005,24849,2014-08-28T01:02:41-04:00,"Short interest hit another new high in mid-August.More than 35% of the float now short.Additionally, days to cover ratio at new high.Possibility of a short squeeze has increased further.","Over the last couple of months, I've been detailing the possibility of a short squeeze for shares of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). With a short interest number that continued to rise, it seemed as if the next piece of good news would send shares rocketing higher. Well, we just received the mid-August update on short interest, and the data makes the long case even stronger now. Today, I'll detail why the chance of a short squeeze has increased to its highest level yet.First, let me discuss the latest update on short interest. As you probably saw in my summary points above, another 52-week high was reached. Short interest increased by more than 800,000 shares in the first half of August, putting the total at nearly 36.9 million. While this was only a 2.22% rise from the previous number, short interest is now up 31.42% in the past year and more than 150% so far in 2014. You can see this dramatic rise in the chart below.So with the rise in short interest, the percentage of the stock's float short has also risen a bit. More than 35% of the reported float number is now short, a staggering amount for those that follow highly shorted names. I usually start talking about the possibility of a short squeeze once we hit the 20% of float number, and this name has blown well past that.Obviously, a rise in short interest is one factor in determining the possibility of a short squeeze. As short interest rises, the possibility of a squeeze does as well, holding all else equal. But there is a second factor in play, and that is volume. If volume is high, a name like 3D Systems may not see a squeeze because shorts can cover very quickly. The best way to detail this is the days to cover ratio, which measures how many days it would take all shorts to cover. Generally speaking, if the days to cover ratio is in the low single digits, a short squeeze isn't as likely. But when the days to cover gets into the high single digits or even double digits, it starts to be a bit more meaningful.Well, as you can see in the ""latest update"" link above, the days to cover ratio also hit a new 52-week high in mid-August. The ratio stood at 11.80, which means it would take nearly 12 full days of trading volume for all shorts to cover. Part of the rise in the days to cover ratio has to do with the increase in short interest, but it also is due to a decline in volume. Volume in the second half of the month hasn't been spectacular, so we could see another new high in the days to cover ratio at the end of August, even if short interest decreases.For now though, the possibility of a short squeeze in 3D Systems has certainly increased. Not only is short interest at a new high with more than 35% of the float short, but the days to cover ratio has jumped into the double digits. At this point, one piece of good news from the company could send short sellers into a world of pain, and that could lead to a large rally in shares. It was just a few months ago when shares rocketed higher in an apparent squeeze, and the next one could be even more powerful thanks to the latest numbers I've discussed today."
2481475,44981,2014-09-09T11:53:47-04:00,"Metal 3-D printing segment recorded a growth rate of 76% during 2013, making it the fastest growing segment of the 3-D printing industry.Expensive nature of metal printers makes it possible for 3-D printing companies to have higher margins in this segment.3D Systems has been trying to expand this segment in the past with Phenix Systems acquisition and now with LayerWise.LayerWise acquisition will add to both the industrial as well as the medical segment of the company.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has been quietly adding to its metal 3-D printing segment in order to complement its already strong 3-D printing product portfolio. Direct Metal 3-D printers is one the key growth areas of the company. Previous acquisitions in this segment will be adding to the organic growth of the company from the current quarter. At the same time, 3D Systems is not sitting idle and the company is making further acquisitions in this area. Recently, 3D Systems added LayerWise to its direct metal 3-D printing segment, which will further enhance its portfolio. We have discussed different aspects of the company's business in our previous articles; however, in this article, we will focus on the direct metal 3-D printing and how it will be important for the future growth of the company.3D Systems: Strengthening its Metal SegmentThe metal 3-D printing segment has evolved significantly over the last few years and is anticipated to increase to nearly $700 million by the end of 2016. The evolution of development in the metal 3-D printing has enabled the technology to improve and become widely accepted as a complement to conventional manufacturing processes. Further, its demand will continue to increase, as manufacturers are willing to bring this technology to mainstream - General Electric (NYSE:GE) is using more than 300 metal 3-D printing systems in order to make aerospace equipment.3D Systems has a growing portfolio of metal 3-D printing systems using direct metal sintering [DMS] technology. The company has grown its metal 3-D printing segment by acquiring Phenix Systems, a leading global provider of Direct Metal Selective Laser Sintering 3-D printers, in the last year. The acquisition also enabled 3D Systems to launch the latest product in metal printing, the ProX Series, which has rapidly expanded its DMC 3-D printers family. The ProX Series is specifically designed for the most demanding manufacturing floor conditions, delivering high-density, precise 3-D printed parts in a wide range of metals including steel, titanium alloys and aluminum. Further, the company exited the first quarter of the current year with $28.8 million of backlog, reflecting the increased demand for the Direct Metal 3-D printers, which continues to outperform the manufacturing capacity.Metal 3-D printing Systems - An Overview of the SectorNow that the demand for 3-D printed products is rising, the related companies are testing a variety of different variants to be used in additive manufacturing. Bigger industry players are also using the 3-D printing systems as prototyping and the technology has now started to move into factories. According to McKinsey Global Institute research, the demand for metals, used in 3-D printing increased to $32.6 million compared to about $12 million in the last year. Further, the sales of 3-D printers that can use metals jumped 76% in the last year, outpacing the total demand for the systems. This increasing demand of metal 3-D printing has also attracted the metal mining companies, which are backing 3-D research projects in different capacities. This will lower the prices of materials used in the process and enable the industry to grow at substantial rates.LayerWise Acquisition3D Systems has recently taken another step in the booming metal 3-D printing segment. The company announced to acquire LayerWise and enhanced its position in the advanced metal 3-D printing sector. LayerWise is a Belgium based company and it exclusively focuses on the additive manufacturing process for metal parts. The company has its own line of proprietary direct metal laser sintering technology and has a history of designing and building its own direct metal 3-D printers. However, the company was also involved in the development of selective laser melting [SLM] technology, which unlike selective laser sintering [SLS], allowed denser and less porous outputs. This also enabled LayerWise to yield 99.38% part density in its metal prints, which allowed the company to gain significant market share. The company is mainly focused on healthcare and aerospace industry and produces orthopedic, dental and spinal implants along with metal alloy parts for aerospace engines.Implications for 3D Systems3D Systems has been trying to increase its sales through expanding its international exposure and has also been acquiring companies in other regions in order to achieve this goal. The acquisition of LayerWise will benefit 3D Systems in accelerating sales of its metal 3-D printing systems through complementary sales channels and also enable it to expand its IP technology platform by adding SLM technology. The takeover should also enable 3D Systems to achieve the first mover advantage in providing direct metal printing to high-growth areas such as aerospace, automotive, and healthcare markets. Further, the acquisition will also boost the services revenue of the company.LayerWise operates under three segments: Industrial Division, Medical Division, and Dental Division [DentWise]. 3D Systems has been trying to capture the medical and dental market through acquisitions and this acquisition will further enhance the company's position in this segment. This acquisition serves two purposes for the company by growing its industrial as well as the medical segments.Why is There Increased Focus on Metal 3-D printing?Metal 3-D printers are used mainly for industrial purposes by the manufacturing sector - these printers are expensive and individuals do not opt for these systems. Being an expensive product, these printers bring in high-margins for the 3-D printing companies. 3D Systems is focusing on this segment because it is showing massive growth potential. According to the Wohlers report, this segment grew by about 76% during the last year - a total of 348 3D metal printers were sold during the last year, compared to just 198 in 2012. The image below shows the trend in 3-D metal printers sold.The growth in the segment is evident from the image - also, the high margin involved in this segment makes it extremely attractive for the 3-D printing companies.Conclusion3-D printing industry is still growing at a rapid pace; however, direct metal printing is going to be an extremely attractive segment in this rapidly growing industry. We believe 3D Systems' recent acquisitions will allow the company to have a better position in this segment and grow substantially. During the second quarter, 3D Systems reported a decline in the organic growth rate; however, as Phenix Systems will be completely integrated by the third quarter results, we believe the organic growth rate increase. Focus on metal 3-D printing will be key for future growth of the company, and we maintain that 3D Systems remains a solid long-term pick.You can subscribe for real time alerts by clicking on the button at the bottom of this article."
2476425,80135,2014-09-07T07:48:49-04:00,"Healthcare and aerospace industry will drive 3D printing growth in coming years.3D printing pure play 3D Systems has been downgraded by several firms on concerns like excessive diversification.A closer look at recent acquisitions reveal that 3D Systems is converging towards healthcare and aerospace, which is a positive sign for the company.3D Systems will witness synergistic and integration benefit as acquisitions are highly relevant.","After stellar valuation growth last year, 2014 is proving to be a tough year for 3D Systems (NYSE: DDD). The stock retracted 45% during the year to date. 3D Systems is a 3D printing pure play involved in the provision of 3D printing hardware, software and services. I recently initiated coverage on 3D Systems with a buy rating amid 3DS' strong presence is several industries, improvement in printing speeds and because of the fact that 3D Systems is consistently posting revenue and EPS growth. This is a follow up report intended to analyze recent round of acquisitions and their related implications for the company.Several firms have downgraded 3D Systems citing reasons like integration difficulties and excessive diversification. A general sentiment is developing that 3DS' acquisitions are all over the place. Let's dissect recent acquisitions to find out the strength of these claims.LayerWiseIn a press release on September 3, 2014 3D Systems disclosed that it acquired a Belgium based company LayerWise; a provider of direct metal printing and manufacturing services. LayerWise has been designing and building its direct metal printers since 2008. Founders of LayerWise were involved in the development of selective laser melting technology, or SLM, at Catholic University of Leuven. Unlike SLS, this technology allows denser and less porous builds. This is why LayerWise's metal printing delivers part density of 99.98%. Moreover, their 3D printed metal parts match the properties of conventional metals/alloys but are substantially lighter.LayerWise is mainly focused on healthcare and aerospace industry. For healthcare industry, it produces orthopedic, maxillofacial, spinal and dental implants. The company develops both serial-produced implants and unique patient-specific implants together with doctors, surgeons and medical device companies. The company has a proven track record in implants. For instance, during a major maxillofacial reconstruction, surgeons inserted a zygomatic implant manufactured by LayerWise. The company also developed an award winning titanium lower jaw implant reconstruction. LayerWise claims that AM-produced implants offer both medical and cost advantages. Dental division operates under the name of DentWise. It offers dental implants, bridges and overdentures to dental laboratories. It also offers a very unique online service that allows customers/dental clinics to upload .STL file, and the company completes the order in a timely fashion.Source: DentWiseFor aerospace applications, the company produces metal alloy parts with weight reduction of almost 80%. It produces turbine vanes and thrusters units for aerospace engines.Spotlight:Implications for 3D SystemsBenefits are multi-fold for 3D Systems. Firstly, the company extended its IP footprint by adding SLM. SLS is not the most suitable solution when it comes to metal printing, and hence acquisition of LayerWise is a boost to metal capabilities of 3D Systems. Secondly, LayerWise is a service company. It doesn't sell printers. Part printing services revenue will have a larger share of 3D printing pie in the future; details later. Also, LayerWise is primarily focused on the healthcare industry, which is anticipated to be a high growth segment in the coming years. Moreover, LayerWise will bring synergistic benefits to 3D Systems (details later).Simbionix and Medical ModelingSource: Simbionix3D Systems also acquired Simbionix; a 3D virtual reality surgical simulation and training company. Simbionix offers training and education for medical professionals, universities and the healthcare industry. The company also provides patient specific simulations. It offers 16 simulations and 60+ intervention procedures across eight specialties. The company's products can be found in simulation centers, hospitals, colleges and other educational facilities in over 60 countries.Now, just a couple of months before Simbionix acquisition, 3D Systems acquired Medical Modeling that offers personalized surgical treatments and patient specific medical devices. Medical Modeling offers virtual surgery planning, or VSP, that combines medical imaging, surgical simulation and additive manufacturing.Implications for 3D Systems3D Systems is offering complete surgery planning solutions with these acquisitions. Medical Modeling can leverage Simbionix's expertise to enhance its simulation understanding and offer more advanced VSP solutions. 3D Systems will witness synergistic benefits as a result of these acquisitions because simulation knowledge of each company complements each other. 3D Systems is quite clear about its plan of action regarding both these acquisitions. Extracts from relevant press releases read as follows:Moreover, medical imaging and role of 3D printing in healthcare is on the rise. Therefore, these acquisitions further expose 3D Systems to benefits of the healthcare industry.APP, APM and Laser ReproductionsIn this recent acquisition spree, 3D Systems also acquired American Precision Prototyping and American Precision Machining. It also acquired Laser Reproductions recently. These companies are part printing and services companies just like LayerWise. LayerWise, however, uses its own printers while APP and APM rely on several OEMs for printers.APP and APM provide rapid prototyping, advanced manufacturing, product development and engineering services. They have 24 years of experience in rapid prototyping and advanced manufacturing. This acquisition will extend 3DS' reach in aerospace as APP and APM have key relations with companies in aerospace.Laser Reproductions is also a provider of advanced manufacturing product development and engineering services. The company brings three decades of advanced part printing service bureau experience to 3D Systems.Implications for 3D SystemsVice President and general manager of Quickparts for 3D systems says:APP, APM and Laser Reproductions expand part-printing reach of 3D Systems. These acquisitions bode well for 3D Systems as part printing services entail a larger addressable market than 3D printers.Joining the pieces togetherBy viewing acquisition details above, it seems that 3D Systems is actually all over the place with its acquisitions. Well, it's not! The company is systematically trying to address growth areas like healthcare, aerospace and parts printing. 3D printing will witness widespread adoption in healthcare and aerospace in the near term. Both these industries have suitable applications for 3D printing, thanks to parts weight reduction, complex part manufacturing and patient specific solutions. In a research report, IBIS acknowledges that revenue will rise as demand from aerospace and medical field takes off in future. The report further says that medical device manufacturing is expected to rise in 2014. IBIS notes that,PWC believes that AM technology has gained adherents in medical devices including prosthetics.On the aerospace front, Boeing (NYSE:BA) notes 25% to 50% cost saving in aerospace applications. General Electric is well-known for its admiration of 3D printing, and it is planning on printing jet fuel nozzles. A chart from the above mentioned PWC report might clear things up.Source: PWCThe chart indirectly depicts that cost savings will drive 3D printing growth in aerospace. To gain some perspective on parts printing, see the chart below.Source: Canalys estimatesServices and materials are going to take most of the revenue share going forward. So, investing in expansion of part printing services is justified.Industry prospects explain investment in healthcare and aerospace but why invest in metal printing? In my view, metal printing is what enables health and aerospace prospects for 3D Systems. SLS was not a very good solution for metal printing amid print density and inferior printed-part properties. But SLM not only beefs up 3D Systems' technology portfolio, it will attract more healthcare and aerospace business. To review, 3D Systems is beefing up metal printing abilities to enable growth in healthcare, aerospace and parts printing services. Hence, healthcare and part-printing services related acquisitions seem a rational move following metal printing related acquisitions. So, no, 3D Systems is not all over the place with its acquisitions.Synergistic benefits and integrationThere are numerous benefits that can arise from these acquisitions mainly because of business model overlap or existence of vertical integration.LayerWise, APP, APM and Laser Productions are part production services. Synergistic benefits can be achieved through centralization of several administrative functions.LayerWise Healthcare, Simbionix and Medical Modeling together can emerge as an end-to-end solution for surgical planning and implantation. LayerWise provides printed parts for reconstructive surgery or implantation, while Simbionix and Medical Modeling assist in planning phase of the surgery. This creates a differentiated one package solution for healthcare industry, which seems to be a critical success factor for 3D Systems in healthcare going forward.Furthermore APP, APM and medical modeling were customers of 3D Systems before their acquisition. Benefits of vertical integration can be enjoyed through acquisition of these firms. Vertical integration always entails margin expansion and cost savings. Margin growth may not be realized in near term because of acquisition related costs and integration cost but eventually it adds to bottom line of the company.Key takeaways"

These acquisitions have later played a role in maintaining a healthy organic growth rate for the company, which has made it one of the most attractive and rapidly growing companies in the sector. Most of these acquisitions have created value for 3D Systems in terms of profitability and product portfolio expansion. The company is continuing with its strategy, and it has made further strategic alliances which are likely to expand its reach.One of the most important developments is the use of 3-D printing technology by Department of Defense. 3D Systems' SLS and Direct Metal printing will be used for some war games and rapid response units. The company will be assisting the Department of Defense in development and repair of Warfare equipment. Under this partnership, 3D Systems will be working with the Department of Defense to design and print components used in T-Hawk™ MAV unmanned micro air-vehicle and Joint Strike Fighter.Source is linked above3D Systems will initially be providing the Marine Corps with 3-D printing, inspection technology and scanning for its Annual U.S. Marine Corps Expeditionary Logistics Wargame. This event is used to reflect the current logistics response capabilities and to figure out new ways to enhance it. All the new technologies are used in the prototypes presented which are implemented in simulated operations in order to test endurance and viability. The T-Hawk and Joint Strike Fighter are both extremely light-weight machines, which gives them a number of advantages. However, being light-weight also makes them vulnerable to damage.This year, the engineers are required to use 3D Systems scanning and metal printing technology to repair the damaged equipment on site in minimal time period. The engineers will be using Geomagic Capture systems of the company, which is basically a 3D Scanner. Using it, teams will repair a multipurpose robot which has been used for getting rid of obstacles and debris in an area to make room for a helicopter to land. Using the Geomatic Capture System, engineers can precisely scan the damaged parts of the robot and develop thorough CAD models to produce a duplicate part using selective laser sintering, fab-grade and direct metal printing technologies of 3D Systems.Although the project is in its initial testing phase, this particular application of 3D printing will likely result in opening another dimension for the sector. The importance of 3-D printing for military and defense purposes will be high because when a military operation is in process, the damaged components of key equipment need to be shipped quickly for repair. In many cases, the whole equipment needs replacing due to limited resources and time. This results in increased cost. Most importantly, time of shipping is the main concern in such operations. Having thorough 3D scanning and precise 3D printing could increase the efficiency.At the moment, it is difficult to determine the economic potential of the opportunity to a certainty as the 3-D printing equipment is currently in the testing phases for Department of Defense - however, the new segment can be worth billions of dollars as the military spending is escalating. The image below shows the military spending by ten countries.SourceThese ten nations spent over a trillion dollars during the last year on defense. Most of the spending is usually done on the purchase of equipment and salaries - however, as war games are an important part of the overall military strategy of a nation, the spending on these war games is also substantial. As we mentioned above, the advantage of 3-D printing will be in terms of efficiency - the ability to repair the equipment on site and print the needed parts will be hugely important for these war games. It will allow the war games to go on without any delay. Furthermore, if the technology is feasible in the war games; it will also result in playing a vital role in the real operations and battles. Even if the 3-D printing industry is able to take about 0.5% from the overall global spending on defense; I believe it will be a massive opportunity for the sector.Another example is XStat, which is a syringe that stops bleeding from a bullet would within 15 seconds so that the medical attention can be delayed until the victim reaches a medical facility. It is now being used in warfare to save many lives. The use of 3-D printing in war games and real warfare can result in increasing the efficiency of operations.Bottom LineThe 3-D Printing industry is still in the early stages and we are seeing more avenues open for the industry. Defense industry can be a massive addition to the 3-D printing industry's target market as the global defense spending is huge. Even on a smaller scale, the application of the technology can result in a considerable increase in revenues for these companies. 3D Systems has an advantage with this recent partnership with the Department of Defense as the success of this experiment will put 3D Systems in pole position to gain business from the Department of Defense. Furthermore, 3D Systems recently opened a 22,000 square feet software development facility and innovation center. This place will support the company's Geomagic software products. Research and development will continue to be a major expenditure for these companies and 3D Systems' commitment shows that the company does not intend to sit on its hands.Additional Disclosure: This article is for educational purposes only and it should not be taken as an investment recommendation.

This represents 34% of the total number of shares and 35% of the float. Year-to-date, short interest in the stock is up 151%. And more interestingly, it's up 2% or 801k shares since late July, while the stock price decline following poor Q2 earnings could have sparked investors to cover their short positions and take their profits.Since our January article ""Competition To Heat Up As Key Patents Expire, Earnings Risk On The Downside"", we have been Sellers of the stock, saying that the expiry of key patents between 2014 and 2017 would spark increased competition and pricing pressures across the industry, as open-source hardware printers would be able to integrate laser sintering. These declining ASPs suggest significant pressure on gross margins as prices go down, while costs remain high due to continued investments. The fact that investors continue to add to their short positions while the stock is down 45% year-to-date suggests that many of them now share our view. It's also likely that many investors assume that 3D Systems will not reach its FY14 revenue target ($700-$740m). As we explained in a previous article, this guidance implies second-half growth will accelerate to 40%-50% from 25% in Q2... despite tough comps (+50% growth in Q3 13 and +52% in Q4 13). The company claims a record backlog, new product introductions and the contribution of Robtec and Simbionix. Fine, but the bar is nevertheless set extremely high at a time when industry conditions have become much tougher. There is clearly no room for error, and any delay in a product shipment would lead 3D Systems to cut its guidance. The risk is clearly on the downside.Even if a short-term short squeeze is always possible, we believe that this rising short interest does not bode well for the stock price. It suggests that investors have growing concerns about the company's outlook and valuation and that the stock price decline year-to-date does not yet fully captured fundamental issues. We reiterate our negative stance on the stock and our $26 target price."
2464975,25991,2014-09-02T10:39:42-04:00,"3D Systems' current valuation metrics are still very high and the shares are trading above fair value even after a 42% decline in 2014.3D Systems' outstanding shares have nearly doubled in two years.3D Systems' gross profit margin and EPS are on a downward trajectory.3D Systems' short interest is, not surprisingly, at all time highs.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) shareholders have had a rough 2014. Shares of the 3D printer have been beaten down over 42% and short interest has piled in at all-time highs. Even after dropping 42% this year, and while considered a growth stock, the company still trades at outrageous multiples and still looks to be a solid short - especially as the hype has started to fade in the 3D printing segment. Before we get to the analysis, take a look at the five-year price chart below. 3D Systems went on a real rocket ride trading at around $10 per share at the beginning of 2012 to over $90 per share at the beginning of 2014. Shares appear to have leveled off in the low $50s.Current Valuation and Fair Value3D Systems currently trades at a trailing twelve month P/E of 152.89 compared to the technology sector average P/E of 20.0 and the S&P 500 average P/E of 19.86. 3D Systems' P/S ratio is at a lofty 9.97 while the S&P 500 average P/S is 1.78. To be fair, 3D Systems does not look overvalued when compared to competitors however that is little consolation as the entire 3D printing segment appears significantly overpriced:Even after the 42% drop this year 3D Systems' current valuation is priced for perfection. It could sustain these levels based on the hype surrounding 3D printers but if the overall market corrects the first stocks to get destroyed will be the high flyers. The risk/reward ratio at these valuations in addition to a frothy/toppy market favor the short sellers.Discounted Cash flow Valuation - The DCF method is a popular method for determining fair value and uses future free cash flow projections, then discounts them to come up with a present value. In using the DCF valuation we have to make some assumptions for the discount rate (our expected annual rate of return on our capital) and projected growth after year 5.Using this online DCF calculator and inputting a discount rate of 10% and a 5% growth rate for year 6 to eternity we get a fair value of $14.92. Using a DCF valuation 3D Systems shares appear significantly overvalued.DilutionAccording to the graph below the number of 3D Systems outstanding shares have doubled since the beginning of 2011. The company's most recent secondary offerings were in May of 2013 and May of 2014. This dilution has been mainly to fund the more than 50 acquisitions over the last three years as part of 3D Systems' growth strategy. Growth through acquisition can grow top line revenues quickly but also is fraught with risk as integrating companies can prove very challenging, especially making the acquisitions maximally accretive to earnings.In addition to the dilution we see the quarter gross profit margin and the quarter EPS in a downward trend, supporting the notion that acquisitions fueled by dilution can have a negative impact on margins and earnings. For investors with longer investment horizons the idea is these acquisitions will eventually fuel bottomline growth in addition to the topline growth. The shorts say the shares are already priced for significant earnings growth, with no margin of safety so the company must execute perfectly to justify the current price and the overall market must cooperate.Lastly, the graph below should be no surprise and shows the outstanding shares short at an all-time high with over 32% of the float sold short.Conclusion3D Systems is a risky gamble at these elevated prices. It would be easy to think a 42% drop in the shares would present some kind of bargain but the shares still appear significantly overvalued based on current multiples and a DCF fair value calculation. To grow into the current valuation the company would have to execute nearly perfectly and would need cooperation of the overall market. The shorts appear to have this one called correctly - I expect 3D Systems shares to continue sliding toward fair value as the shine wears off the 3D printing segment and investors flock to safety as the market tops."
2434605,44981,2014-08-19T07:16:55-04:00,"3D Systems announced the acquisition of two of its sister companies, APP and APM.The acquisitions are in line with our expectations and the company's strategy of complementing organic growth with acquisitions.Our stance has been reaffirmed and we believe the company will continue to grow through expansions as well as organically.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) announced the acquisition of two sister companies - American precision Prototyping (APP) and American Precision Machining (NASDAQ:APM) - both these companies operate in the rapid prototyping advanced manufacturing and product development services. The company did not disclose the details of the transaction. Both the companies will bring a combined experience of about 24 years in the field of rapid prototyping and product development and enhance 3D Systems' portfolio considerably.Specifically, both these companies have expertise in the aerospace segment. Addition of these companies to 3D Systems' portfolio means the company has a stronger footprint in the aerospace segment of the industry. APP and APM have been providing 3-D printed or machine custom parts to Boeing (NYSE:BA), NASA, General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). APP was the customer of 3D Systems' 3-D printers and systems and this acquisition represents a kind of forward integration for the company - 3D Systems has acquired one of its customers and entered the retail segment.These two acquisitions are in line with our expectations as we have said in the past that the company will continue to complement its organic growth with acquisitions. 3D Systems has followed this strategy over the last few years and the company has completed around 45 acquisitions over the last four years and spent over $520 million. These acquisitions have played a key role in strong revenue growth for the company and a number of these acquisitions are contributing towards the organic growth of the company. We expect 3D Systems to continue its strategy to complement organic growth with acquisitions and mergers - this strategy is allowing the company to expand into a number of areas and grow at an exceptional rate.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

2450915,56202,2014-08-26T09:13:31-04:00,"3D Systems is down this year, but the company is on track to benefit from various new applications such as the Project Ara and secular growth of 3D printing.3D Systems is diversifying itself to tap more end markets through acquisitions, and this is a smart move.3D Systems is upgrading its manufacturing facilities to meet impending demand for 3D printing applications.","After a terrific performance in 2013, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has disappointed investors massively in 2014, losing around 45% of its market capitalization. A string of weak quarterly results have weighed on 3D Systems' performance, and the recent second quarter was no different either. 3D Systems once again failed to impress the Street with its results, as its numbers were below the consensus estimate.Moreover, its bottom line dwindled year over year. One of the reasons behind 3D Systems' weak performance is the delay in launch of new products. This is affecting its revenue opportunities, and subsequent costs related to these new launches will weigh on its margins. However, the good thing is that 3D Systems' top line is showing strength, growing 25% year over year last quarter.Also, 3D Systems raised its revenue outlook for the year, which shows that the company's performance could improve as new products come into the market.Looking beyond the short-term3D Systems had delayed shipments of some products to improve user experience. The company began the shipment of its new CubePro printer and iSense scanner in July, while more products are planned for the coming months. These new products will be shipped in the upcoming quarters, which will boost its revenue in the second half of the fiscal year. Also, 3D Systems increased its spending on research and development by 84% year over year. As a result, the company launched ten new products during the first six months, and management expects more launches in the second half as well.3D Systems is also in a partnership with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to 3-D print phones based on the Project Ara platform. Through Project Ara, Google is looking to manufacture a number of modular smartphones. In fact, Google has an ambitious target of selling billions of phones through Project Ara. According to Google:It is estimated that Google will price the modular smartphone at a basic $50. As such, the company can expect to move a large number of phones. Hence, if this initiative takes off, 3D Systems will have another catalyst on its hands.The previous quarter's performance might have been disappointing, but management believes that this was only a temporary setback on account of various transitional forces during the period. According to 3D Systems' CEO Avi Reichental, ""A detailed examination of the specific drivers confirms that our fundamentals are intact and our gross profit margins are poised to rebound and resume their expansion trajectory."" There is no doubt that the demand for its 3D Printers is increasing, as the company reported a 126% increase in units sold.Diversification in the cardsApart from engineering applications, the company is extending its reach into the medical market, with the acquisition of various companies in this segment. During the quarter, 3D Systems acquired Medical Modeling. With this new addition, the company can now provide virtual surgical planning, guiding, and 3-D printing of medical devices.Additionally, it has signed an agreement to acquire Simbionix, which is a leading provider of 3-D virtual reality surgical simulation and training product. The deal also included a complimentary global sales channel. This will enable the company to expand its digital platform to medical services for the development of new and improved machines that can be used for surgical and other medical uses. Robtec is another deal, which the company will close in the second half of this fiscal that will open doors for the 3-D printer maker in Latin America.3D Systems is also expanding its reach into the manufacturing segment. It recently announced that it has acquired Laser Reproductions, ""An expert provider of advanced manufacturing product development and engineering services, further extending its Quickparts operations in the United States."" 3D Systems didn't disclose any terms of the transaction, but expects the deal to expand its expertise. According to a press release:Hence, 3D Systems is expanding its reach into various segments of the 3D printing market. So, it is not surprising that the company is experiencing solid growth in its metal printers, which is outpacing supply. Consequently, 3D Systems has enlarged its Phoenix manufacturing facility to the maximum limit, and is also bringing preparing a system manufacturing facility in the U.S during the third quarter.This will give the company ample room for producing sufficient metal printers by 2015. Apart from this, it has also purchased an additional 200,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Rockville, South Carolina, to expand its production capacity.Going forward, management expects its printer margins to improve in the third quarter, as its operating expenses stabilize. Along with its ongoing acquisitions, 3D Systems has added some major distributors such as ScanSource (NASDAQ:SCSC), Konica Minolta KNCAF), and Cannon Marketing Japan that will improve its performance going forward.Conclusion3D Systems is making good progress. Although the company is seeing some short-term hiccups, the long run opportunity still appears strong. Driven by its acquisitions and the launch of new products, 3D Systems is making the right moves to tap the 3-D printing market. As such, investors should focus on the company's long-term prospects as 3D Systems looks set to deliver growth in the long run."
2440585,22775,2014-08-21T03:42:46-04:00,"We review in this article the recent takeover speculation.And the group’s acquisition policy.In our view, M&A is not an attractive exit opportunity for shareholders.","A takeover play? Not reallyAfter 3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) huge price drop year-to-date, we are pretty sure that the bulls will kindly tell us that 3D Systems cannot go much lower as it has strong M&A appeal. And they will probably remind us that just a few weeks ago, 3D Systems rocketed more than 20% following M&A rumors.Let's have a closer look at the M&A scenario. Actually, takeover rumors emerged in late June when 3D Systems cancelled a Pacific Crest conference appearance. Last minute investor conference cancellations usually hint that something is happening at the company. It can be M&A talks (acquiring a large business, or seeking to sell the company). Or it can be an earnings miss or a profit-warning. And guess what happened just a few weeks after the appearance cancellation… A massive miss on Q2 earnings as detailed in our article.In all, we believe that the recent rumors about a potential takeover of the company are unfounded.We see no major takeover benefits for the potential predatorsFrom a fundamental standpoint, we struggle to figure out why a large tech player such as HP (NYSE:HPQ) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) would try to acquire 3D Systems. The barriers to entry are gradually coming down as patents are expiring, making it cheap and relatively easy for any tech company to design a 3-D printer. This is perfectly illustrated by software maker Autodesk's (NASDAQ:ADSK) 3-D printing hardware initiative.Obviously, Google could easily develop in-house its own 3-D printer thanks to its tech know-how and large financial resources while HP has a large printing patents portfolio, a huge distribution reach (businesses and consumers) and claims it has developed a breakthrough 3-D printing technology. So there is no need for either company in our view to acquire 3D Systems whose patents are gradually expiring.And from a pure financial standpoint, the benefits of such a deal would not be obvious. 3D Systems is trading at 37x 2015 EPS vs. 18x for Google (for an earnings growth which is expected to be slightly above but which faces downside risks) and 9x for HP, suggesting that a deal could be EPS dilutive. In addition, HP would find it hard to justify such an acquisition to its shareholders, notably after the Autonomy disaster.A M&A play? ClearlyIt's no secret that 3D Systems has long been a serial acquirer of small businesses. Since raising more than $300m in June, the group has already announced two acquisitions, Simbionix and APP / APM. The question now is what impact future acquisitions will have on 3D Systems' earnings profile.Assuming that 3D Systems acquires companies which post similar profitability levels at a 2015 Price/Sales ratio of 2.5x (vs. 5x for 3D Systems), we get to a potential 18% EPS accretion. As Simbionix has already been included in the guidance, we would say that potential EPS accretion is rather around 15%.In all, M&A is likely to sustain earnings over coming quarters even if underlying performances are likely to continue decelerating in our view (see our article ""It's Not Just About The FY14 Guidance, It's Also About The Long Term""). But as we said several times, investors' focus will remain on organic growth, not on absolute revenue and EPS numbers as organic growth is the main driver of long-term valuation models.Adding stories to the house of cards is a major riskWe would also mention that many analysts and investors have already highlighted the integration risks related to 3D Systems' M&A frenzy and that some of them are close to calling 3D Systems a house of cards. And obviously, adding stories to the house of cards through M&A is unlikely to please them.A house of cards usually falters when the underlying business weakens. If recent concerns about the 3-D printing outlook prove to be true, then 3D Systems will be the most at risk name within the 3-D printing universe.In all, we believe that the group's acquisition policy is unlikely to sustain the stock price in the long run."
2389755,54222,2014-08-06T15:03:25-04:00,"3D Systems has taken a massive beating this year, but investors need to look beyond the short-term pain.3D Systems is aggressively investing in new products and acquisitions for growth.Driven by strong prospects in the medical 3D printing market and the overall 3D printing industry, 3D Systems is on track to deliver growth in the long run.","Things have gone from bad to worse for 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) this year. The once high-flying 3D printing company is down almost 50% in 2014 as its results have disappointed Wall Street. Despite reporting solid growth in revenue, 3D Systems hasn't been able to translate it into earnings growth. However, the 3D printing industry is expected to be worth a massive $16.2 billion in 2018, from just $2.5 billion last year. This translates into a CAGR of 45.7%.Being a growth stage company, 3D Systems is aggressively investing in innovation, and this will no doubt affect its bottom line. But this will also lead to long-term growth.In the second quarter, 3D Systems' revenue grew 25% year-over-year. But, at the same time, its bottom line declined 77% year over year as 3D Systems invested aggressively in product development. In fact, 3D Systems' research and development expense almost doubled year over year to $17.7 million in the second quarter. This was a key reason behind 3D Systems' drop in earnings. However, these investments are positioning the company to tap the long-term opportunity in 3D printing.Investing for growthR&D is one of 3D Systems' priorities. It has more than doubled its R&D expenditures, and these investments will help the company accelerate product development. The company has already launched 10 new products in the first half of this year, driven by its innovations. In fact, new product revenue increased 49% last quarter, signifying 3D Systems' strong product innovation. The company has lined up more launches in the second half of the year, and this should add to its revenue growth.3D Systems is also making huge strides in the healthcare business. In fact, revenue from healthcare was up 46% in the previous quarter, driven by an expansion of the user base and product adoption. The company made a smart move by acquiring Medical Modeling.Although the terms of the deal were not disclosed, 3D Systems said that it will become immediately accretive to earnings. This acquisition has added virtual surgical planning, guiding, and 3D printing of medical devices to 3D Systems' portfolio.Now, Medical Modeling should allow 3D Systems to tap a fast growing medical 3D printing market. The opportunity here is huge, as 3DPrint.com would have us believe:To improve its chances of tapping this market, 3D Systems has also decided to acquire Simbionix, a leading provider of the 3-D virtual reality surgical simulation and training products, for $120 million. This deal will expand 3D Systems' reach in personalized medical services, and provide it a better opportunity of tapping the medical market.3D Systems is also developing a high speed, fab-grade 3D printer platform with polymer and conductive materials. The company believes that this will increase 3D printing production speeds, satisfying industrial and consumer goods applications.New products and acquisitions will aid growth3D Systems has started commercially shipping the new CubePro printer and iSense scanner. It is on track to start shipping the new Cube in August. In addition, 3D Systems is witnessing good demand for its direct metals printers. After successfully utilizing the full production capacity of its Phenix manufacturing facility, 3D Systems is bringing online a new system manufacturing facility. This facility is expected to start working during the third quarter, and enhance 3D Systems' production capacity for metals printers.3D Systems has also diversified sales of metal printers into areas such as automotive, aerospace, and medical. It is now using metals printers in its quick parts services.3D Systems is also moving into Latin America with the acquisition of Robtec in Brazil. Although the full terms of the deal were not disclosed, 3D Systems will acquire 70% of Robtec at first, and the remaining 30% on the fifth year of the deal closing. With this move, the company plans to ""establish a strategic sales and service platform and a scalable gateway into Latin America."" This acquisition will expand 3D Systems' footprint into the emerging South America region, positioning it for long-term growth.Tapping the market effectivelyAs such, 3D Systems is making the correct moves by making acquisitions to bolster the business, and investors should fret much about its short-term weakness. In fact, 3D Systems is already doing well to tap the market. For instance, in the previous quarter, demand for 3D Systems' design and manufacturing printers increased 126%. In addition, printing materials revenue expanded 30%, while services revenue increased 38%.Looking ahead, the traction is set to continue, as 3D Systems reported an increase of 77% in bookings over the last quarter. Currently, the company has a record backlog of almost $32 million, including $23.1 million for professional, production and consumer printers.There reasons why 3D Systems' order book has expanded in recent times is simple. The company is seeing greater demand for its direct metal printers. This category is growing at a faster rate than manufacturing capacity. Also, management is looking to deliver the best experience to customers. As a result, the company has decided to postpone shipments of new consumer products in a bid to enhance its product. This has resulted in an increase in the backlog.At the same time, 3D Systems has been able to stabilize its operating expenses. Its operating expenses were flat sequentially. This is important, as the company is aggressively investing in product development, sales, marketing, and manufacturing capacity.ConclusionAll in all, 3D Systems seems to be making the right moves. The industry is expected to grow at a fast pace, and 3D Systems is on the right track to benefit from it by way of its acquisitions and product development. The company's bottom line might remain under pressure in the short run, but over the next five years, its earnings are expected to grow at a rate of 22% a year, better than the 15% industry average for earnings growth, which is different. So, investors need to look beyond the short-term issues as 3D Systems looks like a solid long-term bet.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2417685,24849,2014-08-13T03:41:25-04:00,"Short interest spiked to a new high in late July.So far in 2014, short interest is up 145%.More than a third of the float was short into earnings.Company announced expanded manufacturing facility.Will a short squeeze come?","It's been a couple of weeks since I updated investors on the potential for a short squeeze in shares of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). Short interest in the 3D printing name continued to rise in early July, and that made a short squeeze seem even more likely. Going into the recent earnings report, short interest hit another new high. While the company's Q2 results were not great, the yearly revenue forecast was raised. Today, I'll update where the company stands, and detail why short squeeze potential remains high.First, let me start with the latest update on short interest, since we recently got the end of July numbers from NASDAQ. As I stated above, we saw another new high going into earnings, which you can see in the chart below.(Note: last data point on chart is for settlement date of 7/31/14)In the second half of July, short interest rose by another two million shares plus, putting the total at more than 36 million. In the first seven months of 2014, short interest rose by more than 145% in this name, a staggering amount. Even the year-over-year rise stands at more than 38%, showing you how many do not believe in the future of this name.There is one major item that must be updated here as well, and that is the float number. We have seen a rise in the float number on Yahoo! Finance by more than 6 million shares since my previous update. That is not a surprise, and it is something I detailed in past articles would be coming at some point. 3D Systems detailed in its 10-Q filing that it sold 6 million shares of stock in May, so the outstanding share count and float numbers were going to go up. However, short interest also rose by nearly 6% in the final two weeks of July. Thus, the percentage of float short is still at 34.41%, down slightly from 34.49% at my previous update.My guess is that short interest will come down a little at the mid-August update, which will be the first update after the company's Q2 earnings report. Since the company missed on both the top and bottom line, the stock dropped after earnings, even though the 2014 revenue forecast was raised and the EPS forecast was maintained. The company guided to 2014 revenues of $700 million to $740 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.73 to $0.85. In the past week, we've seen analyst estimates rise by a little more than $2 million on the revenue side, but EPS come down by 2 cents. The current averages are $709.48 million and $0.78, respectively. Analysts are still at the lower end of the company's revenue forecast and a penny below the midpoint of the EPS forecast. That bearishness does seem appropriate after the Q2 miss, but it does leave the company plenty of room to beat going forward.In the end, short squeeze potential for 3D Systems remains rather high. Even if we do see a decline in short interest at the next update, roughly 25%-30% of the float should still be short. That's an incredible number, and it means the next piece of good news could trigger a squeeze. Investors that jumped in after my initial article on the name were rewarded with a nice pop from the low $50s to nearly $70, and I think we could see another rally at some point in 2014. Remember, it's the back half of the year where the company delivers a larger part of its revenues and earnings. This is still a growth company with a lot of potential, and the company just announced expanded manufacturing and distribution capacity. While this stock will be a bit more volatile than your average stock, I do think investors that buy now will be handsomely rewarded at the next positive event. Short interest in this name is too high, and a squeeze does seem fairly likely.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2387085,22775,2014-08-06T05:46:41-04:00,"The only way for 3D Systems to achieve its FY14 guidance is to have a stronger-than-expected contribution from acquisitions and new M&A.But investors' focus will remain on organic growth, not on absolute revenue and EPS numbers.Following Q2, investors are likely to start revisiting their long-term expectations: organic growth and margins forecasts are likely to go down in their valuation models.Our $26 bear-case valuation is in sight.","Simbionix does not 3-D print anything… That's good newsLet's start with a positive. 3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) announced acquisition for $120m of Simbionix, a maker of simulators for surgical planning/training, is great. Simbionix hardware isn't used to 3-D print anything, and that's why it's great, in our view.We have been saying since the beginning of the year that margins on 3-D printers were likely to go sharply down in coming years due to intense competition and declining ASPs. Coincidentally, 3D Systems buys, in recent weeks, the services business Robtec in Brazil and now a specialized hardware manufacturer not active in the 3-D printing business. Huuummm... This sounds like 3D Systems is seeking to diversify away from the traditional 3-D printer business, as it's well aware of the risks this business is facing. That would be a smart strategy, but obviously one that would take time.FY14 guidance: The risk is on the downsideDespite poor Q2 revenue growth (25%, o/w 10% organic vs. +30% organic in previous quarters), 3D Systems left roughly unchanged its FY14 revenue target ($700-$740m). Actually, it probably lowered it by $10-$20m for the core business, i.e. excluding Simbionix. Anyway, this guidance implies second-half growth will accelerate to 40%-50%... despite tough comps (+50% growth in Q3 and +52% in Q4).The company claims a record backlog, new product introductions and the contribution of Robtec and Simbionix. Fine, but the bar is nevertheless set extremely high at a time when industry conditions have become much tougher (profit warnings across the board). There is clearly no room for error, and any delay in a product shipment would lead 3D Systems to cut its guidance. The risk is clearly on the downside.The only way to achieve this guidance is to have a stronger-than-expected contribution from acquisitions and new M&A, but investors' focus is likely to be on organic growth, not on absolute numbers.Long-term projections need to be revisitedQ2 underlying trends suggest that long-term assumptions about 3D Systems' revenue growth potential need to be revisited. First, the 24% revenue drop in the consumer business confirms that 3D Systems is unlikely to be a strong player in this segment, seen by many analysts and investors as a key driver of the 3-D industry.The company pointed to delayed new product availability in Q2, but the segment was already weak in previous quarters. 3D Systems trails Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), which has much better reviews on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and which is now on Home Depot's (NYSE:HD) shelves. And the major 3-D players are now starting to face competition from low-cost Asian players, as we explained in previous articles.Second, the strong backlog increase in Q2 (vs. a sharp slowdown in revenue growth) could suggest that final purchase decisions take much more time than in recent quarters, even if we acknowledge that delayed shipments of consumer products played a role.In all, we believe that expectations of sustained 30% organic growth over coming years are not realistic.In the same time, gross margin trends are worrying and call for lower profitability expectations going forward. 3D Systems explained the -400 bps gross margin performance in Q2 by ""product transitions, obsolescence of older lines, and increased COGS"". Even taking this into account, the underlying gross margin was down, as it was already down in Q1 (-130 bps). Something is going on, but 3D Systems does not talk about it... Has anyone noticed that printer unit growth of 126% compared badly to printer revenue growth in the teens? Printers are selling, yes, but at bargain prices.We stick to our view that the expiry of key patents between 2014 and 2017 is sparking increased competition and pricing pressures across the industry, as open-source hardware printers are now able to integrate technologies such as laser sintering, as illustrated by the recent Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) or HP (NYSE:HPQ) initiatives.ConclusionThis is just a question of time before 3D Systems and analysts reset their expectations. We reiterate our $26 bear case (for more details please read our February article ""3D Systems: $83 or $26?

2380615,24849,2014-08-05T06:41:16-04:00,"3D Systems had a large Q2 miss.2014 revenue forecast was raised, EPS forecast maintained.More pressure put on the second half of the year.Short interest remains quite high.Pullback provides an opportunity for those who believe in the name.","Last week, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) reported Q2 earnings, and the report was not good to say the least. Both the top and bottom line came in well short of expectations, and the stock dropped on the news. However, the company did raise its yearly revenue range, and maintained its non-GAAP EPS forecast. Today, I'll explain why the company now faces more pressure, and what it means for investors.For Q2, the company came in at $151.5 million in revenues, which fell well short of estimates for more than $162.2 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.16, which missed by two cents. While Q2 revenues rose by 25% over the prior year period, analysts were looking for more than 34% growth. Any way you slice it, this report was a huge miss, and a big disappointment. Shares fell $6 on the news last Thursday, and have fallen even further since. The current share price is the lowest we've seen in almost three months, even lower than when I detailed how a major short squeeze could occur. We did see a sharp rise in shares to nearly $70, but now we're back in the high $40s.The company normally posts a larger share of its yearly revenues in the second half of the year, so this puts even more pressure on Q3 and Q4. Additionally, the company actually raised its revenue forecast for the year. 3D Systems now expects 2014 revenues of $700 million to $740 million. That range is $5 million higher than the previous range. The company also reiterated its non-GAAP EPS range of $0.73 to $0.85 for the year.As you can most likely guess, analysts have become a bit more skeptical after the Q2 miss. Going into the Q2 report, analysts were looking for $713.82 million in revenues this year. Current estimates call for $707.14 million. Analysts are now about $13 million below the midpoint of the company's forecast, and almost at the bottom end of the range. Should the company come in even at the midpoint of its range this year, it will be a huge beat against current estimates. In terms of non-GAAP EPS, analysts are now looking for $0.80 a share, down a penny from where estimates stood going into the Q2 report. Analysts are a penny above the company's midpoint for EPS, which goes against what they see for revenues.There were a number of analyst downgrades after the Q2 report, which is not surprising given the large miss on both revenues and EPS. Overall, analysts are still fairly positive on the name, with the average recommendation being a slight to moderate buy. Both the mean and median price targets are in the high $50s, implying about 25% upside from current levels. Just like investors, analysts are a bit divided on this name, as the price target range goes from $45 to $84.For investors that still believe in this name, this selloff may be an opportunity to buy. Not only are shares at multi-month lows, but expectations have come down a bit, which makes it easier to beat. As I've detailed above, analysts are near the low end of the company's revenue range. Additionally, this remains a heavily shorted stock. The latest short interest update showed a new high in short interest. More than a third of the float was short, after a 132% year-to-date rise in short interest. We'll have to wait a couple of weeks until the mid-August update to see how shorts responded to the earnings report. It would not surprise me if short interest does come down then as shorts take some profits on the fall. However, even if short interest drops by 25%, you'd still see roughly 25% of the float shorted. If the company announces any good news, a major short squeeze is still possible.In conclusion, 3D Systems now has a lot more to prove in the second half of 2014. The company's second quarter report was terrible, yet the yearly revenue forecast was raised and the EPS forecast was maintained. Shares have taken a necessary hit, but this could be an opportunity for investors who still believe in the name. Short interest remains at an exceptionally high level, meaning any good news could lead to another short squeeze. In the high $40s, this name is a much better buy than it was a few weeks ago when shares were $20 higher.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The 3-D printing company was seeing a huge rise in short interest, and a squeeze did come. Investors that jumped into the name saw a great profit opportunity if they got out at the right time. Recently, shares have come back down to about where they were when I originally wrote about the name, but things have gotten even more interesting. Today, I'll provide a quick update on where things stand.We recently got the mid-July update on short interest, which showed another increase to more than 34 million shares short. This is a 26% rise in short interest over the past year, and nearly 132% year to date. Just when we thought short interest wouldn't go much higher, it has eclipsed the middle of June update by more than 80k shares. That doesn't seem like much, but again, it's another new high. In the chart below, you can see a recent history of short interest in this name.With this latest update, about 34.5% of the float is now short. This is an incredibly high percentage, and it makes the short squeeze case even more plausible. For those looking to gamble, the next catalyst for a short squeeze will be the earnings report this week. Should the company report good news, it might just be what's needed to start another squeeze. With short interest hitting another new high, it makes the long case even stronger going forward, and that could make a potential squeeze even more rewarding for investors this time around. Investors wanting to play this name for its squeeze possibility should look to enter this name again.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Following the recent equity issue (above $300m) and guidance update, the group has no choice but to deliver on expectations as a miss would suggest that 3D Systems misled investors or has extremely low visibility on its business. In either case, the stock would be punished severely in our view.Even if we view the risk/reward on the downside once again (dramatic impact on the stock price if 3D Systems misses / limited positive impact if it beats), we believe that the company should report roughly in line with the Street ($0.18 EPS) and reiterate its guidance.Remember that in its Q1 report, 3D Systems adopted a more cautious approach regarding its 2014 guidance, stating that: Even assuming tough business conditions in Q2, the wording of the Q1 press release suggests that there will be no need to cut guidance after Q2, pending the introduction of new products in the second half of the year.That said, the devil will be in the details. Notably, we will closely monitor the gross margin development which has been worrying in the last quarters: gross margin was sharply up in Q1 2013 (up more than 200bps), then gradually deteriorated as it ended the year flat in Q4 and was significantly down in Q1 2014 (-130bps year-on-year).It's all about the gross marginGroup gross margin has been dragged down by printers (margin down 500bps in Q1). And if 3D Systems does not stem this margin decline soon (against easier comps), concerns will probably be mounting about the company's long-term margin potential and earnings power. We have been highlighting this risk since the beginning of the year and our article ""3D Systems - Competition To Heat Up As Key Patents Expire, Earnings Risk On The Downside."" Our thesis is that the expiry of key patents between 2014 and 2017 is sparking increased competition and pricing pressures across the industry as open-source hardware printers are now able to integrate technologies such as laser sintering, as illustrated by the recent Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) or HP (NYSE:HPQ) initiatives. In the same time, the consumer business takeoff is likely to put additional pressure on margins due to lower ASPs and intense competition from Asian low-cost printer makers.We said in a previous article (""3D Systems: Trading Buy Or Falling Knife?"") that the highly-profitable materials business could offer upside on 3D System's margins at some point when its weight in the revenue mix increases, but that this business remained a mystery until now, as it kept growing at a lower rate than printers (+41% vs. +53% in Q1). It will be interesting to see if there's any inflection here or if the Q2 report will once again confirm what Terry Wohlers said not a long time ago:M&A could be a positiveWe believe that 3D Systems could take the opportunity of its earnings release to announce one or several small acquisitions. Following its equity issue, the company now has more than $600m net cash and has not announced any large acquisition, suggesting that it could have been active in the small & mid market in recent weeks. Specifically, we would welcome acquisitions in the services business (like the Robtec acquisition in Brazil) as we believe that margins in this business will be much more resilient than in hardware.ConclusionWe wouldn't expect Q2 to have a major impact on the stock price. In the short-term, 3D Systems is likely to keep trading in a tight range around the mid-point ($54.5) of our bull-bear valuation analysis (for more details please read our February article ""$83 or $26? Pick your scenario"").Nevertheless, gross margin trends will be interesting to watch to assess the group's future earnings power. If our thesis about declining ASPs and gross margins proves correct, the stock will gradually move towards our $26 bear-case valuation.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2363625,40031,2014-07-31T10:16:13-04:00,3D Systems’ Q2 report is largely disappointing as the company missed EPS and revenue expectations.Full-year guidance was revised slightly higher which is also a major disappointment given the recent acquisitions.The company is likely enabled to grow at a rate that is needed to deserve a higher valuation and I am reducing my price target.,"3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) Q2 report was quite disappointing. The company missed EPS and revenue estimates as momentum in its business faded away. Although the company hiked full-year revenue guidance to $700 million to $740 million from the previous range of $695 million to $735 million, investors expected more and the share price was down sharply after the report was announced. Although the closing of the Robtec acquisition will be delayed, the raised guidance is somewhat disappointing given the most recent Simbionix acquisition, which was factored in the new guidance.Organic growth was just 10% compared to 28% growth in Q1, while the materials revenue increased 30%, which is a slowdown from 41% growth in Q1. Consumer revenue was $7.4 million compared to $9.7 million in Q1 as delayed products availability held consumer revenue growth down, although bookings grew by $7.7 million. Healthcare was a bright spot with 46% revenue growth, but the growth also slowed down from 53% in Q1. Other bright spots in the report include the backlog, which has expanded to a record $31.9 million and a 29% sequential increase in the printer backlog. The company also gets more revenue in the second half of the year, and the backlog points to a pickup in 2H 2014.Given the poor Q2 report, I am reducing my price target from $70 to $55. I now believe that 3D Systems cannot reach the higher valuation level that I previously expected and I have adjusted my expectations accordingly. I also wrote in my previous report that the market may drag down 3D Systems (you can read my previous articles on 3D Systems here), and now the Q2 results are another catalyst that will pressure the share price in the next couple of weeks. The stock might revisit its early May lows and go even lower. The downside potential here dwarfs the upside potential and I think that 3D Systems should be avoided until a more favorable entry point is reached. The long-term growth prospects are still compelling, but the growth potential is lower than was previously expected.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2338085,68555,2014-07-24T12:05:13-04:00,"The limited number of acquisitions means Stratasys will have an easier time integrating the M&A into its core business.The chances of 3D Systems' 40+ acquisitions failing are too high and investors will lose confidence when that happens.Stratasys is also well positioned to benefit from the industrial sector of 3D printing.Stratasys' latest acquisitions should help the company strengthen its market position and drive long-term growth.Thus, investors should sell 3D Systems to buy Stratasys.","The 3D printing industry is growing at a fast pace. However, the stock price performance of Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) has been weak this year, with shares declining 20%. But, Stratasys' performance has been better than rival 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), which has been languishing with a stock price drop of 41%. Moreover, Stratasys' financial performance has been better than 3D Systems'.Terrific growthIn the first quarter, Stratasys reported revenue of $151.2 million, up 53.9% from the year-ago quarter and exceeding the consensus estimate of $144 million. However, EPS was $0.30, less than the consensus estimate of $0.33. The company's gross margins increased 213 basis points to 60.9% as compared to 59% for the same quarter last year. In comparison, 3D Systems' bottom line had dropped as much as 17% last quarter, while revenue growth was slower at 44.7%.Looking ahead, Stratasys should continue doing well as it has a solid position in the industrial 3-D printing segment. While the company focuses on the industrial 3-D printing market, other companies are aiming for the consumer market, which is yet to adopt this technology. The company, in the first quarter, announced its new systems, namely Objet500 and Connex3, Color Multi-material 3D printer. This is the first and only 3D printer to combine color and multi-material 3D and features a unique triple jet technology that allows the user to combine color with various combinations of flexibility and transparency.Positive movesThe high-end printers of Stratasys range from Fortus 250mc to Fortus 900mc, with each being different from one another only in terms of size of the output and the number of input materials. While Fortus 400mc costs around $185,000, Fortus 900mc is around $750,000. The company shipped 8,802 units of 3D printers last quarter, taking the total toll of sold units to 84,620.The earlier successful Stratasys-Objet merger resulted in strong revenue growth. The acquisition of MakerBot, a company already leading globally in the 3D printing industry, has helped Stratasys achieve good results. MakerBot earned Stratasys a market share in the consumer segment, also adding to the company's profitability, which will prove to be beneficial for its long-term growth.The MakerBot platform includes three new fifth generation MakerBot replicator 3D printers -- the MakerBot Replicator Desktop 3D printer, MakerBot Replicator Mini Compact 3D printer, and MakerBot Replicator Z18 3D printer. The MakerBot Replicator Mini won the CES 2014 Editors' Choice Award from Popular Mechanics, the CES 2014 Best in Show award by Digital Trends and ZDNet and was named the Best of CES 2014.Stratasys has also acquired two major private companies -- Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies. The acquisition of Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies goes with the company's strategy of acquiring leading companies to achieve its goal of continued leadership in areas where it operates.While Solid Concepts will help Stratasys with its knowledge of manufacturing and focus in medical and aerospace, Harvest Technologies has experience in power production, along with material and system knowhow. The collaboration of Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies with RedEye will increase opportunities for Stratasys in selling systems and services across the company's large customer base.Stratasys has also acquired some assets of Interfacial Solutions. This acquisition is expected to accomplish three objectives for Stratasys -- strengthening the material R&D skills and bandwidth, helping the company become vertically integrated in material development and manufacturing, and increasing material production space and capacity.Better than 3D SystemsStratasys has done a better job of integrating its mergers and acquisitions into its core business than 3D Systems and this is the primary reason why it has a better business model. Stratasys' acquisition of MakerBot has broadly enhanced its business in the consumer segment. Stratasys has been a dominant force in the industrial segment of 3D printing. However, it has lagged in the consumer segment.However, the acquisition of MakerBot brought it right back into the game. 3D Systems, on the other hand, has acquired numerous companies, and the company will definitely struggle to integrate these acquisitions into its core business.Moreover, nearly 50% of M&As tend to fail, which means that the chances that many of 3D Systems' 40+ acquisitions will fail are high. The high number of acquisitions is the primary reason why 3D Systems has been reporting weak profits for the past two quarters. The company claims that it is investing money in order to reap rewards in the future. However, if even half of these acquisitions fail (which is highly likely), 3D Systems will lose a lot of money and lose investors' confidence.In addition, the industrial segment of 3D printing has a much larger potential than the consumer segment, and as things stand, Stratasys is all set to benefit from it. It already has a market share of 54%, as compared to 3D Systems' 20%, and Stratasys is investing in R&D to make better products and add to its wide list of industrial clients.ConclusionEvidently, Stratasys is making some solid moves in the 3D printing market. In fact, it is even better than 3D Systems in terms of growth and because it focuses on the industrial market. Its performance on the stock market has been better than 3D Systems, while Stratasys' acquisition strategy is also sound. So, investors should consider investing in Stratasys instead of 3D Systems.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

More importantly, the underlying trends were particularly worrying with organic growth sinking to 10% (vs. +30% in previous quarters) and the gross margin accelerating its decline (-400bps vs. -130bps in Q1 and flat in Q4 13).These developments are perfectly in line with our scenario (please see our January article ""Competition To Heat Up As Key Patents Expire, Earnings Risk On The Downside""). We have been saying that the expiry of key patents between 2014 and 2017 would spark increased competition and pricing pressures across the industry as open-source hardware printers would be able to integrate laser sintering. These declining ASPs suggest significant pressure on gross margins as prices go down, but costs remain high due to continued investments. Surprisingly, 3D Systems leaves unchanged its EPS guidance despite these issues and its weak Q2 as it factors in the contribution of newly-acquired Simbionix and claims a ""record backlog."" We are not really impressed by this record backlog: as the company grows, so does the backlog. And more importantly, this suggests that it's getting tougher and longer to sign contracts. It's just a question of time before 3D Systems and analysts reset their expectations.In conclusion, we said in our preview that if our thesis about declining ASPs and gross margins proved correct, the stock would gradually move towards our $26 bear-case (for more details please read our February article ""$83 or $26?

In all, 4-D printing is the combination of smart materials that change their shape in response to outside stimuli (water, air, heat or light), with high-resolution 3D printers.Commercial use is not expected before three to five years, but the technology is likely to change the current 3-D printing landscape. Notably, materials will play a key role in 4-D printing and will, in our view, dramatically change the value chain of the printing industry.Therefore, we were not surprised a couple of days ago when Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) announced a partnership with private company Graphene Technologies to ""develop Graphene-enhanced 3D printing materials"". This deal echoes the agreement signed a few months ago by graphite exploration company Lomiko (OTCQX:LMRMF) and Graphene Laboratories to launch ""Graphene 3D Labs"" for the development of graphene-based 3-D printing materials.Even if graphene does not change its shape in response to outside stimuli, it's obviously a material of the future. As we explained in a previous article (""Nokia And The Graphene Opportunity""), graphene is a single layer of graphite carbon atoms, making it the thinnest and toughest material ever created. It is also much more conductive than copper and as flexible as rubber. All these qualities offer huge promises for a large number of applications, from IT & consumer electronics to energy, aerospace, medicine... and to 3-D printing!While plastics and metals are currently the most used materials in 3-D printing, graphene could become a key material in coming years, as it combines the qualities of both plastics and metals: it is extremely strong, yet flexible and lightweight.Potential margin pressure ahead for printer makers?Graphene and the above mentioned smart materials are likely to expand the possibilities offered by 3-D printers, confirming that the 3-D printing top line opportunity is huge in the long term. But once again, we question the margin impact for printer makers.Back in February, we said that due to their rising importance, materials were likely to climb the value chain of the industry over the years, and that material providers were likely to ask for a higher share of the profits on consumables (through notably higher prices) if more complex materials were needed. The fact that Stratasys needs to cooperate with a company like Graphene Technologies on the development of complex materials confirms our view. This suggests that Stratasys is committing opex and/or capex to the project, that it's not able to simply purchase raw materials from a provider and that it is not able to go alone.As the future of printer makers is mainly dependent on the rise of consumables in their revenue mix and on their profitability, these kinds of deals could put some pressure on the profitability of consumables at printer makers in a not-too-distant future. Note that margins on consumables are already extremely high (74.7% at 3D Systems in Q1), offering obviously more downside than upside.In all, this strengthens our view that consensus long-term margin expectations are way too high on 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and peers.ConclusionWe reiterate our negative stance on the 3-D printing sector, and specifically our Sell recommendation on 3D Systems. The stock is currently trading at 67x-44x 2014-2015 EPS, a level which is not justified, in our view, by the company's earnings power (+20%-30% a year, in a best-case scenario).For those willing to invest in the 3-D printing sector in these uncertain times, an interesting and lower-risk strategy remains to go long Stratasys and short 3D Systems. At 45x-30x 2014-2015 EPS, Stratasys' valuation appears much more decent. And importantly, the company is highly innovative (Stratasys is likely to be seen as a pioneer of 4-D printing) and is set to become a dominant force in the consumer business (see the recent deal with Home Depot) that will drive the 3-D printing industry in coming years.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2318115,54222,2014-07-16T13:32:42-04:00,3D Systems is well-positioned to benefit from the healthcare segment.3D Systems' innovations and acquisitions will drive long-term growth.The 37% YTD drop in 3D Systems' valuation represents a great buying opportunity.,"Although 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has taken a massive hammering this year, with shares down 37%, the company is still reporting solid revenue growth. In fact, in the first quarter, 3D Systems reported revenue of $147.8 million, up 45% from the prior-year period, and beat the consensus estimate of $145.5 million.Revenue from 3D printers and other products grew 53% to $60.8 million, and comprised 41% of total revenue, while 3D printers alone contributed $50.7 million. The company is investing rapidly in the business as 3D printing finds more applications. For instance, 3D Systems has made significant progress in the development of the 3D printer platform and materials to support Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Project Ara.A growing market3D printer growth is exceeding all other product categories. There was a unit growth of 54% in printer shipments, including a 76% increase in design and manufacturing printers and a 48% growth in consumer units. 3D Systems is also expanding its regional service, support and logistics operations by setting up local spare parts warehouses in Europe and Japan, which should allow it to tap 3D printing growth in these markets.Healthcare is one of the fastest-growing segments of the company, and it is expanding its applications and reach in this segment. 3D Systems acquired Medical Modeling, a leading provider of 3D printing-enabled patient-specific medical devices and personalized surgical treatments, which include proprietary, virtual, surgical planning and clinical transfer tools.Medical Modeling is focused in the field of 3D printing, delivering personalized surgery and world-class expertise that delivers thousands of surgical planning tools, implant and facial prosthetic devices, annually. The healthcare platform now delivers integrated 3D modeling to printing capability available in both direct metals and by the compatible plastics. This has created the largest 3D printing personalized surgery and patient-specific medical devices, service and product capability available on the market, which helps surgeons with high precision and control in previously inoperable cases.The acquisition of Robtec, a leading 3D printing and scanning product distributor in Latin America, will create a Latin American sales and service platform for 3D Systems. This will help the company cover locations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Mexico via its channel activities.Innovations and acquisitions to drive growthThe company also expects accelerated growth in the consumer category, as it has begun shipping the latest Cube 3, CubePro and iSense scanners, and plans to ship ChefJet, CeraJet and CubeJet 3D printers later this year. 3D Systems' acquisition of Sugar Labs last year is finally going to come into play, as the company recently unveiled two sugar 3D printers called ChefJet and ChefJet Pro. These printers are expected to start shipping in the coming months, and should strengthen 3D Systems' position in the 3D printed food market.While it was obvious, investors were aware of the decrease in profitability, as its earnings declined 28% from last year in the previous quarter. This decreased profitability is a direct outcome of the company's growth strategy of losing short-term profits so as to spend on activities that result in long-term growth and more market share, hence making it a good option for investors.The company has been constantly criticized for overspending on acquisitions. However, it is slowly starting to integrate them into its core business. Its acquisitions should start reaping benefits once 3D Systems successfully integrates them into its core business, and provide a much-needed boost to the company's bottom line.In addition, 3D Systems also announced that it is producing a 3D printer for Google's Project Ara, which is 50 times faster than the 3D printers which are available on the market. The speed factor is currently holding back the widespread use of 3D printing, and if 3D Systems is able to deliver, it is going to receive a massive boost. The company said:The company also explained the working process of this new 3D printing platform; the management said:ConclusionClearly, 3D Systems is making a number of positive moves in the 3D printing industry. Although the company's earnings were down in the last quarter, there's no doubt that it is trying to make the most of the 3D printing market by expanding its product portfolio, by acquiring more companies and investing in research and development. As a result, 3D Systems looks like a good long-term buy.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2312705,24849,2014-07-14T00:08:18-04:00,"3D Systems appeared to have a short squeeze.Investors who took a chance were handsomely rewarded.Short interest in late June declined slightly even with stock's rise.The next short interest update will be interesting.Short squeeze potential remains, and earnings are coming up.","I've spent a lot of time on this site covering moves in short interest, because high short interest can lead to potential short squeezes. If those squeezes come, investors can see large gains in a short period of time. In early June, I detailed the potential for this to happen in shares of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). Things played out mostly as expected, as the stock raced higher and investors that sold made a nice profit. With shares coming back down, I'll detail why we could see this process repeat itself.The details of what played out:When I first discussed the possibility of a squeeze, shares were in the low $50s. In the first half of June, they stayed mostly in the high $40s and low $50s. As we got further away from the investor meeting, shares started to trend higher throughout the rest of June, closing just under $60 when the month ended.While that rally was nice, it was the first day of July where the action really got wild, right after my follow up article on the continued potential for the squeeze. On July 1st, shares opened at $60.50, started to rise and then all of a sudden exploded to a daily high of $69.56. That afternoon, I warned investors to not be too greedy, and by the end of the day shares came down more than $6 from the day's high.It seems as if a squeeze did occur on July 1st. Shares spiked several dollars higher, then fell back quickly, and it was the highest volume day since February 5th. It will be very interesting to see the next update on short interest to see if it came down in a meaningful way. Because this potential squeeze happened on the first day of July, the update I'll discuss next does not cover that day. However, investors that got in right after my article and out on July 1st could have easily made 30% or more. That's a winning trade.Where does short interest stand?Interestingly enough, short interest did not move that much in the second half of June, despite shares rallying back into the high $50s. As you can see in the chart below, short interest dipped by a little less than 5% in the second half of the month.At the end of June, more than 32 million shares were short, which was still up 120% year to date and more than 20% from the year ago period. With a float number around 99 million shares, you still had about a third of the float short at the end of June. Even if short interest drops 25% at the next update, you'd still be looking at roughly a quarter of the float short. Another squeeze is definitely possible, so let's look at what the next potential catalyst could be.Where things stand now:I mentioned in my above linked follow up article that the company raised its revenue guidance at the analyst/investor day. That caused revenue estimates to rise by about 1%, a little more than $7 million. Current estimates stand at $713.82 million for the year, a little below the midpoint of the company's $695-735 million range. Non-GAAP EPS estimates still stand at $0.81.In a couple of weeks, the company will report second quarter results on July 31st. For the quarter, analysts are looking for $162.28 million in revenues, an increase of 34.4% over the prior year period. Non-GAAP EPS are expected to be $0.18, down from $0.20 in the year ago period.Final thoughts:It appears that 3D Systems saw a short squeeze earlier this month, and investors in the stock were handsomely rewarded. Even with shares rising as June ended, short sellers did not seem to cover in large amounts. That helps to further the short squeeze theory and bull case going forward, even if short interest comes down a bit at the next update. In a couple of weeks, the company will report earnings, and that might be the next opportunity for a squeeze if we get good news.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2310635,40031,2014-07-11T10:40:34-04:00,3D printing stocks surged on takeover rumors last week only to give back gains.The sharp selloff in the momentum stocks might weigh on 3D Systems in the short term.There is still plenty of upside left in the long run.3D Systems should get support at two key areas to keep the rally alive.,"It has been interesting to watch 3D printing stocks in the last couple of weeks. In my latest article on 3D printing stocks, I suggested that they are ready to rally, and they proceeded to rise significantly in the next two weeks. The short-term top was achieved last week, when the stocks ran up between 10% and 30% in one day on buyout rumors. As the general market ran into trouble at the start of this week, momentum stocks took a beating, and 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and its peers followed suit. I believe that the state of the general market is the main cause to be concerned and that 3D Systems' share price will suffer if the market keeps going down. However, the long-term prospects for the company and the industry remain upbeat.Takeover rumors and short interest spark a rally and the momentum selloff kills itIn my last article on 3D printing stocks, I laid out the reasons for a rally in 3D printing stocks: most of the companies are delivering robust growth rates, valuations have improved and short interest was high. 3D Systems and its peers proceeded to rally in the following two weeks, and 3D Systems almost hit my $70 price target on July 1, as the high of the day was $69.56. These recent highs were reached after takeover rumors surfaced. 3D Systems cancelled its Pacific Crest conference appearance because of ""management scheduling conflicts."" However, the cancellation has resulted in rumors about a potential takeover. This is essentially good news for 3D Systems and its peers, as it adds to increasing interest for 3D printing and the stocks in the group would trade higher due to acquisition premium pricing. However, if rumors turn out to be unsubstantiated, the group is due to a correction as the premium dissipates, which is what might have already happened, as the stocks pulled back significantly afterwards. I'm sure that further consolidation in the 3D printing space is realistic in the future, but the timing is certainly unknown at the moment. I also believe that 3D Systems is more of a suitor than an acquisition candidate at the moment (given its history of aggressive buying habits), but I would not rule out the possibility that the company is a takeover target.The move up was certainly amplified by high short interest, and it will be interesting to see the short interest numbers for the first half of July. 3D printing stocks pulled back significantly after the initial spike and part of the reason for the move down is the selloff in the momentum stocks this week, which dragged most of the high growth stocks down, and 3D printing stocks were among them. I believe that this is the main reason to be concerned about 3D Systems and its short-term share price. We can see the potential impact of the momentum selloff in 3D Systems' chart, as it went down more than 50% in the first four months of 2014. This move down has accelerated in March, which was the time of the great momentum stock correction, as many stocks went down 50% or more, particularly in the technology and biotech space. If this kind of selloff gets underway once again, 3D Systems might revisit the late April lows or perhaps lower this time.Source: Stockcharts.comThe long-term prospects remain intactThe concerns I highlighted are short-term in nature and may not materialize. The long-term prospects for 3D Systems and the industry remain intact. I laid out the reasons to be bullish on 3D Systems in the long run in my analyst day article:- 3D printing market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 32% from 2013 to 2020, and the global manufacturing market has significant room for the company to expand.- 3D Systems management expects to reach $1 billion in revenue in 2015.- The recent secondary offering strengthens to company's cash position which will be used for more acquisitions in the future.These are some of the reasons to be bullish on the long-term prospects of 3D Systems and the 3D printing industry.Downside risks and support areas3D Systems' share price should get support at $55 and $50, which are the most important short-term areas for the stock. The $50 level is more significant as it served as both support and resistance in the last two months, while the $55 level is roughly the breakout level which the stock penetrated in late June. Additional downside is possible. I have argued in my late May article on 3D Systems that the downside should be limited to $40 to $45 based on the 18-month P/S ratio range, and I believe that this fundamental price range is a very attractive entry for long-term investors and a potential place of major accumulation by institutional investors.Source: Stockcharts.comConclusionThe state of the general market remains the main cause for concern for 3D Systems' investors. The selloff in the momentum space has dragged the stock down this week and might continue to do so in the next couple of weeks. However, the long-term prospects remain intact, and the stock should be trading at a higher level in the future. The reward/risk ratio here is slightly favoring the bull side, as the upside is almost 30%, while the downside is between 20% and 30%. But the upside could be as much as 40% or 50% if the company gets a takeover bid.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2299755,44981,2014-07-04T09:26:03-04:00,The rumors about the takeover has pushed the stock price up over the last two weeks.Fear among the short sellers has been another factor in pushing the stock price up.This fear in short sellers will remain over the next few days amidst the rumors about a takeover.,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has made a strong rally since mid-June and the stock has gained 26% -- in the process, 3D Systems has crossed the psychological barrier of $60 after being range-bound for the past two months. I expected the stock to be range-bound in the short term, which I explained in my previous article. However, some latest developments have pushed the stock price up and the upward trend has started earlier than my expectations. Nonetheless, I believe the stock is ready to push this upward trend further over the next few months as the fundamental growth in the second half of the year will be stronger for the company.One of the biggest factors in pushing 3D Systems over $60 is the rumors about a takeover. The rumors gained momentum when the company canceled an appearance in a conference due to scheduling conflicts for the management - 3D Systems was scheduled to participate in the Pacific Crest Securities conference in August. The cancellation of the participation for the event has prompted the analysts to speculate that the company might be a takeover target. The timing for any takeover might be good for a number of reasons. First of all, the stock is trading substantially lower than its all time high of $96 - the 3D printing sector has lost considerable value over the last few months and the stocks are trading at substantially lower prices than six months ago, which shows that these stocks have lost a considerable speculative premium and trade closer to their fair value. Furthermore, the prospective buyer might believe that a stronger showing during the second half of the year will further add premium to the price and this might be the best time to buy.The second reason might be the enhanced cash position of the company. As I explained in a previous article, the company has strengthened its cash position through the most recent equity issue - you can read about it here. The cash position of the company makes it attractive for the takeover as it enhances the balance sheet of the company. Furthermore, the cash reserves give an advantage to 3D Systems if it wants to pursue a strategic decision such as merger or an acquisition.Finally, one of the most important reasons could be the wider acceptance of the 3D printing technology. We are currently seeing 3D printers getting more attention due to the affordable prices. The technology is currently entering a phase where we might see a robust marker develop for 3D printers over the next 2-3 years. The declining prices of 3D printers will affect the margins of pure 3D printer manufacturers; however, 3D Systems will benefit from a wider acceptance of 3D printers as the company has a strong materials segment, which is a high-margin segment of the company. These factors make it understandable why any prospective buyer would want to acquire 3D Systems in the current market conditions. However, this is all speculation at the moment as no concrete news about the takeover has come out.I believe 3D Systems' rally will continue in the short term, and the upward trend will stretch to the end of the year. One of the reasons for the rally in the short term is the high level of short interest in the stock - at the moment, At 13th June, 3D Systems had almost 34 million shares short according to NASDAQ, with average daily volume of about 3.5 million - this gives the short sellers just under 10 days to cover. The image below was taken from NASDAQ and shows the current short interest in 3D systems.The short interest reported at 13th June has been the highest for 3D systems in the last twelve months, and incidentally, 12th June has been the starting point of the current rally in the stock price. The rise in the stock price along with the rumors about the takeover has startled the short sellers, which has further supported the rally. I believe we will see a considerable decline in the total short interest when NASDAQ publishes the end of month figures for the company. I am expecting the fear to persist in the market and we might see further decline in the short interest as short sellers continue to cover their positions amidst the rumors of a takeover. As a result, I believe the rally in 3D Systems will continue in the short term, and as the year progresses, the company will have a stronger second half of the year, which should support the increase in the stock price.Bottom LineIt was a great opportunity for the long-term investors of the company to add to their positions over the last few months as the stock lost its value. I am expecting a rise in the stock price over the next few months and still maintain my price target of $86 per share. I believe the company is well positioned to benefit from the wider 3D printing market - the growth in the top-line remains strong for the company with organic growth of close to 30%.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Takeover rumors and short covering may have helped the stock reach near the 70 level. I am hoping the company can go back near the $67 price target that Jefferies made when it upgraded DDD to a Buy.Source: Google FinanceI disagree with Citigroup's assessment that 3D Systems' high valuation already makes it an unlikely takeover target. Any company that wants immediate leadership position in additive manufacturing is better off acquiring 3D Systems, rather than develop in-house 3-D printing products.Furthermore, my long-term outlook is that 3D Systems can still thrive as an independent firm. Eleven companies tried to buy Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) but Zuckerberg rejected them all.DDD investors should remain faithful and let the future decide. 3-D printing companies have high valuations today precisely because many investors believe that additive manufacturing has the potential to become widespread like social networking.Intel And Google Helps Robotics and 3-D PrintingIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is scheduled to release a $1,600 robot this coming September. Jimmy the Robot will be the first model to launch from Intel's open source robotics initiative. 3-D printers helped designed the early prototypes of Jimmy. People who buy this two-foot tall robot from Intel can use 3-D printers to customize the looks.Intel wants smart robots to be affordable to be more attractive to consumers. Socially interactive robots like Jimmy may become as ubiquitous as household pets in the future.As a citizen of the Philippines, I am also open to robots helping the millions of domestic helpers that my country exports to other countries.The future house robot will not only be a pet to amuse its owners.

I expect the search giant company to also champion open source, affordable house robots.Intel and Google are investing on robotics because people will eventually adopt smart robots usage as easily as people buy smartphones and tablets now for their everyday need.The Benefits To 3D Systems3D Systems, as a leader in additive manufacturing, will be one of the beneficiaries in the rise of house robots. Intel is using 3D Systems software to help people scan objects in 3D via Intel's RealSense technology. I look forward to Intel promoting 3D Systems products bundling with future Jimmy the Robot kits.3D Systems is already a partner of Google in the Project Ara modular phone venture. Google will likely tap 3D Systems again to help it come up with modular and customizable house robots.3D Systems has a strong lead in direct metal printing with Phenix. Google and Intel-made robot kits will not remain in pure plastic forms. The military and industrial firms will need robots for heavy-duty services.InMoov is another open source initiative that provides open source 3D-printable robot kits. There will be robotics enthusiasts who might Cubify printers to create modifications of Intel's Jimmy the Robot and inMoov. Consumer 3-D printers of today are also getting cheaper.3D Systems may not offer sub-$500 printers now. However, Abe Reichental will have to come up with more affordable Cubify versions if he wants his company to earn more money from the consumer sector. There will come a time when people will not only be printing custom phone covers with Cubify. The future promises the prospect of people 3-D printing custom parts for their Intel or Google-made house robots.ConclusionThe additive manufacturing industry will gain more mainstream adaptation because of Intel and Google's support for robotics. 3D Systems will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the coming rise of affordable and customizable house robots.The Age of Smartphones will eventually evolve into the Age of Smart Robots. Intel processors and Google's Android OS ecosystem will not remain exclusive to PCs, phones, and tablets. The Internet of Things also includes the promise of web-connected intelligent robots.I remain long in DDD and it is the only 3-D printing stock I am betting on.

The company's new fab-grade printer exceeds the productivity of traditional injection molding.Consistent growth in revenue and earnings point toward the management's ability to execute.","3-D printing, or additive manufacturing, has been around since the 80s. However, this technology gained the attention of the masses quite recently, thanks to improving print speeds, decreasing costs and the expanded material-base of 3-D printing. Because of these improvements, it can be observed that industry projections are moving in a favorable direction. Wohlers' report estimated that 3-D printing sales will reach $6 billion by 2017. Wohlers (2013) estimates were an improvement when compared to the 2011 estimates. On the other hand, Canaly projected that 3-D printing will reach $16.2 billion by 2018. All in all, 3-D printing is set to grow, and I have several reasons to believe that 3D Systems (NYSE: DDD) is the company that is well-positioned to benefit from the growth prospects of the industry. The reasons are as follows:All bases covered (Source: 3D Systems Investor Presentation)The industry will grow, but it is not fully clear where this growth will come from. Well, let me rephrase the question. Which industry, material or business-model will drive the growth of 3-D printing? The answer is unclear for now, and hence 3D Systems is covering all the bases to capitalize on the growth, wherever it arises.3-D printing is proving to be useful in pre-op surgery planning, personalized surgery and patient specific implants.Moreover, Transparency Market Research projects that 3-D printing for patient-specific medical devices will reach $965.5 million by 2019, translating to a CAGR of 15.4% (2013-2019).Aerospace also holds promise for 3-D printing. According to MarketsandMarkets, ""The stringent requirements such as light weight and accurate and precise design requirements for airplanes parts are the major driving factors behind the growth of 3D printing in the aerospace industry, over traditional manufacturing methods."" According to Lockheed Martin, 3-D printing can result in cost savings of around 48%. Aerospace parts are complex, and 3-D printing is a favorable solution because of the flat costs of 3-D printing, irrelevant to the complexity of the manufactured part. See the graph below to clear things up. (Source: 3D Systems Investor Presentation)As 3D Systems is engaged with the high-growth industries (from a 3-D printing perspective) of medical and aerospace, it will benefit from the growth in these industries.3D Systems also has a breadth of materials ranging from plastics to metals. Plastics can be used in consumer-oriented printers, while metals can be used for manufacturing industrial-grade parts. 3D Systems is positioned to grow in either the case of wide adoption of the plastics or that of the metals for 3-D printing applications.Moreover, the company doesn't build printers only. It also provides parts-printing services. Lux Research believes that most of the 3-D printing revenue will come from parts-printing by 2025. A $7 billion part-production opportunity by 2025 is projected by the research firm.(Source: Lux Research, Inc.)Moreover, if parts-printing develops to be a high-margin business model, 3D Systems can capitalize on that.Overall, there are varying projections, and hence, there is uncertainty about where most of the growth will come from. Unlike others, 3D Systems has covered all the bases, and it will benefit the most from the growth of the industry, due to its extended exposure to almost all the aspects of 3-D printing.Printing speed: A key to successThe opponents of production scale 3-D printing argue that 3-D printers are too slow to replace conventional manufacturing techniques. These arguments were true to some extent until now. However, the speed of 3-D printing has been improving lately. 3D Systems claims that its new fab-grade 3-D printer exceeds the productivity of traditional injection molding in direct manufacturing of functional parts. Speed was one of the two reasons (cost is the other reason) that 3-D printing was not successful against injection molding. 3D Systems resolved this problem, and now the company is set to take its share of the $8 billion functional prototyping industry.(Source: orcinternational.com)Moreover, if material costs drop in the future, 3D Systems will also have a shot on the global injection-molded plastics market, which is set to reach $252 billion in 2018, according to Transparency Market Research. Capturing a mere 2% share of this market will be huge for 3D Systems. To review, the improvement in printing speed brought about by the fab-grade 3-D printer is opening new avenues of growth for 3D Systems.Financial performance and the future outlook(Source: 3D Systems Investor Presentation)3D Systems has been showing consistent growth in its revenue and earnings, indicating stable growth in the market, along with the company's ability to execute. The revenue guidance for 2014 is raised by $15 million, and management is confident about achieving $1 billion in annual revenue in 2015. The margin is also healthy, which is very important for a company operating in this high-growth industry. It is because positive margin eventually adds to the cash flow of the company. And the cash flows are used to satisfy the CAPEX needs of a growing company. All in all, a healthy margin is a positive aspect as far as 3D Systems is concerned.Bottom lineAnalysts and researchers are frequently upgrading their forecasts about the industry. 3-D printing is all set to grow. 3D Systems will be the primary beneficiary because of its wide 3-D printing presence. In fact, the record-breaking print speed of its fab-grade printer will lead the growth of the 3-D printing industry. The financials also look good, and it seems that 3D Systems is the best bet if someone wants to hop on the 3-D printing bandwagon.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Athletic application of additive manufacturing is a solid future revenue avenue.3D Systems has a strong lead in healthcare applications. It has products that can help injured athletes and ordinary patients.Technical indicators say DDD is still worth buying, in spite of its recent double-digit surge.","I do not like soccer, but I'm a diehard fan of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). I'm not interested in joining the heavy betting on the current World Cup competition. I cannot tolerate tedious soccer games, but I enjoyed DDD's recent surge.It looks like the market is falling in love again with DDD. The stock has rallied 19.64%+ in less than two weeks.Source: Google FinanceI don't care who the best soccer players on the planet are. I only want to thank the 3D Systems believers who helped DDD stay above $26. The heavy shorting of DDD failed to bring it down to $40.The recent surge of DDD can be attributed to the raised guidance from 3D Systems' management. On the other hand, I'd like to believe that soccer is also one of the three reasons why I still am staying with 3D Systems.1. 3D Systems Technology Can Help Soccer PlayersNike (NYSE:NKE) will most likely use 3D Systems' printers or software to create 3-D printed cleats for soccer shoes, like it did with the football-centric Vapor series. Nike is a featured client on 3D Systems' YouTube channel.I have no real data to support my speculative claim. I used common sense - Nike won't be included in 3D Systems' promo videos if it is not a client of 3D Systems. Two years ago, Nike was using 3D Systems' ZPrinters.Nike also probably used 3D Systems products to create a bag for soccer players. It is a minor matter if I'm wrong about my assumptions. The important thing is that Nike is using 3-D printing to help improve athletic shoes.(Source: Nike)Adidas also used two Cube printers to demonstrate the potential of additive manufacturing in athletic wear. Adidas was a client of Z Corporation, which 3D Systems bought in 2012.Investors should appreciate the fact that 3D Systems is likely attracting the support of sportswear behemoths like Nike and Adidas. I hope 3D Systems will also acquire a company that is engaged in 3-D printing clothing, like Electroloom.Athletic performance is not enhanced only through custom shoes. Individualized t-shirts, sweatpants, and other gear can also help athletes improve their game.2. 3D Systems Is Strong In HealthcareBased on the document released by 3D Systems, the company is the leading player in 3-D printing-assisted dental and medical services. The acquisition of Medical Modeling and Phenix Systems gave 3D Systems a big foothold in dental and medical applications.3D Systems can help surgeons repair broken bones and facial/body injuries. The company can provide the printers and software products to quickly produce personalized surgical solutions to patients.Source: 3D Systems3. Technical Indicators Says DDD Is Still Worth BuyingThe recent climb of DDD is supported by technical indicators. Barchart Opinion puts 3D Systems as a Buy. Short-term indicators average is 100% Buy. There's a big chance that DDD's upward momentum will continue this week.Ten analysts at BarChart see DDD as a Buy, which should further support the short-term technical indicators. The technical indicators of MacroAxis also sees DDD in a positive trend.Source: Charts from MacroAxisConclusionThe technical indicators and the 10 BarChart analysts' bullish assessment convinced me that DDD can still go higher. I firmly believe 3D Systems can help Nike and Adidas come up with highly personalized athletic gears to make professional and amateur soccer players perform better.3-D printed shin guards and other protective gears can minimize injuries to highly paid professionals like Ronaldo. Phenix printers and Medical Modeling can also help surgeons install accurate replacement medical part for broken bones.I am not interested over which country will win the World Cup. I am only rooting for 3D Systems to become the undisputed champion of additive manufacturing. The current higher P/E and P/S ratios of DDD hints that more investors like this momo ticker.Lastly, 3D Systems also released the iSense 3D Scanner accessory for the iPad. Affluent Apple tablet owners will not mind the $499 price tag of the iSense. Some of them will buy the iSense to scan their feet, so they can order a more accurate pair of custom shoes.The shoe industry continues to ignore the issue that most right-handed humans also come with a bigger right foot. 3D Systems could help people get correct-sized shoes for their left and right feet.DDD is a Buy for both near-term and long-term investors.Disclosure: The author is long DDD.

2292775,54222,2014-06-30T11:08:23-04:00,"3D Systems is aggressively investing in its business to make the most of the big 3-D printing opportunity.3D Systems' acquisition of Medical Modeling should allow it to penetrate the lucrative medical 3-D printing market.3D Systems has strong fundamentals, and its earnings growth is expected to outpace the broader industry going forward.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is having a really bad time in 2014 as its shares have declined almost 36%, primarily because of its declining earnings. The company's last reported first quarter wasn't up to expectations as a result, even though it delivered a 45% jump in revenue. In fact, 3D Systems' earnings dropped 28% year-over-year, while its guidance was also below expectations. However, 3D Systems is a growth stage company, and its bottom line is bound to take a few hits as it looks for growth.A huge opportunity aheadIn my opinion, 3D Systems is doing the right thing by focusing on growth, as it is trying to capture the 3-D printing market as much as possible. This is a smart move, as the market is expected to grow in leaps and bounds going forward. According to a CNBC report:Tapping the market successfullyIn fact, 3D Systems is already tapping this fast-growing market quite effectively. In the first quarter, it experienced terrific demand for various products and services. It saw 76% unit sales growth in the professional segment. In addition, the growth rate of its materials business was a record 41%, led by sales of advanced 3-D printers. Moreover, 3D Systems exited the quarter with 17.9 million printer orders, indicating strong demand for the company's Direct Metal 3-D printers. In fact, demand for its printers outstripped manufacturing capacity.Going forward, 3D Systems plans to expand into new applications, with new product materials and services such as Direct Metal 3-D printers and Multi Metal 3-D printers that are capable of printing fully functional parts and assemblies. Besides, the company is also engaged in promoting its 3-D printing 2.0 capabilities, and demonstrated it at the Atlantic Design Show to increase awareness regarding this technology. These will certainly help the company to capture the 3-D printing market in a big way.The company believes that 3-D printing 2.0 will form the future of 3-D printing as it features high speed, multi-material and fab-grade 3-D printing developments. Moreover, management is focused on driving growth for products and services with various key initiatives and concrete investments in R&D.3D Systems is also concentrating on its consumer segment that grew 150% in the previous quarter. The company has already begun shipping the recently launched Cube3, CubePro, and iSense scanners, which will accelerate its growth in the consumer category in the second half of 2014. Also, the company is gaining traction in the market with new consumer products such as ChefJet, CeraJet, and CubeJet 3-D printers. 3D Systems is also planning to roll out commercial shipments in these categories in the second half of the year to further strengthen its position.Acquisitions should help growthMoreover, 3D Systems is also focusing on acquisitions in order to enrich the customer experience. It recently acquired Medical Modeling to penetrate the rapidly growing healthcare category. This is a solid move on the company's part because it is estimated that medical 3-D printing is worth billions of dollars. According to 3DPrint.com:Since Medical Modeling has FDA-cleared processes and cutting-edge expertise, and has the experience of delivering thousands of surgical planning tools and facial prosthetic devices, it should allow 3D Systems to increase its presence in the medical category dramatically.Fundamentals, Valuations, and ProjectionsIn addition, 3D Systems' fundamentals, valuations, and projections are also in its favor. It currently trades at a trailing P/E of 139, which might seem expensive, but a forward P/E of 49 indicates that terrific growth is expected in the future. Analysts have predicted that 3D Systems' earnings will grow at a CAGR of 22% for the next five years, higher than the industry average of 15.26%.Moreover, the company has a positive debt profile and a strong cash position. 3D Systems has cash of $307 million on the balance sheet, while its debt stands at less than $19 million. Now, considering the prospects in the 3-D printing industry and the strategic moves of 3D Systems, it looks like a good bet.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2296095,58641,2014-07-02T00:26:42-04:00,DDD is now higher than my March buy-in price of $62. Takeover rumors might be one of the reasons for the big July 1 rally.It took a long time for this heavily shorted stock to recover but I’m glad the bull case is now getting stronger for 3D Systems.Short-sellers trying to cover their bets will likely continue to contribute to the upside run of DDD this week.Short-term Technical indicators for 3-D Systems are still hinting more upside potential.,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) posted a huge 6.12% jump yesterday. This most-shorted 3-D stock is now again trading above my average March buy-in price of $62. DDD fans should celebrate this momentous occasion by drinking 3 beers. After more than three months of a roller coaster bearish run, the stock market is again hot for DDD.What happened yesterday was a big contrast to what a Benzinga writer published. DDD certainly did not fall $5. The after-hours trading yesterday confirms that DDD went up to $63.50. The big rally of DDD yesterday was in spite of the report that 3D Systems will not be attending the Pacific Crest Securities next month. The Bloomberg article is insinuating that the cancellation might further add speculations over a takeover scenario for 3D Systems.Shorts Covering Their PositionI share the same view that 3D Systems is ripe to be taken over by Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Epson, or even Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). However, I think that big rally yesterday is due to shorts failing buying shares to cover their position. 3D Systems is the most shorted among additive manufacturing tickers.Source: Nasdaq/Yahoo FinanceThe unusually high trading volume of 20,448,872 of shares yesterday was more than five times the average. I believe this is again likely due to shorts covering their bets. The buy-side crowd is winning because the bear case for DDD is hard to sell when Bloomberg proliferates takeover rumors of 3D Systems.Takeover RumorsTakeover rumors are strong market movers. Remember that DDD went up significantly last year due to the November 2013 rumors that it was a takeover target. I believe that these earlier speculations contributed hugely to the big run-up of DDD to hit a 52-week high of $97.28.I hope this new round of speculations of DDD as an M&A target helps the stock recover some of what it lost this year. Mega-cap companies like Hewlett Packard, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Google can certainly afford to buy DDD.3D Systems is Google's major partner for its Project Ara modular phone venture. Google did not mind paying $3.2 billion for a thermostat startup company. Google might also be willing to buy 3D Systems to complement its robotics and Internet of Things ambitions. Google is better off buying 3D Systems than creating its own 3-D printer.Hewlett-Packard is the leading inkjet/laser printer company. Unfortunately, it does not have any real background in additive manufacturing. It will take a long time for HPQ to develop 3-D printers. Whitman can just buy 3D Systems to expedite her company's entry to enterprise-centric 3-D printing.ConclusionLike I mentioned in previous article, I'm still very bullish on DDD because short-term technical indicators from BarChart Opinion still gives 3D Systems an average rating of 100% Buy. Ten analysts at BarChart also share my Buy recommendation for DDD.Experts and technical indicators say DDD is still a Buy for the near-term. The improved guidance is certainly a good reason why DDD is shooting up. However, the market-wide tech short-squeeze is also benefiting 3D Systems and other 3-D printing stocks.Momo tickers like those involved in additive manufacturing are on a 30-day bull run.Lastly, a takeover rumor is always a good incentive for speculators to invest in any Mergers & Acquisition target. There is a good chance that DDD's upside run will continue this week. I will end this write-up with this forecast chart from MacroAxis.Source: MacroAxisDisclosure: The author is long DDD, AAPL.

2291905,24849,2014-06-30T02:16:10-04:00,3D Systems' short interest continues higher.Short squeeze potential even greater now.Company recently raised 2014 revenue guidance.,"In early June, I detailed the potential for 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) to see a major short squeeze. The highly debated name saw its short interest hit a new yearly high, despite shares being very close to their 52-week lows. I thought this combination was very dangerous for shorts, and could provide a decent opportunity for investors.Well, a couple of weeks later, I'm here to provide an update on the situation. Since my original article, short interest has increased to another new high. Additionally, the company raised its yearly revenue range. Shares are up since my last report, but I still believe further gains are possible. Today, I'll detail why.Another high for short interest:I thought that short interest in this name was high enough the last time I reported on it. At that point, more than 33.3 million shares were short, representing a jump of nearly 127% so far in 2014. Well, as you can see in the chart below, after a brief dip at the end of May update, the mid-June update saw another rise to a new high.The latest update showed just under 34 million shares short, almost 650,000 more shares short than in my prior article. Short interest is now up by roughly 19.27 million shares in 2014, or more than 131%. The days to cover ratio also continues to be around 10, meaning it would take about two full weeks of trading volume for all shorts to cover.During the first two weeks of June, 3D Systems shares were trading mostly around $50. In the last couple of weeks, the stock has rallied a bit, closing Friday at its highest point since late March. It is certainly possible that some short covering has taken place. Although, some could argue that as the price has risen, even more shorts may have piled in. We'll get the end of June short interest update in mid-July.Revenue forecast raised, analyst estimates up:I mentioned in my previous article that the company had an upcoming analyst/investor day, and that could be a catalyst for the stock. Perhaps the biggest takeaway from the event was that the company raised its revenue forecast for 2014. The company increased its range by $15 million, so the new range is for $695 million to $735 million. The company did not change its EPS forecast, keeping the $0.73 to $0.85 range.Going into that analyst/investor day, the street was looking for approximately $706.1 million in revenues. Obviously, estimates have risen since then, with the current average calling for $713.8 million. That's slightly below the middle of the company's range, but it still would represent 39% year over year growth. Analysts are still at $0.81 in EPS for the year. My guess is that the company left its EPS range unchanged to account for the dilution from the equity sale.Final thoughts:Short interest in 3D Systems hit another new yearly high at the mid-June update, which seems to be increasing the chances of a short squeeze. The company recently raised its 2014 revenue forecast, and the stock has been trending higher in the last few weeks. For now, I think the long side is favored, until we see a noticeable decline in short interest.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2277793,63753,2014-06-19T16:10:17-04:00,3D Systems bottomed out just below $50 and started to rally after increased revenue forecast.Organic growth is expected to remain at 30% for 2015 while margins will increase.Carefully timing your call and put options will maximize your gains.,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has taken a massive correction in the past few months, losing nearly half its value from its 52-week high of $98 per share. However, it looks like DDD bottomed out and started its rally after its recent Investor and Analyst Day.Why DDD CrashedThat was simple. Both DDD and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) got way ahead of themselves, along with ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE). Normally, hyper growth stocks in the tech sector with growth between 30%-50% goes for a PS ratio of around 10. It may be slightly up or down depending on forecast and PE and EPS.There were no explanations for the inflating stock prices besides hype. Whenever there's a hype, there will be a correction. The moment came when DDD announced that it would invest more money into R&D causing its EPS to be cut in half. This sent the PE ratio higher and created a catalyst for the bear camp to short the stock. It was a double blow to DDD, as its PS and PE ratios were inflated, causing a massive correction. Those who shorted the stock above $90 were rewarded with a nice profit.Why DDD Bottomed OutDDD is now back to its appropriate PS ratio of 9.8, but PE ratio of 126 is still out of whack. Looking at the charts above, both volume and stock price seem to have stabilized. The DMA is showing a bottomed out curve and slightly upward trend thanks to a positive forecast.Source: Yahoo FinanceThe forecast from the Investor and Analyst Day had some very positive highlights:1. $1B Revenue for 20152. Margins are expected to increase in 2015 (55%-60%)3. Forecast for 2014 is raised by $15M to $695-$735M4. EPS is expected to remain the same even after the recent secondary offering5. Promising new technology that is increasing jetting speed by 50x6. Consumer revenue to increase in 2H 2014 due to additional new products and partnershipsInvestor confidence increased after the forecast and the sentiment for DDD is mostly bullish. This caused the stock to stabilize and recover slightly from $49 to $53. There are more important reasons why DDD won't head back to the low-mid $40s range.1. Organic growth is still expected to be 30% for the next year2. DDD is mostly debt free, with only $19M in debt and over $306M in cashSource: Yahoo FinanceDDD's business operations bear very little risks with its high margins, low debt, and plenty of cash on hand. DDD is also cash flow positive. There are very few financial risks associated with its expansion. The only risk I see is if it accelerates its acquisition spree, burning up all the cash. That route will force DDD into issuing more shares to fund acquisitions causing dilutions for shareholders.How To Strategize For Maximum GainsThe account I manage has both margin trading and options. This allows me to maximize my gains through a combination options and long positions. The investor sentiment is bullish, and the stock shows clear signs of bottoming out. In order to maximize my gains, I need to leverage my money with options while reducing my risk of the tiny chance for another massive correction.Buying call options when you see that bottom or close to it will set you up for a nice gain on the rebound. For me, I bought in when the share price was around $50 flat with a cost of about $3 each expiring July 19. My order for common shares did not go through since it never hit my price target of $47. If it did, it would be ideal. But because of volatility, I don't take any chances of overpaying, even if I miss the chance. The call options are safer and will end up making more money overall. Long positions would hold up more of my money for other positions that may see a dip. Therefore, I try to catch long positions only dips to make sure holding up my money leads to good ROI.In this situation, I don't recommend an instant straddle at the same price. This is because the chances of the stock continuing upward is much higher than sinking. The PS ratio and forecasts are excellent with some room to grow. Whenever there's a spike in share price, I would buy puts for dirt cheap, preferably under $1 at the highest strike price possible. There will probably be one if the 3D printing industry or SSYS/EXONE receive good news. If not, there's no point in buying puts, since probability is in my favor. All I have to do is time the sell during a big spike.Depending on whether you can get a favorable price for your puts, you should sell some calls to recover the money invested and eliminate any risk of losing money. Hold the rest to see how high it can go and cash out right under $60. At $60 per share, DDD's PS ratio starts to get out of whack again. There's no point in taking the risk of another correction.Remember that options are even more dependent on timing than long positions. Common shares do not have expirations, and you can literally wait out a correction. Options can expire worthless, so you don't have that luxury. You can buy long term options, but then you are paying much higher premiums and thus lowering your gain percentage. Depending on how well DDD performs in July, I have a choice of either exercising the remaining options or cashing in. That's why having a margin account can be great when you trade options. Exercising options with margin accounts only tie up a percentage of your cash depending on your margin percentage.Final ThoughtsOverall, I am very bullish on 3D Systems. It has a large portfolio of patents that is unique. Its industrial printers are high margins with steady growth. The consumer products will continue to be a small part of its revenue until 3D printers are more practical economically and functionally. I don't see any financial problems that could affect its operations or expansions. Investor confidence is picking up, and the business is expected to be more efficient with improving margins. We still have not seen any definitive product announcement from Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ). It may be a threat, but not any time soon. Even if HP enters the market, I don't think there would be much competition with DDD, since the 3D printing market is still in hyper growth. It is not a zero sum game for the foreseeable future.DDD's net income is currently only $43M, which is the reason why the PE ratio is over 100. It's not hard for 3D Systems to double net income and effectively cut the PE ratio in half. That could happen next year with the expected higher gross margins. If that happens, DDD's share price should rally by a good amount. The bears had their turn, and it's time to be bullish with DDD again.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in DDD over the next 72 hours.

2299375,67835,2014-07-04T00:50:10-04:00,"The 3D printing market is real, and is now trading at an attractive entry point.3D Systems has a strong focus on growth through acquisitions, which have not proven accretive for the stock price other than garnering attention through headlines.Stratasys offers a superior product at a discount based on forward multiples.SSYS leads DDD in the industrial and consumer sectors, which seem to have the strongest long-term potential.","I first initiated large positions in Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), and a small position ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) last fall prior to the huge run up in price. At that time, my knowledge of the 3D printing market was minimal at best, and I was entering based solely off the momentum I believed would carry the prices higher. I ultimately sold DDD and XONE in early February once the 3D market started being sold off. I maintained my position in SSYS and lowered my cost-basis at the dip when I got in around $95. In the long term, I believe SSYS is poised to significantly outpace the broader 3D market, specifically DDD as these are currently the two major players.Is the 3D printing market real or just hype?This question has had drastic implications for the greater 3D printing market, and I am here to tell you it is 100% real. I prefer to invest in companies that offer products and services to a variety of industries, and 3D printing is a market that does just that. 3D printing has the ability to revolutionize the manufacturing industry by increasing efficiency and margins for manufacturers, and has strong demand from a multitude of industries such as the automotive market, defense industry, education, etc. While this hype resulted in a mini-bubble in January and February, the sell-off resulted in stock prices that demanded high multiples not due to hype, but due to growth expectations. The market as a whole is expected to grow at a stellar rate as high as 45.7% annually through FY2018. This growth rate would result in a market of over $16 billion.Companies like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) recognize the potential of this technology and how it can transform their business to cater to the everyday consumer. In-store manufacturing of goods would drastically reduce costs for Wal-Mart, while also providing the consumer means to acquire products such as replacement parts which usually take 2-3 days to deliver. General Electric (NYSE:GE) will begin using 3D printing to manufacture fuel nozzles for jet engines which will be both lighter and more durable then nozzles manufactured by traditional techniques. These fuel nozzles represent the greater potential of 3D printing for on-the-spot manufacturing of any type of product from jewelry to children's toys to electronics.The business model of 3D printing companies is similar to traditional printers in which the actual machine is sold at fairly low margins and the materials (ink in traditional printers) are sold at extremely high margins. As the industry transitions from the sale of printers to the sale of materials, margins will undoubtedly rise in conjunction with earnings. In summary, the fact that some of the largest companies are forging business partnerships with (or possibly trying to acquire) various 3D printing companies shows the potential growth for this market as a whole.So who stands to benefit?As this market continues its rise, SSYS is in the best position to outperform its peers due to a far more proven management and more sustainable business plan. Stratasys outperforms 3D Systems in a few key areas including, but not limited to: the consumer market, industrial market, and acquisition quality.Stratasys acquired MakerBot last Fall in an effort to boost its consumer presence and branch out from its roots where it has dominated in the industrial sector. This set up a battle of sorts between SSYS and DDD to see who could roll out the best consumer-friendly printer. So far, it seems that the MakerBot has significantly outperformed the Cube 3, giving SSYS the early lead in a race that will surely take years to play out. Even by looking through Amazon reviews for the two printers, it is clear that consumers prefer the MakerBot. Wall Street analysts tend to agree and consensus estimates show revenue derived from MakerBot sales growing at a clip over 50% through FY2016. While the consumer market may seem like the smallest market because of practical reasons, as the technology for the MakerBot improves and expands into new areas, it will inevitably lead to higher sales.In terms of acquisitions, DDD's strategy seems to be to make as many headlines as possible, while SSYS kept a fairly low profile up until its MakerBot acquisition. The sheer amount of M&A at DDD may make it seem like the superior company, but management has not proven an ability to derive significant revenue from many of these acquisitions. In addition, many of them simply do not gel and make the overall business strategy seem haphazard, evident in the fact that it has made over 50 deals in the past three years. In contrast, SSYS has been very strategic about acquisitions and all have been significantly accretive to the stock price. SSYS also boasts over $600 million of cash on hand and no debt, giving it the ability to continue focusing on M&A activity that builds upon the strong, pre-existing segments of the company.The industrial sector could very well end up having the largest market considering how 3D printing could redefine the traditional design-to-manufacture method. It is this market that I predict SSYS can truly dominate as well. With a 54% market share versus DDD's 20%, SSYS is already beginning to differentiate itself from competitors. The barriers to entry into the industrial sector are significantly higher than the consumer market, and demand a lot of R&D. SSYS continues investing heavily to better its already superior product. There is no reason to think SSYS will lose the competitive advantage in its technology and should continue raking in a larger market share in the coming years.ValuationSSYS could very well be the superior company, but valuing its growth prospects is important to gauge the upside for both companies. It is hard to define a peer group for 3D printing companies since there are limited amounts that are actually involved in the printer distribution segment. Because of this, comparable companies' analysis is nearly impossible. Instead, I ran a DCF for each company. I ran the same exact model for each company, just switching out the assumptions. Below are the forecast drivers and sensitivity analysis for DDD.I applied the same WACC (discount rate) and EV/EBITDA multiple to both DDD and SSYS. News since I made this model would infer that the price target for DDD should be towards the upper right portion of the sensitivity analysis (around $68/share). Assumptions for SSYS include revenue growth of 47% in FY2014 with 7% decreases each subsequent year before bottoming out at 26%. I expect net margins to stay constant in the 18-20% range over the next 5 years as well. All other assumptions were made in line with historical averages unless significant activity demanded otherwise. The DCF resulted in a $135 price target with the sensitivity analysis looking the exact same.The chart below shows the Trailing PEG ratios for both companies over the last 5 years. It is clear that SSYS looks to be much cheaper based on the current price and future earnings potential of the company. While the current P/E ratio of over 110 may scare some investors, the forward P/E of 65 shows just how much earnings for SSYS are expected to grow.RisksRisks to my analysis include a technology breakthrough for either DDD or another competitor that eats up a large share of SSYS's market. Also, the high multiples the 3D printing market leaves a lot of room for a decrease in stock price if negative news were to hit the industry.ConclusionEven after the recent run up in price, I believe SSYS is a solid buy primed for growth that will outpace the broader 3D printing market. I would suggest purchasing at current price levels and adding on major dips over the next few years, as this is a long-term hold in my mind. I maintain a positive outlook on the industry as a whole, and while I believe SSYS is the strongest company right now, I am not suggesting to short DDD by any means.Disclosure: The author is long SSYS.

2274163,56382,2014-06-18T04:28:02-04:00,"3D Systems might be positioned to benefit from a fast-growing 3D printing industry, but competitors such as Hewlett-Packard will make the going difficult.The expiry of patents will hurt 3D Systems.Too many acquisitions are hurting 3D Systems, and the company even diluted shareholder value recently to make more acquisitions.Disruptive innovations in the 3D printing industry might hurt 3D Systems going forward.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is not in the best of health this year. Although the company reported good growth in revenue in the last-reported first quarter, its earnings plunged on the back of investments to grow the business. This looks like a smart move, as analysts expect the 3D printing industry to grow at a stupendous rate of 45% per year till 2018, hitting a size of $16.2 billion, according to Canalys.But, this massive growth in the 3D printing industry is attracting more competitors that are challenging 3D Systems. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), for example, recently announced that it will be entering the business 3D printing market, intensifying the competition in the industry. But, besides HP, there are five other important reasons that could hurt 3D Systems going forward. Let's check them out.Intense competitionAs discussed earlier, the prospects of the 3D printing industry look enticing, which is attracting many big players. Hewlett-Packard is now gearing up to enter this market. Last month, HP CEO Meg Whitman revealed the company's plans for the 3D printing market. As reported on 3DPrint.com, Whitman said:In addition, HP's strong financial position will be a key reason why it can establish its presence in the 3D printing market. It has a cash balance of $15 billion and spends handsomely on research and development, which gives it enough fire power to address the 3D printing opportunity.Patents to expireMany 3D printing patents are expiring. As a result, 3D Systems' royalty fees will take a hit. Another threat for the company is that the patent expiry will allow many small companies to take a bite of the 3D printing opportunity. Earlier, as the smaller companies were not able to afford the royalty fees, they stayed away from the market and waited for the patents to expire. For example, the foray of venture capitalists such as Harbour Capital Group, will lead to growth in the number of start-ups looking to address the 3D printing opportunity.Too many acquisitions3D Systems has made aggressive acquisitions which have hurt its profit margins. In fact, the company has acquired more than 40 companies in the past few years, and it isn't done yet. Recently, 3D Systems diluted shareholder value by going for a secondary offering. It offered 5.95 million shares, raising around $317 million. The company will use the proceeds to make more acquisitions.The problem is that these acquisitions don't seem to be reaping any results. Ideally, acquisitions should lead to earnings accretion, but this hasn't happened. In the first quarter, 3D Systems' earnings declined 17% year over year, even though the company continued its rapid acquisition pace.Speed and pricingHigh price and low speed are the two main hurdles in 3D Systems' growth story in the industrial business. If 3D Systems plans to bring out a new 3D printer with lower price and higher speed, it will need to make aggressive investments in various R&D initiatives. On the other hand, its rivals such as HP stand strong with a robust R&D budget and are in a better position to invest in the development of low-cost high speed 3D printers.As reported by Reuters earlier this year:Besides, many companies are making advances to develop super fast 3D printers. For example, Cincinnati Inc. has entered into a partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory to develop super fast 3D printers. The projected printing speed of these printers might be 200 to 500 times faster than the existing 3D printers. In addition, they are expected to be capable of printing components that would be 10 times larger.ConclusionSo, 3D Systems is facing threats from a number of quarters. Also, there are a number of investors betting against the stock, as evidenced by a short float of 32.7%. In addition, the stock is very expensive at 125 times last year's earnings, and considering that its earnings are declining, it doesn't make sense to invest in 3D Systems.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2264463,40031,2014-06-11T17:55:22-04:00,"FY 2014 guidance raise was not enough for 3D Systems, as investors pushed the share price below $50.The company laid out the plan for strong revenue growth in the next two years, and strong expectations for the 3D printing industry through 2020.EPS guidance was reaffirmed, and while this is somewhat disappointing, margin expansion is coming in 2015.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) finished lower almost 2% after the analyst day, as investors were not satisfied with the information the company provided. The revenue guidance hike was a good to see, but somewhat disappointing, given that it reflects the recent acquisitions, while the reaffirming of the EPS guidance was not encouraging at first. However, the company laid out encouraging growth trajectories for its business and for the 3D printing industry. The company also said that operating leverage should return in the second half of 2015, and we should see solid earnings growth in 2015 and beyond, together with robust revenue growth. Although the share price might continue to consolidate in the next few weeks, I believe that my $70 price target is reachable by the end of the year.Analyst day highlights3D Systems raised its FY 2015 revenue guidance from $680 million to $720 million to a new range of $695 million to $735 million. The mid-range of the new estimate ($715 million) is now closer to my expectations for $720 million, and I still expect that 3D Systems should deliver or slightly exceed my revenue expectations. On the other hand, the company reaffirmed its previous EPS guidance range of $0.73 to $0.85, but it should be noted that the guidance now includes the equity offering and all the acquisitions that the company has done so far. So, essentially, this should be regarded as good news, since the equity offering should have shaved off a few cents from the EPS guidance. However, investors were not impressed by the presentation, as the share price moved lower to end the day below $50.These lines have also caught my attention:1. The company expects that the 3D printing market will grow at a compounded growth rate of 32% from 2013 to 2020 (Wholers report is the source for the company estimate). On the other hand, Gartner expects an 81.9% CAGR from 2012 through 2017.2. 3D Systems expects to reach $1 billion in revenue in 2015. Analyst estimates for 2015 are currently at $917 million, so there is room for upside revisions.3. The global manufacturing market presents a $10.5 trillion opportunity, and the 3D printing market accounts for just 0.1% of the market. There is a large market for the 3D printing industry to grow into, and if 3D printing was just 1% of the overall manufacturing market, the size of the market would be around $105 billion, or 10 times larger than it is today.4. The company expects flat gross margins in the second half of 2014. The gross margin should be between 55% and 60% once the company's revenue is above $750 million. Higher margins should be achieved with higher materials and software revenue as well as from higher healthcare and services revenue.However, most of these figures are not new, as the company stated its $1 billion revenue target in 2015 previously, and the Gartner and Wholers reports were already out for some time. What is important here is for the management to deliver on its promises. The acquisition-fueled growth path is expected to continue, and the company may deliver above the current views if it does a larger acquisition soon, which it might do if we take the recent equity offering into account, since the company already had sufficient funds to do minor acquisitions. A potential acquisition might also be a catalyst for the share price, and a reason for a new guidance hike down the road.Analysts are mostly positive after the analyst day. Most of them like the medical and metals side of the business, where they (and I) see substantial growth opportunities, while Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) entry into the 3D printing market was one of the main concerns, as well as the fact that 3D Systems is behind Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) in the consumer segment. I covered most of these topics in my previous articles, and the comparisons between Stratasys and 3D Systems are discussed here. Stratasys is the leader in the consumer market, and its reported revenue is much higher than 3D Systems' consumer revenue. Stratasys's consumer revenue was $24.9 million and $20.6 million in Q4 2013 and Q1 2014 respectively, while 3D Systems' consumer revenue was $8.9 million and $9.7 million respectively. This is the area that 3D Systems needs to work on.Price action3D Systems started to move higher in late May, but the rise was disrupted by the equity offering, and the stock went back to trade around $50, which it has been doing for two months. The consolidation through time is what the stock might need in order to flush out the day traders and to make the shorts impatient. What the stock also needs to do is to get above its late May highs in order to get things going again. The move would probably cause some short covering, which should further boost the demand side.Source: Stockcharts.comConclusionWhile the analyst day failed to excite investors, 3D Systems' growth road map is encouraging. Accelerating revenue growth in the second half of the year, the return of operating leverage in the second half of 2015 and the expected earnings expansion are the key takeaways from the analyst day. The rise of 3D printing and an expected 32% compound growth rate from 2013 to 2020 should help the company grow at a fast pace in the future and deliver value for its shareholders. 3D Systems' share price needs to move above its late May highs to get things going and move closer to my $70 price target.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2259703,53482,2014-06-09T15:04:26-04:00,"Open-ended potential for 3-D printing; aviation, food, medicine, mobile and fashion.Partnerships with Google, Intel and Hershey.Still risky, but 50% drop gives investors an opportunity to buy.","Last November, at a price of $80 a share, I wrote that 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) had entered an extremely overbought state which could only end in a significant share price correction.Although the share price proceeded to fall around 13% after I made the claim, 3D Systems ended up going higher by another $17 before the bubble finally popped.Since then, 3D Systems has lost nearly 50%, hitting a low of $44.80 in April of this year.Now that the sharp price fall has taken place, there is very little value left for shorts, and the next direction for DDD shares is likely to be up.Real-world benefitsWithout a doubt, there are many risks involved with buying 3D Systems shares. A forward PE of 42.39 is evidence that the company is not cheap and is still regarded as a speculative play.When this is the case, any traditional valuation method, such as DCF (discounted cash flow) or CAPM becomes pretty much useless. For companies in game-changing industries (which 3-D printing undoubtedly is) success can be pinned just as easily to qualitative factors as quantitative.There is good reason for high PE ratios though, just like there is good reason for optimism in 3-D printing as an industry. Last week's Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Technology Conference highlighted some of these reasons and proves why 3D Systems could still be the stock of the future.PartnershipsAll too often when talking about 3-D printing, thought turns to the carving out of plastic figurines or barely useful souvenirs. But there will be so much more to 3-D printing than that; in aviation, medicine, food, mobile technology and more.For me, the potential partnerships that DDD alluded to in last week's conference form the most exciting part of the story.3D Systems spoke of opportunities in food printing with Hershey (NYSE:HSY). Such opportunities will allow the more repetitive tasks of food creation to be streamlined. In mobile, 3D Systems is working with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), whose 3-D printing chip, RealSense, has just been launched.Speculation that the next Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone could have its own 3-D scanner could easily lead to many more opportunities down the line. Meanwhile, potential agreements with Google (GOOG, GOOGL) could be even more exciting. Management spoke of embedded conductive printing, electronics printing and modular cellphones. Projects that will be ''very relevant to the Ara phone'' and ''relevant to 100s of other applications over time too."" Google is clearly the type of tech giant you want to have in your corner, and it has expressed interest in working with DDD in at least 3 unique areas.Tipping pointWhile commercial partnerships will be important to 3D Systems' growth, could there possibly be a tipping point for the industry as a whole?The rapid take-up in the classroom suggests that could well be the case, and 3D Systems has seen 3-D printers being put into school classrooms all the way down to fourth grade. As more and more kids are taught how to use 3-D printers, the printers themselves will become more familiar, and will soon be a part of the average American household.As Hugh Evans, VP of Ventures and Business Development, puts it, ""a tipping point would be a 3-D scanner chip in your cell phone so you can just click and make"". And that is how sales of 3D Systems' printers could easily hit millions of units a year sometime in the not-too-distant future. Making 3D printing a truly open-ended economic opportunity.Technical outlookWhile the future will no doubt be good for 3-D printing, as I mentioned earlier, the technical outlook forms a big part of any analysis on 3D Systems too, principally because the market has been subject to such intense speculation.The technical picture now is vastly different to what it was at the end of last year, when I made my somewhat early sell call.Today, 3D Systems trades almost 50% lower, and short sellers (unless unreservedly greedy) will almost certainly be closing out their positions at these prices.Looking at the price chart, there is a descending upper trend line that is quickly converging on the price level. $56.64 is the level to watch, and a break of this would surely see all remaining shorts exit their trades. That would lead to a sharp short squeeze and see 3D Systems move up to $65 in a short space of time.From there, the stock may drop back again slightly before building a much more sustainable advance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2266063,44981,2014-06-12T13:53:10-04:00,"Faster 3D printers will likely increase the use of 3D printing in the manufacturing process.Top line growth is not translating into bottom line growth due to increased expenses for expansion.The stock price of 3D Systems is likely to be range bound over the next few days, but it should rise in the second half of the year.","3D printing technology has been the subject of intense debate - there are two extreme opinions when it comes to 3D printing: First group believes that the technology will replace the traditional manufacturing process and it will be a success. However, the second group believes that this is all a hoax and 3D printing technology will fail to go mainstream. In my opinion, the future of the technology is in the middle of both these extremes.3-D printing has already had a massive impact on prototyping. Before 3D printers, it used to take months or days to build a prototype. However, it can now be done in hours. For engineers or inventors, 3D printing has changed the landscape completely as now they can test their ideas in a matter of hours. This has also resulted in efficiency in some parts of the manufacturing process as the speed of prototyping has increased and it now takes less time to reach the final product.On the other hand, replacing the traditional manufacturing process in the near future is a far cry in my opinion. There are many reasons for it. However, two of the most important reasons are the cost and time. First of all, manufacturing at a large scale will result in higher costs through 3D printing as the equipment and the materials are costly. In theory, 3D printing should decrease the cost as the same machine can give you variety (ability to print a number of different parts on the same machine), choice of materials, no lead time and lower wastage - in traditional manufacturing, a large amount of materials are wasted. However, in practice, the technology is still not applicable for mass production as the constraints about the size, cost and time remain.3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is one of the biggest players in the sector, and the company has a strong position in the industrial segment of the 3D printing industry. Recently, it announced that its Fab-Grade 3D printers have broken the speed barrier and it gives better speed than the traditional injection molding techniques. In my previous articles about 3D printing becoming an integral part of the manufacturing process, I have maintained that a decrease in the printing of finished product will be an important development and I believe we will see faster 3D printers over the next few years. The announcement about the Fab-Grade printer augers my belief that the technology is on course to play a larger role in the manufacturing process. This development opens up some opportunities for the company, and the manufacturers can follow just-in-time manufacturing of small parts at a larger scale. This is a significant step for 3-D printing technology as the time constraint is minimized through this development.We have talked about the partnerships for 3D systems with some manufacturers such as Hershey's. The partnerships in the food industry as well as the businesses manufacturing small parts can work as the small parts can be manufactured at lower cost and in less time. However, I do not believe 3D printing will replace the assembly line in the near future.The valuation of the stocks in the 3D printing sector has been dividing opinion as well. Valuing these stocks on the basis of multiples will not make them attractive to anyone as the businesses are still operating in the hyper-growth stage of the business cycle. The revenues are growing at breakneck speed and the businesses are making an effort to increase market share through geographic expansion. As a result, top-line growth is not being converted into the bottom-line growth. At the moment, valuing these stocks based on P/E ratios is not the right approach in my opinion. In my previous article, I talked about the new equity offering by the company and how it will impact the stock price in the above mentioned article, I said that I do not expect the new equity offering to take the stock price below its recent support price of $47.50. The below chart shows the price movement during the past month - the stock did not go below its support price.Over the next few days, I believe the stock price will be range bound and we will not see a major rally in 3D systems. However, the second half of the year will push the stock price up as the company continues to expand its reach. The metal side of the business will contribute significantly and the medical segment will also be a vital part. The recent increase in the revenue guidance backs my theory of better performance in the second half of the year. My fellow SA author, ONeil Trader, has shed some light on the analyst day here.Bottom LineThe speed of printing remains a hurdle in the way of 3D printing becoming an integral part of manufacturing. While the technology is still far from replacing the assembly line, I believe the increase in the printing speed for Fab-Grade printers is a positive sign and it might become a rival for injection molding. As I have said above, the technology is still at the early stages and the growth will remain rapid for the companies operating in the sector over the next few years. As the adoption rate for 3D printing increases, these companies will benefit heavily from the increasing demand.Additional Disclosure: This article is for educational purposes only and it should not be taken as an investment recommendation.

2258253,22775,2014-06-09T03:58:18-04:00,"The NYC analyst day will give management the opportunity to discuss its recent equity offering and M&A ambitions.The message around the 2014 guidance will be key as concerns emerged recently about the group’s ability to reach its targets.After talking of a back-end loaded guidance in Q1, 3D Systems could go one step further and cut it.If the company leaves unchanged its guidance, this could spark a relief rally.We reiterate our long-term negative stance on the stock, but the analyst meeting could be a short-term trading buy opportunity on 3D Systems.","The analyst day that 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) will hold on Tuesday, June 10 is widely expected to give management the opportunity to discuss its recent $317m equity offering. In our previous article we said that we had some concerns about this offering and its timing. 3D Systems' balance sheet was indeed rock solid with $300m net cash (now more than $600m) and did not require a capital increase. And issuing equity after a 40% stock price decline was obviously not perfect timing. In our view, this could suggest that 3D Systems' stock was no more accepted as a M&A payment method by sellers following the stock price collapse and that the company was taking the opportunity of a stock price rebound to raise capital before potentially cutting its guidance.It looks like our concerns have been shared by many other investors. The stock is now trading below the offering price and the 10% price decline since announcement is above the EPS dilution (6%).This clearly puts pressure on management and CEO Avi Reichental will have to reassure on the company's business fundamentals (will the guidance be maintained?) and to provide more color on its M&A policy.Message on the 2014 guidance will be keyIn our April 29 article (""Trading Buy Or Falling Knife?""), we highlighted that management's tone regarding the 2014 guidance (initiated just a few weeks before) appeared less confident in the Q1 press release. Management reiterated ""its 2014 guidance, expecting revenue to be in range of $680 million to $720 million and its GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.56 and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.85"". But management added a sentence that was not included in the initial guidance: ""Additionally, management expects a greater portion of revenue and earnings to be generated during the second half of 2014, as the full impact of its new products and services materializes.""This more cautious approach could imply that 3D Systems finally took notice of the severe competition risks we have been highlighting since the beginning of the year. Our thesis is that the expiry of key patents between 2014 and 2017 is sparking increased competition and pricing pressures across the industry as open-source hardware printers are now able to integrate technologies such as laser sintering, as illustrated by the recent Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) or HP (NYSE:HPQ) initiatives.Could 3D Systems go one step further and cut its guidance? That's a possibility in view of the weak industry environment (numerous warnings). But if the company leaves its guidance unchanged, it will have to convince investors about its H2 product pipeline and its ability to preserve its gross margins despite increasing competition.M&A: large deal or expansion into services?With $600m net cash, 3D Systems has the firepower to make a large acquisition, the usual suspects being ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), Voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET), Arcam (OTCPK:AMAVF). Such a deal could scare investors for several reasons:1) These companies still boast high valuation multiples and some of them have been experiencing operating difficulties, suggesting that an acquisition could give rise to a significant write-off in just a few quarters.2) Many analysts and investors are already focused on the integration risks related to 3D Systems' M&A frenzy of the last years. A large acquisition would only add to their fears.In all, we believe that a step-by-step M&A approach vs. a large deal would be reassuring for the financial community. Specifically, we hope that the services business will be 3D Systems' next area of focus. The group recently acquired the service bureau Robtec in Brazil and we would welcome similar deals in coming quarters, as we believe that margins in this business will be much more resilient than in hardware.Bottom lineWe reiterate our long-term negative stance on the stock as we consider that 3D Systems is still overvalued (see our ""$83 or $26?"" article). That said, 3D Systems could be a short-term trading buy candidate: if the company leaves its guidance unchanged, this could spark a relief rally in view of the negative stock price reaction following the equity offering.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The median 12-month price target for 3D systems by 19 analysts polled by FT.com was $69, while the high price target is up by 128.1% to $115.The 20 analysts are betting that 3D Systems is going to make a big bounce up after losing almost half of its price from its 52-week high. Despite the negative propaganda against DDD, the bullish analysts expect it to continue posting double-digit growth rate until next year.Source: markets.ft.comThe positive endorsements among professional analysts are a ray of light that should please long-term DDD believers.Strong Industrial Metal Printing DemandAnother contributor said that long-term DDD investors should not worry about the new stock offering. The proceeds from the sale of new shares increased 3D Systems' cash position to more than $600 million. 3D Systems, judging by its rapacious M&A history, will use some of its new cash to acquire another additive manufacturing company. I have always been supportive of the company's non-organic strategy to grow its business and IP assets. Growth by Mergers & Acquisitions is still growth.We already know that 3D Systems is enjoying overbooking over its Phenix direct metal printing products. I assume that DDD would like to increase its industrial metal printing products. Industrial demand for metal printers is definitely one of the reasons why 3D Systems' Q1 earnings report has a backlog order of $28.8 million.Mr. Reichental ought to be eyeing metal printing-centric companies like Arcam (OTCPK:AMAVF) or privately held EOS. Arcam has a winner technology with its Electron Beam Melting (EBM). EBM is used for industrial and medical purposes, which is in line with 3D Systems' existing product lines. However, EOS is currently hot news because it helped create the SuperDraco engine for Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket. Musk tweeted last year that an EOS 3-D metal printer was being used to create the SuperDraco Inconel rocket chamber.Source: Elon MuskIt doesn't really matter which new company that Reichental decides to buy soon. Arcam and EOS are two very attractive acquisition targets. My preference is for EOS because the strong cult following of Elon Musk is something that Abe Reichental does not have.DDD, like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), is heavily shorted but 3D Systems is still 45% down from its January high. A touch of the Elon magic might help DDD recruit more bulls to its cause. Getting back to the $97.28 high, which DDD set last January 3, is nearly impossible this year. However, the Strong Buy recommendations from 20 analysts suggest that 3D Systems is a momo ticker that is up for a comeback.All additive manufacturing tickers have suffered this 2014. Market sentiment over momo 3-D printing tickers may recover in the next half of the year. 3D Systems' strong history of profitability and sales growth makes it one of the best 3-D printing stocks to bet on.Source: Google FinanceConclusion3D Systems delivered a hefty 3-year return for its investors who were able to get out when the stock price was at its peaks. I believe that stronger demand for direct metal printing solutions will help DDD gain back some of its stock market losses this year.Source: markets.ft.comI doubt if Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) can immediately offer direct metal printing service when it starts its additive manufacturing venture later this year. It will be easier for Whitman to jumpstart HPQ's additive manufacturing venture by acquiring or merging with 3D Systems. 3D Systems has a very versatile product line but its 3-D printers could sure benefit from Hewlett-Packard's faster printing speed technology.If Whitman is not interested in 3D Systems, there are other companies. Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) is considering buying a 3-D printing company to fast track its entry into 3-D printers. DDD has proven itself a consistent profit-making additive manufacturing company that has more than three decades-worth of clients list. 3D Systems is therefore a good acquisition target.Source: MorningstarThe detractors of 3D Systems cannot refute that the company has consistently delivered double-digit revenue growth rate. It has also been profitable for the last five years. 3D Systems is a good Buy for long-term investors. The high volatility of this stock is a pain to witness. Near-term pain is inconvenient but it is a small price to pay for a long-term gain.Disclosure: I am long DDD. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

2254393,40031,2014-06-05T08:36:47-04:00,"3D Systems' secondary offering has stopped the potential rally, but it just might be a slight bump on the road to a higher share price.Worries about competition from cheap 3D printer makers are overblown.The reward-risk ratio is still favorable for the bulls.","Two weeks ago, I argued that 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is set to rally and that the reward/risk ratio is favorable for the bulls. 3D Systems is down almost 10% since the article was written, and the decline is the consequence of the secondary offering the company did last week. I believe that the secondary offering adds nothing to the bear side, except for the 5.8% dilution. On the plus side, the company is raising the necessary funds to continue its acquisition strategy, which has helped the company to grow considerably in the past few years, but has also added integration risks, which have not been a problem for the company so far. I am reaffirming my $70 price target, and the reward-risk ratio is now even more on the bull side. The secondary offering should be just a short-term bump on the road to a higher share price.Source: stockcharts.comThoughts on the secondary offeringThere is nothing new here. The company is continuing its acquisition-fueled growth path, and the additional funds should help the company zero-in on other potential candidates. The gross proceeds should be $327 million (or around $50 million higher, if underwriters take advantage of the over-allotment option), and should boost the company's cash balance to almost $700 million, which translates into about 15% of the current market cap. As to where the money will go, the company indicated at the Bank Of America Merrill Lynch Global Technology Conference that acquisition candidates are less on the hardware side and more on the side of materials in quick parts, medical and expansion into other geographies, as well as adding expertise in order to enhance the available product and material offerings. My conclusion here is that the secondary offering is good for the company, as it intends to broaden the company's ability to solidify its position in the rapidly developing 3D printing space.Worries about cheap printers are overblownLately, I have seen a lot of arguments that 3D Systems and other companies in the field will face competition from companies that will offer cheap printers, and that this will put a dent in 3D Systems' bottom line down the road. While this may be true, it will mostly impact the consumer part of the business, since the industrial side relies on more robust machines that are not very cheap, and this side of the business is not that easy to penetrate into. And the industrial side is the one with the most growth potential for 3D Systems in the future. 3D Systems has good long-term relationships with numerous companies in this space and is being quite aggressive with product launches and acquisitions, and most of the competitors will probably stay behind. However, the competitive threats are not to be discarded easily, and we are still waiting for Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) to make its move in order to assess the potential danger for 3D Systems, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and other companies in the field. For now, 3D Systems is benefiting from strong demand across its business segments, and these trends are likely to continue in the future.Reward-risk is still favorable for the bullsIn my previous article, I have laid out a bull and bear thesis for 3D Systems, and pointed out that the reward-risk ratio is in favor of the long side. The situation has changed a little bit since, but I am keeping my $70 price target, which translates into 40% upside from the current price, while the downside should be limited to $40 to $45, which means a 10% to 20% downside from here.Conclusion3D Systems continues to pursue its aggressive, acquisition-based growth strategy. While the strategy poses integration risks, they were not an issue for the company so far. While the competitive threats are more or less evident, 3D Systems remains in a good place to benefit from the strong demand and growth across its business segments. The potential acquisitions might add more to the top and bottom line going forward, and analysts are likely to change their estimates upward in the next couple of months as the management takes another look at FY 2014 guidance after the Robtec acquisition gets completed, and as the second half of the year gets underway, which will allow more visibility into the growth potential through the rest of the year. Fellow contributor Bill Maurer offers some insight into 3D Systems short-interest, and short-squeeze potential, which may be an added benefit to my own bullish thesis. Additionally, 3D Systems is having its Analyst Day next Tuesday, and this might be a catalyst for the short squeeze.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in DDD over the next 72 hours.

2245243,54222,2014-05-30T01:01:46-04:00,"3D Systems' revenue has gained good momentum, and the company is making investments to keep this going.3D Systems' latest acquisitions should continue driving growth and assist its organic growth.Since Hewlett-Packard won't be targeting the consumer 3D printing market, 3D Systems will face less competition.","If you are a 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) investor, 2014 hasn't been a kind year for you. 3D Systems has been battered badly and it is down close to 40%. In addition, the company's first-quarter results didn't bring much joy to investors. Although 3D Systems satisfied consensus estimates and reported a 45% jump in revenue, its earnings declined 28% from last year. Also, 3D Systems scaled down its guidance for the year.However, there are some positive points that investors shouldn't ignore. For example, 3D Systems doesn't face as big a threat from Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) as thought earlier. HP recently announced that it won't target the consumer 3D printing market and keep itself limited to what it calls ""business 3D printing."" In addition, 3D Systems' revenue has been growing at a rapid pace, indicating that the company is doing well in a fast-rising 3D printing market. Although earnings are declining, investors shouldn't forget that 3D Systems is investing in its business to capture more market share.So, investors should not lose hope as 3D Systems can get back on its feet going forward. Also, it might be wise to make the most of the stock's weakness to buy more of 3D Systems. Let's see why.Investments will drive growth in the future3D Systems' revenue growth in the previous quarter reflects strong demand for its design and manufacturing printers. There was strong demand for direct metal 3D printers during the quarter, which exceeded its current manufacturing capacity. Keeping in mind the growing demand for its products, 3D Systems is expanding its present capacity. Because of this expansion, it made investments in the business that created pressure on its gross profit margin, which decreased around 130 basis points from the year-ago period.Moreover, its R&D team has made significant strides in the development of the continuous, fab-grade 3D printer platform and materials in support of Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Project Ara.Management believes that this platform will deliver high speed and advanced manufacturing methodology to various industrial and consumer goods. Although in the short term, this investment increases pressure on 3D Systems' profit margin, management is confident that it will result in greater benefits in the long run. According to management, ""We expect our growth initiatives and accelerated investments to continue to expand our first mover advantage and increase our market share. And we believe that our unified sales force and channel focus can deliver continued success.""Healthcare prospects and acquisitions3D Systems also saw increased demand in the healthcare category, where its revenue soared 53%. In this sector, 3D Systems is expanding into new applications with new products, materials, and services. To further expand its reach in this sector, the company has acquired Medical Modeling. Medical Modeling is known for personalized surgery and patient specific medical device solutions.Moreover, Medical Modeling has FDA-cleared processes and cutting-edge expertise since it has already delivered thousands of surgical planning tools and facial prosthetic devices. 3D Systems anticipates that this move will increase its expertise in this rapidly growing category. In addition, 3D Systems has also announced the acquisition of Robtec, which is headquartered in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Robtec is the largest Latin American additive manufacturing service bureau and the leading 3D printing and scanning product distributor in the region.Once the acquisition of Robtec is complete, 3D Systems should bolster its sales and services in Latin America. It will increase its reach throughout Latin America with locations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Mexico.Consumer growthThe company also saw solid rise in consumer revenue. 3D Systems managed to achieve this by expanding its consumer product category beyond home use printers into education, entertainment, and consumer goods. It is also planning to extend its desktop design that will result in more affordable offerings to engineers, students, makers, entrepreneurs, and home users. In addition, its acquisition of Gentle Giant Studios will extend its reach in the entertainment and toy industry as well.3D Systems anticipates accelerated growth in the consumer category during the second half of the year. This growth will be led by the company's plans to ship Cube 3, CubePro, and iSense scanners along with ChefJet, CeraJet, and CubeJet 3D printers.These moves look impressive, and since Hewlett-Packard is not thinking of moving into the consumer space, 3D Systems investors need not worry. According to HP CEO Meg Whitman:The source goes on further to state that:Valuation and projection3D Systems currently has a trailing P/E of 133, but its forward P/E looks attractive at 47. This is promising as it indicates earnings growth going forward. The stock is currently trading near its 52-week low and represents a good buying opportunity. In the short term, there might be some pressure on its profit margin. But, considering all the above factors and looking at its future prospects, 3D Systems seems to be a good investment option as its earnings are expected to grow at an annual rate of 23% over the next five years.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2247393,65563,2014-06-01T06:27:35-04:00,"With giant corporations like Apple and Google eyeing the 3D printing sector, now appears to be a better time than ever to lock up available competitive resources.Having already made 45 acquisitions for a total of $520 million, 3D Systems has ample experience in making strategic acquisitions.Given that the secondary offering is expected to bring the company's net cash above $600 million, investors have another reason to believe that a major acquisition is on the horizon.3D Systems' recent 11% drop in share price on Wednesday, May 28, was caused by a combination of the secondary offering announcement, negative commentary, and short interest.I believe that the recent drop in price is merely a hiccup and see $50/share as a desirable entry point.","Less than two weeks ago, I wrote about one of the two pure 3D printing stocks with positive EPS. In my article, I explain some of the reasons why I believe Arcam AB (OTCPK:AMAVF) is the best pure 3D printing stock. In this article I will discuss the other pure 3D printing company with positive EPS.3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD), headquartered in Rock Hill, South Carolina, is the largest pure 3D printing company in the world. The company is a provider of design-to-manufacturing solutions for consumer, commercial, and industrial applications. 3D Systems can print many materials, including metals, plastics, ceramics, and edibles. As of May 29, 3D Systems has a market cap of $5.32 billion and a P/E ratio of 121.During the past two weeks, the 3D printing industry has been earning the trust of investors again. Some of this is because Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are rumored to be working on ""all in one"" 3D printer projects. Some of this is because many shorts had to cover. These two events helped 3D Systems; however, I believe most of their recent run from $48/share to $56.50/share had been a result of a more positive outlook for consumer 3D printing and the recently announced compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.9% for the 3D printing and additive manufacturing industry.When it Rains, It PoursIt is not very often that investors respond well to dilution. Even though most investors have realized that the additional capital will be used to finance new acquisitions, the news has not been greeted with a standing ovation. In addition to this, Jim Cramer and Barron's decided to pour fuel on the fire immediately after the announcement was made. There was also pressure from the desperate short interest. Finally, JPMorgan and Pacific Crest decided to cut their respective price targets. All things considered, it is a wonder that 3D Systems was able to find such strong support at $50/share.Now is a Great Time to Make a Game Changing AcquisitionInvestors can officially add Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to the growing list of giant corporations that are interested in benefiting from 3D printing. While tech giants Google and Apple have not revealed whether or not they are scoping out acquisition targets, Wal-Mart makes it clear that acquisition would be their only entry method. In-house 3D printing is no easy task and there are few competitive acquisition targets available.Who will 3D Systems acquire?The first company that comes to mind is Arcam AB. The Swedish electron beam melting (EBM) specialist would be an incredible asset for any company; 3D Systems is in a better position to capitalize from this technology than any other company. Because my position in Arcam is larger than my position in 3D Systems, I have very mixed emotions about this potential move. I would imagine that Arcam investors would drive their stock's share price up much higher before allowing an acquisition.Another possibility is a company located about 500 miles due south of 3D Systems' headquarters in Rock Hill, South Carolina. The company I am referring to is Deland, Florida-based ARC Group Worldwide, Inc. (OTCPK:ARCW). The thought of this 3D printing service bureau as an acquisition target for 3D Systems had slipped my mind. While doing research on potential acquisition targets, I ran into the latest article on 3D Systems by Gary Anderson and it made perfect sense. ARC Group Worldwide currently uses 3D printing technology and is already the world's largest metal injection molding company.Although I have not heard about this in formal discussions, 3D printing software and service provider Materialise should also be on the radar. The privately-held Belgian company recently filed for a $125 million IPO. Also, I would not be so quick to rule out Voxeljet AG (NASDAQ:VJET) or The ExOne Company (NASDAQ:XONE). Despite the recent loss of love for these two high-fliers, proper management may be able to get the best use of their technologies.There is also a possibility that 3D Systems will look to acquire one or more tech companies that could help with new activities, which include Google's Project Ara. Most investors would be reluctant to endorse another string of small acquisitions, but based on history this is a possibility.A Look at Major Acquisition Opportunities*3D Systems should have over $600 million in cash after the secondary offering.As indicated by the table above, 3D Systems can afford any of these major companies based on market cap. Considering that ARC Group Worldwide is extremely undervalued (forward P/E is around 20), is located within 500 miles of 3D Systems' headquarters, and already uses an acquisition method similar to that of 3D Systems, it may indeed be the best target.Risks, Questions, and ConcernsConclusionI believe that the recent dip in share price represents a great buying opportunity for 3D Systems. I actually think the secondary offering is a positive move or at least a ""necessary evil"". If there has ever been a time to acquire, I believe it is now.The sharp rise in short interest should not be overlooked; however, it could be a bullish advantage. The shorts already had a bit of a squeeze in the $45-$48 range. Also, the rumors about Google, Apple, and most recently Wal-Mart entering the field of 3D printing are still circulating. A solid acquisition could make 3D Systems an even more desirable target.Because of how bullish the future looks for 3D Systems, I believe the current P/E of 121 and the 6.6 percent implied dilution are justified. Normally these numbers would be horrifying, but 3D Systems is an exception. It is the largest pure play 3D printing company, one of two 3DPS with positive EPS, and is in an industry with a CAGR of 34.9%.Disclosure: I am long DDD, AMAVF, ARCW.

2242003,22775,2014-05-28T15:25:12-04:00,"The timing of 3D Systems’ equity issue is quite weird: the bulls will say that the company is likely to announce major acquisitions soon.The bears will argue that 3D Systems cannot pay acquisitions in stocks anymore and is taking the opportunity of a stock price rebound to raise capital before cutting its guidance.Deals in the services business (like the Robtec one) are likely to be welcome, as margins in services will be much more resilient than in hardware in our view.But many analysts and investors are already focused on the integration risks related to 3D Systems’ M&A frenzy. This equity issuance will only add to their fears.","Last night, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) announced an equity offering of 6.84m shares, including a green shoe of 892k shares, which is expected to bring in more than $300m in cash and raise the group's net cash position to roughly $600m. The issue is 5-6% dilutive to 2015 and 2016 EPS.What does the timing of this offering mean?The timing of this issue is quite weird. First, the stock is down roughly 40% year-to-date, meaning that the dilution is much higher than it would have been just a few months ago. Second, 3D Systems' balance sheet was rock solid with $300m net cash and did not require an equity issue.So, what does the timing of this equity offering mean? The bulls will say that the company is likely to announce major acquisitions soon. The bears will argue that 3D Systems' stocks are no more accepted as a payment method by sellers following the stock price collapse and that the company is taking the opportunity of a stock price rebound to raise capital before cutting its guidance. As a reminder, the company holds an analyst day in just a few days and this could be the opportunity for 3D Systems to update its guidance. In our view, both stances are valid and we will have a clearer view of what's going on June 10.A M&A focus on services would be good newsIt was pretty obvious that 3D Systems would remain active on the M&A front as the company's mid-term revenue guidance included acquisitions. Now, the question is what kind of companies 3D Systems is going to focus on?We have been saying for a while that the printer business would soon experience significant competitive pressures as patents expire, leading ASPs and gross margins to decline fast. That was already the case in Q1 with a gross margin down 510bps in printers. And we believe this is just the beginning of the margin compression story in printers as competition heats up, with HP (NYSE:HPQ) or Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) recently announcing initiatives. In all, we do not see a bright future for the printer business (or at least a future likely to support the stock's valuation) and believe that the services business could be 3D Systems' next area of focus. The group recently acquired the service bureau Robtec in Brazil and we would welcome similar deals in coming quarters, as we believe that margins in this business will be much more resilient than in hardware.At risk of becoming a house of cardsMany analysts and investors have already highlighted the integration risks related to 3D Systems' M&A frenzy. This $300m equity issuance will only add to their fears and some could soon call 3D Systems a house of cards.A house of cards usually falters when the underlying business weakens. If recent concerns about the 3-D printing outlook prove to be true, then 3D Systems will be the most at risk name within the 3-D printing universe. We reiterate our Long Autodesk / Short 3D Systems (see our January 23 article) and our Long Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) / Short 3D Systems (see our February 27 article).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2238153,40031,2014-05-27T03:12:33-04:00,"3D Systems has finally broken its downtrend, and may be ready to rally.The worst might be over and the revenue and profitability expectations might improve soon.Reward-risk ratio is on the bull side right now.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) enjoyed a solid move higher last week and the stock may have finally broken its downtrend. I argued in my previous article on 3D Systems that the stock might find its bottom in the next few weeks. Investors were mostly focusing on declining profitability as the company ramped up investments to capture the growing demand for its products. The other cause of concern is also the increasing competition as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) plans to enter the 3D printing field this year. However, these fears might be overblown and I believe that the company has significant upside potential in the coming years. The downward profitability expectations cycle might also be over soon, as the company puts more focus on the bottom line next year and as margin compression stops and eventually reverses in the second half of 2015.3D Systems is set to rally as the stock reverses to the upside3D Systems has finally managed to close above its 50-day moving average line last week. This was the first time that the stock closed above the 50-day moving average line since January 23. Last week was also the first week of accumulation, as volume swelled on the upside, which means that institutional investors are buying shares. Another thing that might help the potential rally is the short-interest, which has more than doubled since the beginning of the year. Signs of a sustainable bottom in the share price, which are now becoming evident, might prompt short sellers to cover, which might add fuel to a strong move higher. I will discuss my potential price target later, and will now focus on the fundamentals and catalysts that might push the share price higher together with the improving share price momentum and potential short covering.Source: stockcharts.comHigher expectations might move the share price higherAs I stated in my previous article, investors were mainly focusing on the negatives: margin compression and the lack of upside guidance revisions. Management expects a return to operating leverage in the second half of 2015, and this is the time investors should focus on the bottom line. I believe that the worse might be over, and that downward earnings revisions might end soon. This might mark a turning point for the stock going forward, as the potential increase in revenue expectations should be followed by higher expected earnings. And higher revenue expectations might be coming in Q2 or Q3. Management reiterated FY 2014 guidance and said that growth should accelerate in the second half of the year. Current analyst estimates call for 36% and 38% revenue growth in Q3 and Q4, which is not in line with those expectations, since the company delivered 44% revenue growth in Q1. The Robtec acquisition should also boost the top-line expectations, and the full-year guidance should be raised when the company concludes the acquisition. I expect FY 2014 revenue above the high end of management guidance, and I am looking for annual revenue growth between 40% and 45%, as opposed to current analyst expectations for 37.5%. The higher revenue growth might be offset by higher levels of investments, and might not translate into higher 2014 earnings, but I still expect modest upside here. FY 2014 EPS might be between $0.85 and $0.90, as opposed to current expectations for $0.82.Price target and potential upside and downsideEarlier in the year, I was looking at potential downside between $35 and $40. Based on the above mentioned expectations and a P/S ratio range in the prior 18 months, I am moving my downward expectations to $40 to $45, and this price range should present a place of major accumulation for long-term investors. As for the potential upside, I believe that the stock might achieve a 2014 P/S ratio of 10, which translates into 25% upside from the current price based on the current consensus estimates. Based on my revenue growth expectations, the upside is between 28% and 33%. My year-end price target is $70, which represents the low end of my revenue growth expectations. This compares to the potential downside of 17% to 25%. Based on these calculations, the reward-risk ratio is anywhere between 1 to 1 and 2 to 1. Any weakness in the share price will result in a stronger shift to the bull side.ConclusionThe worse for 3D Systems' share price might be over, and a set of positive circumstances might result in a significant short-term rally. The potential for upside revenue guidance revisions and a bottoming price pattern might spark buying demand and short covering, which should boost the share price closer to my $70 year-end price target. However, investors should also focus on Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), which I believe might outperform 3D Systems this year. Stratasys is in a similar situation as 3D Systems, but its forward valuation is more compelling.

2232193,44981,2014-05-22T04:08:41-04:00,"The recent fall in price has given 3D Systems an attractive valuation.CubePro has bigger build size and more variety than Replicator, which might go in its favor.The forward PEG ratio of 1.3 shows that 3D Systems is attractively priced for a stock in the hyper-growth period.","The 3-D printing sector has been under pressure since the start of the year, and almost all the players operating in the sector have lost value. The fall in the stock price has given rise to the notion that speculators may have left the sector and these companies might be ready to make a sustained push upwards. Year-to-date, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) have lost about 47% and 34%, respectively. The prices are now stabilizing and what follows could be sustainable growth. 3D Systems have recently launched its new series to counter Stratasys' MakerBot series. In this article, we will compare the key metrics of these specific models of 3D printers of each company to determine who has greater edge in the consumer 3D printer market.The Comparison3D Systems recently announced its Cube and Cube pro series. According to its specification, it is in direct competition with Stratasys' MakerBot Replicator. Stratasys acquired MakerBot to capture the consumer 3D printer market and is very effectively doing so with its current portfolio of printers. This is why Cube series is very crucial for 3D Systems and will help the company to sustain its market share. In the following table a few key metrics of CubePro and MakerBot Replicator are given on which we will evaluate the two printers.Build volume is one of the very important factors of 3D printers which determines the size of the printed product. Here, CubePro not only offers bigger printing size but also offers a cubic shape. While in Replicator, the printing size is small and the maximum dimensions are rectangular (252 x 199 mm). So, if a consumer had to print a cubic shape or something which has both equal length and width, Replicator would offer an even smaller printing size.Next feature in focus is layer resolution. We know that 3D printing is done through the repetitive process of layering. This layer resolution determines how thick this layer would be in a particular 3D printer - smaller the number, thinner the layer. Thin layers will result in better and sleeker finishing and more strength. However, thinner layering compromises the speed of printing.If we look at the layer resolution of CubePro, it ranges between 70 and 300 Microns. It means that for faster speed, layer resolution would be 300 Microns and for slower, it will be 70 Microns. The maximum speed which CubePro offers is 15mm/second which would naturally be at 300 Microns. CubePro is weak in this area as Replicator offers 100 Microns of layering resolution with 40mm/second of speed. However, it does provide the options of going to thinner layer resolutions to gain better product strength and finishing provided that the consumers have ample amount of time.Another important metric is extruder temperature. This one is also greatly correlated with printer speed. Extruder is the point through which the input material, for instance, plastic melts and forms layers where needed. Consider it like a glue gun. In order to melt this plastic, the temperature at the tip of extruder has to be higher. Higher the temperature, quicker would be the printing making them positively correlated. CubePro provides 15mm/second at 280°C which is a much higher temperature than Replicator's 220°C on which it gives 40mm/second. CubePro can use PLA, ABS and dissolvable natural PLA in three different colors. This would result in three different extruders. CubePro offers more variety and bigger build space than Replicator - however, Replicator gives consumers more speed.Valuation: Is 3D Systems Valued Attractively?A fall of about 50% in stock price is substantial for any company. However, in case of 3-D printing companies, it has been harsh, in my opinion. 3-D printing is still in the early stages and the market is expanding. 3D Systems and Stratasys remain the major players in the market with strong position. As we have mentioned in previous articles, margins of 3D Systems will remain under pressure due to the market expansion. However, as the company increases its global reach, the larger volume of sales will allow it to have better profitability. The organic growth rate in the revenues is still around 30%, which is extremely impressive for any company. At the moment, the stock is trading at forward PEG ratio of close to 1.3 (forward PE ratio: 41, growth rate: 30) - We have taken the organic growth rate only to calculate the forward PEG ratio, if we take the three years average annual growth rate (41%), our forward PEG ratio will be close to 1, which is extremely attractive for a hyper-growth stock. Stratasys is following the same strategy by investing more on marketing and advertisement. Both these companies are trying to capture a larger market share in order to grow margins through volumes.ConclusionWe believe these stocks are attractively priced due to the recent fall in the price. The industry is still at the early stages and the adoption rate is increasing. At the same time, 3D Systems is increasing its footprint in the market. The growth in the revenues will continue due to the global expansion. The launch of these new products should also help the company continue its growth in the short-medium term.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2249913,24849,2014-06-03T00:55:56-04:00,"3D Systems is a highly shorted stock.Last year's equity sale basically set a bottom.Analyst/Investor meeting next week.More acquisitions are expected.High potential reward, but not without risk.","When looking for stocks that could rally, one of the key items I look at is short interest. High short interest could spark a tremendous rally, as short sellers scramble to cover on good news. In recent years, we've seen some pretty large rallies due to short squeezes. One current short squeeze candidate I'm looking at is 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). The 3D printing name is a very highly shorted stock, and after a recent equity sale, shares have come down recently. Cash raised could be used for acquisitions, and next week's Investor/Analyst Day could set a roadmap for the rest of 2014. Today, I'll detail why this name is a short squeeze candidate, and how investors could be rewarded if things go right.A highly shorted stock:Short interest was relatively high last summer for this name, mostly ranging in the 26 million to 29 million shares area. At the end of Q2 last year, the company had a little more than 102 million shares outstanding, up from just under 90 million at the end of 2012. Having about 25% of your outstanding share count short is high. In late 2013, a lot of short sellers covered, and that's also when shares of this name started to soar. However, the end of 2013 marked a key turning point, as you can see in the chart below.At the end of 2013, about 14.7 million shares were short for this stock. However, every single short interest update in 2014 has seen a rise in short interest. At the middle-of-May update, short interest was over 33.3 million shares. In 2014 so far, short interest is up by more than 18.6 million shares, or nearly 127%!Not only is the short interest number at a yearly high, but the days to cover ratio is as well. This ratio measures the number of days it would take all short sellers to cover, based on average trading volume for the stock. At the end of November 2013 update, the days to cover ratio was at 2.35. At the mid-May 2014 update, the ratio stood at 9.86. 3D Systems did see a rise in volume during the second half of May, mostly thanks to the equity sale, so the days to cover ratio could come down a little at the next update. Of course, that also will depend on how short interest fares.At the end of Q1 2014, the company had almost 104 million shares outstanding, according to the 10-Q filing. We know that the outstanding share count will rise as the year progresses. Recently, the company announced a nearly 6 million share offering, and underwriters can purchase another roughly 900k shares. This equity sale would add nearly 7 million shares to the outstanding share count. Even at around 111 million shares outstanding, you're still looking at nearly 30% of the outstanding share count short.In terms of the stock's float, the number would be even greater. Yahoo Finance lists a current float of 98.7 million. Even with a float of about 105 million, the mid-May short interest number would represent about 32% of the float. 3D Systems is certainly a highly shorted stock, and that makes a short squeeze possible.Share sales - 2013 and 2014:The recent equity sale isn't the first time this company sold shares during the Spring. Last year, in May, the company had a larger offering, with 7.5 million shares being sold, of which 1.3 million were sold by existing investors. The deal was priced at $40.Interestingly enough, it was that share sale that basically marked a bottom for shares. The low trading price on May 10th, 2013, was $40.62. That was the lowest intra-day point the stock hit during the rest of 2013. While shares did not initially soar after the news, they slowly started to climb throughout the rest of the summer. You can see how the stock has performed since the start of May 2013 in the chart below.(Source: Yahoo Finance)Usually, most investors take a share sale as a bad thing, at least upfront. If a company is selling stock, some believe it is a sign that the company believes its shares are overvalued. In the 2013 case, with the company selling shares at $40, some would think that $40 price should be a short-term top for the stock. Well, in 2013, it basically turned out to be a bottom. A Goldman Sachs analyst reiterated a Neutral rating and $55 price target after the 2014 equity sale news. The analyst believes acquisitions will come, but expected shares to trade down due to dilution. Recently, shares peaked at around $57, but they've come down, closing Monday at $51.82. If shares get closer to or drop below $50, I wonder if this analyst will change the Neutral rating to a Buy.Next week's analyst/investor meeting:On June 10th, which is next Tuesday, the company will hold an Analyst & Investor Meeting. In the press release, the company provided the following statement:The company will also have a booth at the Atlantic Design and Manufacturing Show at the Javits Center. An analyst at Needham, who has a Buy rating and $70 price target on the stock, also believes acquisitions may be coming. This analyst believes that some plans could be revealed next week:While the company may not announce a specific acquisition next week, there could be clues as to what the company is thinking. The company should lay out some sort of roadmap, primarily for the rest of 2014. As the company stated with its Q1 earnings release, a larger portion of this year's revenues and earnings will come in the back half of the year. The company's most recent guidance was for revenues of $680 million to $720 million this year, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.73 to $0.85. Analysts are a little ahead of both midpoints, with current estimates calling for $706.08 million and $0.81, respectively. The current estimates call for 37.5% revenue growth this year, as well as a four-cent decline in EPS. Another 30% revenue growth is expected in 2015. The company believes operating leverage will resume in the second half of 2015 and be fully restored the following year. Analysts are looking for $1.19 in non-GAAP earnings next year.High potential rewards do carry risk:Every stock has risks, but this name may carry more risk than your average investment. Last year, the stock rallied from less than $30 to nearly $100, only to fall back this year to around $50. Even after such a large fall, the stock still trades at more than 60 times this fiscal year's expected non-GAAP earnings. That's important because GAAP earnings are even less. In the last two years, the company had GAAP net income of approximately $83 million, but non-GAAP net income of more than $151 million. Additionally, the stock trades for more than 7 times this year's expected revenues, and that's before the dilution that comes from the equity sale. This is a high-growth stock that has plenty of potential, but it also is expensive.Final thoughts:3D Systems shares have come down since the recent equity sale announcement, and it might provide a decent entry point for investors. The company will use this cash for more acquisitions, which will help to fuel this high-growth company. This stock is highly shorted, so any good news could lead to another massive short squeeze. Shares soared last year as short interest dropped. Next week, the company has an Investor/Analyst Day, where future plans could be laid out. That event might not be the singular catalyst for shares to soar, so investors may need to be a little patient. If this company can announce decent results in the next few quarters, short interest should drop, and that should help shares to spike.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2231313,39301,2014-05-21T16:39:07-04:00,"3D Systems meets expectations, but has a low margin of safety.Consumer adoption is an emerging trend, and it's starting to accelerate.3D Systems' acquisition of Medical Modeling is strategic, and puts it in a solid position to compete in healthcare.","I guess everyone feels uncomfortable about buying a stock that trades at a higher P/E multiple. I get it; you want to buy a Starbucks Frappuccino for a dollar rather than 5 dollars. Bargain hunting in the technology sector is difficult, and has probably become a waste of time. The higher growth names are priced to perfection and assuming guidance and earnings results meet expectations, the stock usually trends higher. The stock never gets cheap, and it never trades at low earnings multiples until the growth dissipates.Overall, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) falls into the category of a little undervalued relative to growth prospects, but too expensive for the average retail investor to buy into. I have high conviction that 3D Systems has found a base, and while earnings growth hasn't exceeded analyst expectations, it's at least meeting them. The stock has more room to run, and I think I can argue that point in this specific article.Earnings results weren't too badI'm not going to spend too much time reviewing past results, but I do want to mention them, so I'm not making an argument that's devoid of any factual knowledge.In the first quarter, 3D Systems met consensus expectations. In the past three quarters, 3D Systems has not beat earnings. This is okay, but it's not helping to ease the skepticism investors have had. There's hardly any margin of safety, and a small slip-up could lead to a disappointing quarter.In the most recent earnings conference call, 3D Systems communicates that it's doing a lot to consolidate global sales, and to drive other efficiencies from its operations, and it continues to acquire smaller competitors like Medical Modeling, Gentle Giant Studios, and the Wilsonville team at Xerox (NYSE:XRX).The company had 28% organic revenue growth, and when including acquisitions, revenue growth was 45% (indicated below by the graphic).Source: 3D SystemsIn its Q1 fiscal year 2014, the company somehow managed to push growth in its consumer division by 150%. This is important, because consumer adoption was what made many in the industry declare that 3D printing will make packaged delivery irrelevant. Although there are many material goods that a 3D printer can print from scratch, it's not very cost competitive for consumers to go out and buy an $800 printer just to print out a basketball.However, enthusiasts are starting to adopt the product in droves, at least according to RBC Capital Markets, Amit Daryanani:Based on those survey results, it's certainly likely that 3D printing will accelerate, as the number of survey respondents indicating that they will buy a 3D printer is higher than the figure of those who already own one. Furthermore, service and material revenues are likely to improve in that specific category due to increases in the installed base, leaving me with a favorable impression on the consumer division.Healthcare a growing catalystFor the most part, 3D printing is making massive in-roads in the healthcare sector. Printing artificial limbs and the like can be done better using a 3D printer. Furthermore, the type of materials that can go into artificial body parts and the like can be customized, and is cost competitive in the medical field.3D Systems acquired Medical Modeling to drive further growth in this category. The Medical Modeling team developed software so surgeons can operate more successfully on patients. At least, according to Everyday Health:With this acquisition, 3D Systems seems firmly on track to having a more comprehensive product offering in the medical space. Furthermore, by working closely with medical professionals, it's unlikely that 3D Systems is at any threat of losing market share in this specific sub-segment of the broader 3D printing landscape.Healthcare-related revenue was up by 53% in the first quarter. It is 3D Systems' second fastest segment. Even if 3D Systems doesn't figure out a way to print out organs, the use of prosthetics in various conditions, paired with computer modeling and analytics is perfectly relevant and is a large enough of a market worth competing in. Over time, I expect the medical segment to drive further bottom and top line growth, and using acquisitions to secure an advantage in this field was a fairly intelligent business decision by upper-level management.ConclusionWhile 3D Systems isn't the easiest stock to own, I think we've found a bottom. The company doesn't waste any time looking for strategic acquisitions, and has been able to grow bottom and top line results on a fairly consistent basis. The high growth rates justify the high P/E ratio of 115. While some think it's a ridiculous number, it really isn't, as 3D Systems is in an investment year. Investment years dampen profit margins, increasing the premium paid on earnings.The downside is the lack of margin of safety. The company hasn't beat earnings expectations in the past three quarters, which indicates that there's limited upside surprises in store for shareholders. Without earnings beats, the stock is likely to remain in a sideways channel.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2219893,22775,2014-05-15T10:04:34-04:00,"Autodesk's 3-D printing hardware initiative confirms our view that entry barriers are coming down in the industry and that ASPs and gross margins are likely to keep trending south.More importantly, Autodesk's open-source software is a major threat to the profitability of 3D Systems and peers.If this software enjoys wide adoption, it could transform printer makers into plastic box makers, like Microsoft did with PC makers 30 years ago.The margin and earnings downside on 3D Systems remains significant, and we remain convinced that the stock is on its way to our $26 bear-case valuation.","At first sight, Autodesk's (NASDAQ:ADSK) announced launch of an open-source software platform called Spark is good news for the 3-D printing industry and its leader, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). Autodesk's long track record in the design software business is indeed likely to make Spark more reliable and more user-friendly than proprietary solutions. And the open-source nature of Spark will save printer makers R&D costs, and will enable them to offer less expensive printers. Consequently, this initiative is likely to favor the adoption of 3-D printers around the world. Great.But a deeper analysis shows that this announcement also has key negative implications for 3D Systems and its peers.First, Autodesk will ship an open-source 3-D printer to show off Spark's functionalities. We would not expect software maker Autodesk to turn into a hardware maker, but this initiative, which follows that of HP (NYSE:HPQ) just a few weeks ago, clearly demonstrates that the barriers to entry are coming down in the 3-D printing industry. As we said back in January in our article ""Competition To Heat Up As Key Patents Expire"", the gradual expiry of key patents between 2014 and 2017, notably the Laser Sintering patent (owned by 3D Systems), was likely to attract new competitors, and this is exactly what is happening. The outcome is quite simple: as many technologies are no more protected by patents, new competitors can develop 3-D printers at a low cost and sell them at low prices, putting pressure on ASPs in the industry and on gross margins. As a reminder, 3D Systems' gross margin on printers was down roughly 500bps in Q1, and the trend is unlikely to reverse soon, in our view.Second, Autodesk seeks to become the 3-D printing software standard by offering free software to printer makers. In our January article ""Autodesk: A Different And Safer Way To Play The 3-D Printing Revolution"", we said that in the 80s and 90s, software makers were the real winners of the computer revolution, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) grabbing most of the dollars generated by the PC industry at the expense of hardware makers. We believed that history could repeat itself in the current 3-D printing revolution… And apparently, Autodesk is trying to follow Microsoft's example, i.e. taking control of the software and transforming printer makers into plastic box makers. Therefore, Autodesk CEO's comments that the established players in the industry are unlikely to adopt Spark and that ""it's going to be a fight"" are all but surprising, as 3D Systems and peers will try to preserve their margins. Note that 3D Systems' operating margin was above 20% last year, while that of a PC and printer maker like HP is below 10%.The margin and earnings downside remains significant, and we remain convinced that 3D Systems is on its way to our $26 bear-case valuation.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Other names in the industry such as Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and the ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) company are down 34% and 52% over the same time period.Despite the sell off, the stock is not a value proposition at current prices.

As this market grows, the risk of manufacturing companies such as HP, General Electric, Boeing, or Microsoft entering the space can be a long-term threat to future profitability.

2240933,44981,2014-05-28T07:54:50-04:00,Equity offering should dilute the current shareholders equity by about 6%.The negative impact of the offering on the stock price should be short-term.The decision to raise cash indicates the company might have lined up another acquisition.,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has made strong rally over the last few days. However, the stock started falling in the after-hours trading yesterday as the company announced an equity offering. It is disappointing for the shareholders that as the stock was gaining an upward momentum; this piece of news has brought the share price down. Since the start of the year, the 3-D printing sector has been under pressure and the recent rally by 3D Systems and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) was being taken as the start of a sustained upward movement by the 3-D printers.Yesterday, the company announced that it will offer 5.95 million shares of common stock in a public offering. Furthermore, the underwriter has the option to buy 892,500 additional shares in the 30 days after the offering. According to the press release, the proceeds will be used to finance future acquisitions and working capital requirements. At the moment, the company has 103.5 million shares outstanding.After the new offering, the total number of shares outstanding will go up to 109.5 million - if the underwriter exercises the option of additional shares then the total number of shares outstanding will go above 110 million. The timing of the new offering is a bit surprising - it would have been more effective for the company if 3D Systems had decided to raise cash at the start of the year when the stock was trading at over $95. The decision to raise cash through an equity offering after a fall of about 40% shows that the company might have a deal lined up.3D Systems has always been active in the sector with its acquisitions and mergers, and the fact that the company clearly mentioned in the press release that the offering was for working capital as well as acquisitions; it shows 3D Systems might be close to another acquisition.Moving onto dilution - new share issue will amount to about 5.8% of the current shares outstanding, or 6.5% if the underwriter exercises the option of additional shares. In theory, the stock price should come down by the same magnitude. 3D Systems stock came down more than 5% in the after-hours trading as the news hit the market. Since 3D Systems is a high-growth momentum stock, the fall in the price will likely be bigger than the actual dilution impact of the new share issue as emotions often dictate the investor behavior when it comes to momentum stocks.At the current price levels, the company will be able to raise around $300-340 million ($340 million if the underwriter exercises the option) from the offering. At the end of the last quarter, the company had $306 million in cash and cash equivalents, almost identical to the previous year. So, the new issue will raise almost the same amount the company had at the end of the year. However, as I have said in my previous articles, the cash burn of the company is rising due to the increased spending on the marketing and advertisement activities. 3D Systems will continue to grow its market share by targeting new regions and spending more on marketing and advertisement in the short-term. The cash raised through the equity issue will allow the company to meet these working capital requirements as well as a small acquisition, if the company has something lined up.As I said above, ideally, the new offering should have the same impact on the stock price as the magnitude of dilution. However, the markets usually consider secondary offerings as negative news and the real impact of the offering is normally more than the actual dilution.Since the big fall, the stock has established a support price at around $47.50 - I believe the news of the equity offering will bring it close to the support price again. However, I do not believe the stock will go considerably below the support price even if we see Strong reaction from the market.Bottom LineNo one likes to see his/her holdings diluted - but it is the truth that growing companies will raise cash to meet the growth opportunities. There are two ways to raise cash: Debt and equity offering - 3D Systems have chosen equity offering, which will result in dilution for the current shareholders. In my opinion, the impact of the equity offering on the stock price will be short-term and the upward trend will return as the sector continues to makes strong recovery in the second half of the year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2214443,57222,2014-05-13T11:19:43-04:00,"3D Systems remains strong for the long-term. Yet, it still has downside and will continue to be swept up in the decline of 3D Printing stocks in the short-term.3D System's aggressive spending strategy in terms of sales and marketing and R&D is a key determinant of its recent decline in profitability and gross margins.Declining gross profit margins for 3D Systems can also be attributed to the fact that its top-performing printer revenue segment is also the least profitable.3D Systems has a significant vulnerability when it comes to the firm's operating cash flow.","On April 29th, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) reported earnings that were in line with Wall Street expectations. The firm reported a revenue total of $147.8 million for the first quarter of 2014. This represented a 45% increase from the first quarter of 2013. The revenue total surpassed the $145.5 consensus estimate by Wall Street analysts as well as the $146.74 estimate made by the good folks at Estimize Research. 3D Systems posted significant growth across key revenue segments. 3D System's printers' revenue segment increased by 53% for the quarter. The Materials and Services revenue segments increased by 41% and 38% respectively.Additionally, 3D Systems reported a 53% increase in its Healthcare segment and a 150% increase in its Consumer segment.3D Systems' EPS total of $0.15 was two cents short of the Estimize consensus, yet was directly in line with the expectations by Reuters analysts. However, 3D System's EPS for 1Q 2014 declined 29% y-o-y. This was the second quarter in a row that 3D Systems posted an EPS decline of at least 10%. Yet, the EPS decline could be attributed to the firm's aggressive spending in sales and marketing and research & development.According to their latest 10-Q, 3D Systems' increase in SG&A expenses were largely due to increases in sales and marketing. Aggressive investment in sales & marketing and research & development are typical strategies for a firm that is operating in an industry which is in its growth stages of the industry life cycle. Needless to say, the 3D Printing industry is in the growth stage. The following charts illustrate 3D Systems' significant increase in SG&A and R&D for the last three years as well as the last four quarters respectively. Notably, 3D System's R&D total for the first quarter represented a 165% y-o-y increase.3D Systems' shares fell by 9.1% upon news of the report as reporters were looking for totals that exceeded Wall Street estimates significantly. Moreover, they were looking for results that would cause an increase in the outlook for 2014. Instead, 3D Systems only reiterated its prior guidance.Over the last three quarters, 3D Systems took a hit in terms of profitability and gross profit margin.Since 3D System's investment strategy is a key catalyst for these declines, this should mitigate concern over the graphs above for investors. Yet, there is another reason to consider.3D Systems' decline in gross profit margin could also be attributed to the fact that sales in 3D Systems' printers segment have grown at a faster pace than sales in their materials segment.The following graph shows a year-over-year comparison of the revenue, gross profit and gross profit margin generated by each of 3D Systems' revenue segments. As you can see, 3D System's materials segment generates a much higher gross profit and gross profit margin than the printers and services segments.Yet, the materials segment declined as a % of overall revenues despite its substantial revenue growth for the quarter. Despite the fact that revenues in the printers segment were the strongest year-over-year, one can see that the printers segment is the least profitable for 3D Systems. Thus, lower margins were largely a result of the change in sales mix.The silver lining is still clear. There is still strong growth in the materials segment. Furthermore, the current growth of the printers segment will have a positive effect on the future success of the materials segment. Consumer demand for materials (and with that, gross margins) will increase as a result of explosive printer sales.HERE'S SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT:Potential investors of 3D Systems should have an eye on the firm's operating cash flow. There is a growing divergence between the firm's operating income and its cash from operations. This issue was really brought to light by Beth McKenna of the Motley Fool and is evidenced below.This divergence only grew during the 1st quarter of 2014. 3D Systems generated an operating cash flow of $308,000 in spite of its reported operating income of $9.517 million dollars. Operating cash flow provides a clearer picture of the current business operations of a firm as opposed to operating income. In this case, it is evident that 3D Systems is highly vulnerable in this area.BOTTOM LINE:All-in-all, 3D Systems' strong revenue growth and long-term potential are still evident in their recent earnings report. I'm bullish on the long-term prospects of 3D Systems and the 3D printing industry in general. Patience is needed as 3D Printing stocks will eventually reach valuations that are far more reasonable. Once these valuations are reached and firms begin to mature within the 3D Printing space, I feel that 3D printing stocks will thrive in the marketplace for a significant period of time.For the foreseeable future, 3D Printing stocks such as 3D Systems will continue to feel the pain. It is clearly evident that 3D Systems is still overvalued in spite of its YTD decline. Currently, 3D Systems has a trailing P/E Ratio of 113.53 and a Forward P/E ratio of 39.91. I would also be quite concerned with the firm's operating cash flow as well. It will be interesting to see if that vulnerability persists in future quarters.The firm still has downside left and I feel it will continue to be swept up in the decline of 3D Printing stocks and momentum stocks in general. I feel that 3D Systems is headed for a drop to the $35 level.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The stock is down close to 50%, and terrific year-over-year revenue growth of 45% in the first quarter couldn't rescue 3D Systems either. In fact, 3D Systems shares dropped almost 10% after the company reported that earnings were down 17% from the prior-year period, missing analysts' estimates. However, the company reiterated its full-year guidance, suggesting that there won't be any more pain going forward this year. In addition, the company's recent partnership with Google (GOOG, GOOGL) for Project Ara and improvements in the business mean that there could be better times ahead.As such, investors should consider capitalizing on the stock's recent drop by buying more shares. Let's see why.Investments are reaping results3D Systems missed earnings because the company has been investing in its products to gain more traction. During Q1, it increased its R&D expenditure by about 165% to $17.2 million to drive accelerated product development. Such investments seem to be bearing fruit, as revenue from sales of 3D printers and other products increased 53% to $60.8 million year-over-year in the previous quarter.In fact, 3D Systems saw growth of 76% in design and manufacturing of printers. In addition, the higher placement of advanced 3D printers led to a jump of 41% in materials growth rate. Also, the company exited the quarter with a backlog of $28.8 million. 3D Systems' backlog in March 2014 included $17.9 million of printer orders. This illustrates an increase in demand for the company's Direct Metal 3D printers that are in great demand, which the company is finding difficult to meet.Also, 3D Systems is continuing to invest in research and development to expand sales, and it is also undertaking marketing activities to accelerate growth, new product development, and marketplace expansion. Moreover, 3D Systems is also increasing its manufacturing capacity to accommodate rising demand.Key acquisitions to drive growthAt the same time, 3D Systems has been executing on acquisitions and strategic partnerships to broaden and enhance its 3D printing ecosystem, extending the 3D printing digital thread across its entire portfolio, from consumer to healthcare to industrial manufacturing. As such, 3D Systems acquired Medical Modeling in April, which showcases its urgency to significantly expand its reach and expertise in the rapidly-growing healthcare category.By 2025, Luxe Research estimates that the 3D printing market will be worth $8.4 billion. Of this, the medical, automotive, and aerospace industries will account for 84% of the market. At present, medical accounts for just 1.5% of the entire 3D printing market, hence there is a lot of growth potential here, and 3D Systems is looking to make the most of it.There are substantial organic and inorganic opportunities in this market, such as personalized surgery and patient-specific medical devices that 3D Systems is targeting. So, the company is expecting an increase in demand for its design and manufacturing solutions to continue driving its growth going forward.In addition, 3D Systems is extending its desktop design and prototyping reach by delivering more affordable offerings to engineers, students, makers, entrepreneurs, and home users. Also, through acquisitions like Gentle Giant Studios, it is extending services to the entertainment and toy industries.The Google factor3D Systems has strengthened and expanded its strategic partnerships with leading global brands and taken steps to leverage its existing expertise and synergies in key markets. Its tie-up with Google on the ambitious Project Ara was one such move. Project Ara intends to make a modular smartphone for customers, and this could be a big opportunity for 3D Systems. According to Google --So, Google seems to be targeting a lot of consumers with this project. The reason why this is good news for 3D Systems is because it will be 3D-printing these modular smartphones. According to Tech Times --So, 3D Systems is looking to bring new technology to manufacture modular smartphones. Since Google is targeting billions of customers with this project, and will probably price its modular smartphones as low as $50, it could end up selling a lot of devices. This would mean a lot of 3D-printed phones, so 3D Systems will benefit.Valuation and conclusion3D Systems trades at a forward P/E of 40, which seems quite cheap considering its earnings are expected to grow at a CAGR of 23% for the next five years. In addition, 3D Systems has a very low debt figure of less than $19 million, while its cash position is strong at $306 million. So, the company can easily continue making investments and acquire new companies to enhance its presence in the 3D printing industry.All in all, there are numerous catalysts that could drive 3D Systems going forward, as we saw above. As such, investors should definitely consider utilizing the stock's recent drop to buy more shares.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2209153,24491,2014-05-11T04:19:58-04:00,"Investors in 3D Systems are taking on a huge amount of risk.
        We expect Hewlett-Packard and other large entities with substantial financial resources to eventually start a value-destructive pricing war in the 3D printing industry.
        3D Systems registers a 5 on the Valuentum Buying Index. We prefer ideas in the Best Ideas portfolio.","Investors in 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) are simply taking on too much risk. If the 3D printing industry manages to generate material economic profit over any duration of time, it will be competed away by the likes of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) or another competitor or two or three with the substantial financial resources looking for marginal growth. We're not fond of the violent stock movements of 3D Systems (as a result of this expected dynamic), and we expect the industry to be ultra-price-competitive in coming years. In any case, let's walk through a derivation of the firm's intrinsic value and apply the Valuentum style to shares.For those that don't know us, at our boutique research firm, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. We think stocks that are cheap (undervalued) and just starting to go up (momentum) are some of the best ones to evaluate for addition to the portfolios. These stocks have both strong valuation and pricing support. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.Most stocks that are cheap and just starting to go up are also adored by value, growth, GARP, and momentum investors, all the same and across the board. Though we are purely fundamentally-based investors, we find that the stocks we like (underpriced stocks with strong momentum) are the ones that are soon to be liked by a large variety of money managers. We think this characteristic is partly responsible for the outperformance of our ideas -- as they are soon to experience heavy buying interest. Regardless of a money manager's focus, the Valuentum process covers the bases.We liken stock selection to a modern-day beauty contest. In order to pick the winner of a beauty contest, one must know the preferences of the judges of a beauty contest. The contestant that is liked by the most judges will win, and in a similar respect, the stock that is liked by the most money managers will win. We may have our own views on which companies we like or which contestant we like, but it doesn't matter much if the money managers or judges disagree. That's why we focus on the DCF -- that's why we focus on relative value -- and that's why we use technical and momentum indicators. We think a comprehensive and systematic analysis applied across a coverage universe is the key to outperformance. We are tuned into what drives stocks higher and lower. Some investors know no other way to invest than the Valuentum process. They call this way of thinking common sense.At the methodology's core, if a company is undervalued both on a discounted cash flow basis and on a relative valuation basis, and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. 3D Systems posts a Valuentum Buying Index score of 5, reflecting our ""fairly valued"" DCF assessment of the firm, its unattractive relative valuation versus peers, and neutral technicals. A score of 5 is just that -- middle of the road. Let's take a look at why 3D System's registers such a mediocre score.3D Systems' Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• 3D Systems earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 36.6% during the past three years.• 3D Systems provides 3D content-to-print solutions including 3D printers, print materials and on-demand custom parts services for professionals and consumers.• 3D Systems has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 10.2% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 0.2 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 2%.• What once seemed like an unattainable pipe dream is now a very powerful means of production. 3D Systems is seeing strong demand from manufacturing customers, and the firm's consumer products are on Staples' (NASDAQ:SPLS) shelves with a positive reception from consumers.• 3D printing is an exciting business, but competition should not be taken lightly. Hewlett-Packard plans to enter the business in a big way and to price aggressively. This is not welcome news at all. We expect the ease of entry to be a significant impediment to long-term success. Gross margins are already facing pressure, and the pressure will only get worse.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. 3D Systems' 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 36.6%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 11.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. 3D Systems' free cash flow margin has averaged about 9.2% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At 3D Systems, cash flow from operations decreased about 9% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 169% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that 3D Systems' shares are worth between $39-$81 each. This is a huge range, and it should be. For a company like 3D Systems, the only thing that investors can count on is uncertainty. Even as shares trade at $49 each at the time of this writing, we wouldn't think anything of a further 15% decline or so. Anything more than that, then we'd think the possibility of a valuation mispricing may exist, but without knowing the drivers behind the price decline, we can't say for certain that our fair value range won't change as well. Fair value estimates are not static, and only companies that fall outside of the fair value range are considered underpriced/fairly-priced.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's HIGH ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $60 per share (the midpoint of the fair value range) represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 133.9 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 50.3 times last year's EBITDA. These are just incredible multiples. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 27.3% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 30.6%.Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 24.1%, which is above 3D Systems' trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 12% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. We're still building in some nice growth to arrive at the point fair value estimate of $60 per share. For 3D Systems, we use a 11.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.We understand the critical importance of assessing firms on a relative value basis, versus both their industry and peers. Many institutional money managers -- those that drive stock prices -- pay attention to a company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-earnings-to-growth ratio in making buy/sell decisions. With this in mind, we have included a forward-looking relative value assessment in our process to further augment our rigorous discounted cash flow process. If a company is undervalued on both a price-to-earnings ratio and a price-earnings-to-growth ratio versus industry peers, we would consider the firm to be attractive from a relative value standpoint. We think investors can find much better risk-adjusted growth in a firm such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as an example. Our favorite companies continue to reside in the Best Ideas portfolio.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $60 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for 3D Systems. We think the firm is attractive below $39 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $81 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate 3D Systems' fair value at this point in time to be about $60 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of 3D Systems' expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $83 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $60 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. Importantly, this assumes our existing forecasts prove correct, and that we are not being too optimistic about profit potential. The expected equity value increase also does not consider the fair value range at that time in the future, which could be wider or smaller. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsIn the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of the Valuentum Buying Index has stacked up per underlying score as it relates to firms in the Best Ideas portfolio.

2172403,22775,2014-04-29T11:26:37-04:00,"3D Systems reports an inline but uninspiring Q1 and more importantly, shows less confidence in its 2014 guidance.Due to rising competition, revenue growth is becoming tougher and costlier.While gross margins are unlikely to be supportive soon due to the rising weight of consumer products.We continue to believe that our $26 bear-case valuation for 3D Systems is becoming more and more likely.","In our Friday preview, we said that we did not feel confident heading into 3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) Q1 release and that the earnings risk was still on the downside despite the profit warning made earlier this year.As we expected, Q1 revenues were ahead of the Street ($148m vs. $146m) but the gross margin was significantly down (-130bps year-on-year) and EPS was merely in line at $0.15.More importantly, the company adopted a more cautious approach regarding its 2014 guidance, stating that ""management expects a greater portion of revenue and earnings to be generated during the second half of 2014, as the full impact of its new products and services materializes.""In our view, this clearly suggests that the level of confidence in the 2014 guidance has declined and could imply that 3D Systems is finally taking notice of the severe risks we have been highlighting since the beginning of the year. Our thesis is that the expiry of key patents between 2014 and 2017 will spark increased competition and pricing pressures across the industry as open-source hardware printers will be able to integrate laser sintering. The bulls will argue that revenue growth remains healthy and that there is no sign of weakening growth. That's true but it's worth noting that 3D Systems now finds it increasingly difficult to significantly beat consensus (the revenue beat was just +1% in Q1) and that revenue growth is becoming much more expensive than it used to be as the company has to step up R&D and sales & marketing efforts. In all, business has become much tougher.Another source of concern is margin expansion, with 3D Systems stating in its press release ""the resulting mix delayed anticipated expansion of our gross profit margin."" We believe that the company will find it difficult to solve the gross margin equation soon. Most investors expect in the same time consumer products to take off and group gross margins to expand. This is unrealistic as the consumer segment will probably be much less profitable due to lower ASPs and intense competition from Asian low-cost printer makers. In all, we would expect consumer products to put continued pressure on group gross margins.Admittedly, the highly-profitable materials business could provide some upside at some point… but remains a mystery for the time being as it keeps growing at a lower rate than printers (+41% vs. +53% in Q1). This could confirm what Terry Wohlers said not a long time ago, that ""a significant number of machines bought by hobbyists are also sitting idle. They generally print out a part or two and forget about it.""And obviously, this is not encouraging for the investment case.ConclusionEven if a trading buy could be tempting following the stock's decline year-to-date, we continue to believe that our $26 bear-case valuation for 3D Systems is becoming more and more likely and that the stock is a falling knife as we see no supporting newsflow ahead.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2169723,23625,2014-04-28T13:53:43-04:00,,"3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD) is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings before the market opens on Tuesday, April 29th. 3D printing stocks were all the rage in the bull market of 2013, but the sector hasn't been quite so hot lately. DDD's stock has been nearly halved since the start of the year. Additive manufacturing may still revolutionize the way the majority of physical products are made, but it looks like at the very least the time horizon may be further out than some investors were hoping for. This quarter Wall Street expects DDD to increase revenue by 43% on a year-over-year basis but see profit fall from 21 cents in EPS to 16 cents this quarter. Here's what the investors expect on Tuesday.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click here to see Estimates and Interactive Features for 3D Systems.)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for 3D Systems to report 16 cents EPS and $146.41M revenue while the current Estimize.com consensus from 25 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 17 cents EPS and $146.48M in revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting 3D Systems to beat the Wall Street EPS consensus by 1 cent per share and report in-line with expectations on revenue.By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69.5% of the time, but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market's actual expectations.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case we are seeing a very small differential on 3D Systems' earnings.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from 14 cents to 31 cents EPS and from $138.00M to $152.00M in revenues. This quarter we're seeing the widest range of estimates we have ever seen on DDD.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A wider distribution of estimates signals less agreement in the market, which could mean greater volatility post earnings.Over the past four months the Wall Street EPS forecast fell from 26 cents to 16 cents while the Estimize consensus drifted lower from 23 cents to 17 cents. Meanwhile Wall Street reduced its revenue consensus from a high of $149.08M to $146.41M while the Estimize community brought its numbers up from $144.52M to $146.48M. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and here we see converging expectations between Wall Street and the Estimize community going into the report.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is turbinecity who projects 17 cents EPS and $146.41M in revenue. turbinecity was our Winter 2014 season winner and is ranked 5th overall among over 4,300 contributing analysts. Over the past six months turbinecity has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 59% and 54% of the time, respectively, throughout over 2,000 estimates. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case turbinecity is expecting 3D Systems to report in-line with the Estimize community on EPS while beating slightly on revenue.Last year it seemed that everyone was hot on 3D printing stocks but so far they've gotten nothing but an ice bath in 2014. Two of the biggest players in the industry, 3D Systems and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), are both expected to report lower profit compared to last year but simultaneously see large year over increases in sales. Both Wall Street and the Estimize community have taken EPS projections down significantly throughout the quarter. A beat on the bottom line Tuesday could help to stop the bleeding across the sector and get 3D Systems moving in the right direction again.Disclosure: None."

Avi Reichental said it very well - the anti-competitive behavior lawsuit of DSM Desotech's suit was without merit. 3D Systems offers a one-stop shop solution with its integrated printing and materials which provides the ultimate benefits to clients.It is lawful and Reichental is judiciously using the lock-in strategy that made Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) so dominant in IP hardware routers and switches. All these recent positive turn of events definitely helped DDD make a nice +6.20% run yesterday.3D Systems has a dangerous short float, 27.77%, so I'm amused that DDD is defying the bears for the past few days.Source: FinvizDespite the -43.94% YTD setback, DDD is still up 67.47% from its 52 week low. It should noted that Finviz has a target price of $84.59 and that DDD has done a +12.62% run in a week's time. 3D Systems might really surprise us next week.Robotec Is an Enterprise-centric CompanyI really appreciate Avi Reichental's new acquisition. Robtec of Brazil is certainly not a small mom & pop operation. It is a leading enterprise-centric provider of additive manufacturing solutions in Latin America. It was founded in 1994 and has an impressive clients list. Robtec's clients include multinationals involved in automotive and aerospace industries.Siemens, Volkwagen, CenPra, Fiat, Mercedes, and Embraer have long-term working relationships with Robtec. I again reiterate my belief that M&A helps 3D Systems makes allies out of competitors. Robtec is an accretive acquisition.Source: RobtecAvi Reichental's recent purchase of Robtec gives DDD a healthly list of new enterprise clients and a Latin America-wide distribution and services network. Aside from Brazil, Robtec has corporate customers in Chile, Mexico, Uruguay, and Argentina. Those five Latin American countries' economy is a huge market - maybe even bigger than Canon Marketing's Japan.3D Systems is no longer limited to being just a producer of additive manufacturing machines. It designs, makes prints, it resells, it makes rapid prototyping, and parts replacement for corporate clients. This is a critical aspect that anti-DDD conveniently ignores. Services accounted for 28% of Q4 2013 revenue and Robtec's multinational clients will add to this important revenue stream.Look at the screenshot below to appreciate how important services revenue is to the momentous growth of 3D Systems in 2013.Source: Seeking AlphaTake note of that 206% increase in consumer solutions too. 3D Systems may not have a best-selling MakerBot consumer 3D printer but the company still did triple-digit growth on consumer category. Staples and Project Ara will help the company improve its consumer solutions revenue.ConclusionNow that 3D Systems is aggressively buying out distribution channels and services firms to increase its grip on additive manufacturing. Robtec will likely help the company reach $1 billion revenue by FY 2016. Much as I would like to make a Buy recommendation, I find it more prudent to follow the Neutral rating that Goldman Sachs analyst gave DDD after the Robtec acquisition was announced.Samuel H. Eisner, Vice-President Global Investment Research at Goldman Sachs, reiterated his $63 Price Target for DDD. Now Eisner, based on his Linkedin profile, is a lot smarter than most of us here at Seeking Alpha. Should we heed Eisner or cave in to the bears shorting DDD?Eisner gets my vote. I'm still holding on to my DDD shares. I look forward to seeing it north of $55 again, preferably before the April 29 earnings report.

2177083,44981,2014-04-30T11:29:55-04:00,Strong growth in business segments and the organic growth numbers are in line with the industry growth rates.The bottom-line has suffered due to the focus on achieving higher market share through increased marketing and sales expenses.The outlook for the year remains intact and the growth in revenues will be higher in the latter parts of the year.,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) reported its first quarter earnings yesterday, and despite beating the top-line estimates and meeting the bottom-line estimates, the stock lost more than 9% in the regular trading hours. It is surprising to see such a big fall in the stock price despite strong revenue growth numbers. However, the market works in mysterious ways and sometimes a stock is punished purely on the basis of false expectations. Usually, when a company meets or beats the consensus estimates, the stock price is positively impacted. However, in the case of 3D Systems, the difference between the reported numbers and the expectations of the investors was substantial - the investors were expecting the company to beat the consensus estimates by a large margin, which did not happen and the stock price took a tumble.During the full year results conference call, the management of the company was clear in saying that the growth in the first two quarters will be in line with the expectations and the major portion of the revenues will come in the latter parts of the year. However, the investor expectations were still high despite the management giving hints that the earnings growth in the first two quarters will be on the slower side. Nonetheless, the growth in revenues has been extremely strong and almost all of the segments have shown solid progress.Source: 3D Systems First Quarter PresentationPrinters and other products continues to be the largest segment for the company and showed strong year-over-year growth of 53% -- print materials currently accounts for 27% of the total revenues, down from 28% a year ago - however, the growth in this segment also remained strong with year-over-year sales growth of 41%. Services segment is the third largest segment for the company and grew by 38% along with consumer segment, which grew by 150%. One of the most recent acquisitions for 3D Systems was in the healthcare segment (I explained the potential in this article) and this segment is one of the fastest growing segments in the 3-D printing sector - year-over-year growth for healthcare was also strong at 53%; however, I believe this segment will get stronger as the Medical Modeling acquisition gets integrated over the next few months.It is hard to deny the growth for a company when the organic growth is close to 30% and the company has been beating the top-line estimates for the last 17 consecutive quarters. The organic growth of the company will remain intact as the metal printing business will be fully integrated by the third quarter and then the subsequent integration of acquisition in healthcare will continue to support organic growth. The demand in the metal printing segment is outstripping the production capacity and it will add to the revenues substantially as the company ramps up its production. Source: 3D Systems First Quarter PresentationThe growth in revenues is straightforward and does not need much explanation. However, the operating expenses structure of the company needs more focus. First of all, SG&A expenses have seen an increase of 65.4% on U.S. GAAP basis and over 47% under Non-GAAP basis - accounting treatment of certain items under these both systems is slightly different. The total increase in SG&A expenses was $19.2 million and this increase took it to 33% of total revenues from 29% a year ago. The biggest increase ($8.3 million) was due to the compensation expenses as the company increased its marketing and sales staff. Furthermore, in order to reach the new markets, the budget for marketing sales was increased.Some acquisition costs and expenses along with R&D expenses of the acquired firm are expensed under U.S. GAAP - as a result, the total increase in the SG&A expense has been larger than the Non-GAAP numbers. One of the most important non-cash expenses is amortization expense - there was an increase of $5.4 million in amortization expense during the quarter - this expense is added back to the net income in order to calculate the operating cash flows. Furthermore, the increase of 165% in R&D has played a part in bringing down the EPS of the company. R&D is an extremely important expense for a company and this expense ensures the long-term competitive edge of the company.The focus of the company has been to grow its top-line by expanding into different geographic regions and segments. 3D systems wants to have the largest market share and enhance its margins later by selling larger volumes and bigger market share than its competitors. The cash position of the company has been unchanged during the last year ($306 million) despite increased SG&A and R&D expenses. At the moment, the company is operating at a lower operating leverage, meaning each new sale is adding less to the gross margin of the company. A company operating at a high operating leverage means each new sale adds more to the margins. This means that 3D systems has high variable costs and lower fixed costs; as a result, as the production is increasing its variable costs are increasing resulting in lower addition to the gross margin. The management expects the operating leverage to come back by the end of 2015. It means that for the next 12-18 months, the addition to the gross margin will be low.So, what can we take away from going through the revenues as well as the expenses of the company?Bottom LineThe 3-D printing sector has been under pressure recently as the major players have been focusing on expanding the market share by spending more on sales and marketing. As a result, the earnings of these businesses have suffered. However, the strategy to grow the business in the short term to ensure the long-term growth is commendable, in my opinion. Markets usually look at the numbers and the reaction was a bit hasty in yesterday's post-earnings trading. In my opinion, the long-term growth story of the company is intact and the stock will make a strong recovery. Most of the analysts have price targets between $60-100 for 3D Systems, and I agree with these valuations as I believe the strong expected growth in the sector will support the growth in the fundamentals of the businesses operating in this sector.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2154353,40031,2014-04-22T13:39:51-04:00,"Google’s project Ara and a partnership with Staples put 3D Systems in a more favorable position to grow its consumer business.We should see heightened volatility before and after the earnings report, and we might see a sustainable bottom in the share price depending on the first quarter results.Delayed customer purchases in Q4 should boost revenue growth in Q1, and help 3D Systems beat estimates.","I warned readers last week about the worst case scenario pricing of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) that could drive the share price down to $35. And as we approach the end of April, we should see higher volatility, since 3D Systems is expected to report first quarter earnings on April 29. I have reason to believe that 3D Systems might surprise on the upside when it reports next week. The expansion in Latin America and new developments on the consumer front should provide a stronger footing for future growth, and the rapidly expanding product portfolio in prior months should help the company's revenue growth momentum throughout 2014. Short-term risks in the general market could push the share price lower in the next couple of weeks, but I believe we are very close to a sustainable bottom.New developments on the consumer front should help drive long-term growthIn November 2013, 3D Systems partnered with Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Motorola Mobility unit to develop 3-D printed modules and user-customizable smartphones to support the project Ara. Although Google sold Motorola to Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGF), it kept its patent portfolio and project Ara. 3D Systems' CEO Avi Reichental said in early April that the building blocks of Ara will start shipping early next year. Project Ara is designed to produce a configurable smartphone. Upon purchase, ""you will get an empty smartphone frame. And then you can insert the hardware components of your choice on the back of it."" 3D Systems will make the plastic parts, including the circuitry, as well as the custom designs on the surface of the blocks. This bodes well for 3D Systems' consumer initiative, although we will see the first results of the partnership in the second half of 2015.On April 14, 3D Systems announced a partnership with Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS), and a pilot project of 3D printing services in two Staples stores in New York and Los Angeles. The two stores will let consumers and small businesses create personalized products and use 3D printing hardware. This pilot program will help 3D Systems to learn about customers' needs for a local 3-D printing service. There is also potential for a meaningful rollout of 3-D printing services across the country in the next couple of years. This pilot program should be regarded as a great learning tool for the company going forward, which has potential to become significant down the road.Goldman is favoring StratasysGoldman is more bullish on Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), which has a solid presence in the industrial end markets, and noted Stratasys also has potential to gain a larger share of aftermarket revenue by leveraging its RedEye business. I would add that Stratasys has also been more successful on the consumer front, at least when judged by revenue contribution, although I expect the previously announced initiatives will help 3D Systems to better compete in the consumer markets. 3D Systems also has an advantage over Stratasys in the metals printing market.Earnings report is expected next week, and we should see increased volatility in the next two weeks3D Systems is due to report earnings next Tuesday and we should see higher volatility in the next two weeks. I believe that revenue growth and the progress in the consumer market will be the most important metrics. The market was disappointed with Q4 revenue being slightly below the mid-range of management guidance, and management stated that the announced releases of new products delayed purchases in Q4. The delayed purchases should help boost Q1 revenue growth, and I believe this might be a decisive factor in the Q1 report which should help 3D Systems to report above expectations. An increased 2014 revenue guidance might also help the share price next week. The Q1 earnings report should be the determining factor for the short-term share price. If 3D Systems disappoints once again, we might be headed for the worst case scenario and a share price of $35. But I expect a positive report next week, and the share price might not get there, unless we see a strong sell-off in the general market, as was the case in the last couple of weeks.Conclusion3D Systems continues to expand aggressively with new partnerships and acquisitions. The results of strong product introductions should be visible in the earnings report next week, as the delayed customer purchases should help 3D Systems deliver above expectations. Higher volatility should be expected in the next two weeks, and a favorable earnings report will probably put an end to a decline in the share price. On the other hand, a poor earnings report and a general market sell-off might drive the share price below $40.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2182403,40031,2014-05-01T13:34:04-04:00,"3D Systems' Q1 report sparked a massive sell-off, although the results were in line or better than expected.Gross margin has declined because of an adverse product mix and a heavy focus on new product launches, which is a short-term negative and a long-term positive.Strengths in many areas of the business and accelerating materials and services revenue point to a brighter future and a higher share price.Downside should be limited, and the stock might have bottomed on the day of the earnings release.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) published its Q1 report on Tuesday, and investors reacted negatively, sending the shares down 10% on the day of the release. I believe that the report shows far more positive than negative developments, and I think that we may see limited downside in 3D Systems' share price going forward. In fact, the stock may have bottomed on the day of the earnings report. The company is focusing on capturing market share and exploiting the rapid developments in the 3D printing space, and is sacrificing short-term profitability to boost investments into R&D and sales and marketing. Operational leverage should return in the second half of 2015 as these investments start to pay dividends to 3D Systems investors.Negatives - margin compression, 2014 guidance, and moderating growth in the U.S. and initial market reaction to earningsThe focus of the negative reaction was margin compression, moderating growth in the U.S. and the lack of upside guidance for 2014. Gross profit margin declined 130 basis points over Q1 2013 due to a continued unfavorable product mix and the rising costs of manufacturing expansion. The company continues to invest aggressively, as R&D spending rose 165% Y/Y and as the company continues to increase sales, marketing and infrastructure spending. A 510-basis point compression in printers and other products' gross profit margin outweighed the 200-basis point expansion of materials gross profit margin and a 140-basis point expansion in services gross profit margin. Management expects continued margin pressure in the next couple of quarters and a return of operational leverage in the second half of 2015. We should see strong margin expansion and rapidly rising profits in the second half of 2015, with a full return of operational leverage in 2016. That is the time when investors should focus on profitability, not now. Top line growth is the name of the game right now, and the investments the company is making now should pay dividends in the future.Management stated in the Q1 conference call that revenue in the United States increased 19% Y/Y. When asked about the issue, 3D Systems CEO, Avi Reichental said that he does not see it as moderating growth: ""We had somewhat of a tough comparison in the U.S. quarter-over-quarter, but more importantly we don't see any slowdown in the U.S. We don't consider a single quarter to be a trend."" He also stated that he expects higher growth in the U.S. in subsequent quarters. This will be an important metric to follow in the following quarters, and leaves room for doubt about continued momentum in the U.S.My largest disappointment was the lack of upward guidance revision. Management reiterated its prior guidance for 2014 revenue between $680 and $720 million. This was disappointing, because the company made acquisitions that should have translated into higher guidance. And a ""beat-and-raise"" nature of a fast-growing company is usually responsible for higher stock prices. However, there are several clues that point to potential revenue upside and upward guidance revisions in the following quarters. Management expects that growth will accelerate in the second half of the year because of several factors: the company has launched 24 new products over the last year, which should ensure higher materials growth rates. Management also indicated that it will take another look at 2014 guidance once it concludes the Robtec acquisition. So, we might see an update on 2014 guidance in Q2 or Q3, and I expect revenue at the high end of the current guidance, or even above $720 million, based on stronger momentum in the second half of the year and a possible upward revision due to recent acquisitions. Analysts might have caught this too, as the 2014 revenue consensus moved up to $706.6 million from $699 million.Positives - accelerating services and materials growth, demand in the direct metal segment, strong growth in Asia-Pacific and Europe, expansion in Latin AmericaThe trends in the materials and services units are encouraging. Services revenue rose 38% to $46.6 million, primarily driven by Quickparts. Materials revenue growth rate accelerated to 41%. Materials gross margin expanded 200 basis points to 74.7%, while the services gross margin expanded 140 basis points. The growth in the services and materials business should continue to accelerate in the rest of 2014 and beyond as the demand for the newly-sold printers picks up and as the company continues to expand its materials offerings.Direct Metal 3D printer sales have outstripped 3D Systems' manufacturing capacity during Q1, even though the company continued to add capacity. Management plans to quadruple Direct Metal printer sales over the next 12 to 18 months. The company also plans to market a larger-format and higher-speed Direct Metal printer, most likely at the end of 2014. The increased demand in the Direct Metal business should provide additional upside to future expectations.The company is also expanding in Asia-Pacific and Europe, and plans to expand more rapidly in Latin America. Revenue from Asia-Pacific and Europe rose 97% and 66%, respectively, and these markets present a large base for future growth. The acquisition of Robtec, the largest Latin American additive manufacturing service bureau and the leading 3D printing and scanning product distributor in the region, should create a strategic sales and service platform in the region. The expansion in Latin America is another factor in my expectations for higher-than-expected revenue growth in 2014.ConclusionI believe that 3D Systems' Q1 report is encouraging, despite the margin compression and the lack of upward guidance revision. The company should continue to deliver robust revenue growth rates in the future, and we should see the return of operational leverage in the second half of 2015. The accelerating growth in the materials and services business is particularly encouraging, and it will contribute to higher margins going forward. A look at a P/S ratio chart reveals that 3D Systems is near the bottom of its 18-month valuation range and it may have bottomed. Additional downside should be limited, since the growth potential and future expectations are changing for the better and there are no signs of slowing growth and declining business momentum, which would push the share price and the valuation range lower.Source: YCharts.comDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2144763,44981,2014-04-16T11:57:55-04:00,"The recent sell-off is unwarranted and it has created a buying opportunity.The fundamentals of the business will improve further over the next 2-3 years.The adoption rate by the consumers and manufacturers will increase, resulting in further growth for the company.","The S&P 500 index is down about 3.25% since the start of the month - some experts believe we are going to see the much dreaded ""correction"" and the stocks are in for a rough ride. Growth stocks have lost substantial value over the same period and it has caused a mini-panic in the market. The chart below shows the performance of S&P 500, 3D systems (NYSE:DDD), Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).3D systems has lost the most value among the stocks mentioned above. The recent sell-off and the fears about the correction have created an opportunity for the long-term investors of the company to add to their positions, and for the new investors to initiate a position in the company. The fundamentals of the company have in fact improved and the company is focusing on expanding its products portfolio, which should support further growth in the fundamentals of the business.There are no doubts about the viability of the technology anymore as the major players such as 3D Systems and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) are expected to have $1 billion in revenues by the end of 2016. The technology is on the verge of being mainstream - companies like Adobe are integrating tools to help 3-D printing - the decision by the major players like Adobe in entering the 3-D printing industry shows that the technology is not far from becoming mainstream. As the technology gets a wider level of acceptance from the consumers as well as manufacturers; the companies operating in the sector will benefit further.3D Systems have been making partnerships and acquisitions and these acquisitions have been a vital part of the strategy of the business. The company's partnerships with mega-players such as Hershey's and Hasbro further strengthen the belief that the manufacturers are showing more interest in the 3-D printing. This link shows how some large manufacturers are using 3-D printing.Consumer segment is extremely important for 3D Systems - the hobbyist market has been growing at a phenomenal rate. However, the price of the 3-D printers still makes it a little difficult for many households to have a 3-D printer. We are likely to see 3-D printer prices to come down in the future, which should help the adoption of the technology by the hobbyist segment. The reduced prices will certainly hurt the margins of the companies in the short-term. However, it should be kept in mind that 3D Systems has a materials segment, which is a high-margin segment - materials segment should benefit further as the adoption rate in the consumer market goes up.3-D Systems is already a strong player in the business and consumer markets - recently, the company has acquired Medical Modeling (I have talked about this acquisition in detail in this article). The acquisition will allow the company to increase its penetration in the medical devices and equipments business. Furthermore, the acquisitions in the medical segment have brought more diversification to the current revenue mix of the company. The dental implants industry is expected to show robust growth over the next few years, and it will allow 3D Systems to continue its revenue growth.3D Systems will continue to show organic growth of about 30% in the short term, and the acquisitions will enhance the future revenue growth. Taking into account the organic growth numbers of the company and the current price; it is not difficult to say that the sell-off is due to the fear. In the early parts of the last year, I gave 3D Systems a price target of $47 when the stock was trading close to $30. At the start of the last month, I updated my model and gave a new price target - I decided to update the model after the company announced its full year results. Over the last year, the company had introduced a number of new products, entered into partnerships and made some acquisitions -- the updated free cash flows model showed that the stock should trade close to $86 per share -- you can read the free cash flows analysis here. I believe the stock will be trading close to my price target in a year's time.Bottom LineIncreased adoption by the manufacturers as well as consumers, penetration in the medical segment, expected growth in the materials segment, and the organic growth of over 30% do not warrant the fall shown by the stock over the last few days. The true value of the stock is much higher than the current levels and I believe the stock will be trading close to its fair value in about 12 months. In the longer term, I see more room for growth. The fear and panic in the market always create an opportunity for a savvy investor, and I believe the fall in the 3D Systems' stock price has created a good opportunity to buy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company seems to be at the other end of the ""hype cycle"", where negativity and bubble theories have become overwhelming. I have been warning about the potential downside risks in my previous article, where I said that the downside risk might be limited to $50, and stated the worst case scenario for a drop to between $35 and $40 (to a TTM P/S ratio around 7). At the time of writing, 3-D printing stocks were in a downtrend of their own, unaware of the rally in the general market. The recent sell-off in the momentum space has resulted in additional selling pressure in 3-D printing stocks, that might exacerbate the downward movement of 3D Systems, and other 3-D printing stocks. As a result, I think that 3D Systems might not done with its correction, and it might last more and the stock could fall down further if the correction in the overall market worsens.In my previous article on 3D Systems I stated that the ""worst case scenario might be a TTM P/S ratio around 7, but we might need a very bad market environment to get there. A previously stated and more optimistic bottom price would translate into 10% to 15% downside for 3D Systems. This would coincide with a technically important level of $50, which might serve as psychological level of support, as well as a point of major accumulation in the spring and summer of 2013."" And we seem to be getting into a very bad market environment, at least for high growth momentum stocks. Since 3D Systems is currently trading at a TTM P/S ratio of 9.8, the expected downside from here is another 25% to 30%, with a downside price target of $35. However, on a forward basis, we are already getting there, since 3D Systems' forward P/S ratio is already around 7. We could assume that 3D Systems will grow into its valuation, but nonetheless, there is a real possibility that the downward momentum could drive the price down another 20% or 30%. The same fate awaits Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), which performed better than 3D Systems this year, which can be attributed to its lower valuation at the beginning of the year.Source: ycharts.comA crucial short-term fundamental event for 3D Systems and Stratasys is the Q1 earnings report. The reports will come after somewhat disappointing Q4 reports and profit warnings. Both 3D Systems and Stratasys are sacrificing their short-term profitability and investing heavily to expand their market share and product portfolios. 3D Systems plans to gain significant operating leverage in 2015 and beyond, which might drive accelerated earnings growth. There is also room for upward estimate revisions for 3D Systems, since the company presented a road map to $1 billion in annual revenue in 2015, which is 9% higher than the current consensus. The long-term growth prospects for 3-D printing stocks remain intact, and 3D Systems and Stratasys should enjoy strong top and bottom line growth in the next couple of years.Source: Stockcharts.comConclusionIf the price level of $50 does not hold, and if the current sell-off in the momentum space continues, 3D Systems could fall another 20% to 30%. Stratasys and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) could also fall by the same amount, while voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET) might fall even further, given its premium over its peers. However, I am optimistic about the long-term prospects of the industry, and we might be a few weeks or months away from a sustainable bottom. The Q1 earnings report might prove as crucial for 3D Systems and other stocks in the group, as it will shed light on the recent fundamental trends.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2165503,22775,2014-04-25T10:27:57-04:00,3D Systems will report Q1 next Tuesday: we feel pretty comfortable at the top-line level but believe that earnings are once again at risk.Gross margins could head south as rising competition and consumer products put pressure on ASPs.The operating margin could suffer from increased R&D and marketing spending vs. Q4 (when the company started stepping up investments).The stock’s valuation has become more reasonable but another miss would probably drive down the price close to our $26 bear-case valuation (50% downside).While a beat would spark a 10-20% rally. The risk/reward remains unattractive.,"We have been aggressive sellers of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) since January and our article ""Competition to heat up as key patents expire, earnings risk on the downside,"" lead a fellow SA author to give us the nickname ""the $26 bears.""But, believe it or not, we thought about calling the stock a trading buy in recent weeks. Indeed, the stock price collapse made the valuation much more reasonable and the stock started to trade below the mid-point ($54.5) of our bull-bear valuation analysis ($83-$26, for more details please read our February article ""$83 or $26? Pick your scenario).Finally, we did not make the call. Why?Momentum is broken and earnings risk is still on the downsideWe believe that 3-D printing names are momentum stocks. And obviously, the positive momentum is now broken with a flurry of profit-warnings in recent months from the likes of 3D Systems, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE)… and with stock prices down close to 40% from their peak.3-D printing stocks have even entered a vicious circle: stock prices are going down, fear is rising and putting additional pressure on stock prices and so on…and we do not identify any catalyst that would reverse this trend.Indeed, we believe that the earnings risk is still on the downside. We said in January that the expiry of key patents between 2014 and 2017 would spark increased competition and pricing pressures across the industry as open-source hardware printers would be able to integrate laser sintering. Since then, increased competition has become a reality, with HP (NYSE:HPQ) claiming to have a breakthrough 3-D printing technology (a release date has yet to be announced) and with low-cost Asian printer makers (such as Taiwan's New Kimpo or Singapore's Pirate3D) entering the all-important consumer market with aggressive prices (see this article in the Nikkei Asian Review). And the arrival of low-cost Chinese printers could make things worse.In all, we reiterate our view that the ASP of printers is likely to fall sharply in coming quarters, suggesting significant pressure on gross margins going ahead: prices go down, but costs remain high due to continued marketing and R&D efforts (both 3D Systems and Stratasys warned in January due to increased R&D and marketing spending).That said, we believe the risk will be high heading into 3D Systems' Q1 earnings release (next Tuesday).What to expect from the Q1 earnings release?We feel pretty comfortable at the top-line level and believe that the company should do well in view of easy comps (22% organic growth in Q1 13 vs. 29% over FY13) and of the revenue traction seen in Q4. But investors' attention is likely to focus on gross and operating margins if you remember that investors punished the stock in January despite a strong FY14 revenue guidance as the margin guidance was well below expectations.Gross margin trends in the last quarters have been worrying: the margin was sharply up in Q1 last year (up more than 200bps) and gradually deteriorated to end the year flat in Q4. Due to rising competition and to the rising weight of consumer products, we would not be surprised to see a slightly down gross margin in Q1 and this could be a source of concern for investors.At the operating margin level, 3D Systems started to step up investments in Q4, suggesting that the impact of increased R&D and marketing spending could potentially be higher in Q1 and importantly higher than expected by the Street.In all, we would expect 3D Systems to deliver rather good revenue growth, but uninspiring margins and earnings.If we're wrong (3D Systems posts a strong beat), the stock will probably rerate by 10-20%. But if we're right, we consider that a second consecutive miss or warning could be lethal for the investment case and drive the stock close to our $26 bear-case valuation, suggesting a 50% downside. Once again, we've got to say that the risk/reward is not attractive.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Some of the 2,000 stores of Staples in 26 countries will likely offer retail-oriented 3D printing services soon.By taking 3D printing to mall shoppers, first-time users no longer need to buy expensive additive manufacturing machines. Staples will educate customers about the benefits of personalized 3D printing.The expanded distribution deal with Canon Marketing was good enough to keep the 3D Systems (DDD) shorts at bay last April 11. The Staples deal is helping DDD recover.","Here is one more good development for 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) long-term investors, Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) has chosen 3D Systems as its partner for its consumer-oriented 3-D printing venture. This positive news probably helped DDD post a +2.27% performance yesterday.Staples, Inc. is using 3D Systems' products for its two pilot 3-D printing services in New York and Los Angeles stores. Staples is aiming to make 3-D printing for consumers and small business owners as easy as availing photocopying services from its Staples' Copy & Print Center. Staples' official logo is ""That was Easy"".SourceMaking 3-D Printing Accessible To Ordinary PeopleOffice supplies customers will get the chance to learn and try out 3-D printing from Staples. Thousands of people will soon have the chance to produce personalized 3-D-printed items without having to buy a $1,000 AM printer. Trained employees from Staples and 3D Systems will educate customers on how to use user-friendly software to create custom 3-D designs for output.Like I explained before in my previous article, 3-D printing is a misnomer. Majority of ordinary consumers are still not able to grasp the importance of this disruptive technology. Staples is aiming to provide immersive or educational experience in 3-D printing in its two pilot stores.This is more user-friendly and convenient than 3D Systems' own Cubify.com cloud-based service. The trained employees of Staples and the immersive hands-on experience will quickly make additive manufacturing and 3D Systems' products more popular among the masses.The slow acceptance rate of retail 3-D printing is due to lack of knowledge and prohibitive costs of buying 3-D printers. DDD will greatly benefit if Staples expands this consumer-oriented 3-D printing service to more stores. People will be able to learn, design, and print their own additive manufacturing creation right inside Staples Copy & Print Centers.Small business owners or creative professionals can also bring their complex designs (or needs special materials) to Staples, and employees there will send it for printing to 3D Systems. The finished products will then be shipped via UPS or DHL directly to the address of the customer.Chris DeMeo, Staples' Director of Business Development, promises fair pricing for his company's services. Depending on materials used and the complexity of design, customers can quickly turn their 3-D designs into reality. DeMeo quoted a $30 price for a custom cellphone case and $70 for custom figurine.3-DMe Photobooth Has Mainstream AppealStaples's 3-D printing services includes the 3-DMe Photobooth. Customers can go inside the 3-DMe Photobooth, and 3-D System's facial scanning software will capture individual faces so people can personalize action figurines and other collectibles.Source: 3D Systems3D Systems bought Gentle Giant Studios last January. Gentle Giant has acquired licensing rights for many popular characters, including those from Marvel Studios, Disney (NYSE:DIS), Star Wars, Avatar, Harry Potter, and The Walking Dead. It makes sense, therefore, that a mother who wants to gift a Wolverine figurine to her son will gladly pay $70 to print out an X-Men superhero toy model that looks like her son, instead of the generic variety.ConclusionThe consumer products division is the weakest link of 3D Systems. Staples is helping to make this division a little more relevant to the bottom line of DDD. 3D Systems' enterprise products unit, especially its metal printing division, is quite strong. Staples' retail-oriented approach to additive manufacturing is a boon to DDD.3D Systems has a high short float percentage, 27.7%, and is therefore subject to being played by sell-side specialists. It is my unwavering mission to never quit writing good propaganda for 3D Systems. I can delay DDD's downward spiral through Seeking Alpha and make the $26 bears work really, really, really, really hard.The YTD performance of DDD is -49.09%, but Finviz puts the target price at $84.59. The Forward P/E is 39.13 and Q/Q sales is +52.40%.Seeking Alpha investors should do their own due diligence before gambling on DDD. The shorts are many and persistent. DDD might have more room to fall before the Q1 earnings report.Illuminati or the real informed investor should refuse to believe the black propaganda against 3D Systems. Even if the shorts send me PayPal donations, I still won't sell my DDD shares. I will not short nor write short-motivated articles on DDD.Pacquiao won convincingly last Sunday. Oui! I made money on Pacquiao! Paper loss is unrealized loss. DDD, with Staples and Canon's (NYSE:CAJ) help, has a good chance to recover.Disclosure: I am long DDD.

2127263,58641,2014-04-05T06:36:36-04:00,Mergers & Acquisitions is great for 3D Systems. There’s strength in numbers.3D Systems leads in direct metal additive manufacturing with Phenix.Medical Modeling gives 3D Systems stronger foothold in health-related 3D printing.,"I am going to say it again… M&A growth is not a quicksand but really is an advantage for 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). Canaccord Genuity analysts Bobby Burleson and Prabhakar Gowrisankaran reinforced their BUY rating for DDD and raised their price target from $75 to $100. It's a lot higher than my $82 PT but they are the experts, so I agree with their assessment.The two analysts explained their bullish sentiment over DDD based on the strength of the company's Phenix printers. 3D Systems is enjoying a great demand for its metal printing machines. The company has a long backlog order of its Phenix PX Direct Metal printers. The two Canaccord Genuity analysts estimate that 3D Systems can deliver 15-20 Phenix machines per quarter.Burleson also made it clear that 3D Systems' recent purchase of Medical Modeling gave the company immediate foothold in customized surgical modeling and orthopedic implants. While the stock market reaction to this deal was again negative, I'm happy about it. Medical Modeling is not a mom & pop operation - it's a well established company with over 15 years in additive manufacturing for personalized medical-related services.Phenix's metal printing IP complements Medical Modeling's metal & biocompatible plastics-based personalized surgical devices and services. Medical Modeling's Electron Beam Melting (EBM) technology is used to produce patient-specific titanium implants.3D Systems Did Right In Buying Phenix Last Year3D Systems' decision to buy France-based Phenix Systems last July 2013 is now proving to be a bonanza for the company. The company is overbooked with orders of Phenix direct metal additive manufacturing products. 3D Systems paid $15.1 million to get a controlling interest of Phenix Systems. Now Phenix is a linchpin for the $100 valuation of DDD by Canaccord Genuity analysts.This deal won't have happened if Andreas Hopf was the CEO of 3D Systems. Hopf dislikes inorganic growth and keeps berating 3D Systems' penchant for acquisitions. I, on the other hand, appreciate how CEO Abe Reichental and Chuck Hull shrewdly used Mergers & Acquisitions to make allies out of competitors. The increase in the number of shares outstanding is printing money for the future.3D Systems, with the Phenix Systems IP, is now the undisputed leader in direct metal printing, not Arcam, not Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS). DDD now offers five direct metal laser sintering machines for industrial and dental purposes. Per the report of Canaccord Genuity analysts, 3D Systems direct metal printers division is overbooked. I wish Abe or Chuck can speed up the production to 40 machines per quarter.3D Systems' metal additive manufacturing machines can output high-quality and complex metal parts in matters of hours, not days. The company's QuickParts service can quickly produce custom metal components with the help of Phenix Systems technology.Source: 3D SystemsThe Canaccord Genuity analysts also emphasized that 3D Systems' powder bed fusion (NYSE:PBF) as the best solution for serious production of metal parts. PBF, as popularized by Phenix Systems, is better than binder jetting and directed energy deposition.Phenix Systems also gave 3D Systems a strong presence in the dental additive manufacturing market. Phenix pioneered lower-cost faster 3D printing of prosthesis using laser sintering of Cobalt-Chromium. The PXS Dental and PXM Dental machines were easy to use with the bundled Phenix Dental V4 software.Source: Phenix SystemsMedical Modeling Complements Phenix SystemsAbe and Chuck again made another smart acquisition of a potential gold mine firm. Medical Modeling is the leader in personalized surgical guide and modeling. I don't care too much if 3D Systems overpaid for Medical Modeling. I am impressed with Medical Modeling's Virtual Surgical Planning (VSP) technology.3D Systems, with the Medical Modeling acquisition, just made itself the leader in medical-centric additive manufacturing. VSP, ClearView, Arthtroview, and AccuDental are just some of the assets that Medical Modeling brought to 3D Systems.Medical application is part and parcel of the projected 2018 $16.2 billion market size of the 3D printing industry. Medical Modeling and Phenix Systems insured 3D Systems will get a big share of that $16.2 billion cake.Source: CanalysisConclusionThe $100 price target projection by Bobby Burleson and Prabhakar Gowrisankaran is based on 3D Systems hitting sales of $949.5 million by FY 2015. I share their optimism, I expect DDD to hit $100 by end of 2015. 3D Systems will continue to deliver double digit revenue growth rate.Unlike SSYS, DDD has also been profitable for the last 5 years.Source: MorningstarIf HPQ screws up the December 2014 presentation of its 3D printing initiative, I predict DDD to hit a new 52-week high this year too. I'll keep holding on to DDD even if it goes down to $50. I'll buy more if it really goes down to $50.Yes I already understand the risks involved. 3D Systems has reached bubble stock valuation because of its high P/S and EV/EBITDA, but it is not the fault of the company. Speculators and rumors of IBM takeover propelled DDD to its $90+++ range in January. I'll buy low now and sell high next year when DDD hits $100.Source: Yahoo FinanceDisclosure: I am long DDD.

2138443,58641,2014-04-12T05:36:24-04:00,Canon Marketing will greatly help penetrate the Japanese market for 3D Systems’ AM printers. Canon Marketing has a global distribution network so I hope the deal extends to other markets.Illuminati or enlightened investors should realize by now that DDD has real products that are really being bought by real customers.Critics who attack 3D Systems’ and its management since January have failed to bring the stock down to $26. Abraham outfoxed the shorts on April 11 with timely Canon deal.,"Illuminati or ""enlightened"" Seeking Alpha investors deserve another donation of good news for 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). You don't need to send me PayPal donation to learn that DDD got a strong helping hand from Canon Marketing of Japan. This April 11 announcement from 3D Systems' official website might have been a contributing factor why DDD did not get hammered as hard as VJET yesterday.I already explained that the big drop of DDD last April 10 was due to a universal market pullback. Momentum, biotech, and high-flying tickers like DDD suffered significant sell-off on April 10. It doesn't require you to be an aerospace engineer to understand the explanation above. Look at the Finviz charts again below, please. The Thursday Throwdown event continued to April 11.Look at the chart below from Google Finance, notice how DDD defied the flow during the early trading hours yesterday. DDD even went up to $50 but it got pummeled down to $48.20.Retirees, newbie investors, feelings-only traders, retail investors, occasional investors, fund managers, should all be able to understand what those charts above are saying. My elementary math is good enough to comprehend those charts.DDD suffered the least damage among its peers on April 11.Canon Deal Cushioned DDD On April 11The Canon deal announcement was likely a strong factor why the shorts failed to bring down DDD as much they did with VJET. The anti-DDD, some of them used to be pro-DDD last year, realized that Abraham and Chuck at 3D Systems also understand the power of propaganda. They released the news right on the day after bears and shorts brought down DDD (along with many other tickers). Perfect timing from two dudes I really admire.The shorts tried but failed to bring down DDD. Canon, yes that mighty Japanese conglomerate, just gave 3D Systems a strong thumbs-up approval yesterday. I firmly believe that the executives of Canon Marketing are way smarter than the anti-DDD critics. I also believe that Abraham and Chuck are way smarter than all anti-3D Systems shorts.The shorts got trumped by 3D Systems with the Canon Marketing deal. Do you really think that those fastidious Japanese executives will join forces with DDD if 3D Systems are just selling ""imaginary"" products? Here's a screenshot of 3D Systems banner announcement on every press release.Source: 3D SystemsFollow The Leader3D Systems puts that proclamation on every official communication because they have to remind investors (and wannabe competitors) that DDD is still the Leader in Additive Manufacturing. Not even Citron Research or the best aerospace engineer can deny this fact. The leader in additive manufacturing was founded by Chuck Hull, inventor of SLA.ARC Group Worldwide, the world's biggest metal injection molding company, recently bought three Phenix Direct Metal AM machines from 3D Systems. 3D Systems is enjoying a overbooked demand for Phenix. Google also approached 3D Systems for help with their futuristic and modular Project Ara smartphone. Brin and Page are way smarter than all the shorts - they approached the leader in 3D printing, DDD.Canon Marketing has been selling 3D Systems products since October 2013 but the new announcement says the two companies are upgrading the deal to more products. Canon Marketing wants to be the premier source for 3D printing requirements in Japan. 3D Systems will let Canon market Projet 3500 Series and other Projet printers in Japan. Canon will also distribute the CubeX printer.Source: 3D Systems.The Projet 3500 series aren't for consumer sales like the MakerBot. These are high-ASP products and Canon can sell them to commercial enterprises. Japan's rich market base will help 3D Systems benefit from production grade printer and materials sales. Credit Suisse said 3D printing is set to grow to a $12 billion market by 2020.I hope that this distribution deal with Canon will expand to include non-Japan customers. Canon has a global distribution network for its printers and digital cameras. 3D Systems will greatly benefit if Canon Marketing extends its distribution service to other countries.ConclusionI'm following the leader, 3D Systems. I'm not an aerospace engineer. I'm not a jazz musician - I'm tone deaf. But I know mathematics. Shiv Kapoor can explain this to you better than I do - Alpha Omega Mathematica rates DDD a Hold using Growth Indicators. Growth/Industry Indicators gave DDD a Buy, confirming 3D Systems' leadership status in the disruptive additive manufacturing industry.Source: getaom.comI'm not as smart as Shiv but one look at the chart below and I immediately understood why Mathematica gives DDD a Hold rating based on Growth Potential. Last time I checked DDD has been growing sales by double digits.Source: getaom.comI do not rely on feelings when it comes to investing. I study and analyze industry reports, balance sheets, income statements, and technical charts. I researched on DDD and its products. So far, I find this company a good long-term bet. The management has kept the company alive for more than three decades.Canon and Google wants to make money with 3D Systems' technology, expertise, and products. The U.S. aerospace industry and military uses 3D Systems products. Abraham showed he knows how to use propaganda when he released the Canon deal press release yesterday. I admire him more today because of that.I worked for advertising/marketing companies before so I understand the power of Seeking Alpha as a propaganda and counter-propaganda platform.The thorny issue is what DDD's price should be. I leave it to you to decide when to buy or sell DDD. I'm holding on to my DDD. I will continue writing about 3D Systems and will do so more often.These are DDD's revenue and profitability charts from Google Finance. No other additive manufacturing company has matched it. Follow and protect the leader.Disclosure: I am long DDD. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."

Market pullback is to be blamed for the drop yesterday.I'll wait for the stock to bottom out before I make new buy-ins.No, I'm not shorting DDD. No, I will not sell my current DDD shares. Paper losses are just that, virtual, unrealized, arbitrary. DDD can recover.","I'm admitting frustration, not defeat. I seriously am raising the Green Flag, not the White Flag of surrender. My agent strongly informed me she will sell all the 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) put options today. Not next week, but today, April 11. I said Oui, Mademoiselle! Sell all those remaining $55 puts... but Non, don't sell the DDD shares I bought for $62.50 +++. Oui! Mademoiselle is way smarter than me. She agreed that selling DDD now is pointless. Panic selling is not good for my tiny portfolio's health.She likes me a lot, and she tolerates my recalcitrant DDD gambling. I'll heed her recommendation to wait for DDD to bottom out before making another buy-in. No, I did not request her to buy $45 put options. I already have $53 puts. She might sell them too, today or next week. I gave her discretionary authority over options, because she understands them more than I do now.Jazz musicians are smarter than me. Andrew Left is smarter than me. All the DDD shorts are smarter than me. Oui! I lost paper money on DDD. I made real money from my DDD's April 10 crash. Oui! My French is terrible. I cannot imitate Quoth the Raven or Michael Blair's style of writing too.The April 4 bloodbath part deux happened yesterday. That's my explanation for DDD's fall on April 10. Overall anti-momo, anti-biotech, anti-tech bearish growls & noise, it wasn't piano music, that prevailed yesterday.Source: FinvizSeveral 3D Printing tickers got hit hard, it wasn't only DDD. The shorts won yesterday, it was a general rout of tech tickers. Every major additive manufacturer got whipped hard yesterday, VJET lost more than DDD. Americans call it a market pullback. It is not the fault of Reichental or Chuck Hull.Source: Google FinanceEven market darlings TSLA and AMZN did not survive the Thursday Throwdown yesterday.Source: Google FinanceSelling DDD Now Would Only Reduce My Real Money WinningsMademoiselle complimented me that my $55 put options more than made up for the paper losses I incurred from DDD. So, I would like to thank SA user Palma308 for the options lessons. I am not shy to own up to my misadventure - my bullish calls for 3D Systems got ripped by the bears. I did say in my previous articles that DDD will go down further. I just did not expect it to happen so quickly.I dare not make another BUY call for DDD for the near term. The DDD investors who did not have some protective puts can hold unto them and bear the bearish mood. I assume most people who gamble on DDD have deep bankrolls and can endure paper losses.The put options gains will be monetized today. I'll use some of the money to bet not on DDD - but on the Pacquiao vs. Bradley rematch this coming Sunday. I might use the gains too to buy a ASICs rig for Dogecoin mining. I'll survive the $26 DDD bears. I lost more real money when Marquez knocked out Pacquiao. I lost more real money much faster here in the Philippines betting on 10-second matches of gamefowl fighting.The good thing about stock market dips is that paper losses can often times become real winnings. Patience, not defeatism, will reward DDD long-term investors.Is DDD Selling Snake Oil?Snake oil theorists are not to be believed. The DDD management is not selling snake oil, but real machines for additive manufacturing. 3D Systems has been in business since the 1980s. It did not survive for more than three decades selling ""snake oil"" products. Chuck Hull practically started the commercial 3D printing revolution. 3D Systems' direct metal printing additive manufacturing machines are currently overbooked.I looked at 3D Systems' balance/income statements, and I accept that the company is not losing money. 3D Systems generates double-digit sales growth. It doesn't have any debt load.All charts from Morningstar.comI also know that the U.S. aerospace and military industries are using DDD products. The U.S. war machine is not going to win the war on terrorism if they used snake oil products from 3D Systems. DDD products were responsible for some of the Lockheed F-35 components and other weapons systems.Source: Lockheed MartinThe high DDD price is not due to Abraham's master showman skills. Reichental does not play jazz piano, but he knows additive manufacturing. I'm tone deaf, but I understand the noise that forced 3D Systems' bubble-stock flight from November to January and subsequent crash wasn't the fault of the management.I'm again writing this DDD article after a down day. The snake oil theorists and shorts are free to comment on my 3D Systems articles. I respect all opinions and disagreeing noise. I am not selling my DDD shares.Conclusion:I believe in 3D Systems. It is a calculated bet. I understood the risks, including engaging noisy $26 bears. I will make another buy-in if DDD has bottomed out. I read up and researched as much as I could about 3D Systems and additive manufacturing. I have consulted other people more knowledgeable than me.The DDD drop yesterday was due to a market-wide fallback hitting tech sectors and momentum stocks. Here's a technical chart from Macroaxis for Seeking Alpha users to analyze. It doesn't take any musical ability to understand. Common sense will do.Disclosure: I am long DDD. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

2113223,58641,2014-03-27T14:59:02-04:00,"3D Systems is subject to good/bad propaganda. The high valuation is not the fault of the company.A majority of the general public still doesn’t understand additive manufacturing. 3D printing is a misnomer that contributes to the confusion. It should be 3D additive manufacturing.Patent expiration does not spell the death of 3D Systems or any other company for that matter.Hewlett-Packard, compared to 3D Systems, has less experience and patents over additive manufacturing. Success in 2D printing doesn’t guarantee an immediate win for HPQ’s 3D printing venture.","I'm biased against those propaganda writers who publish misleading information about 3D Systems and additive manufacturing. The power of the Internet is such that a false rumor can be taken as the gospel truth. If the propaganda writer is adept enough in using half-truths, misinformation campaigns can either make 3D Systems shoot up or down.Writing in English is very hard for me, it is not my native language. However, I have a strong vested interest that DDD doesn't fall prey to disinformation. I do not seek to distort the market through anonymous fear mongering.Yes it is my agenda that DDD should go up, but here are my three reasons why the short-run on 3D Systems offers shrewd investors a good opportunity to buy on the dip, and/or a swing trade. My near term scenario for DDD is downward and brave investors can profit both from DDD's ascent and descent.1. HPQ's Vaporware Threat?The bearish attitude inspired by the threat of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) with its rumored entry 3D printing ambition is going to continue so DDD and other 3D printing companies will suffer further drops in the near term.The original propaganda about HPQ's 3D printing announcement this coming June was already denied by more recent sources. A post on HP's website made it very clear that HPQ's announcement over 3D printing will not be this June but tentatively set for the end of the fiscal year. Reading the post convinced me that HPQ's 3D printing ambition is still, according to HP Labs' Martin Fink's words, in prototype status.Chuck Hull and 3D Systems are not going to let HPQ's ""vaporware claim"" of faster printing speed and better output quality steal market leadership from DDD. 3D printing is manufacturing, the technology to come up with inkjet-like 2d printing speed for additive manufacturing is years away. Chuck Hull and his team, in my opinion, are working hard to come up with better printers too.2. Misconceptions About 3D PrintingI would like to point out that additive manufacturing should not have been given the alias 3D printing. Some people still don't get the concept. Miscategorization and misinformation will only drive some gullible DDD investors to panic and dump their shares, which is just fine for people like me waiting to make a re-buy of cheaper DDD shares. Buying put options also will let savvy traders ride the shorts.Here are some myths I would like to dispel.Limited Materials?Additive manufacturing supports a lot of production technology and various materials aside from resins, and a few metals. Google will give a lot of hits if you type in 3D+printing+materials. 3D printers are using PLA, polycarbonate, steel, wax, silver, titanium (Yes titanium!), glass filled polyamide, photopholymers, etc…One only has to go to the sites of 3D Systems and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) to find out that these two leaders of industry have existing additive manufacturing technology which allows multi-material production using just one product. Stratasys has the Objet Connex 500 and 3D Systems has the Projet 5500X.Source: StratasysComplex Usability?It takes time to learn but it is not hard to create 3D digital files for manufacturing. One doesn't need to be an AutoCAD expert to quickly design and print a complex object. There is a lot of free easy-to-use 3D modeling free programs like Blender, 3Dtin, 3DCrafter, LeoCadd, etc.There's a huge library of ready-to-use 3D models that can be starting files for 3D printing. Those who do not want to waste time learning 3D modeling software, 3D Systems has Scan-to-Print solutions. Intel and its partners are also coming up with notebooks and tablets with a built-in Intel RealSense 3D camera later this year. Tablets with a RealSense 3D camera will allow even nursery-age kids to scan real world objects for output to 3D printers.3D Systems has already released the iSense, an accessory that can be attached to the iPad. The iSense will let some of the 200 million iPad owners to quickly scan objects for quick conversion to 3D models - or reading for additive manufacturing.Strength?Additive manufacturing or 3D printing is being used to produce parts for mission-critical purposes. Aerospace and military bigwigs will not be using 3D printing technology if the outputs are not up to the highest strength and reliability standard. A combat helicopter manufacturer gave 3D Systems a multi-year contract in 2010.Yeah that was four years ago, long before 3D printing was famous, that's how long the military trusts the reliability of 3D Systems products. The U.S. Air Force even rewarded 3D Systems a $2.95 million cash reward for its contribution to the F-35 jetfighter.Source: Lockheed Martin3D Systems and Stratasys are producing additive manufacturing products that are trusted by aerospace and defense industries. There is no doubt that additive manufacturing produces very strong and reliable components and parts.3. Misconceptions About 3D SystemsPatent Expiry? More Competition?The expiration of 3D Systems' essential patents on laser sintering will not kill the company's overall gross margins. This issue is being blown out proportion by DDD shorts to accelerate the downward trend of the stock. I suggest old and new investors of DDD to download the 10-K of the company so they will understand why I'm dismissing the patent expiration of laser sintering.3D Systems has more weapons on its arsenal and more patents on its library that will keep the competition eating the dust. It has hundreds of patents outside of laser sintering and DDD has six other technologies for additive manufacturing. Aside from Selective Laser Sintering (NASDAQ:SLS), DDD has these other weapons to defend its leadership position:Stereolithography printersSinterstation Pro SLM Direct METAL sinteringMultijet Printing (MJM)3DP PrintersFTI PrintersPlastic Jet Printing (NYSEARCA:PJP)-Based PrintersIt is highly fallacious to claim that DDD will suffer from more competition because the company's patents on laser sintering expired. Yes, it will give rise to cheaper 3D printers, but I doubt if it will lead to dirt-cheap 3D printing materials. Even the Chinese will have a hard time coming up with dirt-cheap material prices which will drive 3D Systems to bankruptcy.Just like the old 2D printing industries, companies will make most of their money from the repeat sales of additive manufacturing materials. MakerBot is still a great success despite of the FDM patents expiring years ago.The 3D printing industry winners will be those that can offer the best printers/materials at the right price. Some will bet on Stratasys, HPQ, GE, but my bet is DDD. Chinese copycats can come up with cheaper printers but, just like the iPhone, nobody can beat top quality and long years of experience.3D Systems has been in business for more than 30 years. It knows how to build additive manufacturing products like nobody else.Artificial Growth? Inorganic Growth?Like what the great Andreas Hopf always remind me, 3D Systems' acquisitions of so many small companies is bad. It increased the number of shares and made integrating all these new subsidiaries very hard.I disagree, M&A is actually good for the company's future.I suggest that people read The Art of War so you will understand that it is better to make allies out of potential/current enemies. Dilution of stock value is good if it prevents unnecessary warfare, thus ensuring bigger future prosperity. I used this technique to enjoy a lot of MMORPGs from 2003-2007. I built a guild and recruited other guilds/players with bribes of game money/weapons/armor. I made many real dollars selling boss-drop weapons and armor because I lead the strongest guild.Peacemaking early in the game, when all are low-levels, ensures faster leveling, farming of equipment, and overall success of the server population. I commend Abe Reichental for his mastery of the carrot-than-stick approach to recruit allies. It is easier for my guild to win new recruits if I just bribe their leaders +9 weapons or +9 armor, rather than killing them all repeatedly. Waste of time and bad publicity.There's strength in numbers. Acquisitions gave 3D Systems more technology and more talented employees. I wish Abe or Hull can persuade David Reis to join the DDD guild too. 3D Systems + Stratasys is a killer combination that will insure both companies' investors a solid future.Growth, organic or inorganic, is still growth.ConclusionI have refuted some of the most annoying lies and misconceptions about 3D Systems. I can provide more legitimate replies to other issues but I'm tired. This is one of the longest SA articles I ever did.I accept that DDD's fall will go unabated in the near term but I'll be using this bearish mood to make small purchases to add to my DDD position. Yes, I'll swing trade and buy options too. I'll ride the shorts but I'm long DDD.Here are some pertinent charts that I find necessary to always include for new investors who are not yet familiar with DDD. 3D Systems is not at fault for the high DDD price in January.A pump and dump may have happened, I'm not really sure. But my background on mathematics and advertising convinces me that there was something fishy about the bullish run of DDD from October 2013 to early January 2014.After Citron Research published its negative report on 3D Systems on January 24, DDD fell sharply. Please read this explanation why I thought Citron Research ignited a wildfire of negativity over DDD.SourceDDD's double digit revenue growth over the years is not fake. It is also making money for the last three years.SourceSource: Yahoo FinanceIt's March 27, 2014. A 52-week low for DDD was $30 on March 27, 2013. The shorts' percentage of float should be higher than 30% already. Buy on the dip, hold and be patient. DDD will rise again once the shorts get bored shorting the stock and make another manipulative bull run.Source: Yahoo FinanceDisclosure: I am long DDD.

2111813,56202,2014-03-27T03:57:08-04:00,"3D Systems is delivering solid revenue growth, which means that the company is dominating the 3D printing market.3D Systems is making strong headway in industrial-grade manufacturing with its direct metal printers.With a host of acquisitions, 3D Systems is well placed to benefit from the different applications of 3D printing.While 3D Systems looks overvalued, its earnings growth projection for the next five years is very impressive.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has faced some tough times recently as the company's shares are down 36% so far this year. The stock has been dogged by news of new competitors in the market, such as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and 3D Systems' reduction of its guidance in February. But, in my opinion, investors should capitalize on the recent weakness in 3D Systems' stock price since the company has got strong long-term prospects and looks capable of dominating the 3D printing industry for a variety of reasons.Positives to consider3D Systems' printing business is doing well as a result of its robust design and manufacturing. The company is focusing on various aspects of its operations to improve profitability and is actively hunting for opportunities to gain market share. Further, 3D Systems' business lines such as print material, service, and healthcare and consumer solutions have been important to its success so far, and the company isn't leaving anything to chance as it intends to dominate these markets. As such, it wasn't surprising to see 3D Systems post revenue growth of 52.4% in the last reported quarter since its products have gained good traction.But it needs to be kept in mind that 3D Systems is also facing a challenge in maintaining its profit margin as a result of unfavorable product mix and new product announcements that require higher investments to promote. But, it should also be considered that these pains are more short-term in nature and could propel 3D Systems to new highs in the future.Industrial growth is key3D Systems' Direct Metal 3D printer is seeing strong demand. Also, major OEMs and service providers are adopting the company's ProX metal printer because of its capability to produce the most demanding industrial grade precision metal parts. 3D Systems' direct metal revenue grew 204% last year, driven by sales of its Phenix printers. 3D had acquired Phenix Systems last year, and now the company is reaping the benefits of the acquisition.Going forward as well, 3D Systems should see the momentum in this sector continue as it continues to attack the industrial precision parts market with its robust printers. According to Gartner:The research firm goes on to say that 3D printing will redefine various industries such as consumer products, industrial, and manufacturing, while also having an impact on construction, education, energy, government, medical products, military, retail, telecommunications, transportation and utilities. By 2015, seven of the 50 largest multinational retailers are expected to sell 3D printers through their physical and online stores as Gartner predicts.3D Systems has positioned itself accordingly to benefit from these applications. The company has made numerous acquisitions in the past couple of years as it is looking to tap each and every spectrum of the 3D printing industry.Impressive movesFor instance, 3D Systems recently acquired Xerox's (NYSE:XRX) Wilsonville-based team that has added over a hundred experienced engineers, including over 20 materials scientists, state-of-the-art facilities, and significant intellectual property to 3D Systems' portfolio. In addition, 3D Systems launched 12 new professional and design and manufacturing products at EuroMold, as it targets to become the leader in aerospace, automotive, medical device, and jewelry manufacturing.Further, 3D Systems' recent acquisitions, such as Village Plastics, Gentle Giant and Digital PlaySpace should open up opportunities on the consumer and retail platforms. Also, 3D Systems is in a partnership with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for delivering the first ever high-speed continuous manufacturing of multi-materials 3D printer.A premium, but worthy valuationHence, it can be clearly seen that 3D Systems is a pioneer in 3D printing. As the company continues to integrate its acquisitions, its products should see better margins and drive earnings growth in the future. This is what the analysts expect as well. 3D Systems' earnings are slated to grow at an annual rate of 23.17% over the next five years, eclipsing peers such as Stratasys.While some might complain that the stock is expensive at a trailing P/E of almost 130, it should also be considered that it trades at a relatively cheaper forward P/E ratio of just 48. This signifies substantial earnings growth in the future, making 3D Systems a good buy on the recent pullback.ConclusionHence, despite being overvalued, 3D Systems looks like a good pick since its earnings are expected to grow at a remarkable pace. With a slew of acquisitions and product roll outs, 3D Systems looks like a good long-term bet. So, investors shouldn't mind paying a premium for the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2124283,44981,2014-04-03T10:28:10-04:00,The dental implants market is expected to reach $5 billion in the U.S. by 2018.Medical Modeling's products are an essential tool for surgeons.The acquisition will allow the company to enhance its position in the medical devices and solutions segment.,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has made about 50 acquisitions in the last three years making its way through different segments of the consumer segment of the 3-D printing industry. The ability to supplement the organic growth with acquisitions has enabled the company to grow at an exceptional rate and to broaden its products mix. The 3-D printing sector has been trending down since the start of the year and these stocks have lost substantial value. However, more recently, the sector has started to make a turnaround and 3-D printing stocks are making good progress.Another Addition to the Portfolio3D Systems has most recently acquired Medical Modeling Inc. The company is the world's only 3-D printing-to-modeling provider in the medical devices segment. It has the capability with both biocompatible plastic and direct metal. The main application of this technology is in the field of surgical planning and implants. Medical imaging historically has been used for the diagnosis only. However, Medical Modeling has used the medical imaging to create custom solutions for the patients, and the use of medical modeling in the treatment these days have changed how reconstructive surgery is being done. VSP (Virtual Surgical Planning) is a product developed by Medical Modeling. This process allows the surgeons to plan the surgery in a virtual mode in order to increase the success rate. The surgeon remains in contact with the Medical Modeling engineers throughout the process and gets the desired results. Once the surgical plan is completed, the custom instruments can be created. (You can read further about VSP here).The earlier products of the company were ClearView and AccuDental. ClearView is the premier offering of the company - this product offers the image processing of CT/CBCT input data. Once the medical imaging is done, the files are sent to the machines where the models are created. The 3-D printing technology is being extensively used in the dental implants segment, and the company's AccuDental procedure will allow 3D Systems to enhance its position in this segment. The product is focused on the guided implantation.The transaction will be accretive to the net income. The use of 3-D printing and medical imaging is increasing in the healthcare sector and these products will go a long way in establishing 3D Systems in the medical devices and equipments segment. As I have said before, the medical devices segment is almost as important as the consumer segment as the application and use of this technology is extremely helpful in different procedures.At the end of last month, the company announced that its ProJet 3510 MP and VisiJet's Stoneplast dental materials were available with 3Shape Implant studio. The studio software allows the dental surgeons to design and print fully functional dental implant drill guides. The integration of the company's proprietary material and printer will further enhance its position in the segment. The recent movements by the company in the medical devices segment shows that 3D Systems is focusing on this lucrative segment of the 3-D printing industry.Market PotentialAccording to the American Academy of Implant Dentistry, the global prosthetic supplies market is expected to reach $4 billion by 2018, and the dental implants market in the U.S. is expected to reach $5 billion. It is clear that this segment of the market is set to experience strong growth over the next five years. I believe 3D Systems' efforts to increase its presence in the segment are timely and it should bring substantial benefits to the company.The current position of the medical equipments in the 3-D printing industry is quite small and the majority of the revenue comes from the consumer printers and the industrial printers that are mainly used for prototyping. However, as the surgeons look for precision and higher success rate in surgery, the use of the 3-D printing and medical imaging will increase. As a result, I believe the economic benefit from this segment will grow substantially over the next five years.Conclusion3-D printing stocks are going to remain volatile in the short term due to the pessimism about the technology becoming mainstream from some sections of the market. Another reason for the high volatility is short-term traders. However, I believe in the long-term prospects of the technology and I expect 3-D printing to further grow its roots over the next few years. I believe 3D Systems is making very good acquisitions and it is important that the company has a presence in the medical devices segment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2105383,39301,2014-03-24T11:44:20-04:00,3D Systems may fall further based on the technical chart set-up.Macroeconomic concerns immaterial to 3D Systems at the present moment.Decelerating growth rates may not result in a lower valuation over the long haul.R&D may unlock efficiency gains resulting in wider adoption for industry applications.Overall the risk-to-reward favors to the upside.,"I wouldn't be in any hurry to dump 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). Sure, the stock is volatile, but this is to be expected from a high momentum name. We all knew the risk of volatility going into this. While many try to pin an exact reason, for why 3D Systems is being sold-off, I for one think it's being sold because of fear.The long-term picture remains largely intact, and unless I see a material change to guidance, or a missed quarter, I feel that the investment offers compelling upside despite trading at lower levels.The technical set-up looks awfulSource: FreeStockChartsThe technical analysis is definitely indicative of a down-trend. This makes it very difficult to convince anyone to buy into the equity. However, buying when others are fearful in high momentum names has proven to be an effective strategy for generating market beating returns assuming the growth trajectory offered by other analyst or by internal management is accurate.Is China the problem?Maybe, and it's just a theory here, the real reason for selling is the weakening Chinese PMI indicator. I have no idea how investors thought that China's manufacturing sector would be indicative of outward growth for 3D printing. China tends to focus on low-end manufacturing, which can be more labor intensive than capital intensive.If anything, China unto itself isn't really indicative of where 3D Systems is likely to be, as 3D Systems reported that 19% of its sales went to the Asia Pacific. While 19% of sales coming from Asia economies doesn't sound like a whole lot, to a high-flier like 3D Systems, just a moderate miss on sales or earnings due to worsening PMI may send jitters down the backs of investors.Source: JPMorgan ChaseWith global PMI above 50, manufacturing is expanding on a broader scale, and is slowly accelerating. 81% of 3D Systems earnings come from North America, and Europe, so I'm pretty skeptical of China's macro crimping on the share price, despite being a potential risk factor.Analyst sentiment lowering valuation?However, a notable dowgrade from Bank of America/Merill Lynch came in a couple weeks ago, sending the stock even lower:I sat back, and thought about the validity of Bank of America's arguments for further downside. The biggest argument by Bank of America was decelerating growth, but looking over case history, many high growth names report slowing growth and still trade at higher valuations.Source: YChartsLooking over the historical data, you will notice that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have reported declining growth rates over the ten year period. Think of this mathematically, is it possible for a company to sustain higher rates of growth as the business grows bigger, the answer is no. No matter how great of a product, sometimes the value in dollars rather than percentile becomes so humongous it becomes difficult to sustain the historical pattern.However, offering a lower price target doesn't really make a whole lot of sense as the business can return to its previous highs even at lower growth rates. Meaning, that investors quick to dump the stock because of peaking growth rates may miss out on the next stock price rally.Bank of America mentions that rising R&D spending is bad in this specific instance, because it isn't going to result in revenue growth expansion. However, even at 30-40% growth rates, I find that 3D Systems seems a little undervalued. I'm throwing around figures here for illustrative purposes, so we can understand the difference between exponential and linear growth. Let's assume revenue growth slows, and we're stuck with a 30% annual growth rate for the next five years, where would that leave us? It would approximate to $2.6 billion in revenue. Assuming the stock trades at 5x sales, that would leave us at a $13 billion market capitalization, which is higher than the current $5.9 billion market capitalization.Manufacturing is a multi-trillion dollar industry, and assuming 3D Systems' R&D initiatives are successful, it can unlock really huge chunks of the global manufacturing market. In the grander scheme of things, 3D Systems is well-positioned to sell an all-purpose manufacturing product. This is why 30% growth feels like a very conservative figure, because it assumes that 3D Systems will only earn $2.6 billion in sales from a multi-trillion dollar industry by 2019. Sure a 3D printer can't do everything, and in many instances it makes sense to assemble rather than 3D print. But if we were to assume efficiency gains, the install base of 3D printers could expand above consensus expectation, resulting in higher revenue growth.ConclusionBecause none of the factors mentioned by Bank of America indicate the business will destroy shareholder capital, I'm remaining bullish. Furthermore, I think the selling is temporary, and is largely fear driven. While growth rates may slow, it's unlikely that will happen in the immediate future based on management's guidance. Organic growth could be resurgent if efficiency gains unlock further manufacturing applications. Overall the risk-to-reward favors the upside.The volatility of the investment will make it difficult for more conservative investors to hold onto their positions during periods of portfolio draw down. To address volatility, investors should cost-average into 3D Systems. It will take a lot of conviction to hold onto 3D System through market volatility, be prepared.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2104903,58641,2014-03-24T08:46:07-04:00,"3D Systems is in a disruptive industry, the high P/S and EV/R ratios are normal.DDD is susceptible to propaganda.3D Systems’ numerous printing technologies make it very versatile like Phil Ivey. It can play and win in several avenues of additive manufacturing.A good way to profit from DDD is to ride both the bulls and bears via options trading.","I confess that my paper loss over 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is nearly half of my monetized gains from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). However, whining and quitting while down are not my style. I'm only more challenged to stick it out with DDD in spite of the recent setbacks. I'm a poker grinder and I squeezed out In The Money wins by being patient and focused on long-term gains.Many times, like DDD is right now, I got dealt with bad beats and saw my stack go to 1/10 of the big stack. I never lose my enthusiasm and just played the game. Most often, patience (not luck) to wait for strong cards helped me finish In The Money. Going full tilt just because bad press caused DDD to lose 40% of its share will not help me recover those paper losses.The important thing is to ignore the trash talking, false tells, intimidation, and bad beats that goes with poker tournaments. The same principles apply to stock investing, it's just another gambling tournament. However, I was wrong to previously expect that stock markets follow the rule of logic. Fundamentals do not dictate how companies perform in the stock market.Pot odds, implied odds, stack management, all important poker rules, are mathematical rules that the stock market often disregards. I lost a bundle (paper losses) on my wrong calls on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), BlackBerry (BBRY), Nokia (NYSE:NOK), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Thankfully, my poker-training helped me minimize or even win back those losses. Last month's DDD movement helped me recoup losses via judicious swing trades.Trash Talking Dictates DDDSpoiler alert: if you do not tolerate conspiracy theories, better stop reading this article now and go watch funny cats at YouTube.This is also for new SA readers. Most SA veterans already know that DDD lost 40% of its price most likely because the devious people who hyped it up and brought the stock to its January highs, are the same forces that are again shorting the stock. Trash talking about DDD on the news was an easy method to make many gullible investors quickly dump their DDD like it was a dog with rabies.Smart small investors already accept that propaganda, or psy-war tactic, is very effective in driving down or driving up any company's ticker. Big investors can either start a big rally or an avalanche of shorting if enough half-truths get into the rumor pipeline. The sheep always go where the big dogs bark out the directions.The 3D printing industry was 2013's top disruptive topic and since DDD was the clear leader in the said sector, it received the pump and dump treatment. The heavy hitters decided the DDD's pyramid run has reached its peak last January, so they decided it was time to short and make money again on DDD's decline.If we look back to 2013, DDD's movement was largely influenced by news releases. I can't put all the links in here, Google them yourselves and compare those good/bad news clips to the chart below. Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) recent 3D printing rumor last week is just one example of this market-influencing fear mongering against DDD and other additive manufacturing players.I wish I was as smart as Phil Ivey. I am not smart enough to realize that options trading would have helped me profit from the psy-war experts' play with DDD. I am not as versatile as Ivey, I only grind Pot Limit Omaha and No Limit Hold'em tables. Ivey can play and win on all variants of poker.Versatility Is Good for DDD's FutureLuckily for 3D Systems, its judicious acquisitions make it the Ivey of additive manufacturing. It has seven different 3D printing methods - which to me is better for the long term because multi-tabling poker games or product-selling has better variance of winning. I do 4-tables poker gambling regularly to stay ahead of the unrealistic probabilities that online poker often delivers.Bears often cry that 3D Systems is worse than Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) because DDD will have a hard time integrating seven different printing products. Only the dumb will accept this kind of faulty logic. Ask any professional poker players, they win more money because they can play at several variants of poker. More poker skills mean more tournaments to sign up for - more chances to finish In The Money.The company's patent on laser sintering expired last month and bears again drummed up that DDD will die from this because 3D Systems cannot compete with cheap 3D printers from China. Patent expiration issues did not deter SSYS. Stratasys still bought MakerBot despite the fact that FDM patents expired years ago. Stratasys flourished despite the presence of cheaper FDM printers made possible by expired patents.$26 Is Not DDD's Fair ValueA fellow Seeking Alpha contributor gave 3D Systems a $26 price target. Based on the comments and his replies to queries about his valuation, there's no way to justify accurately what price DDD should have. 3D Systems is in a disruptive industry that even the most brilliant mathematicians or Phil Ivey cannot put a future value on.We only have to rely on guesstimates. The one with the loudest mouths on Wall Street, will be heard by the greatest number of listeners.I do not have the biggest mouth but I'd like to shout that $26 is not DDD's fair value. There are so many metrics that we can use and still not come up with a near-accurate value for 3D Systems. P/S, EV/R, P/E, P/B, PEG, these are just ratios that we concocted that are not set in stone.Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Just look at what my darling Facebook did recently with its purchase of WhatsApp. That startup isn't worth $19 billion if we apply all the theories of good investing. A 400 million user base is not worth $19 billion. We quantify investments based on guesstimates of future returns.Zuckerberg is smarter than me, he is gambling that the FUTURE might give him more than double the price tag of WhatsApp. WhatsApp's 2013 estimated gross revenue was only $400 million. If we use Price/Sales, Facebook valued the startup with a P/S of 47. Who are we to question the genius that is Zuckerberg. Phil Ivey will go all in with just connected connectors if he is in position. Suited connectors have good odds to produce a flush, which can beat a pair or trio of aces.The $26 bears are not smarter than us, they are just going with the flow, dancing to the music that big market players decide for DDD.Conclusion3D Systems is being shorted because the deep stack big boys of the market decided that DDD is now a bubble stock with its high P/S ratio of more than 10. The said high valuation, which the manipulators themselves created on the expense of susceptible investors, is being used to orchestrate a bear run over 3D Systems.Based on Facebook's latest acquisition, 3D Systems can also be worth 40x P/S to somebody out there. But of course, I'm just a conservative dumb dog from the Philippines. My 1-year PT for DDD is still 10 P/S of the projected next FY's sales of $812 million or $81.2.My PT guesstimate is also influenced by the intangible asset that is Chuck Hull, the man largely responsible for 3D printing. Hull's old brain can still come up with an equalizer to Hewlett-Packard's threat to put 3D Systems' future in jeopardy. I hope he calls HPQ's bluff and raises Whitman's bet by threefold. A merger with SSYS is just the perfect tag team to knock out HPQ.Since propaganda is such a big factor on how the market treats tickers, I'll be using options to ride how the big deep stack bullies treat DDD this year. Buy-and-forget is good for long-term DDD gambits but swing trading is also great.I will do what HPQ is doing. I know how to be a bully too. I'm going to log in my max level 99 Rohan Online Templar tonight so I can terrorize low level players out of their leveling spots.Disclosure: I am long DDD.

2104483,25106,2014-03-24T05:29:13-04:00,"3D Systems shares have fallen after HP announced it will enter the 3D printing business.Analyst downgrades are likely over the next few months, and will keep pressure on 3D Systems shares.HP is a better way to bet on the future of 3D printing.","Since my previous mention of 3D System Corp. (NYSE:DDD) in a piece entitled ""3D Systems Corp.: A Strong Sell"", published just weeks ago, shares have fallen by more than 24%.Hewlett-Packard To Enter 3D Printing MarketNews that Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) will enter the 3D printing market in June sent shares of 3D printing stocks sharply lower. DDD shares tumbled, along with peers such as Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), Exone Co. (NASDAQ:XONE), and Voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET). HP's decision to enter the 3D printing market is a negative for these companies for a number of reasons. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, HPQ's move indicates that it is unlikely to make a major acquisition in the 3D printing space. Instead, HPQ is unrolling its own technology. Additionally, HPQ will almost certainly prove a most capable rival for the companies currently in the 3D printing business. Despite this, some, such as RBC analyst Amit Daryanani, have argued that HPQ entering the 3D printing space in some way validates the market for 3D printing and could help support stocks, such as DDD. I disagree with this notion. The sky-high valuations of 3D printing companies show that the market has already anticipated a bright future for the industry. Certainly, investors do not need HP to tell them that the future for 3D printing is bright.HP Confirms My ThesisIn my previous piece, one of the reasons why I was bearish on DDD was the possibility of increasing competition in the 3D printing space. 3D printing stocks, such as DDD, Exone, and Stratasys are being valued as if they will dominate the industry in the coming years. However, this is no guarantee. Furthermore, HPQ's move to seriously enter the 3D printing market makes it less likely that any of these firms will dominate the industry.The Next Shoe To Drop: DowngradesI believe the next part of the DDD story to play out is likely to be a rush by analysts to downgrade the stock. Currently, ratings on DDD are mostly bullish. According to Nasdaq, DDD has 8 buy ratings, 2 hold ratings, 1 underperform rating, and 1 sell rating. We have yet to see a significant number of analyst downgrades in reaction to recent developments, and most importantly, recent weakness in the stock price. Downgrades will lead to continued pressure in DDD shares as momentum continues to the downside. Simply put, I am still a bear on DDD.How To Play 3D Printing ConservativelyWhile I am not a huge bull on HPQ because of its exposure to old, mature, businesses such as 2D printing and PC manufacturing, I believe HPQ is a conservative way to bet on 3D printing and a far better stock to be long than DDD. Importantly, HPQ trades at a reasonable valuation, less than 10 times forward earnings and 2.15 times sales. Comparably, DDD trades at more than 45 times forward earnings and more than 12 times revenue. If the 3D printing business disappoints in the coming years, DDD shares have considerable downside. HPQ does not face the same risks due to its lower valuation and diverse business mix. Finally, if 3D printing takes off in the coming years, I believe HPQ is more likely to be the industry leader than DDD.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2107423,56382,2014-03-25T09:39:24-04:00,"Increasing competition is going to be a problem for 3D Systems after patent expiry.Faster printers are being developed by others, and this could hurt 3D Systems.Too many acquisitions seem to be taking a toll on 3D Systems’ earnings performance.","3D printing is a fast-growing industry with many companies capitalizing on this market, and 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has been one of the fastest-growing companies in it. But as the 3D printing industry grows, more companies are coming in to fight for a bigger slice of the market share pie. 3D printing is projected to be a $6.5 billion industry by the end of this decade, and this growth of the 3D printing market, which was worth $1.7 billion in 2011, is attracting new players, such as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ). But HP's entry isn't the only reason why you should dump shares of 3D Systems. In fact, there are a total of five reasons why the stock is no longer a buy. Let's take a look at them one by one.Stronger competition: Bigger players such as Hewlett Packard are now making an entry into the 3D printing market. HP's financial strength will be an important factor that will help it establish its footprint in this industry. HP has been extravagant when it comes to R&D expenses that amount to $800 million, and this policy will further help HP to come up with its own 3D printers which can be more cost effective, apart from providing better printing speeds.Just recently, HP CEO Meg Whitman announced that the company will lay out its 3D printing blueprint in June this year. According to HP executives, sales of 3D printers and associated software and services should increase to $11 billion by 2021 from just $2.2 billion in 2012. Hence, HP is placing a bigger bet on the industry's prospects than analysts.Patent expiry: This year, many patents related to 3D printing are expiring. This can hamper revenue of 3D systems in terms of royalty fees for patents. Adding insult to injury, many smaller start-up companies are looking to jump onto the 3D printing bandwagon, as such companies could not have afforded the royalty fees earlier and were waiting for the patents to expire. In fact, financial organizations are keen on investing in ""disruptive start-up firms"" as venture capitalists. One such company is Harbour Capital Group, which is keen to invest in the 3D printing market. This will again lead to higher competition with start-ups being financially backed by venture capitalists.Unplanned buying spree: 3D Systems has made aggressive investments to acquire other players, and this has led to profitability concerns among investors. 3D Systems has been overgenerous since December last year in buying various companies. In fact, five companies have been bought by 3D Systems during this time frame and recently, it purchased Digital Playspace for an undisclosed amount. Another major acquisition of 3D System's was Xerox's (NYSE:XRX) Oregon-based solid ink engineering and development team for $32.5 million in cash. In addition, Village Systems and Gentle Giant Studios are other companies that 3D Systems has bought.The problem with these acquisitions is that 3D Systems has acquired too many companies too fast, and integrating them will take time. But, on the other hand, it is also seen that these acquisitions haven't contributed much to 3D Systems' earnings. In fact, in the previous quarter, 3D Systems' earnings grew just 3% year over year. The company is now looking to invest in research and development, which ultimately nullifies the positive effect that the acquisitions were supposed to have.So, it can be said that in a bid to expand its reach to as many verticals of the 3D printing market as possible, 3D Systems messed up somewhere and now it is looking at organic growth possibilities.Price and speed: This is the most important constraint that may lead many users and corporations to refrain from embracing 3D printing for their mainstream operations. While price is the most important factor for general consumers, speed plays an important factor in the industrial arena. High prices and low speeds are a major hindrance that would limit the adoption of 3D printing.Excessive investments might be needed on various research and development activities before a 3D printer with a lower price and a higher speed comes out. This would affect the bottom line of companies such as 3D Systems. On the contrary, companies such as HP, which have a very high R&D budget and a huge cash position, stand to have a better chance of coming out with a low-priced higher speed 3D printer.Super speed 3D printers: But, it seems that high speed 3D printers, mainly for industrial usage, would soon be in the market. Cincinnati Inc. has partnered with Oak Ridge National Laboratory to produce super fast 3D printers. The projected printing speed can be 200 to 500 times faster than the existing 3D printers and would be capable of printing components that would be 10 times larger. This can create more trouble for 3D Systems going forward.ConclusionIt looks like 3D Systems' days of dominance will be a thing of the past going forward. The stock has lost a staggering 40% of its value in 2014, and this downward trend looks set to continue if we look at the reasons stated above. In fact, 3D Systems has a short float of 29.5%, which is very high. This indicates that there are many who are betting against the success of 3D Systems, and this could be the case, since the company is facing a lot of headwinds.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

HP's faster printing technology can further improve DDD's products.3D Systems is trading 33% below its 52-week high, making it more affordable for interested M&A suitors.","The latest report that Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) is on track to start its 3D printing by June should not be a reason for 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) investors to hit the panic button. Don't let this latest press deter you from swing trading DDD for the short-term, or holding it long for a possible HP and 3D Systems merger scenario.HP CEO Meg Whitman claims that HP researchers already solved critical technical problems which will help HP make a successful entry to the 3D printing industry. The Reuters article mentioned that HP has solved the problem regarding the durability of finished products by improving the quality of the substrates used in the company's 3D printing process. More importantly, Whitman also revealed that HP has managed to speed up the entire process of 3D printing.The tedious printing speed is a major factor why 3D printing has not yet received wider acceptance among consumers. If HP really delivers a higher speed home 3D printer than what 3D Systems and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) have, then now is a great time to buy HP shares.On the other hand, HP already failed earlier in its effort to enter the 3D printing market. Whitman's company signed a manufacturing and distribution deal with Stratasys in 2010. HP decided to terminate its deal with Stratasys in 2012. I don't really know why those two parted ways.The important clue is HP tried and failed. HP's June announcement also doesn't mean the company will immediately be rolling out 3D printers alongside their inkjet printers. It will take time for the company to make a commercial launch. It will be better for HP to adjust its latest 3D solutions to improve 3D Systems' current products.Should HP's latest foray into 3D printing prove to be a flop like it was two years ago, it will be very hard for the company to catch up with the current leaders, 3D Systems and Stratasys.3D Systems is A Good Fit for HPI assume that HP is making a second attempt to enter the growing 3D printing market primarily because of 3D Systems' rapid sales growth. The numbers do not lie; DDD produced consistent double digit revenue growth rate for the last five years.I do not doubt that HP actually has the resources and distribution network to go on its way. However, a merger with 3D Systems still offers compelling reasons. In addition to its in-house patents, 3D Systems' buying spree has given it ownership of other important 3D printing IP assets.HP's strong presence in the corporate server/data market plays well with 3D Systems' high-end products. 3D Systems already proved its mettle with its success in the enterprise market. Based on its latest earnings report, DDD's biggest revenue came from non-consumer solutions sales.I do not believe that DDD's M&A-fueled growth is reason enough to dismiss the company's success as an illusion. Again, the non-organic growth of 3D Systems gave it access to new customers, IP technologies, and eliminated competition. I don't think U.S. regulators have been negligent in their jobs to see to it that DDD's CEO Avi Reichental did not cook up 3D Systems' books to show fake sales.I also believe that HP's enterprise-centric business should help 3D Systems retain its high-margin sales to corporate customers. A rapid shift towards low-ASP products can greatly affect DDD's already thin net income. While there's a popular demand for cheaper personal printers, 3D Systems will not benefit much from selling cheap printers now.The biggest benefit to HP of a possible HP merger with DDD is immediate access to a profitable company that already has the biggest market share in 3D printing. Quickparts is a nice complementary service for HP's corporate customers. HP's huge cash reserves can even let it buy DDD in an all-cash deal now that DDD is selling in the low 60s.3D Systems Can Survive Against HP3D Systems' growth rate can suffer from HP's entry. Should HP decide to go it alone, I still firmly believe that the DDD can survive and thrive. The company has been in the business since the 1980s and outlived or outpaced the competition. 3D Systems can even survive in the face of an HP and Stratasys merger.While the high 12.60 P/S and 11.52 EV/R worries some, DDD has no debilitating debt handicap to make the company go bankrupt anytime soon. 3D Systems is in a disruptive high growth business, so it's natural for the company to trade at premium P/S, P/E ratios.SSYS, on the surface, looks like a better merger partner for HP due to its current lower market cap and lower projected forward P/E. But I'm hoping that HP will take into account that 3D Systems is the one with a more diverse portfolio of 3D printing solutions. DDD is also currently profitable while SSYS suffered a loss despite the big surge in its sales.The big pullback since January improves DDD's chance to be acquired by a bigger company. If HP decides not to merge or buy 3D Systems, there's still Seiko Epson. Industry consolidation, like what DDD has been doing with its frenzied buy-outs of smaller firms, is ultimately beneficial to the future of the 3D printing industry.ConclusionThe big 3.2% drop in DDD recently is understandable. Investors are nervous about the latest report on HP's 3D printing advances. It did not also help that CEO Avi Reichental sold 66,700 shares last March 14. Further drops are on the horizon.A cheaper DDD is just fine with me. I'm waiting for the bears to bring it down further so I can buy some more. A merger or takeover offer from HP, Epson, or any bigger company is not farfetched. The lower market cap makes the company more affordable to prospective buyers.HP or Epson, with 3D Systems under their wings, can help 3D printers become as popular as laser/inkjet printers in the office and households. However, 3D Systems' inherent flexibility and long experience in the industry make it capable enough to prosper as an independent company.Disclosure: I am long DDD.

2092053,54222,2014-03-17T06:32:43-04:00,Increased R&D spending will benefit 3D Systems in the future.Acquisitions should assist growth when 3D Systems integrates them into its core business.Recent drop in the share price makes 3D Systems a good deal.,"3D printing stalwart 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has dropped 35% this year after issuing a disastrous outlook in February. Investors are spooked by the fact that 3D Systems might lose its advantage in the 3D printing industry to fellow players such as Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) or ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), or even potential newcomers such as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ). However, with shares of 3D Systems down massively this year, is the stock a buy? Let's find out.Accelerating R&D and a rich tradition3D Systems is aggressively investing in research and development. The company more than doubled its R&D spending in the fourth quarter from $7.8 million the prior year to $16.6 million for the December quarter. 3D Systems is rapidly increasing its sales and marketing infrastructure and talent expenditures to support its growth initiatives. The impact of these expenditures was partially reflected in the unveiling of 24 new products between Dec. 1, 2013 and Jan. 9, 2014. As a result of R&D productivity, revenue from new products rose an impressive 75% to $231 million in the previous quarter. 3D Systems also continued to expand its manufacturing capacity to accommodate increasing demand.3D Systems plans to double its revenue over the next couple of years. However, this would come at the cost of a short-term impact on the margins. Management is focusing on accelerating the company's growth and expanding its market share. Consequently, management is prioritizing initiatives and investments that are central to its plans to double its revenue over the next couple of years, ahead of short-term earnings, in order to deliver the full potential of its business model.3D Systems has illustrated its leadership through innovation and technology. It invented 3D printing with its stereolithography (SLA) printer and was the first to commercialize it in 1989. 3D Systems also invented Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) printing and commercialized it in 1992. Further, 3D Systems invented the ColorJet-Printing (CJP) class of 3D printers along with Multi-Jet-Printing (MJP) printers. Today, its comprehensive range of 3D printers is the industry's benchmark for production-grade manufacturing in aerospace, automotive, patient-specific medical device, and a variety of consumer, electronic, and fashion accessories.Due to its strong and diversified portfolio, 3D Systems saw robust demand for professional and advanced manufacturing printers, an increase in materials growth rate, and total unit sales that more than tripled last year's units. Also, demand for Direct Metal 3D Printers is rising. Major OEMs and service providers are investing in ProX Direct Metal printers because of their capability to produce the most demanding industrial-grade precision metal parts.Inorganic growth is certainly helpingDirect Metal revenue was helped by the acquisition of Phenix Systems, which 3D Systems had acquired in July last year. This shows the adept nature of 3D Systems at buying smaller companies and integrating them successfully into its business.3D Systems is also a domain expert in aerospace, automotive, medical device and jewelry manufacturing and believes that the acquisition of Xerox Wilsonville, combined with its Google Project Ara, places it in a solid position to benefit from 3D printing's advancement. The company has an attractive consumer portfolio available today, along with the right performance levels and price points to accelerate adoption.Also, 3D Systems expects the acquisition of Village Plastics to accelerate its consumer material development and margins. It expects the acquisitions of Gentle Giant and Digital Playspace to enhance its brand publishing capabilities and the attractiveness of its consumer and retail platform. Moreover, the joint development agreement with Hershey is designed to explore and develop fab grade manufacturing platforms, as well as prosumer and consumer 3D printers for edible chocolates and sweets.Analyst targets and targeted acquisitionsIt now seems that 3D Systems' shares have run out of fuel. The stock is down nearly 38% from its all-time high, thus, this is an ideal entry point for opportunistic investors. The company's prospects look strong and it has already taken the lead in the consumer segment. The acquisition of Village Plastics and Gentle Giant, along with the deal with Hershey's, will benefit the company going forward.Moving on to the industrial side of the business, 3D Systems is facing intense competition from Stratasys and ExOne. Both these companies focus more on the industrial side of 3D printing and are currently enjoying stronger pricing and better margins than 3D Systems. However, 3D Systems will improve as it integrates its 40+ M&As into its core business. As I explained in one of my previous articles, each of 3D Systems' M&A serve a different purpose, thereby giving it a diverse range of products. In the long run, this will give it a competitive edge over its peers.In addition, multiple firms have upgraded their 3D Systems' rating. Credit Suisse recently upgraded its price target to $79, while the price target at Piper Jaffray was revised upwards from $69 to $82.What should investors do?With the 3D printing market still in a nascent phase, 3D Systems has got a long runway ahead of it to propel its growth. The company is smartly strengthening its position in the industry with numerous acquisitions and is also focusing on research and development. Hence, investors should consider utilizing the recent drop to buy shares of 3D Systems as its earnings are slated to grow at a CAGR of 23% over the next five years, and there might not be many opportunities in the future to buy the shares at around $60.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2102113,22775,2014-03-21T11:45:55-04:00,HP’s 3-D printing initiative is a serious blow to the bull thesis on 3D Systems.Competition is just starting to heat up. The situation is likely to get worse when Asian low-cost companies expand their distribution reach.3D Systems' ASPs and gross margins are at risk and we expect additional EPS disappointments. Our bear-case valuation stands at $26.An HP bid for 3D Systems is highly unlikely in our view.,"HP (NYSE:HPQ) announced yesterday that it would outline plans to enter the 3-D printing market in June, with CEO Meg Whitman adding that HP researchers had developed a breakthrough technology. That technology is expected to improve the quality of substrates used in the process (a positive for the quality of finished products) and to speed up the printing process.This announcement is clearly a blow to the bull thesis on 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and peers and confirms what we said back in January in an article titled ""Competition to heat up as key patents expire, earnings risk on the downside"". The stock has lost 30% since then and we now believe that the $26 bear-case valuation we set in our ""$83 Or $26? Pick Your Scenario"" article is becoming more and more likely.Increased competition now a realityWe said in January that the expiry of key patents between 2014 and 2017, notably the laser Sintering patent (owned by 3D Systems) which expired in February 2014, would spark increased competition and pricing pressures across the industry as open-source hardware printers would be able to integrate laser sintering.The HP announcement perfectly illustrates this: HP is a new competitor in the 3-D printing industry and plans to price aggressively. Bulls say that HP's first attempt to enter the 3-D business failed in 2012 when the company ended its distribution agreement with Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) in 2012, and that it could fail again in 2014. But in our view, there's a big difference this time around: HP apparently spent a lot in R&D and claims it has developed a breakthrough technology. We will not have the opportunity to check HP's claims before a couple of months, but it looks like the company will be a serious competitor in the very short-term (in the business segment first) and that should be a major source of concern for 3D Systems and its shareholders.Competition is also heating up in the consumer market. A recent article in the Nikkei Asian Review highlighted that Japanese hobbyists would soon have the opportunity to buy 3-D printers coming from Taiwan (New Kimpo) or Singapore (Pirate3D) for much less than $1000. This suggests that 3D Systems could find it difficult to grab share in the all-important consumer space over coming years (note that was already the case in Q4). And the arrival of low-cost Chinese printers could only make things worse.In all, we reiterate our view that the ASP of printers is likely to fall sharply in coming quarters, suggesting significant pressure on gross margins going ahead: prices go down, but costs remain high due to continued marketing and R&D efforts. We would expect additional profit-warnings from 3D Systems and peers.M&A: not a likely exit opportunity for shareholdersOur fellow SA author Almario Alexej Alcazar suggested yesterday that 3D Systems could end up being acquired by HP. In our view, this scenario is highly unlikely, at least in the short-term.First, we struggle to see how HP could justify such an acquisition to its shareholders, notably after the Autonomy disaster: a 3D Systems acquisition would significantly dilute HP's EPS in view of 3D Systems' stratospheric valuation multiples.Second, HP has a large printing patents portfolio and claims it has developed a breakthrough 3-D printing technology while 3D Systems patents are gradually expiring.Last, HP has a huge distribution reach (businesses and consumers). So, where's the need to acquire 3D Systems?Conclusion3D Systems' business and earnings are obviously at risk. Against this backdrop, we believe that our bear-case $26 valuation is becoming more and more likely. As a reminder, we used the following assumptions to get to this valuation (for full details, see our article):- Organic revenue growth accelerates to 30% over 2015-2016 and then gradually moderates as competition increases and as the technology matures (pricing pressures).- In 2023, 3D Systems generates more $4bn revenues (vs. $514m in 2013) and still delivers a comfortable 15% revenue growth.- EBIT margin slightly recovers to 19% in 2015-2016 and then gradually declines as pricing pressures hit gross margins.- In 2023, 3D Systems displays a 16% margin (roughly in line with the 2014 level), and is still more profitable than hardware makers …- Growth rate in perpetuity is 3%, slightly more conservative than in our blue-sky scenario.- Discount rate of 10.4% (beta of 1.3x).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2111203,56262,2014-03-26T16:31:11-04:00,3D printing still has many flaws.Patent expiry and entry of Hewlett-Packard will hurt 3D Systems.Acquisitions will backfire.,"It's been roughly a month since I recommended investors short 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), and the stock is already down 30%. I also recommended shorting 3D Systems when it was trading over $92, and I still think the stock has more downside potential. Thus, I still think 3D Systems is a great short candidate. Let's take a look at the reasons why.Unrealistic ExpectationsInvestors have bid up 3D Systems in the hope that it will revolutionize industrial printing and also that 3D printers will become an everyday household object in the future, but I don't see this happening anytime soon. There are many things you can make with the help of a 3D printer, but people seem to ignore the fact that they will need a very expensive high-end 3D printer, which uses resins or lasers, to print these objects. Many people blindly believe that they will be able to manufacture a range of products on a low-end printer (which costs roughly $800), which is definitely not true.High Time ConsumptionThe method of producing a simple product via 3D printing can consume plenty of time, and can even last for a couple of days. By comparison, conventional industrial machines can churn out thousands of fully-finished products every day, and there's no way a present-day 3D printer can compete against that. Also, the fact that a 3D printer does not produce a fully-finished object and requires an extra step of removing the object from the printer further delays the printing process. This completely rules out the possibility of 3D printing ""revolutionizing"" the manufacturing industry.The strength of the finished product is another issue which comes with this technology. Since this technology uses layering techniques, the printed product will not be as strong as the conventionally manufactured product.Limited MaterialsAs of now, 3D printers can only print in plastic, resins, and certain metals. These printers are not capable of printing products in mixed materials, and the majority of the products that are used today are manufactured by a combination of materials, and this adds to the limitations of 3D printing. 3D Systems does NOT print in metal. This further restricts the uses of 3D printers.Complex Usability3D printing is not a user-friendly process, and you will need a CAD model to print any desired product. It goes without saying that you will need to learn how CAD works in order to make a model, and mastering the program can take years. Therefore, it is certainly not rational to assume that 3D printers will become an everyday household item in the future.Strength3D printers use a layer-by-layer technique for manufacturing an object, which ensures homogeneous strength. The product which has been manufactured may look exactly the way you wanted it and will have uniform strength throughout, but it will be weaker than the traditionally manufactured products.Patent ExpiryPatent expiry is definitely bad news for 3D Systems. Eleven key 3D printing patents are set to expire in 2014, which will open the gates for entry of new companies and give rise to a price war. 3D Systems' gross profit margin is already at the risk of compression in 2014, and the entry of new peers will further put downward pressure on it.Increasing CompetitionOut of all the peers, the impending entry of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) is probably 3D Systems' biggest cause of concern. Hewlett-Packard CEO, Meg Whitman recently announced that the company plans to enter the market in June. The company claimed it has solved several of the problems with 3D printing, including its speed, and plans ""a big technology announcement in June"" about it.Acquisition Spree Will End In DisasterAs per a Forbes article, 50% of all acquisitions end up in failure. 3D Systems has acquired close to 45 companies in the last two years. Statistically, this means over 20 of 3D Systems' M&A will fail. Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) has successfully integrated the acquisition of MakerBot into its core business; however, I don't think 3D Systems will be able to do the same. I don't think it is possible for any company to integrate over 40 companies into its core business in less than two years, let alone 3D Systems. Thus, I think 3D Systems' acquisition spree will end in a disaster.ConclusionInvestors who have made over 30% profit in the last few months can consider covering their short positions, however in the long term, I still think 3D Systems' share price will go down. Due to the aforesaid reasons, I think 3D Systems is still a good short candidate.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2091273,40031,2014-03-16T13:22:20-04:00,"After a precipitous drop in the last two months, 3D Systems may be close to finding its bottom.Recent bad publicity may be good for long-term investors.The premium valuation over Stratasys is almost gone, and the price correction has alleviated concerns over valuation.Given the past P/S ratio trends, 3D Systems’ downside may be limited to 10% to 15%.","3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) share price suffered a 38% correction from its early January all-time highs, as valuation concerns emerged and as the stock had a massive run in late 2013, squeezing the shorts out of their positions. Some of the concerns I had when I wrote my previous article on 3D Systems are almost gone now, as 3D Systems is now trading at just a slight premium over Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), and the company's P/S ratio has gone down considerably together with its share price. I believe that the downside may be limited to 10% to 15% from the current price, based on the past P/S ratio trends. The stock could consolidate further, as it may digest the latest move down, and might also depend on the general market environment, which was mostly unfavorable to momentum stocks in the last couple of weeks.Bad publicity should be good for long-term investors3D Systems has received some bad publicity recently. Barrons recently published a column titled ""Beware 3-D Printing"", which caused a sharp drop of all of the 3D printing-related companies. The column cited Whitney Tilson's short case for 3D Systems and the company's recent profit warning, and that 3D printing remains slow. 3D Systems also faces increased competition from printing services firm Shapeways and leading metal printer maker EOS. Two days later, BofA/Merrill brought the share price down further, after the firm said that the company's printer mix is ""shifting towards cheaper systems that tend to have lower materials attach rates"". While those are legitimate concerns, I believe that the valuation is now much more favorable, as I will analyze later in the article. I also think that the recent bad publicity should help long-term investors to get a better price entry in the next couple of weeks.Are valuation concerns gone?While my most important reason to favor Stratasys over 3D Systems in the short run has been 3D Systems' premium over Stratasys, the premium has come down considerably, since 3D Systems corrected 38% from its all-time highs, while Stratasys is just 18% off its all-time high price. 3D Systems' P/S ratio has come down to 12.2, while Stratasys' TTM P/S ratio stands at 11.5. However, their forward 2014 P/S ratios are almost the same. 3D Systems' 2014 P/S ratio is 8.9, while Stratasys' is 8.8. In my most recent article on Stratasys, I compared the strengths and weaknesses of both companies, and argued that Stratasys is currently a better trade/investment than 3D Systems. Now, when the valuation argument is almost gone, we have a more level playing field, with Stratasys being more successful in the consumer segment, and 3D Systems having a big advantage in metal printing. I still think Stratasys should perform better for the other reasons I mentioned: better margin performance and a more focused approach, given the number of acquisitions 3D Systems has done in the last couple of years.Where the bottom might be?If you take a look at the P/S ratio chart of 3D Systems and Stratasys in the last two years, there is a clear trend of P/S ratio expansion. Stratasys' performance is more aligned, with a more manageable trend, while 3D Systems went wild in the second half of 2013. I believe that both stocks may bottom at a TTM P/S ratio of 10, since that was the bottom of the range since the spring of 2013. Given the strong revenue growth trends, both 3D Systems' and Stratasys' P/S ratio will contract in the next couple of quarters even if the share price stays the same. Worst case scenario might be a TTM P/S ratio around 7, but we might need a very bad market environment to get there. A previously stated and more optimistic bottom price would translate into 10% to 15% downside for 3D Systems. This would coincide with a technically important level of $50, which might serve as psychological level of support, as well as a point of major accumulation in the spring and summer of 2013.Source: ychartsSource: Stockcharts.comConclusionWhile 3D Systems might continue to consolidate in the next couple of weeks, the downside may be limited to 10% to 15% from the current price. Bad publicity might also help long-term investors here, since the hype and excitement about the 3D printing industry brought the valuation to nose-bleed levels, and now may help long-term investors get a better price entry. Stratasys may continue to perform better in the next couple of weeks/months, but 3D Systems is now in a much better position than it was just a few weeks ago. The bottom could very well be around $50, which might serve as an important psychological and technical level of support.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2083633,63013,2014-03-12T10:15:54-04:00,DDD is to face lower margins due to important patent expiration and stronger competition.Exposure to consumer market and questionable acquisitions have a potential to destroy shareholder value.Development of the balance sheet positions such as “goodwill” and “inventories” are the first warning signs.,"As a private investor searching for the ""next big thing,"" I started following the 3D printing industry some time ago with a hope of finding an investment opportunity for myself. The more I learn about the industry and its main players, the more I realize how dangerous the situation for private investors is getting. Stock prices of 3D printing companies are running ahead of the industry by many years.One such stock is 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), and in this article, I would like to explain what considerations affected my originally bullish expectations and turned me into a bear.Expiring patents and strong competition:Some very important patents expired or will soon be expiring starting this year. For example, ""selective laser sintering patents."" The video provides a detailed explanation of what it means for 3D Systems.Patent expiration and growing competition will most likely cause lower margins in one of the main profit sources for 3D Systems - industrial 3D printing. Margins from consumer 3D printing have a high chance of being affected even stronger with numerous competitors coming from Asia this year.Consumer market exposure:3D Printing is coming to the consumer market. That is a known fact, but its popularity is still a question mark from my point of view. In order to become profitable, consumer 3D printing has to offer more than an expensive way to print cute but mostly useless plastic forms. Moreover, 3D printing software is not easy to use and materials are expensive. 3D systems have new products in the pipeline for 2014, which they will have to market and sell. This can prove more challenging especially considering the following statement in the latest earnings call:Acquisitions:Acquisitions are a double-edged sword; on one hand, a company acquires know-how and technology, but on the other hand faces challenges of organizational integration. There are many examples of mergers and/or acquisitions, which have gone wrong. Here is some statistics to prove my statement:Taking into account that 3D Systems acquired plenty of companies (all very different, within a short period of time), the chances are high that integration of those will prove more difficult and more expensive than anticipated. Not to mention that the expected synergies are yet to be achieved and monetized.Questionable spending apart from acquisitions:Making a pop star your company's Chief Creative Officer is an expensive and a bad marketing move, as proved by BlackBerry's stunt with Alicia Keys. 3D Systems is following that path with someone called ""will.i.am."" His deep understanding of 3D printing and its possibilities are astonishing to say the least… You can watch it here.Taking these points into consideration let's try to look at the quantitative side of the bear equation.Recent numbers already deliver the first warning signs:Rising Inventory:  Rising inventory means that 3D Systems might be facing trouble selling some of its products. Taking into consideration that they are introducing new products in 2014 it is realistic to assume that they will have to write down the unsold inventory.Rising Goodwill: Goodwill is basically a premium that a company pays for the acquisition of another company over and above its book value. This means that 3D Systems have paid dearly for its acquisitions and that goodwill might be subject to impairment in the future.Revenue Growth vs. OpEx growth:In its earnings call, 3D Systems CEO states:This statement basically says that DDD's costs are rising faster than its revenue. This is another indication of lower margins in the future.Conclusion:Normally each of these indicators alone could be disregarded but in combination they mean a high probability of a not so rosy future for 3D Systems, and by the way, we are talking about a company trading at a current P/E of 149.58 (at the time of writing). Not to mention that the market cap of roughly $ 7B which is roughly the same as the projected size of the entire 3D printing industry for the year 2018.(Source: Rob Wile Sep. 17,2013)In other words I see no way 3D Systems can meet the current sky-high expectations. As a result, I expect a continuing pullback of the stock price with a few recoveries in between. I am not setting any price target, because I think it is simply impossible for this stock, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see it trading in the $30-40 range during 2014.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in DDD over the next 72 hours. On recoveries, I occasionally buy put options on 3D Systems. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."

Is their stock a good buy or sell in 2014?3D Systems multiple strengths in Q4 2013The company improved earnings per share 6.3% in the 4th quarter 2013 over the same quarter a year previous.More growth can be anticipated in 2014 for some fundamental reasons:Their debt-to-equity ratio is low (0.02), though currently higher than the industry average. A quick ratio of 4.4 emphasizes their ability to cover short-term cash requirements.Beyond the numbers: what investors need to knowFourth-quarter revenue growth of 52% screams loudly, but what's behind that number tells a startling growth story for investors:Revenue from the ""other"" category-meaning software and perceptual devices-was $10.8 million, or 7% of total revenue.How the revenue break-out matches with demandMarket forecasters and other 3-D printing companies have predicted greater growth in this segment than actually appeared. Without a ""killer app"" compelling consumers to buy 3-D printers, the stampede might happen in 2015, and not by holiday season 2014. Thus, the company's consumer printer sales soaring 162% failed to meet their own company expectations.Growth in the health-care sector revenues-67% to $21.8 million-matches expectations of demand in that field. ""Outsized growth"" should continue with growing health-care applications from surgical models to medical implants to instruments.Furthermore, since acquiring Phenix Systems in July 2013 direct metal revenue grew 204% to $14.3 million:Growth expectations for 2014 (and 2015)Revenue growth expectations for 2014 and 2015 are ""turbocharged"". The company expects 2014 revenue from $680 to $720 million, with adjusted earnings per share coming in from $0.73 to $0.85. They expect 2015 revenue of $1 billion; nearly doubling 2013 revenue of $513.4 million.Strategically it plans to sacrifice short-term profits to focus on long-term growth and capturing market share. The plan involves:On top of these, 3D Systems continues to search for ""opportunistic acquisitions"" and partnerships. The more 3-D printers they can install the more recurring revenue from material sales they can count on-boosting company profit margins.The company partnered with dominant players across a wide range of industries in 2013. These partnerships included:With the 3-D printing sector expected to explode from $2.2 to $6 billion 2012 to 2017, it's seems best to pair up with movers and shakers before somebody else gets there first.Stock analysts express optimism on 3D SystemsMore and more analysts are expressing optimism about the prospects of 3D Systems stock. Among these:In support of all this optimism on stock price, Ricchiutti sees the company adding $105 million in revenues from metals and consumer sales, and operating leverage returning 2015. Kejriwal sees good things coming from the hiring of 100+ engineers from Xerox (NYSE:XRX) and the partnerships with Google and Hershey.Analyst Twigg sees 3D Systems aggressively developing new products, ramping up R&D spending, and focusing on creating better consumer access to 3D printing. Jensen expects investments in R&D and S&M, coupled with expansive market demand, to ""fuel impressive growth over the next several years.""And answer to the questionIs 3D Systems a good buy in 2014? Most certainly, yes.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2080633,56922,2014-03-11T09:12:49-04:00,"3D Systems is using a more focused approach to seek growth in new segments.Aerospace, toys and dental are the key segments for this industry.Valuations indicate that 3D just might be overpriced but that doesn't alone define the buy thesis.","3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), an additive manufacturing and 3-D printing company, is one of the largest 3-D printing companies in the world. We have been covering this particular stock since November 2013 and are bullish about the future prospects of the industry as a whole and specifically about the overall success of 3D Systems. We based our buy recommendation on several factors mentioned and analyzed in previous pieces. This report is an update on the recent activities of 3D Systems and the implication of these activities, if any, on the future prospects of the company. An FCF based valuation will also be added at the end of the report, incorporating growth in perpetuity, as some investors want to gain perspective on how the price target will turn out to be if growth is incorporated in the FCF calculations.Note that we did not incorporate growth factor for perpetuity in the previous price target estimates.AeroDef 2014*Source: company website3D Systems recently announced that it will present 3D printed ""functional"" aerospace parts and assemblies during the AeroDef Manufacturing Summit. The parts will be printed on the demand cloud based 3-D printing service, Quickparts. The ability to print finished parts to be used in the aerospace industry is a big achievement and it will open further doors for 3-D printing in the industry. In the past only prototypes were printed for this particular industry. The ability to print functional parts is a huge step forward for the entire 3-D printing industry and, especially, 3D Systems.GE's plan, as mentioned before, to manufacture 3D printed nozzles was also a sign that 3-D printing has a future in the aerospace industry. According to a recently published report aerospace is one of the leading markets for 3D printing. Another report by SmarTech projects that the sales of 3-D printing equipment and materials to the aerospace industry will reach $805 million by 2019 and $1.2 billion by 2023. According to this report:3D Systems' ability to print functional 3D aerospace parts enhances its opportunity to capitalize on the growth prospects of the aerospace industry.Dental Implant Drill Guides3D Systems recently announced its ProJet 3510 MP, a health care printer which will be used in implant drill guide production. The company claims that the material used is compatible with the leading dental software modules.*Source: company websiteCathy Lewis, Chief Marketing Officer at 3D Systems says:The company also claims that using this printer to print wax-ups for dental labs will result in 20% savings on alloy consumption and 50% time savings on framework finishing. The most important point is that it can be used in labs with same day processing. The company offers a vast range of dental solutions. The report mentioned above also states that 3-D dental printing can be one of the fastest growing segments of this booming industry.Overall, it seems 3D Systems is prioritizing in terms of the industries it targets. The company has been focusing on dental and aerospace segments lately which have relatively more potential for growth. We have mentioned several times that the current area of growth for the 3-D industry is the prosumer market and, in our view, a good strategy would be to focus on these prosumer and aerospace markets. 3D Systems is precisely doing this and this strategy will assist its growth in the coming years.3D Systems and the Toy IndustryA research report from Deloitte (Disruptive manufacturing: The effects of 3-D printing) mentions that toys are a $80 billion industry and rates printer readiness for toys as ""in use"". This means that 3-D printers can be used in the toys industry with their current technology and cost structure and can benefit from this lucrative industry. See the table that follows:*Source: ForbesIt seems that 3D Systems sees the toy industry as a big opportunity as it has been involved in several acquisitions that are toy related. The significant developments in this regard are as follows:Therefore, toys are also a focus of 3D Systems along with prosumer and aerospace and it makes sense. The table above shows that the current opportunity for 3-D printing lies in medical, aerospace, toys and animation. We believe that 3D Systems will benefit from the market opportunity of dental, aerospace and toys if it is successful in the execution of its plans. By focusing on fast growing industries the company is establishing itself as the top 3-D growth pick for the coming years.Valuation and Final ThoughtsWe valued 3DS in the last piece using a no growth assumption beyond 2021. Some investors wanted to find out the effect of growth assumption into perpetuity. Moreover, current and next year estimates for revenues also improved after the full year results 2013. The assumptions for valuation are the same as mentioned in the previous report, only growth has been added to the mix:The price target reveals that at current levels 3D Systems is overvalued, assuming no disruption is caused by 3-D printing technology. However, we believe 3-D printing is a candidate for mainstream adoption in the prosumer (including dental and aerospace) and consumer (including the toys industry) markets in the future. Any form of mainscale adoption will cause these fundamentals and price targets to be irrelevant. We also believe that 3-D stocks can see a correction period and are expected to fall in the near future, i.e. 6 to 7 months. Keeping all these factors in mind, we believe that 3D Systems is a good long term investment even with a risk of industry wide price corrections. It should also be noted that 3-D is a disruptive technology and this is why we have used extremely conservative growth estimates.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2072363,44981,2014-03-06T13:30:19-05:00,Strong organic and non-organic growth.New information incorporated into the model.Upside potential of about 21%.,"At the start of March, last year, I gave 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) a price target of $47 per share when the stock was trading close to $30 per share. However, the stock gained value faster than expected, and it more than tripled in value before coming down to around $70. Year-to-date, the stock is down more than 20%, and the market participants believe that the stock might come down further.As my regular readers know, I do not recommend short-term trades, and I have always advocated the long-term investment approach. In case of the 3-D printing industry, we all know that the industry is in the early stages, and the companies are going through a hyper-growth period. As a result, volatility in price will be high as investors continue to bet on the long-term growth prospects of these stocks. Due to the elevated levels of volatility, I believe the short-term trading should be left to expert traders.After the company announced its full-year results, I decided to update the model and increase its scope. Previously, my model projected revenue and earnings till 2022. However, now I have extended the period to 2026. Furthermore, I have updated the revenue and cost assumptions as well as expectations according to the new data available to us. I will discuss the model and its results in the following paragraphs.Model and AssumptionsFirst of all, let's talk about the model and the assumptions. I have used a discounted free cash flow approach in order to determine the fair value of the stock.Pro-Forma EarningsPro-forma earnings shown above have been calculated using the above-mentioned assumptions. According to my calculations, 3D Systems should be able to maintain solid operating and net profit margins even after the hyper-growth period.ValuationFor valuation, I have used a 10% discount rate, which I believe is appropriate for the company, as it has increased its footprint in the global 3-D printing industry. The discount rate is a unique component, which can differ for each investor. However, I feel a discount rate around 10% is appropriate; you can of course use your own discount rate if you deem my discount rate to be on the higher/ lower side. The below table shows the calculation of free cash flows and fair value of the company.For the free cash flow calculation, I have taken net income as the starting point. All of these net income figures represent projected net income based on above-mentioned assumptions. To reach at free cash flows, I have made adjustments regarding, depreciation, amortization, interest expense and other non-cash items, such as restructuring expenses/gains, gains/losses on equipment sale and taxes. Furthermore, investment in fixed and working capital has also been taken into account.Free cash flows beyond 2026 have been projected at a constant growth rate of 3% and discounted at the discount rate of 10% (adjusted for growth rate) to calculate terminal-year free cash flows. After calculating free cash flows for each year, I have discounted those free cash flows at 10% to reach at the present value, and added them to achieve $8.9 billion in discounted free cash flows. According to my free cash flow model, 3D Systems' stock should be trading at around $86 per share. At the moment, the stock is trading close to $71 per share. The current stock price shows that the upside potential in 3D Systems is close to 21%.ConclusionI remain bullish on the 3-D printing industry as a whole and 3D Systems in particular. I think the stock will be trading above $86 per share in about a year's time. I am giving it a one-year price target of $86 per share. The companies in the 3-D printing industry are working very hard to increase the market share; there are new partnerships and acquisitions announced on regular basis, which may result in the stock price going above my price target sooner than expected. However, I believe one year is a reasonable time frame for the stock to move towards its fair value.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2068963,22148,2014-03-05T10:41:57-05:00,3D Systems is now focused on revenue growth over profits.Organic revenue growth is not fast enough to justify the current valuation even after the recent stock drop.Scary chart updated that signaled the impending stock drop back in January.,"Along with Q413 earnings, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) made the proclamation that it would reach revenue of $1 billion during 2015. While the news generated a great deal of buzz, especially considering analysts only forecast revenue of around $900 million, the real deal is that the company will again print the revenue via acquisitions instead of organic growth. As with the guidance for declining earnings in 2014, the company continues to focus on growth over profits.The company is a leading provider of 3-D printers, print materials, and on-demand customer parts for professionals and consumers. After a recent stock slide, 3D Systems has a market value of nearly $8 billion, with revenue forecasted to average $700 million in 2014.The market remains enchanted with companies that grow revenue in spite of the impact to earnings. Back in January, Stone Fox Capital questioned how the stock could grow any further considering the scary chart showing the EV-to-Revenue multiple at over 20x. Remember, the original premise is that the multiple only declines based on organic growth or a declining stock price. Despite the undeniable valuation questions, it appears investors were enchanted with the stock again, following another weak quarter. All the CEO had to do was throw out some magical revenue numbers to excite the markets, but it probably won't last. Below, we'll review the results and update the scary chart to see if the situation has gotten any better for investors in the sector, including Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS).Weak ResultsThe company continues to push revenue growth at all costs, to the detriment of revenue. Naturally, this can make sense in order to grab market share in a fast-growing segment. 3D Systems, though, isn't pushing through organic growth. The company continues to apparently overpay for small players in the field, causing earnings growth to falter. The original intrigue in the sector was the ability to not only grow, but also generate solid profits.Below are the highlights from Q413:The revenue numbers continue to generate strong growth, even with the company suggesting that the numbers were disappointing, with more orders pushed into backlog. The biggest continues to be the lack of profit growth, with guidance suggesting that the important earnings per share will actually decline in 2014. The company forecasts reaching up to the $0.85 made in 2013. On the low end, 3D Systems might only generate $0.73 in profits this year.Scary Chart UpdatedAs mentioned in the previous article, the 3-D printing-related sector has an attractive growth trajectory, suggesting the stocks should trade around market-leading multiples. The stocks, though, spent the last couple of years outgrowing the organic growth rates. Remember that a major part of the top line growth for both 3D Systems and Stratasys was bought with stock issued to the acquired companies or issuing stock via a secondary offering to pay the acquired firm in cash. Such moves make it crucial that investors pay attention to share-based valuations either related to earnings per share or even enterprise value multiples. In the case of a fast-growing stock such as 3D Systems, earnings valuations get tricky, while enterprise values can make more since.The enterprise value multiple of revenue is where the valuation of 3D Systems got scary back in January. At the time, with the stock trading near $100, the multiple reached the stratospheric number of over 20. Most investors would consider a valuation of more than 10x revenue as extremely expensive. With the updated chart below, 3D Systems has fallen back in line with the valuation of Stratasys. The stock still sits at nearly 15x revenue, suggesting limited upside, with organic revenue growth at only 30%.DDD EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsConclusionThe 3-D printing sector remains exciting to watch, with advancements made seemingly on a daily basis. The stocks of both 3D Systems and Stratasys continue to price in high growth expectations that aren't actually occurring. Typically, 30% revenue growth and flat earnings would not justify a stock trading at an enterprise multiple to revenue of nearly 15x. In this regard, the stocks may not falter, but the short-term upside remains limited. As the headline numbers continue to fall closer to the organic numbers due to a lack of mega-mergers going forward, investors caught up in the excitement of the acquired revenue growth are likely to start losing interest in the sector. The biggest concern for investors is with earnings per share likely declining during 2014 for 3D Systems. The stock isn't likely to maintain the scary multiples in that scenario.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2094633,58641,2014-03-18T07:27:53-04:00,"Consistent revenue growth, good cash flow, and low debt ratio makes 3D Systems a great long-term momentum bet.Actively trading DDD according to the rumor-of-the-moment of 3-D printing opponents/proponents is a good way to farm short-term gains.Growth by mergers and acquisition is better, faster, cheaper way to grow market share and gain valuable IP assets.","My earlier opinion last January called for a long term hold on 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). I gave seven good reasons why 3D Systems was worth enduring near-term paper losses. Brave or impatient investors may accept my proposition that swing trading DDD during this volatile time is the better option.3D Systems is now grossly portrayed as the poster boy for the alleged 3-D printing bubble. DDD is now 33.34% below its January high. Rival Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) did not suffer the same angry treatment over the same period.On the other hand, looking at the chart below, I realized aggressively trading DDD can be profitable due the explosive nature of DDD. Emotions can run high among supporters and detractors of 3D Systems. The rabid anti-DDD crowd has equally zealous opponents in the pro-DDD camp.Swing To The Music, Profit From the BeatDDD will likely continue to experience fluctuations in its price this year. Active trading favors this scenario. A buy now in the low 60s is a swing trade opportunity. Yes, there's a good chance that it can drop further to the 50s given the current pessimism over the 3-D printing industry.However, I still foresee DDD going back to the $70-$80 price range in a month's time. Like I said, 3D Systems evokes bipolar market reactions. The share will shoot up again once critics stops pillorying 3D Systems. I also don't believe the share will crash to $26 anytime soon.DDD has risky cycle of bad press/good press that traders can take advantage of. If you are well-versed in put and call options, I congratulate you in advance. DDD's news-driven volatility is ripe for options trading.Good Press For 3D SystemsSince I'm on a buy mode, I would like to share some positive propaganda here at SA. It's up to you to decide whether my agenda is congruent to yours or not.1. I like the fact that 3D Systems signed up for the government-led Digital Lab for Manufacturing initiative to revolutionize the American manufacturing sector. It's always good for a company to collaborate with the powers-that-be.In my country, the Philippines, even the most inept company can win juicy government contracts. All it requires is a tight relationship with public officials. The same goes for any country, government contracts are won mostly through networking and lobbying.2. DDD's diverse portfolio of 3-D printing technology makes it well-positioned for the future bonanza that additive manufacturing is destined to become. The slow adaptation of home based 3-D printing can be offset by medical requirements.While replacement human organs is not yet viable, DDD is making inroads in the medical field. 3D Systems products helped doctors do quick and accurate surgical reconstruction of a man's face.3D Systems' alleged bubble-level high P/S ratio is easy to forgive when people see that the company's products helped a wheelchair-bound girl walk again.The medical benefits of 3-D printing technology is one reason why ardent supporters see a FUTURE gold mine in DDD. No matter how strong the bears are, the bulls will make repeated comebacks to keep DDD afloat.Military application of additive manufactured gadgets is also on the table. The 3-D printed exoskeleton that helped the girl walk again can be upgraded for combat or police personnel.3. Global expansion will further increase 3D Systems double-digit revenue growth rate. The market for additive manufacturing will quickly gain acceptance in emerging markets. The cost-savings from 3D printing should increase DDD products' appeal outside multinationals.Time-sensitive and short-run manufacturing of replacement parts is quickly being adapted. DDD's Quickparts is a cost-efficient service for companies to get replacement components for expensive equipments or machines.4. Aggressive acquisition is beneficial, not detrimental to DDD's bottom line. The fierce competition to lead the 3-D printing uprising requires companies to recruit the most number of allies. I am happy that President and CEO Avi Reichental has not caved in to criticism, 3D Systems' shopping spree still continues. The Digital PlaySpace acquisition is a great move to promote Cubify to mobile users.Conclusion:Swing trading DDD offers bold investors to profit nicely on the share's propaganda-fueled volatility. The current depressed price looks a good entry point for a ""buy-low-sell-higher-next-month"" gambit. The most recent financial report indicates 3D Systems is not losing steam.Stephens Inc. recently upgraded DDD to Overweight and Credit Suisse also increased its price target for 3D Systems to $79 two weeks ago. Piper Jaffray also raised its price target for DDD to $82 from $69 last March 3.Here's a chart of the company's quarterly revenue trend and forecast for the next quarter. Avi's company enjoys healthy growth in the face of growing competition. Critics badmouthing DDD are best taken as opportunities to swing trade.Finally, DDD has much a lower chance of going bust than SSYS. Defensive, long-term 3-D printing investors should appreciate the huge 1% vs. 75.8% disparity between the two.Disclosure: I am long DDD. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

2066283,30811,2014-03-04T11:53:23-05:00,,"Since reaching its all-time high at $97.28, share price of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has recently experienced a meaningful pullback and now trades at 23% below the high. However, I wouldn't accumulate shares on this weakness as valuation remains lofty even compared to other hot stocks favored by many momentum investors.Despite the price drop, 3D continues to trade at a high 2015 forward EV/Sales multiple of 8.4x, which is at a 16% premium over the average of 7.2x for a high-growth momentum stock group consisting of leading social networks, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Current consensus estimate predicts 3D's top line to rise by 32% through 2015, which is lower than the average of 38% for the peer group. By factoring in the top-line growth potential, 3D trades at a forward EV/Sales to top-line growth ratio of 0.26, which is at a whopping 44% premium over the group's average at 0.18x.Management recently provided a medium term guidance expecting revenue to double and exceeded $1B threshold by 2015. They also forecasted profitability to pick up from the current level (e.g. gross margin to increase from the current 52.1% level to about 55-60%). Current average consensus estimate reflects market's belief that 3D's top line could reach $900M by 2015, which means there would be a positive surprise at the high end of management's revenue guidance (i.e. close to $1B). However, even with the $1B estimated 2015 revenue, 3D's 2015 forward EV/Sales multiple still trades at 7.6x, which remains slightly above the group's average (7.2x). This suggests that the margin of safety on valuation is still thin even if the company is able to achieve a positive surprise.On the earnings front, 3D now trades at 44.5x forward 2016 P/E multiple, which is in line with its high-growth peers' average at 44.9x. However, the company's consensus long-term EPS growth estimate of 20% is less than half of the group average (44%), and the resulted PEG ratio of 2.3x is more than double the benchmark at just 1.0x. It should be noted that average consensus estimate has already predicted a considerable EBITDA margin expansion from 21.4% in 2013 to 35.4% in 2016.I can understand the rationale of many buyers as the company continues to ride on solid fundamentals. Top line growth momentum remained strong in Q4 largely driven by increased demand for Direct Material printers. Management expects Direct Material printer sales to be a major growth driver in 2014 with an estimated growth rate of 160%. Despite the fact that the company has been chasing top-line growth in the expense of margin, it is believed that profitability would eventually pick up owing to 1) management's ongoing effort to shift toward higher-margin business with recurring revenue stream; 2) positive operating leverage as a result of continued investments (i.e. R&D as well as sales and marketing) in the business; and 3) continued integration of acquired businesses and realization of synergies.However, I would want to remind investors that as the stock is now priced for extreme perfection, any negative updates would likely trigger a double-digit sell-off. I would not recommend a short position as fundamentals remain very strong, but I also don't think the stock should deserve a buy or hold rating in light of the sky-high valuation as management's medium-term financial target has been fully factored in.All charts are created by the author and data used in the article and the charts is sourced from S&P Capital IQ, unless otherwise specified.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2061923,25106,2014-03-03T03:03:06-05:00,,"Over the past six months, shares of 3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD) have been on a wild ride. DDD shares surged towards $100 per share towards the end of 2013 before falling sharply to $55 per share in early February after the company lowered its earnings forecast for Q4. Since putting in a temporary bottom at $54.63 on February 5, DDD shares have moved sharply higher. I believe the recent move higher in DDD shares is a selling opportunity.DDD data by YChartsQ4 EarningsAfter massive volatility leading up to DDD earnings results, investors' reaction to Q4 results was quite tepid with shares failing to make a major move up or down following the results. Not surprisingly, given that the stock trades at more than 15 times sales and more than 100 times past earnings, DDD reported a massive increase in both revenue and profits. Revenue rose 52% to $154 million while gross profit rose 53%. I do not believe strong earnings growth is enough to justify DDD's current valuation.ValuationDDD currently trades at 15 times sales, 8.26 times book value, 168 times trailing earnings, and 63 times forward earnings. Clearly, based on any metric DDD is an expensive stock. Of course, given the proper reasons, stocks can trade at excessive valuation for a long time. As an example, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), one of the most exciting growth stories of the past ten years, has traded at more than 100 times earnings for a long time but has only managed to trade at a price/sales multiple in the low single digits, same applies to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), another impressive tech growth story over the past few years. Part of reason why bulls have been able to justify a ridiculous valuation such as 15 times earnings is the high profit margins that have characterized DDD.CompetitionAs has been pointed out in numerous articles, 3D printing is not a new concept. However, there have been some major industry changes in recent years. Technology has both improved and become cheaper which has ignited consumer demand. While 3D printers may well be the way of the future, I believe it is far too early to say what product will eventually dominate the market. Furthermore, larger, well funded competitors such as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), are starting to pay attention to 3D printing and will likely ramp up their game in the coming years. Interestingly, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also applied for 3D printing patents. Just because an industry is about to takeoff does not mean the first companies to the party will dominate. In recent history, one of the biggest industries to takeoff was the smartphone industry. However, some of the initial players such as Palm, BlackBerry (BBRY), Nokia (NYSE:NOK), and Motorola did not fare particularly well once Apple entered the market with the iPhone. Tech giant IBM has also recently made a push into 3D printing. The bottom line here is that while 3D printing may be the way of the future, DDD is not guaranteed to dominate the industry just because it is a current industry leader.Buyout PotentialDDD has been rumored as a potential takeover target for a while now with possible bidders said to be HP or IBM. While this thesis makes some sense, I think the current valuation is much too high for a takeover to occur. In addition to the high valuation based on price to sales or earnings, DDD is a risky takeover because of its large market cap. If 3D printing fails to live up to expectations, having paid $8 billion for DDD would be a major mistake.Insider SellingOver the past few months, insiders have been taking advantage of DDD's high stock price by selling shares. While insiders still own stock in the company, the fact that they are selling and not buying is at the very least a cautionary signal.Acquisition StrategyDDD has made over 40 acquisitions over the past three years. As noted bear Whitney Tilson has discussed, DDD's strategy appears to be to acquire growth as opposed to innovating. The fastest growing companies in recent history have not relied on a acquisition strategy. (think Apple, Amazon, Tesla, and Netflix) DDD's acquisition strategy leads me to believe that the company is trying to be all things to all consumers, a strategy that typically does not work. It should be noted that DDD is not the market leader in any of the market that it serves.Short CoveringOne factor that had been helping DDD shares into the end of 2013 was the large number of shorted shares being covered. As shown by the chart below, short interest fell from close to 30 million shares to 15 million shares in the final months of 2013. Not surprisingly, this also coincided with all-time highs for DDD shares. However, the short covering appears to be over as short interest has started to increase in early 2014. While it is possible that a possible takeover rumor sends short scrambling to cover, I believe it is unlikely that we will see a short covering rally in 2014.DDD Short Interest data by YChartsConclusionI feel strongly that DDD is a sell. The current valuation assumes, in my view, a far too rosy future for DDD. While the 3D printing industry will continue to grow, especially the industrial segment, I do not believe we are close to seeing an explosion of consumer demand for 3D printing. Furthermore, even if consumer demand for 3D printing lives up to the hype, it is not clear that DDD will lead the industry. Competitors such as HPQ, IBM, and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) will be competing even more vigorously in the coming years. The fact that DDD has relied heavily on acquisition leads me to question management's ability to innovate and keep up with competitors. DDD is at best a second rate company and should be avoided at all costs.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in DDD over the next 72 hours.

2061763,22445,2014-03-03T01:54:58-05:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) announced full year 2013 and Q4 results, and once more the numbers were within market expectations. The company reported EPS of $0.19 which was exactly what the market expected. In addition, the company reported that it expects revenue for 2015 to top $1 billion. For FY 2014, the company reiterated its previous revenue guidance of $680M-$720M and its prior FY 2014 EPS view of $0.73 to $0.85 per share.If you ask me, it does not matter if the company misses by a penny here or a penny there, because even with these very good results, this stock is still a very expensive proposition.Many analysts and commentators were upbeat about the company because it forecasted about $1 billion in revenue for the calendar year 2015. While this may be very nice -- with the company continuing to grow and all -- one has to put this into perspective. And the perspective is, that as it stands today, 3D Systems has a market cap about 8 times the revenue the company will generated in 2015 (not today). On a trailing basis the company recorded $513 million in revenue in 2013. And my question is, if the company is worth $8 billion today, with about $500 million revenue, what will it be worth in 2015? Well one could say that if the company is trading at 15 times sales today, it should be worth $15 billion in 2015, right?I can think of several reasons why this is not going to happen.To begin with, even if revenue for the company as a whole has been going up about 50% on a year-over-year basis, on a per share basis, it has not been.DDD Shares Outstanding data by YChartsIn other words, even assuming that 3D Systems will be worth 15 times sales in 2015 (which I doubt), if it has X amount of additional shares, then that 15X sales will be spread out among more shares. So don't think that the stock will simply double from today's levels in 2015, just because it might double in valuation (which I don't think it will anyway).Recently 3D Systems' stock nose-dived from its high of around $97 a share to $55 a share. All this in about a month's time. The market does not react like that unless there is a reason. Yes the stock has gained some ground from the recent $55 mark, but for me this means that we are at some kind of turning point.The turning point might be the first batch of sellers that don't see much upside to the stock anymore, and were aggressively selling based on its valuation.And if you want my opinion, all the stocks in the sector are starting to show early signs of fatigue. And if we take a closer look at the charts, there are signs that a top has been reached and a downtrend channel has formed, and the stocks in the sector might underperform from now on for several years to come.Please note there is no rule that says that 3D Systems' stock will follow this channel, but the recent dive of the stock, is at the very least a warning sign that something has changed from now on (or about to).And if we look at the other stocks in the sector, we will see similar patterns. Please observe the downward channel forming in Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), Exone (NASDAQ:XONE) and Voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET).Bottom lineThere is no doubt that the 3D space is one of the most exciting and fastest growing sectors out there. However, one has to realize that he is not getting this growth for free. Investors are paying through the nose for it, if the form of very high P/E's and Price/Sales ratios.I have said in the past that these stocks have too much expectation built into them, and investors can not expect these stocks to perform as they have the past several years.While I may be wrong and these stocks might continue to perform as in the past, the truth of the matter is that while the companies themselves might continue to grow, the underlying stocks might go nowhere, simply because they have too much backed into the cake already.And while we do not know if this future underperformance has started as of yet, the charts above are giving us a small clue that underperformance in the space might already be here, and investors might have to lower their expectations from now on, irrespective if the companies themselves continue to perform very well for many years to come.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2066553,40031,2014-03-04T13:08:42-05:00,,"Executive summary:_________________________________3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) reported earnings that slightly missed analyst estimates, and the company reaffirmed the prior revenue guidance for 2014. The Q4 earnings report missed estimates and the company's expectations due to a preannouncement of the 2014 product lineup, which delayed customer orders, and resulted in lower than expected demand for consumer products. While I find the earnings report and the reasons for the lower than expected revenue and earnings reasonable, I am worried about the loss of momentum and the current valuation, which is elevated and most importantly, still higher than Stratasys' (NASDAQ:SSYS), which reported higher revenue growth. As I mentioned in my previous article, the long-term outlook for 3D Systems and 3D printing remains quite positive, while there might be a more favorable entry point in the following months.Q4 highlights and 2014 and 2015 outlook3D Systems reported Q4 revenue of $154.8 million, up 52.4% year-over-year, and $0.2 million below analyst estimates. Adjusted EPS was $0.19, missing expectations for $0.20. Management explained that revenue came in below estimates because of lower consumer demand. While the lower than expected consumer demand would be a reason to worry about in normal circumstances, the reason for lower consumer demand was the preannouncement of the 2014 product lineup, which resulted in delayed orders and the doubling of the order backlog in the fourth quarter. Consumer segment's revenue in Q4 was $8.9 million, a 162% increase over Q4 2012. On the other hand, lower than expected profitability was the result of an unfavorable product mix and due to high concentration of new product announcements.Other areas were particularly strong. Materials revenue growth accelerated in Q4 to 39%. Healthcare revenue solutions revenue grew 67% and contributed $21.8 million in revenue. Direct metal demand continues to rise. Direct Metal revenue grew 204% in 2013 to $14.3 million, driven primarily by Phenix printer sales. Management stated on the Q4 conference call that 3D Systems sold out its Direct Metal printers manufacturing capacity and finished the quarter with a strong backlog of metal printers orders.The company reaffirmed the 2014 revenue guidance between $680 million and $720 million. Management expects that the demand for new professional and consumer products are going to accelerate organic growth in the second half of 2014.3D Systems also announced a road map to 2015 revenue, which is expected to reach $1 billion, almost double the 2013 revenue. The increased revenue will be driven by printers, materials and software driven perceptual devices. The company expects gross margin to expand to 55% to 60% as revenue exceeds $750 million. Operating leverage is expected to resume in 2015. This road map is perhaps the most important detail from the Q4 report. This shows that the increased spending is not a degradation of the company's operating model, but rather a consequence of a robust product rollout and the fact that the company is at an inflection point, where it must take advantage of the growing demand for 3D printers and services. 3D Systems' CFO Damon Gregoire indicated on the conference call that they:Source: 3D Systems Q4 presentationSlowing momentum and valuation are two major short-term concerns3D Systems' share price experienced elevated volatility in 2014. The company's share price was almost cut in half, as it went from $95 to $55 in less than two months. The stock was supported at its 200 day moving average line, and now faces resistance, as it trades below its 50 day moving average line, which started to roll over in February. The loss of momentum is evident, and the lack of demand can be observed by mostly lower volume on up days and higher volume on down days.Source: Stockcharts.comThe other cause for concern is 3D Systems' premium valuation over its main competitor Stratasys. 3D Systems price to sales ratio is 15, while Stratasys' P/S ratio is 12.8. This is still a substantial premium, and either Stratasys needs to rally 15% to catch up, or 3D Systems needs to fall 15%. Stratasys' revenue growth in Q4 was 61.6%, compared to 3D Systems' growth rate of 52.4%. 3D Systems would need to have higher growth rates to command a premium valuation over Stratasys, not the other way around, which is currently the case. I expect Stratasys to outperform until their respective valuations are at the same level.ConclusionAlthough 3D Systems' Q4 report came in below estimates, it seems to be justified by the lack of demand for consumer products, since the company preannounced the 2014 product lineup, which delayed customer orders. The 2015 revenue and margin road map seems quite encouraging, and the company expects greater operating leverage in 2015 and beyond. The loss of momentum and premium valuation over Stratasys are two major short-term concerns, and investors may get a more favorable entry point in the next couple of months. However, the long-term perspective for 3D printing and 3D Systems remains positive, and I would not be surprised if the stock keeps rising. The 50 day moving average line remains the point of resistance for the stock, and if it moves above the line, chances are that 3D Systems will continue to rise.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

In fact it’s been around since Chuck Hull of 3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD) built the first 3-D printer back in 1984. Since then the industry has come a long way and innovator’s are dreaming up new ways to use the process of additive manufacturing to transform the world. Organovo (ONVO) is attempting to 3-D print human liver replacements and 3D Systems just launched ChefJet and ChefJet Pro for, you guessed it, 3-D printing delicious treats. Cupcakes and biosynthesizing organ replacements are just the tip of the iceberg, other potential applications of 3-D printing technology include cheap prosthetic limbs and 3-D printing replacement parts on board space stations using a limited supply of stock material. The sales expectations for 3D Systems are high this quarter as Wall Street is expecting 53% revenue growth compared to the same period last year. DDD is set to report FQ4 2013 earnings before the market opens on Friday, February 28th, here’s what investors are expecting.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click Here to see All Estimates for 3D Systems)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for DDD to report 22c EPS and $155.09M revenue, while the current Estimize.com consensus from 32 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 29c EPS and $155.17M in revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting 3D Systems to beat the Wall Street consensus by 7c EPS and a tiny margin on revenue.By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69.5% more accurate than Wall Street, but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market’s actual expectations. It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case, we are seeing a wide differential on EPS.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from 19c to 36c EPS and $149.00M to $159.58M in revenues. This quarter we’re seeing a wide distribution of estimates for 3D Systems.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A wider distribution of estimates, signaling less agreement in the market, could mean greater volatility post earnings.Over the past 4 months, the Wall Street EPS consensus decreased from 33c to 22c while the Estimize consensus dropped from 33c to 29c at the end of the period. Over the same period of time, the Wall Street revenue consensus rose from $146.83M to $155.09M while the Estimize consensus increased from $143.75M to $155.17M. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and at the end of the period we saw rising revenue expectations but falling EPS consensuses from both groups.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is anmikyoso who projects 33c EPS and $154.84M in revenue. In the Winter 2014 season, anmikyoso is rated as the 35th best analyst and is ranked 31st overall among over 3,950 contributing analysts. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case, anmikyoso is expecting 3D Systems to beat the Estimize consensus on EPS but come up less than $1 million shy on revenue. 3-D printing was a huge sector of growth in 2013. The technology has been around for a long time but 3D Systems will have to get in gear and meet the high expectations from contributing analysts on the Estimize.com platform to maintain current levels of valuation. This quarter, the Estimize community is expecting DDD to edge past Wall Street expectations in revenue and beat EPS expectations by 7c per share.Disclosure: None."
2061023,39301,2014-03-02T04:48:58-05:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) reported a solid quarter, as it provided a guidance that exceeded expectations. Net income growth is likely to stall as 3D Systems is expected to aggressively invest into its business in order to drive organic sales growth. Acquisitions and high operating expenses seem to go hand-in-hand with high momentum names.Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call, much of the negativity surrounding the stock isn't justified at the present moment. Besides the concerns surrounding the high earnings multiples, and the euphoric rise of the stock price, there's not a whole lot here to short.Summarizing financial performance on a year-over-year basisSales grew 52.4% year-over-year, while gross profit improved by 52.6% year-over-year. The gross profit margin has remained the same at 51.7%. However, operating expenditure increased by an astounding 81% year-over-year. As a result the net income improved by 2.9% year-over-year. The low earnings growth comes as a result of aggressive spending on the part of management.Source: 3D SystemsDamon Gregoire, CFO and SVP of 3D Systems states:In other words, 3D Systems spent more money, which will improve its positioning and generate more sales as a result. I applaud the management for taking on a more aggressive stance when it comes to sales growth. Historically, the market rewards high sales growth more than high earnings growth, because earnings can increase as a result of better cost management, whereas sales growth comes as a result of intelligent investment on the part of management.Source: 3D Systems3D Systems has increased the amount spent on SG&A by 47% year-over-year and R&D by 87.4% year-over-year for the full year. The fastest-rising spending category has been R&D, as it's blatantly obvious that 3D Systems needs to aggressively invest in the development of future products in order to sustain sales growth. The CFO also mentions that SG&A was up slightly more than expected:This isn't bad, as marketing spend should increase as a result of a higher number of product launches. It wouldn't be very intelligent to increase product offerings without increasing product awareness.Guidance and earnings for the quarter was solidAnalysts were expecting EPS of around $0.19 per share for the quarter. DDD reported earnings of $0.19 per share. The expectations were based on Non-GAAP figures that 3D Systems reports to shareholders.Source: 3D Systems3D Systems expects sales to grow to a billion by 2015. This indicates that the stock is slightly undervalued as it can potentially grow into its 164 P/E multiple in a reasonable enough timeframe. While, I don't advocate the company to increase net income through cost cutting, the 51.7% gross margin indicates that the cost of revenue is low enough, so that if the business were to further scale, operating costs can be capped, thus allowing massive net income growth in future years.The company currently trades at a 17 P/S, and assuming the company can provide guidance in 2015 that's near its historical growth rate, the stock can easily trade at a $17 billion to $30 billion valuation in the two-year time frame we're working with. Since market maturation won't happen for quite a while, the revenue growth can be sustained for quite a while longer. Therefore, 3D Systems is likely to price future growth in the future, making it a bargain in the present.Source: Yahoo! FinanceAnalysts expect sales growth of around 36% for fiscal year 2014. However, the guidance indicates that the CAGR between 2014 and 2015 is 39.62%. This is 3.5% above consensus estimates for next year sales growth. In other words, forward guidance beat analysts' estimates; therefore, the stock is due for a massive move to the upside.Source: FreeStockChartsAs you can tell, DDD has declined from its all-time-high at around $100 per share. I think the recent earnings results make for an excellent opportunity for investors to buy on the dip. Resistance at the 20-day and 50-day moving average are likely to be temporary, and I expect a continuation of 3D Systems' long-term up-trend.ConclusionAs you can tell, I remain optimistic on 3D Systems and expect further stock price appreciation following the earnings announcement. The company's aggressive approach to investment and acquisitions confirms my suspicion that 3D Systems is better positioned than many of its competitors. I don't think there's a valid short thesis on the stock, and if such a thesis were to exist, it won't materialize for quite a while.I would remain long due to sector growth, aggressive investment, and favorable guidance. I expect 3D printing technologies to continue to unlock more and more industrial applications as the technology advances. As more and more unique-use-cases emerge, demand for 3D printing services and devices will continue to trend higher. Therefore, accumulating a position over the next five years would take advantage of the upside while alleviating volatility.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2053483,22775,2014-02-27T08:32:23-05:00,,"The 3-D printing technology is evolving so fast that 4-D printing, i.e. the combination of high resolution 3D printers with smart materials that change their shape in response to outside stimuli, is already there. The rising importance and complexity of materials suggests in our view that 3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) input costs will rise in the future, putting some pressure on the margins of its key consumables business.We reiterate our view that consensus margin expectations are way too high on 3D Systems and that the stock is a Sell. For those willing to invest in the 3-D printing sector in these uncertain times, an interesting and lower risk strategy would be to go Long Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and Short 3D Systems.What is 4-D printing?While 3-D printing is still in its infancy, a new technology is already making the buzz: 4-D printing. Actually, 4-D printing is an evolution of 3-D printing: instead of building static 3D items, the technology allows dynamic materials to self-assemble into different shapes after they have been printed or to evolve over time in response to their environment. The ""fourth dimension"" represents change and time.Source: MIT's Self-Assembly Lab4-D printing is likely to have a major impact on construction and manufacturing industries as it will make it easier to build in extreme environments thanks to dynamic and tunable structures. But 4-D printing is also likely to have an impact on everyday life: just think of self-assembling furniture, clothing changing in response to your body temperature, better tire grip as you go through turns …Smart materials to play a key role in the printing industryAs 4-D printing is the combination of high resolution 3-D printers with smart materials, that change their shape in response to outside stimuli (water, air, heat or light), it is quite obvious that materials will play a growing role in this business in coming years.Smart materials already exist, as explained by Skylar Tibbits, head of the MIT's Self-Assembly Lab which, in collaboration with Stratasys' Education and R&D departments, is at the forefront of 4-D printing. Notably shape-memory alloys (such as nickel titanium), used in stents and other biomedical technologies, and shape-memory polymers or smart plastics.But for cost reasons, Skylar Tibbits has for the moment a preference for everyday materials like plastics, metals and woods. He then combines and prints these materials in different thicknesses and orientations. The MIT's Self-Assembly Lab notably developed a printing material that expands 150% when it meets water and a few prototypes, among which a tube that folds itself into a cube when submerged in water.We believe that the MIT's Self-Assembly Lab approach is a just a first step and that smart plastics and alloys will be part of the game in a few years as their cost declines. Later, materials might change in a way most of us are unable to imagine today. Just think of an object that is composed of atoms (an atom is the smallest particle of an element that remains identical to all other particles) and compounds (atoms of different particles combined) which are ""intelligent"" and can take the desired shape ... You think this is science fiction? Have a look at this article … Actually, we just need more computing power.Due to their rising importance and complexity, materials are likely to climb the value chain of the industry over the years (4-D printing commercial use is not expected before three to five years). This suggests in our view that the 4-D technology could change the economics of the 3-D printing industry, with rising input costs and hence lower margins for 3D Systems and peers.Potential margin pressure ahead for 3D Systems?In our view, odds are good that material providers such as Victrex (OTC:VTXPY) will ask for a higher share of the profits on consumables through higher prices in the future. This could put some pressure on the profitability of the consumables business at 3D Systems (and peers), suggesting that the long-term earnings growth driver of the company is at risk. Indeed, consumables are expected to generate most of the industry profits in the long-term.In all, the advent of 4-D printing and smart materials strengthens our view (see our previous articles) that consensus margin expectations are way too high on 3D Systems and peers.ConclusionWe reiterate our negative stance on the 3-D printing sector and specifically our Sell recommendation on 3D Systems. The stock is currently trading at 96x 2014 EPS, a level which is not justified in our view by the company's earnings power (+20-30% a year in a best-case scenario). It's also worth noting that 3D Systems does not seem to be at the forefront of 4-D printing as this is Stratasys which works with the MIT on the technology.For those willing to invest in the 3-D printing sector in these uncertain times, an interesting and lower risk strategy would be to go Long Stratasys and Short 3D Systems. At 58x 2014 EPS, Stratasys' valuation appears much more decent. And importantly, the company is highly innovative (Stratasys is likely to be seen as a pioneer of 4-D printing) and is set to become a dominant force in the consumer business, that will drive the 3-D printing industry in coming years. As you all know, the reviews for its MakerBot product on Amazon have been much better than those for 3D Systems' Cubify.Disclosure: I am short DDD.

2058473,44981,2014-02-28T10:39:29-05:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is one of the most exciting stocks in the market. The company has reported double-digit revenue growth in each of the last four quarters, which is extremely impressive taking into account the overall conditions of the global economy. Today the company reported its fourth quarter and full year results, and the growth in the main areas for the company has been solid. However, despite impressive growth in all the areas, the company missed the estimates for the top-line as well as the bottom-line by small margins. Let's take a look at the earnings and the future outlook of the company.Impressive Growth in EarningsRevenue for the company grew by 52% year-over-year and went up to $154.8 million. Printer and other products sales were at the forefronts of the increase in revenue, and recorded an increase of 76% year-over-year - total unit sales more than tripled. The growth in revenues was lower than the company expected. Also, the company missed revenue estimates by $0.18 million for the quarter. The reason for the revenue miss seems the company's inability to convert its order backlog into revenues - according to the management, the order backlog has nearly doubled from the previous quarter. Whenever the revenue growth of 3D systems has been discussed, organic growth has been an important element. Organic growth for the quarter stood at 34% while for the year organic growth figures came at 29%. In my opinion, organic growth of around 30% is extremely impressive, and increased sales of printers and materials indicate that the growth in the core segments remains strong.3D Systems also recorded 53% increase in gross profit; however, the gross profit margin remained flat at around 52%. Higher volume sales were the main reason for gross profit expansion, and it also indicates the company is able to manage production costs. Segment wise break-up shows that the consumer solution segment was the winner with 162% growth in revenues; however, despite these growth figures, the total revenues for the segment fell below company's expectations - health care and services revenue grew by 67% and 33%, respectively. For the full year, printers and products revenue went up by 80% to $227.6 million - the highest growth was witnessed in the customer solutions segment which grew by 206% during the last year - Healthcare, services and print materials revenue went up by 45%, 27% and 24%, respectively.Non-GAAP net income for the quarter stood at $19.7 million while the GAAP net income was $11.2 million. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter stood at $0.11 and non-GAAP earnings per share at $0.19, missing the estimates by $0.01 per share. For the full year, GAAP earnings stood at $0.45 per share while non-GAAP earnings were $0.85 per share.Printers and other products are the biggest component of the total revenues at 44% while the materials segment stood at 25%, and services segment at 31%. Geographically, North America is still the biggest region for 3D systems and contributed 55% towards the total revenues. Europe is the second largest region with 26% share in revenue followed by Asia-Pacific with 19%. There was also an increase of more than 50% year-over-year in R&D expenses from $7.8 million to $16.6 million. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses have gone up by about 34% for the company, mainly due to the increase in the marketing expenses - the company has invested heavily in developing channels and new product launches. The biggest increase in the expense came from the sales and marketing section, which grew by 65%, followed by R&D and G&A at 53% and 23%, respectively. The sales and marketing expenses were $5.1 million more than the company expected due to the product launches, channel expansion and acquisitions. G&A expenses mainly went up due to an increase in legal costs, bad debts and increased costs from recently acquired companies.Finally, let's take a look at the cash and inventory levels-the cash balances for the company increased by 96.5%, mainly due to the stock offering of $272 million - cash from operations was $25 million. An increase of about 80% in inventories clearly shows that the company is building up inventory for expected increase in demand.Key Points to ConsiderConclusionThe growth in some of the segments was not in line with the expectations of the company; however, the market seems to be happy with the results. The stock is trading up after the earnings announcement. I believe the growth will remain strong for the company and the prospects are good. As I have said in my previous articles, management's decision to sacrifice short-term profitability in favor of long-term growth is admirable and the shareholders should be happy with the management. In my opinion, 3D Systems remains a strong buy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2046623,24513,2014-02-25T13:15:25-05:00,,"3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) has been around the market for over a decade and has since then managed to establish itself as one of the largest 3-D printers and related equipment manufacturers in the industry. Benefited through high switching costs amongst customers and high barriers to entry, the company has gained a narrow economic moat, which is bound to persist in the medium-term future, at the very least.Its vast product portfolio of high-end printers, as well as low-priced offers, the company is set to adapt to shifting consumer preferences, as technological advancements continue. This is especially the case in the rapidly growing prototype product segment, where the firm recently introduced its ProJet 3D and ZPrinter series. In addition to this, the company's acquisition of all consumables necessary for product manufacturing, which attract high gross margin results, helped eliminate third part material sellers, thereby boosting overall results.So, in the article below, I will analyze 3D Systems Corporation's past profitability, capital, and operating efficiency, in addition to looking at which institutional investors have recently bought the company's stock in the last quarter. Based on this information, we will get an understanding of the company´s revenues, operating metrics and quality of earnings.Profitability AnalysisProfitability is used to analyze a business' ability to generate earnings compared with expenses and other relevant costs incurred during a specific period of time. In this section I will study 3D Systems' return on assets, quality of earnings, cash flows and revenue, so as to elucidate if the company is really making money.In addition, I always compare a company's revenue growth and operating cash flow growth. Over the past three years, the company's operating cash flow has increased by 65%, augmenting from $32 to $53. I advise to look for companies with strong cash generation profiles as these will have less trouble paying off present or future debts.ROA - Return On Assets = Net Income/Total AssetsROA is an indicator of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. Calculated by dividing a company's net income by its total assets, ROA is displayed as a percentage and in simple terms, tells you what earnings were generated from invested capital (assets).I do not like the fact that 3D Systems' ROA decreased from 10.89% in 2010 to a current 6.83%. As I am always looking to invest in companies that generate increasing ROAs, this firm's ratio is discouraging, as it is evidence of the company generating less from its assets than it did in 2010.Quality of EarningsQuality of earnings is the amount of earnings attributable to higher sales or lower costs, rather than artificial profits created by accounting anomalies. In order to assess 3D Systems' quality of earnings we will compare the level of income with operating cash flows. The company augmented its profits at a rate of 26%, but the growth of cash flows was higher, which is strong evidence of profits being created through a boost in sales or cost reductions.Working CapitalThis ratio indicates whether a company has enough short term assets to cover its short term debt. Anything below 1 indicates negative W/C (working capital), while anything over 2 means that the company is not investing excess assets. Following this measurement, most believe that a ratio between 1.2 and 2.0 is sufficient.3D Systems' current ratio (working capital measurement) increased from 1.74 in 2010 to 3.82 in 2012, meaning that the company has a strong balance sheet and can pay off its obligations.Gross Margin: Gross Income/SalesThe gross profit margin tells an investor what percentage of revenue/sales is left after subtracting the cost of goods sold. A company that boasts a higher gross profit margin than its competitors -and overall industry- is more efficient and should be able to make a decent profit as long as overhead costs are controlled (overhead refers to rent, utilities, etc.). This is a quality that tends to attract investors.Over the past three years, 3D Systems' gross margin has increased from 46.3% in 2010 to 51.2% in 2012, indicating an efficiency boost on behalf of the company.Asset TurnoverAsset turnover measures a firm's efficiency in using its assets to generate sales or revenue, in addition to indicating pricing strategy: companies with low profit margins tend to have high asset turnover, while those with high profit margins have low asset turnover.The fact that the company's revenue growth has outpaced the assets growth (-30% growth) on a percentage basis, indicates that the company is making money on its assets.Institutional SponsorshipI also evaluate recent institutional activity in the stock. In other words, which hedge funds recently bought the stock. In 3D Systems' case, I feel encouraged by the fact that Paul Tudor Jones and Ken Fisher bought the stock in the past months at an average price of $70.76, depositing their vote of confidence in the company's future profitability.Analyst OutlookCurrently, analysts have a mixed outlook for 3D Systems. While MSN money is predicting that the company's EPS will show stagnant growth rates, remaining at the current EPS of $0.86 for the rest of FY 2014, analysts at Bloomberg are estimating revenue to jump from fiscal 2013's $513.66M to $696.70M for FY 2014.ConclusionDespite some risks regarding rapidly changing product cycles and dependency on customer spending, I still feel very bullish about 3D System' long term profitability. This is due mainly to the fact that 3D printers are very hard to replicate, making barriers to entry extremely high.Furthermore, the individually patented technologies prevent ""copycats"" from reproducing any product developments until years after it has become outdated. However, I would recommend investors to await a more profitable time to buy this company's shares, as the current value of 112.30x trailing earnings is spiking at an outrageous price premium relative to the industry average of 24.00x.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2053723,56202,2014-02-27T09:25:35-05:00,,"3D printing stalwart 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is set to report its next quarterly report on Feb. 27. Let's take a look at what is expected of the company and whether it is a buy going into earnings, or even after that.Earnings expectationsAnalysts expect 3D Systems to bring in revenue of $155 million for the quarter ending December. This would be an impressive jump of 52.60% over last year's quarter, establishing the fact that the company plies its trade in a rapidly growing industry. However, not everything is hunky dory for 3D Systems. The company's earnings are expected to decline to $0.20 per share from $0.26 in the year-ago period. This is in contrast to additive manufacturing rival Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), whose earnings are expected to increase to $0.49 a share from $0.40 in the prior-year period.3D Systems should be able to meet its forecast, as the company had recently readjusted its expectations for fiscal 2013, and the current outlook is at the low end of its guidance. Moreover, as far as the outlook going forward is concerned, investors shouldn't expect fireworks from the company since it had reduced its forecast for fiscal 2014 below expectations. 3D Systems' 2014 forecast missed analysts estimates by a mile, with the company expecting earnings of $0.73 to $0.85 a share, while analysts were looking for $1.27 per share.Comparatively, 3D Systems' revenue forecast was quite strong. The company forecasts revenue in the range of $680 million-$720 million, ahead of the analyst forecast of $671.3 million. This essentially means that 3D Systems is expecting weak earnings growth this year, which is what investors would have ideally wanted to see from a high growth company such as 3D Systems, especially after it acquired a staggering number of companies.Looking beyond earnings3D Systems has acquired more than 40 companies in the past three years, but now its earnings are expected to take a hit as it invests in research, manufacturing and marketing. Thus, essentially, 3D Systems' acquisitions haven't proven accretive to earnings, and since earnings are expected to decline on a year over year basis in 2014, it doesn't look like an enticing investment.If you compared it to a peer such as Stratasys, 3D Systems looks like a weak investment. Stratasys' earnings are expected to increase to $2.24 per share this fiscal year from $1.83 a share in 2013. Hence, Stratasys is following the right path to growth while 3D Systems seems to have shot itself in the foot by acquiring a horde of companies and now spending on research and development.Moreover, 3D Systems is highly overvalued, especially considering the industry's prospects. The stock trades at a trailing P/E of 165, and even on a forward P/E basis, it is expensive at 96 times earnings. Comparatively, Stratasys is cheaper at 57 times forward earnings, and its PEG ratio of 3.23 is lower than 3D Systems' 4.61.These valuation levels of 3D Systems are very, very high since the industry itself is expected to grow to $6 billion by 2017, and $10.8 billion by 2021, according to Terry Wohlers, president of Wohlers Associates. According to Forbes, Wohlers Associates is a research firm that exclusively focuses on 3D printing, so the report can be counted upon for its data.Great, but highly-optimistic expectationsWhat's most fascinating is the fact that 3D Systems is bigger than the industry itself. The company's market capitalization of almost $8 billion eclipses the expected size of the market going forward. This seems absurd as 3D Systems is not a monopoly player in the 3-D printing industry. The company has a number of rivals popping up, with the likes of Stratasys, Voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET), ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), and other prospective players such as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) entering the market.The 3-D printing market is not a winner-take-all industry and it's safe to assume that each 3-D printing company will command at least some portion of the market. Thus, assuming that 3D Systems commands a market share of 25% (which is very optimistic given the amount of competition) by 2021, it will still have a P/S ratio of over 2 in 2021. Therefore, it's evident that 3D Systems is absurdly overvalued.The earnings report should not bring in any new surprises as the company had recently updated its forecast. 3D Systems' earnings and revenue should fall in the company's guidance range, but that doesn't mean it is a good investment.Spending lavishly on M&A instead of R&D might backfire. Most researches show that M&A have a success rate of about 50%. Statistically, this means that half of 3D Systems' acquisitions have a chance of failing, which obviously will have a severe negative impact of 3D Systems' earnings going forward.Bottom lineCurrently, 3D Systems is being driven by momentum, and the smallest bit of negative news can send the stock tumbling. In addition, 11 main industry patents are set to expire in 2014. This will not only open the gates for entry of new rivals, but will also pave the way for a price war. So, investors should ignore the hype and stay away from 3D Systems.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2034363,44981,2014-02-20T10:09:43-05:00,,"3D systems (NYSE:DDD) experienced a decline of over 15% as the company came out with future outlook. I argued in my previous article that the market had overreacted and the fall in stock price in fact gives its long-term investors an opportunity to add to their positions. A week has gone by and the stock has gained more than it lost. However, these swings in stock price are certainly making a lot of short-term traders rich. The good thing about the 3D printing industry is that there is always some news, which causes the stock prices to record rapid changes.As a result, the traders betting on volatility make handsome profits. As we all know, 3D Systems have been extremely aggressive when it comes to growth, both through acquisitions and new partnerships. These partnerships will go a long way in helping the company achieve a larger market share. Some of these partnerships are opening new markets for the company, which will not just result in short-term growth in revenues, but also provide an opportunity to further enhance the revenues.Two New potential Markets3D systems have recently announced partnership with Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS), the manufacturer of some of the largest toy brands of the world. Hasbro is a huge player in the toy market with a strong retail market. The details of the partnership have not been revealed by the companies yet, but this opens another door for 3D Systems in a completely different market. This is the second major partnership for the company after it recently announced its partnership with Hershey's.These two partnerships have opened two new markets for 3D Systems, which should support its future revenue growth. Hasbro has some of the biggest brands in the toys market such as the transformers, Star wars, Monopoly and Scrabble. Both of these companies are looking to launch play printers and platforms by the end of the year. I believe the importance of this partnership should be seen in the context of the acceptability of the 3D printing technology. As I have mentioned in my previous articles, the manufacturing companies are now increasingly trying 3D printing and Hasbro coming out with this partnership is another proof of that.The reason I see so much potential in 3-D printing industry is that the possibilities are endless. On the one side, the company is printing chocolate with Hershey's while on the other hand, it is selling industrial printers to some of the biggest manufacturers. It is not just the growth these segments present, but also the diversity they offer.Another act which may turn into a whole other industry is robotic suits for the disabled people. 3D Systems recently announced the printing of first ever hybrid robotic suit joining hands with EksoBionics. The suit would allow the disabled people to walk easily. This is a major step for the company as it strengthens its medical devices segment and it shows that 3D printing can move from just dental products to larger and bigger structures. Although this is just a prototype, the results are extremely encouraging and the companies can benefit substantially from this partnership in the future.Growth prospectsWe all know that the growth prospects of the 3D printing industry are bright and it is growing at an exceptional rate. I have shared industry researches in the past with my readers - recently, a new research report came out which also highlighted some growth areas. Let's look at some of the areas. According to the report, the industry is expected to grow at an annual rate of 20% over the next five years. The major opportunities will be in the industrial segment, where the demand for 3-D printers for manufacturing molds and prototyping purposes will remain high. Furthermore, the demand in the medical devices and dental segment will also remain high. As I mentioned above, the production of robotic suits will be a major step in the medical science and it will open a new opportunity for 3D Systems. At the moment, United States is the largest market for 3-D printing and it will remain the largest market for 3-D printing by 2017, with a total market share of 42%. The summary of the full research report can be read here.ConclusionI have maintained that 3-D printing will become a major player in the manufacturing and companies like 3D Systems and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) will continue to benefit. I will reiterate that the short-term swings in the stock price for 3D Systems should not spook investors as I believe the long-term prospects of the company are real, and it will be a good long-term investment. The company is growing its portfolio impressively with partnerships, which should enhance its future revenue growth.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2043793,40031,2014-02-24T13:59:49-05:00,,"Executive summary:_________________________________In my last article about 3D Systems, I outlined the two key risks for the company in 2014, and explain why I believe that the future for the company is still very bright. Those two risks were the expected revenue growth slowdown, and the fact that 3D Systems was trading at a premium over its main competitor Stratasys. In early February, 3D Systems provided 2014 guidance, which disappointed investors, sending shares down from $75 to a low of $55. I am a bit disappointed with the Q4 results, as I expected revenue to be closer to the upper range of management guidance. EPS guidance was especially weak, but I believe this is of less importance right now because of the emphasis on increased investments. I also believe that the company's long-term operating model is still intact. The two risks I mentioned are still present today, and the pressure will be on the company to ease the concerns of investors when the company announces Q4 earnings this week.Recent developments3D Systems continued its acquisition spree, with the acquisition of Digital PlaySpace, ""the creator of a ""digital play platform"" that combines 3D-printed toys and dollhouse items with design tools and social sharing features for kids."" This presents another push into the consumer market, which was previously strengthened with a deal with Hasbro and the purchase of the 3D toy modeling firm Gentle Giant Studios, as well as the December acquisitions of Figulo Corporation and Village Plastics. This shows that the company is quite serious about the opportunity in the consumer market, and is looking to ""buy its way"" into the market. Acquisitions continue to be an important part of the company's growth plans.On February 18, 3D Systems announced the first ever 3D printed hybrid Exoskeleton suit in collaboration with EksoBionics at an event in Budapest. 3D Systems' President and CEO Avi Reichental stated that ""3DS has long been a pioneer in patient-specific devices, integrating our cutting-edge 3D capabilities with robotics to better serve humanity opens new and unimaginable frontiers."" The company is making headway in healthcare applications, and the healthcare solutions revenue made up 12.4%, or $16.9 million of total revenue in Q3, which was a 40% increase over Q3 2012.What to expect from Q4 earnings report?I think there will be no major surprises in the Q4 report, since the company already preannounced the results in early February. What will be interesting though is the conference call, where we will find out more about management expectations for 2014. Although some investors are concerned with lower margin and profitability expectations, I believe that the long-term operating model of the company is still intact, and that the major investments are necessary in order to capitalize on the growing opportunity in the 3D printing market. 3D Systems' CEO Avi Reichental said in the preliminary FY2013 results statement that: ""As we previously stated, we are willing to tolerate earnings reduction and even slight gross profit margin compression during this period to substantially accelerate our growth rate and market share. We firmly believe that these accelerated investments that already resulted in the announcement of 24 new products over the past nine weeks position the company to double its revenue over the next couple of years on organic growth of at least 30% going forward and to achieve greater earnings power and profitability over the long term.""The Q4 report will likely determine the short-term share price direction, and more volatility is to be expected this week.Valuation concerns and future expectationsI have been talking about the 3D Systems' P/S premium over Stratasys in previous articles, and it proved that Stratasys was more resilient than 3D Systems, and saw a more modest price decline than 3D Systems. As of this writing, Stratasys is 8% off its early-January all-time highs and had a maximum drawdown of 18% this year, while 3D Systems is down 17% from its all-time high price, and had a maximum drawdown of 44%. I stated in my previous article on Stratasys that 3D Systems is more vulnerable if a correction occurs, and it proved to be the case given the more severe drawdown that 3D Systems experienced. As it stands right now, 3D Systems is trading at a 16% TTM P/S ratio premium over Stratasys (18x TTM P/S versus 15.5x TTM P/S), and a 28% premium on a forward 2014 P/S ratio (12.6x 2014 P/S versus 9.9x 2014 P/S). So, the reward-risk ratio is still in Stratasys' favor, and I believe that Stratasys will have better short-term stock performance than 3D Systems.Source: Stockcharts.comConclusion3D Systems is at a short-term crossroad. The company will report earnings this week, which will likely determine the short-term share price direction. The results were preannounced earlier this month, so there is less uncertainty, but it will be interesting to listen to the conference call, and to get more information about the company's plans for 2014. Both 3D Systems and Stratasys are investing heavily to capitalize on the growing opportunity in the 3D printing market, and it is taking a toll on their bottom lines, but I believe that this does not affect the long-term profitability prospects. Although I believe that both companies have compelling long-term growth prospects, the current valuation is in Stratasys' favor, and I expect Stratasys to outperform.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2050213,28121,2014-02-26T11:11:26-05:00,,"Not wanting to be trite; we'll focus on sales, accounting quality, and what we feel are relevant metrics for this industry.Company ComparisonStock PricesMoving AverageOn Balance VolumeThe graphs above reveal strong appreciation for both 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) stock. Moreover, revenue and cash flows appear healthy, positioning the companies well to invest in future R&D and capital for growth. In 2013, the industry boomed as their stock prices exploded to new highs with the 50-day moving average continuing to exceed the 200-day moving average and On Balance Volume climbing on the momentum train.However, after closer examination of these two companies, there are a few inconsistencies with the positive picture painted above.StratasysLooking beyond December 2012 year end financials, sales growth explodes to 113% from Sep 2012-2013, yet net income declines -257%. This is in-line with the general industry and what we've seen from DDD.A look into the income statement revealed SG&A rising at surprising rates. SG&A expenses from Sept. 2012-2013 was 160M.Stratasys tried to blame this increase on recent merger and stock compensation expenses when the true increases were due to rapidly rising amortization of intangibles from 2%-16% of sales from 12 month periods ending Sept. 2012 and 2013, respectively. (Per our warning about technology write-offs...)It may also seem like the company is gearing up for another acquisition. Issuing shares to increase its cash balance to nearly $415M and paying off its customers early to improve key ratios. (Inorganic growth driven by M&A activity).With increased acquisitions, Stratasys' asset base is growing through intangibles. However, what investors must keep in mind is the associated amortization expense that comes with it. At the rate the company is going, this expense is expected to have a great impact on Stratasys' bottom line in the future. The question then becomes whether revenue will be able to outpace these expenses.A stunning change we found was earnings quality. Although earnings growth for Stratasys may be projected, the sustainability is questionable as the accrual ratio explodes to a stunning 169% from Sept. 2012-2013. This is in strong contrast to 3D system's decline in the accrual ratio.Various accounts rely on estimates based on management discretion. One area of concern may lie in accounts receivable as management continues to decrease its reserves as this account grows.Although it could be possible that management has invoked more stringent credit policies, no such policy has been disclosed to date. Moreover, 2013 reserve information is not available at this time, which may indicate that this number was possibly too low to mention. (The fact that management expects all accounts to be paid in full seems quite odd).3D SystemsOn the other side of the story, earning quality has improved for 3D systems as their accrual ratio declines to 46%. In contrast to Stratasys, their healthy accrual ratio is further exemplified by an increasing reserves set up as accounts receivable increase.In FY2012, although favourable growth can be seen in terms of volume for the Printer & Other Products Segment, the negative change in the price/mix for this segment is alarming. Where revenue was offset by as much as 163.7% (~64% of volume revenue). Moreover, the reduction of revenue from price/mix as a % of revenue generated from volume has ballooned from levels of 3% in 2010 and 24% in 2011. This suggests that:Final ValuationUsing Bloomberg consensus estimates, the following peer valuation was conducted with peers weighted by two segments: Printers & Materials and Services. Many of the companies in the service segment offer substitute to services using 3D printers. Stratasys appears to be undervalued at $192.97 (compared to its current price of $125.31) while 3D Systems appears overvalued at a price of $68.48 (compared to its current price of $76.39).60%/40%:We believe that printers and materials bring in a sizeable part of overall revenue and will continue to do so as the margins are very inflated. Services will represent a larger portion of revenues in the future as the profits will be made on providing services with the printers.Valuation of DDDValuation of SSYSThe debate about 3D printing has never been about whether the technology will succeed. It irrefutably will. The question has been always been about the size of the market.Final Investment ThesisShort term bullish on DDD and SSYS (riding positive market news and earnings)Medium to long term bearish on DDD and SSYSDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2028981,54502,2014-02-18T15:57:29-05:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) seems to be gradually losing its superiority in the additive manufacturing industry to peers such as Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and potentially Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ). As the 3D printing market matures, the going might become even tougher for 3D Systems. According to Credit Suisse, the size of the 3D printing industry was expected to be $625 million in 2016, but it was revised it to $800 million, showing the prospects of the industry. With such bright prospects, competition is no doubt expected to increase in the industry.As we see, 3D Systems and Stratasys are striving to be the leaders in the 3D printing arena, while HP is looking to establish its base. However, Stratasys might be gaining some ground over 3D Systems. Let's see how.Strategic movesThe acquisition policy of both the companies is quite competitive. However, the major risk with 3D Systems is its acquisition policy that can burn investors. 3D Systems has also been spending lavishly to promote its sales at the cost of higher marketing expenditure, affecting the margins.As we see more and more competition in the 3D printing space, along with technology enhancements, one can expect the market share of 3D Systems to be eroded by newcomers such as HP in the future.Factors in playPrinting speed, price, technology upgrades, printing materials can be the main factors that might decide the leader in 3D printers in the future.Speed: Speed is an important factor that can affect the 3D printing market in the future. This is a significant constraint right now, so it remains to be seen how and when industries unanimously embrace 3D printers. When this happens, 3D Systems might incur lower marketing costs. However, HP can steal its advantage since the company already has strong relationships with various companies worldwide due to its traditional printer business.Also, objects generated by 3D printers can always be painted as a part of the prototyping of the design, but if color is a part of the design, it can save lot of time in object prototyping. Since 3D printing is all about prototyping, this saves time during the process, which is a major advantage for industrial 3D printers.To capitalize on this advantage, Stratasys is the first to release a multi-color 3D printer with multi materials, known as Objet500. This should certainly be more widely accepted in industrial applications as it saves time, adding to Stratasys' advantage.Domestic use: Home and education is one segment of 3D printing, which has enormous prospect in the future. To tap this market, price is one of the biggest constraints, and Stratasys is focusing on all price points, which is why it has released low-priced 3D printers for domestic users. The MakerBot Replicator Mini launched recently claims to be the smallest and the cheapest 3D printer which targets home users, strengthening Stratasys' position in the industry.Educational use: In November 2013, Stratasys had launched MakerBot for educational institutions with the aim of delivering a 3D printer to every American high school. In America, as per the census report of 2009-10, the total number of public schools was 98,817, while the total number of private schools was 33,366, which means big opportunity for Stratasys as it aggressively sells its 3D printers for these purposes and prices them right.In the education segment, Stratasys seems to have gained more acceptance than 3D Systems. Stratasys' MakerBot is targeting university graduates and engineers of the future. There is also an initiative to establish MakerBot innovation centers in various universities and educational institutes. Stratasys is looking to tap this unexplored market of 3D printers in the education segment, and this is already exemplified with various universities as customers of Stratasys.For the futureIt not just 3D printing, but Stratasys is also looking at 4D printing, and it has already achieved a breakthrough with 4D printing materials. Printing materials developed by Stratasys transform when in contact with water, opening up a wide range of applications.In the future, there might be self assembled objects with intricate designs when submerged in water. The innovation of such materials may not be limited to just reaction with water, but can also be experimented with heat, light and sound.3D Systems' woes3D Systems had crashed early in February when the company reported earnings. Its weak guidance for the fourth-quarter and the entire fiscal year scared investors, and the stock tumbled around 16%. The lowered earnings outlook was due to the fact that 3D Systems is planning to invest aggressively in new products.This is probably because peers such as Stratasys are unveiling new products and are targeting the mass market. Moreover, Stratasys is also looking to speed up the industrial 3D printing process through its multi-color 3D printer, and this is another cause of concern for 3D Systems.Valuation and conclusionSo, it can be said that 3D Systems is facing pressure from both existing peers and probable competitors such as HP in the additive manufacturing space. Also, with a P/E ratio of 160, 3D Systems is quite expensive.On a forward P/E basis also, 3D Systems is expensive at a multiple of almost 84 when compared to Stratasys' 55. HP is the cheapest of them all, and it might prove to be a solid pick if it enters the 3D printing space, as it will be the cheapest of the three and will already have an existing network of clients and distributors to sell its products. All in all, it can be said that 3D Systems is under siege, and investors should avoid it.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2041213,28121,2014-02-23T03:16:59-05:00,,"Valuing intangibles has been consistently a problem for most industries, even moreso for an industry like 3D printing. Patents could become a potential key for dominating the market once a technical victor arises out of the arena.We'll dive into what's happening with intangibles in the 3D printing industry and how to proceed from here.PatentsThe two behemoths in the industry, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) both have sizeable patent portfolios. Partially as a result of software patent wars, many believe that this industry will devolve into the same pissing contest. Their comparisons usually focus on recent patent infringements between Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), but this perspective ranges from wrong to absurd.To understand technology hardware patents, we'll need to explore a bit of history first.These patents can be used as leverage for other technologies and to enact licensing fees but cannot bar other entrants from industry as anti-trust issues arise. It's also been historically the case that hardware margins erode and software becomes the (edge) sole revenue stream for companies.Should any technical patent cover the superior technical implementation in the immediate future with the current patent environment in the United States staying as it is (very likely), you'll probably see some forced cross-licensing so the industry doesn't become monopolized. Then any investment today in any firm big or small has a few of the following ramifications:While we're on the topic of patents, we'll look at the first ever patent infringement case. This is the first ever patent lawsuit in the 3D printing space that will have significant ramifications. DDD and SSYS both hold huge patent portfolios and have lofty valuations.Stratasys has sued AfiniaThis will set the bar for the rest of the industry, what patent infringements and lawsuits will go through and how the courts will handle it. The notable aspect is that the lawsuit does not specifically target Afinia - it is surprisingly broad and could encompass a variety of other manufactures. We could think that Stratasys is probably upset Afinia received 'best overall experience' from a reputable magazine instead of MakerBot.Patent lawsuits as the smartphone industry has shown, are absurdly expensive, perhaps DDD will acquire Afinia…Infillining: Stratasys says anyone who does infill is at fault.They have no qualms with how Afinia is doing the infill process, but merely that they are.Heated platforms are for Stratasys only.This roughly describes… 99% of all 3D printers on the marketPatent on the extrusion head for Afinia's printer.Well, I suppose there are a multitude of differences between a nozzle and funnel as well...The plastic is printed in such a way as to hide the seams when the plastic is printed.The general consensus among some of the community is that most of these patents would apply to every desktop printer out on the market right now. It's also quite odd since Stratasys has had these patents for approximately 30 years and haven't done anything with them until now. It's also probably that this move coincided with their acquisitions of MakerBot.Some other background information about the situation:It'd be interesting if Stratasys could force Afinia to stop shipping units for any amount of time to create a void where the retail stores need something to fulfill (expected) demand and have MakerBot be the natural alternative.Patent ConclusionThere's been some spectacular failures with companies that attempt to corner the market with patents. A good example to bring up is Sony vs. VHS, the alternative was developed to combat Sony and was shared freely amongst everyone and today... no one remembers what Sony made.The current situation is that with 3D printing, the platform that has the easiest-to-use designs with a balance of cost should win any platform war outright. Even if Stratasys enforces patents across the desktop printer market, there will be an alternative that circumvents it and you can expect the hobbyists and other startups to join and support the movement with full-force.This is the first time there's been major litigation in the 3D printing industry, this will set the precedent for future cases and validate the value of patent portfolios. It'd be interesting to see all of the patents being shot down - though unlikely. It would be safe to assume that 1 or 2 of the patents won't hold in court but we'll see how it evolves.The Technology ItselfA large part of the growth of DDD can be attributed to absorbing smaller companies and consolidating the various patents and expertise in 3D printing. Even though the company has been around since 1986, the demand for 3D printers is quite soft and still in its infancy. The only way for such a company to grow faster than the market growth is to acquire other smaller competitors and at the same time acquire talent, customers, and expertise.Normally, looking at the acquisitions of 3D systems, they are seen as an avenue for (albeit inorganic) growth. Sounds great, but here's the problem:Interestingly, there still isn't a dominate technical implementation in 3D printing.Example: The predominate technologies used in 2D ink printing is laser for industrial use and inkjet (though you can easily Google several types of printing technologies like bubble jet).Let's take a closer look at the hard drive industry and the NAND patents we mentioned earlier.SSD / NAND and ToshibaThe main technologies in hard drives wereBack when hard drive technologies were still new, successive iterations and new technologies would replace older ones, more storage for less cost.So imagine 4 different companies starting the hard-drive race with 4 different technologies. Which of the 4 will win? We know from history the magneto-resistive heads won, the efficiency scale draws out better and the other two technologies can't compete with it.So for the sake of simplicity (and to be generous), we'll argue that there will be 2 winning technologies. There are a few major technologies out there that I'll list for comparison.Looks surprisingly similar to how the hard drive race started in our little example. Some purists will say that the technologies in the hard drives developed chronologically and can't be compared to today... but what we have now are all 4 technologies lying before us and we need to make an educated bet as investors.Then...It's Already StartedHas the amortization write-offs already began? What's the value of the company once these write-offs start happening?Actually, they have.SSYS has been previously amortizing RP technology at 11 years.Pictures are taken from SSYS AnnualsSince FY 2011, SSYS has effectively halved the expected amortization time for RP technologies. We feel this is a turning point as realize that the technologies they have are slowly going to have to be amortized away but we feel this is still very conservative (remember, 80% of the technologies on the market today will be worthless in less than a decades time).Unsurprisingly, the company has been consistently underestimating amortization expense for 5 years out2010:2011:2012:It's laughable that they are only estimating the expense at ~50 million for the next 5 years. Notice the increasing cost of amortization that they consistently underestimate and project to decrease the years out?Here is an analysis that we did for the amortization expense - it's important to note that we aren't really focused on the dollar amounts here (the difference of 100k isn't going to majorly affect the bottom line of a company like , however, it's the only indirect proxy we have for measuring technology).ConclusionIf you sit back and look at the technology/patents DDD and SSYS has through a historical lens, you'll notice a lot of inconsistencies and what is simply a gross valuation.You can clearly see that 70-80% of the technology that exists today will be obsolete (for our purposes), so take care when looking at the balance sheets and ultimately the valuation of these companies.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2045533,56262,2014-02-25T07:51:24-05:00,,"I have been advising investors to sell or short 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) for over three months now, with my latest recommendation coming on Dec. 30, 2013 when the stock was trading above $92. The stock fell as much as 25% in the next few weeks, giving the shorts a chance to cash in their gains; however, it has regained its upward trajectory, appreciating nearly 20% in the last 15 days.Many investors see the recent blowup as a buying opportunity, but I think it's a big mistake. 3D Systems is driven by hype and a 25% decline in one day indicates that the smallest bit of negative news can send the stock tumbling. When people finally realize that the company's prospects are not good enough to justify its valuation, or hype, the stock price will fall a great deal. Hence, I'd recommend investors to short 3D Systems. Let's go over the reasons why I think 3D Systems will never justify its valuation.Acquisitions Will BackfireDue to its aggressive M&A tactics, 3D Systems had to revise its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and FY2014 downwards. The company expects 2014 earnings to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.85, well below analysts' estimate of $1.27.Avi Reichental, 3D Systems' Chief Executive, noted, ""We are willing to tolerate earnings reduction and even slight gross profit margin compression during this period to substantially accelerate our growth rate and market share."" This quote looks appealing, but what will happen if these acquisitions don't turn out to be as profitable as the company expected? Obviously, shares will plummet and there's a good chance of this happening and here's why.First, many of 3D Systems' acquisition were done with the consumer segment in mind. The acquisition of The Sugar Labs, Village Plastics, and Gentle Giant were done to boost the company's consumer business. People seem to believe that 3D printers will become an everyday household product. I have already said that I don't believe this will ever happen, but even if it does, there's no guarantee that 3D Systems' (Cube and CubeX) 3-D printers will dominate the consumer market.Overwhelming positive media attention has overhyped 3D Systems' printers. For instance, the company's CubeX 3D printer was awarded the ""2013 Best Emerging Tech Award."" But, does this automatically mean 3D Systems' printers are the best? No, it does not!In fact, CubeX is nowhere near the best thing available in the market. Here's a screenshot of customer reviews of CubeX taken directly from Amazon.com. As you can see, the ""best emerging tech"" gadget failed to please users as they gave it an average rating of 1.1/5.The advanced version of the CubeX, called the CubeX Duo, didn't do any better as customers gave it an average rating of 1.2/5.There are many better products available in the market; however, they don't get much attention, primarily because the hype surrounding 3D Systems is massive. Moreover, the 3D printing market is extremely competitive and spending excessively on M&A instead of R&D wouldn't make much sense if the company is not able to come up with better-quality products. In addition, wealthier companies like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) will also be entering the market pretty soon, posing a new threat to the existing players.Absurd ExpectationsThe hype surrounding 3D printing is so huge that it has overshadowed the facts. For instance, consider the case of Boeing. Avi Reichental said, ""The company's printers already make about 90 different parts installed in F-18 fighters."" This quote made everyone believe that 3D printing has a great future in the aerospace segment, and 3D Systems being a supplier of Boeing will benefit the most. However, it isn't true, as Citron Research recently released a report, debunking this myth. Citron noted:Yes, it is possible to print a variety of different objects via 3D printing, but it will not revolutionize the manufacturing industry. In the industrial space, the existing traditional manufacturing methods are very cheap, and in almost every industry, cost is the primary driver in selecting manufacturing equipment. The company will succeed in very niche markets targeting dentists, design firms, and architecture firms etc., but not in the mass production market. Thus, I believe 3D Systems will sink considerably when people realize its true potential. Therefore, I think investors should short 3D Systems at present valuations.Upward risks3-D printing is still in its nascent stage. Although the technology has evolved over time, it still has a long way to go. If raw materials used in 3-D printing get stronger and more durable with time, it won't be surprising if they find use in mainstream industrial and domestic applications. This is where 3D Systems' various acquisitions will come to its advantage.The advent of durable concept models, prototypes, and tooling could help make industrial products move into production with the help of 3-D printing. However, as I have said all throughout, it does not make sense to buy 3D Systems on this pretext since the stock is highly overvalued and the company is almost as big as the industry itself in terms of market capitalization. Until and unless there's growth in the prospects of the 3-D printing industry, 3D Systems won't have a bright future.ConclusionTo bring 3D Systems overvaluation into perspective, consider this. Currently, 3D Systems has a market cap of over $7.8 billion, while the 3-D printing market is expected to be worth $8.4 billion by 2020. So, how can a company be worth more than the entire market (that too in 7 years from now)? It's obvious that 3D Systems is extremely overvalued and is way ahead of its fundamentals and given its prospects, it will never justify its valuations. Hence, I think investors should short 3D Systems.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2019561,44981,2014-02-13T14:25:45-05:00,,"Executive summary:_________________________________The movement in the stock price of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is probably causing a lot of concerns for its investors - at the same time, it is undoubtedly offering a great trading opportunity to short-term traders to make some quick bucks. However, investors need to remember that it is a common trend in the companies operating in the hyper-growth period to show a high level of sensitivity to small pieces of news - a new partnership for distribution of products can result in a large upward movement in the price, and at the same time, a downgrade from a single analyst can bring the stock price tumbling down. This sort of price movement creates a great opportunity for short-term traders. The real question is that do you believe in the long-term potential of the industry? I do.I have always maintained that the long-term potential of the 3D printing industry is real and the growth opportunity is there for the companies. 3D Systems is the main player in this industry, and the company will certainly continue to grow. The stock price came down after the recent update about the earnings - it is a credit to the growth of the company that organic growth figures of about 30% have disappointed the market. In isolation, if you offered me that number for organic growth I will bite your hands off. However, market is expecting the company to continually grow its organic growth rate, which is not possible for a company operating even in a hyper-growth sector. Nonetheless, the stock price is back up again, and I expect it to continue to go up.The Message from the Management is ClearLet's first look at the issue - the stock price came down due to the future outlook - the company announced that it will earn 83-87 cents over the next year, compared to the previous outlook of $0.93-1.03. Most of the times, the news is taken on its face value for the stocks that have high volatility in the stock price. We need to analyze the reason behind the decrease in the expected earnings. First thing to remember here is that the revenue growth is exceptionally strong and the company is expecting to double the revenue figures over the next two years. Now, how can the company establish this feat? By investing in the marketing and distribution channel.The message from the management is clear: we are willing to sacrifice short-term margins in order to ensure better long-term margins. The long-term growth in margins is more important, in my opinion. In order to enhance the margins in the long-term, the company has to capture more market share. The investment in the marketing will ensure the company captures a larger market share and the products are marketed to a wider market, geographically and segment-wise. At the same time, the investment in the research and development is hugely important for the companies operating in this sector. In order to stay one step ahead of the competition, these companies need to invest substantial amount on research and development. It is one of the main expenditures for 3D Systems going forward, along with marketing expenses.Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) went through the same procedure earlier in the year, as the company announced to increase the spending on R&D and marketing. We need to remember that these two expenditures are essential for the long-term sustainability of the earnings. These two expenses are the main reason for a decline in expected earnings. I do not believe a decrease in earnings due to the increase in R&D and marketing warrants a decline in stock price. In fact, the long-term investors should be happy that the management is taking a long-term view of the business. Furthermore, 3D Systems generates a substantial portion of revenues from materials, which is a high-margin product for the company. At the moment, the company is focusing on increasing the sales of printers (low-margin product), which will increase the demand for the high-margin product (materials) in the future. I believe this factor will play an important role in doubling the revenues for 3D Systems over the next two years.Big Boys are Choosing 3D PrintingARC Group Worldwide (OTCPK:ARCW), the largest metal injection molding company in the world, purchased ProX, a direct metal sintering (DMS) printer, from a reseller of 3D Systems. These new series of industrial level printers are capable of printing a wide array of parts with stainless steel, titanium, cobalt chrome, ceramics and aluminum. It is another proof that the manufacturers are taking 3D printing seriously, and 3D Systems is making strong inroads in the manufacturing segment of the 3D printing industry, which is the fastest growing segment in the industry at the moment. The cost and time constraints will likely restrict 3D printing from taking over injection molding; however, it should be kept in mind that this technology is consistently evolving and the printers are a lot faster and cost-effective.The 3D printing industry has been around for some years now. However, only recently the bigger businesses have started to use it for manufacturing purposes. General Electric (NYSE:GE) is another manufacturer that uses 3D printing to manufacture some of the engine parts for its aviation business, which were previously manufactured through injection molding. Now GE has adopted additive manufacturing, the industrial level of 3D printing. The company has adopted 3D printing because it is more efficient than the traditional way, and saves huge material costs and gives strength to the parts, as discussed above. This gives an idea of how the 3D printing industry is growing on a huge industrial level. These two manufacturing giants were discussed here as an example of the potential of the technology in the industrial segment of the industry. It is clear that the growth potential is massive, and the bigger players in the 3D printing industry should benefit from this growth opportunity.ConclusionI remain bullish on the long-term prospects of 3D Systems in specific and the 3D printing industry in general. As I mentioned in my previous article, the stock is trading close to my price target ($64). In fact, it is trading at a slight premium, which is normal for companies operating in hyper-growth period. I believe the premium is, in fact, low considering the trend in the industry and there is still some potential in the short term for the stock to go up. However, long-term investors should keep in mind that the price will remain volatile over the next twelve months, but the overall trend in price will be upward in the long term, in my opinion.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2005291,56922,2014-02-07T17:29:59-05:00,,"3D Systems Corp (NYSE:DDD), along with the 3-D printing industry as a whole, has been experiencing a downward trend in its stocks lately. Investors began to lose their confidence in 3D Systems and the industry after a report from Citron research adjudged the company to be a short sell and concluded that it has no long term growth prospects. Furthermore, 3D Systems lowered its 2014 EPS guidance which increased the investor's concerns about the 3-D printing industry. All stocks were hit; DDD, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and Voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET) fell by around 30%, 13% and 28% respectively during the last month. We will analyze the current uncertainty surrounding 3D Systems and assess the claims of Citron Research in this report.Recent DevelopmentsFinancial Reporting3D Systems recently issued preliminary results for 2014 along with revenue and earnings guidance.Revenues for 2013 are expected to be around $513 million, which is in line with the previously issued revenue guidance. The company expects 2014's revenues to be in the range of $680-$720 million, translating to a growth rate of around 32%. The projected CAGR from 2012-2021 is 19% according to Wohlers and is mentioned in Citron's report. Therefore, 3D Systems' growth will be above expectations according to the guidance. This also means that 3D Systems will have a larger share of the market by 2021 if it continues to surpass expected growth projections. All in all, 3D Systems is set to grow if we assume that it continues to perform as it has in the past; and there is no evidence to suggest that it will be unable to do so.Earnings are expected to be $0.43-$0.45 in 2013, which is below the previously issued earnings guidance. The expected earnings for 2014 are around $0.44-$0.56. Management cites R&D expenditure, marketing investments and costs related to acquisitions as the reasons for the compressed earnings guidance. The company announced about 24 new products over a period of nine months and in our view, these expenses are necessary to cope with the growth of the industry.The OCF of 3D Systems is positive and has grown during last year. The company generated around $53 million operating cash in 2012 and the 2013's results are expected to be even more positive. In comparison, Stratasys (SSYS) generated an OCF (TTM) of around $15 million. The solid OCF position and past performance of the company indicates that it has the ability to generate positive cash flows. This is what matters most for a company operating in a premature industry with high growth. The amount of cash generated is also important but as long as the company has positive cash and is managing its balance sheet, it is effectively buying an option to capitalize on the mainstream adoption of that industry's offerings in the future.The financial reporting of 3D Systems indicates growing revenues, compressed EPS and positive operating cash flows. The EPS compression is justified on the basis of the industry's growth factor and the requirement for expenditure in research and development. We believe that the financial performance and position of 3D Systems is satisfactory as of now but does this justify the valuations that the investors put on the company? This will be examined later on.Business RelatedThere have been several business developments in 3D Systems' camp just after the New Year. The company introduced several consumer and prosumer products during the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show. It also initiated several business partnerships, including partnerships with Intel (INTC) and Hershey's (HSY).CES 2014: 3D Systems introduced several products at CES 2014. The showcase included products like the third generation Cube 3D, CubePro series of 3-D printers, the ChefJet (the first ever sugar and chocolate 3-D printer), iSense 3D scanner and several others.Potential Successful ProductsIn our view Cube 3D, ChefJet and iSense will gain popularity this year. Cube is differentiated from other consumer printers because of its speed; the new Cube prints at speeds that are up to 2x faster than other alternatives in expanded, finer resolution print modes with a greater materials selection. The ChefJet is a unique product and will capture the interest of many restaurants, professional bakers and some candy manufacturing corporations; the deal with Hershey's is an example of such an interest. The iSense is the pick of these products as it will strengthen the 3D printing ecosystem. Said Rajeev Kulkarni, Vice President and General Manager, Consumer Products:Capturing 3-D images from an iPad whenever someone wants makes the iSense a very attractive consumer offering. We are not saying that portable 3-D scanning will go mainstream in 2014 but it will surely have some impact on the whole 3-D printing ecosystem.One important thing worth mentioning here is that the major barrier to consumer printing going mainstream is the cost associated with owning a 3-D printer or its related products. Once the manufacturers find a way to reduce the technological and manufacturing costs, consumer 3-D printing will go mainstream.PartnershipsHershey's: 3D Systems entered a multiyear joint development agreement with Hershey's to deliver 3-D printed edibles. We see a lot of synergic benefits in this arrangement. The 3-D printing capabilities of 3D Systems and Hershey's experience in food science, working together, have the potential to bring innovative and successful edible items to the market. Note that Hershey's generated around $7 billion in revenues this year and 3D Systems is likely to benefit from this partnership even if a fraction of these revenues starts coming from edible printed products.Intel: 3D Systems recently announced its collaboration with Intel Corporation. The company will make available its Sense scanning, editing and 3D printing software applications for the Intel-powered Ultrabook 2 in 1, AIO and tablet devices equipped with the new Intel 3D camera during the second half of 2014. Said Brian Krzanich, CEO, Intel Corporation:This development will further enhance the 3D printing ecosystem by expanding the base of 3D models available online. The diverse collection of 3D printable scans is key factor in the future success of 3D consumer printing.To summarize, the company has launched some decent products at the start of the year. The partnerships with Hershey's and Intel are also a positive sign but the price tag of 3D Systems' offerings is a stumbling block. As long as the prices are high it will not be possible for consumer printing to go mainstream. However, the company is on the right track as far as its product portfolio is concerned and we believe that it will be among the leaders of the 3-D industry in the years to come.The rest of the report will critically analyze Citron's perspective on 3D Systems and also analyze whether the current valuation of the company is justified or not.Cirtron's PerspectiveIn a recently published report, Citron Research commented that the bull case for 3D Systems is flawed and presented several reasons to support this claim. The most significant reasons specified were:As far as the first point is concerned, hobbyist machines may be sitting idle but are they the main revenue generating group for the company? In our view, the prosumer market including dentistry and jewelry will be responsible for 3D Systems' growth. According to businesswire.com:IDTechEx claims that:Hobbyists were never expected to add much to the 3D printing revenues. It was the prosumer and professional segment of the industry that was expected to flourish and 3D Systems offers more competitive products compared to the offerings of Stratasys. Therefore, we cannot see 3D Systems' growth opportunities declining when compared with Stratasys.The second reason mentioned by Citron Research was the inferior quality of 3D Systems' consumer printers and they used Amazon reviews as evidence. In contrast, tomsguide.com named 3D Cube to be the best 3D printer for beginners and 3D Cube X and 3D Cube hold the 2nd and 3rd position respectively on toptenreviews.com. In our view, a few reviews on Amazon are not a sufficient sample to comment on the competitiveness of a product. 3D Cube may not be the best consumer printer around, but it is practical and is comparable in terms of performance to any other consumer printer available. The third generation Cube mentioned earlier is faster and has a lower price than the previous model. The bottom line is that 3D Systems is not dead in the consumer market as Citron portrays. It has a decent consumer product portfolio which can gain market share in the 3-D printing industry.The third point raised by Citron is that some big players like HP (NYSE:HPQ) are entering the market and Mitsubishi (OTCPK:MIELF) has launched a MLS (Metal Laser Sintering) machine. The question that naturally comes to mind is: why are HP and Mitsubishi entering the 3-D printing market? Why is China spending money on 3-D printing research? The answer is obvious; they see the growth in 3-D printing in the coming years. This growth will benefit 3D Systems more than the new entrants because it has been in this industry for almost 25 years now. Other companies, despite their size, do not have the IP portfolio or the expertise as far as 3-D printing is concerned. HP can acquire 3D Systems, but competing in parallel may not be that easy. As far as Mitsubishi is concerned, it does not own a diverse portfolio for all the business segments of 3-D printing and in our view the possibility of Mitsubishi bringing 3D Systems down is a remote one.Valuation and Bottom LineThe only point on which we agree with Citron is the company's current valuation. Yes, the stock is overpriced if we look at the fundamentals only, but we strongly disagree with Citron on their claim of long term growth prospects. The 3-D industry has strong growth prospects and once any of the 3-D industry products go mainstream, the current price targets and fundamentals will be meaningless because the dynamics, revenues and earnings will change. We believe that 3D Systems is a great investment for the long term because, eventually, the technology will mature and the industry will experience an inclined trend in valuations. A cash flow based valuation of the company is given below.Assumptions:The value mentioned in stock translates to a price target of $56, indicating an overvalued stock. Note that assuming the discount rate mentioned by Citron will result in a PT in excess of $60. However, the estimate is based on a no-growth assumption beyond 2021, the chances of which are extremely remote because the industry will almost surely keep on growing after 2021. Hence, the price target is on the low side. Moreover, mainstream adoption of 3-D products will render this valuation void. That is why we believe that the true potential of 3D Systems lies in future opportunities and not in the current fundamentals and estimates. We still maintain a long term buy recommendation on 3D Systems because of the industry's growth prospects and the company's leadership potential.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1998081,20167,2014-02-06T08:06:39-05:00,,"Mark my words: Wednesday's blowup of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is the beginning of the end for the 3D printing bubble (I'm short five stocks across the sector, the largest of which is DDD).I'm not the slightest bit inclined to cover any of these positions and, in fact, shorted a bit more DDD as it bounced on the entirely predictable rush by analysts to reiterate their buy ratings - ""move along, nothing to see here"" (more on this below).3D printing is real, but the stock valuations aren't. For example, coming into today, DDD was trading at 17x revenues. So now it's trading at 14x. So what? Even if DDD is accounting properly for its nearly three dozen acquisitions in the past three years - which I highly doubt - it's maybe worth 3x.The story is the same for pretty much every company in the sector, which is in a completely obvious and STUUUUUUUUUPID bubble.It will never happen, but someday I wish the executives of a company like this were injected with truth serum and then wrote the press release. For DDD's, it would read something like this:Meanwhile, the ""analysts"", if injected with truth serum, would write:As an example of the contortions analysts are twisting themselves into to remain bullish, consider this note from the Pacific Crest analyst yesterday:Wow, lowering the multiple of next year's revenues from 11 to 10 - how conservative!By the way, was it really only last month that we were subjected to this foolishness at CES? 3D Systems Appoints will.i.am as Its Chief Creative Officer. Here's a video of will.i.am with DDD CEO Ari Reichental - it's high comedy! Talk about a great tell for a stock about to crash - check out this stock chart of DDD over the past year:Here's one more sign of a bubble: last week marked the launch of the first 3D printing-focused mutual fund, the 3D Printing and Technology Fund (TDPIX). I'm not making this up. Here's the web site, an interview with the manager, and the ad in last weekend's Barron's:)Disclosure: I'm short five stocks across the sector, the largest of which is DDD."
1996601,21369,2014-02-05T15:24:16-05:00,,"By David Urani3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) reported guidance today that shocked the Street, as it provided earnings guidance that was way below consensus estimates:But before calling the 3-D printing space dead and buried it’s important to note that the softness is all on the bottom line while the revenue expectation for 2013 was held right near the consensus and 2014 sales were actually guided above expectations with the high end representing an increase of approximately 40% over 2013. It’s clear demand for their 3-D printers remains intact.As for the bottom line miss they’re pinning it on investments related to their rapid growth, including marketing, R&D and production capacity. However, we do note they’re expecting to take a gross margin hit, which suggests some competitive price pressure could also be at hand.Likewise, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) put out a similar earnings warning last month noting its own spending initiatives on growth. We also note that SSYS’ Makerbot acquisition has proved to be a great success thus far, and their Replicator printers are a big hit. This could account for some of DDD’s aforementioned shortfall in consumer demand and gross margin pressure.It does appear DDD and SSYS have run into some growing pains and when stocks are priced with extremely high expectations, as theirs are (DDD fwd P/E 50 and SSYS fwd P/E 51), these kinds of speed bumps take their toll on share price. But the long-term success story of 3-D printing looks like it’s still intact and the rapid demand growth in the industry is very real; so much so that perhaps DDD and SSYS are scrambling just to keep up."
2011831,54222,2014-02-11T14:27:55-05:00,,"Many analysts have often criticized 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) for its mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and their prediction seems to be coming true (at least for now). Recently, 3D Systems released earnings guidance which was way below analysts' estimates, and the market did not receive it well as shares plummeted over 15% in a day. While every 3D Systems bear is gloating, I think their happiness is short lived.The company noted:While the M&A have eaten into 3D Systems' earnings, I think they will reap benefits in the coming years. 3-D printing is a fast growing technology; therefore it is important for 3D Systems to expand its market share and acquiring other companies is a good way to do it.Moreover, 3D Systems' acquisition spree isn't absurd as each new purchase serves a different purpose. Let's take a look at the company's recent takeovers.A sweet dealBack in September 2013, 3D Systems completed the acquisition of The Sugar Lab, a startup micro-design firm based in Los Angeles, California, which focuses on 3-D printing customized, multi-dimensional, edible confections in real sugar. The Sugar Lab adopted 3D's own Color Jet Printing technology;As of now, printable sugar only has a small number of applications, but over time, 3D Systems expects the technology to evolve into;This acquisition gave 3D Systems a competitive edge over its peers as it allows the company to diversify its product portfolio and focus on a completely different type of client base. The company can move into creating edible binders and sugar-based objects for food services, bakers, and chefs. 3D Systems also plans to help create home-based products for amateurs to print sugar at home.Plastic fantasticThen, in December 2013, 3D Systems completed the acquisition of Village Plastics, a manufacturer of 3-D printing filaments. Village Plastics is based out of Norton, Ohio, and is one of the leading manufacturers of 3-D printing materials including ABS, PLA, and HIPS. 3D Systems highlighted three key motives for the acquisition which are as follows:· To widen the company's gross profit margin for the materials category that is quickly growing.· To extend its filament materials knowledge base and manufacturing capacity.· To speed up its development of thermoplastics for 3-D printing.3D Systems claimed that it intended to; The company also stated that it would continue to support every single one of Village Plastics' existing customers. Even though this acquisition serves a completely different purpose than The Sugar Lab, it's equally important. Moreover, since this will help 3D Systems widen its gross margin, it looks like a really good move.Metal printing3D Systems possess a long list of customers that will help it to outperform competitors. Out of all the clients, General Electric (NYSE:GE) attracts me the most.Earlier in 2012, when General Electric announced the acquisition of Morris Technology, it was broadly believed that the company would jump into the 3-D printing technology, posing a threat to the existing players. However, in 2013, when GE announced that 3-D printing will account for nearly 50% of its manufacturing, it opened up huge growth opportunities for 3-D printing companies.Presently, less than 10% of General Electric's manufactured products use 3-D printing. With annual sales of over $150 billion, GE's industrial output would be a massive growth opportunity for 3-D printing companies, and as GE is already a customer of 3D Systems, it may benefit the most from this opportunity. Moreover, in order to dictate the industrial sector, a company will have to develop printers that print materials like metal at a fast rate and 3D Systems has already taken care of this.In mid-2013, 3D Systems completed the acquisition of Phenix Systems, a leading global provider of Direct Metal Selective Laser Sintering 3-D Printers based in Riom, France. Also, 3D Systems unveiled the new ProX 300 Direct Metal printer, the first fully rebranded Phenix printer now included in the Direct Metals portfolio. This new production printer leverages Direct Metal Sintering (NYSE:DMS) technology, which is capable of producing fully dense, chemically pure end used metal parts.Furthermore, the latest acquisition of Gentle Giant Studios, a privately held 3-D modeling provider, has given 3D Systems access to an exciting list of existing clients and character licenses to manufacture toys and other collectibles. Hence, it's obvious that each and every one of 3D Systems' M&A serves a unique purpose and this strategy will help the company outperform its peers.ConclusionSo, 3D Systems' recent drop could prove to be a great buying opportunity as it is a short-term weakness. Criticism of the company's acquisition strategy is unwarranted as 3D Systems is focusing on different areas of additive manufacturing through its acquisitions, positioning itself to benefit from different areas of the 3-D printing market in the future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1996371,22445,2014-02-05T14:43:00-05:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) today announced preliminary results and the market did not like them one bit. On the face of it, the company is doing just fine in terms of revenue growth, but on a non-GAAP basis, it fell shy of expectations (to say the least).3D Systems said that its full year 2013 revenue will be between $513 million to $514 million, within its previous guidance range of $500 million to $530 million, which translates into 30% organic revenue growth for the year and about 50% revenue growth for Q4 of 2013.The question is, does revenue growth really count, even if a company has little or no profits? Of course it does, but only when you are a normally priced stock.If your Price/Sales ratio is off the charts -- as is the case with the entire 3-D space -- then as far as I'm concerned, it makes no difference. As a reminder, the Price/Sales ratio of 3D systems is around 16, even after today's fall.But in the case of 3D Systems, revenue is not the issue, because it came within guidance and within market expectations (whatever that means). Where 3D Systems was way off was in non-GAAP earnings.Τhe company expects non-GAAP earnings per share for 2013 to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.87, below its previous guidance of $0.93 to $1.03. The market was expecting $0.96 non-GAAP earnings per share.But where 3D systems really disappointed was in its 2014 guidance. For 2014, the company expects revenue to be in range of $680 million to $720 million (within expectations) but non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.85, with market expectations for 2014 of $1.27 (data from yahoo).Not only is this a big miss, but guess what, it also means the company will not register any non-GAAP EPS growth for two years in a row. For a stock that sells for astronomical multiples and far and above any investment metric I can think of, one would expect more.As a result, the market marked down 3D Systems as well as the whole space, including ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and Voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET) accordingly.And why you ask has the sector been marked down today by the market so much? To begin with, please recall that ExOne also missed expectations a short while ago. So counting 3D Systems today, that's two for two and is a red flag for the sector as a whole.The second and more important reason, is something I have repeated for the space many times:The stocks in this sector are so far ahead of the fundamentals, that any deviation from the astronomical expectations the market has of them, can crash many of these stocks, even if revenue growth continues for many years to come.And that's why 3D Systems is crashing today. Revenue growth will continue, but revenue growth is simply not enough, when you are trading for such high multiples, you need EPS growth as well.So irrespective if the company and the space continues to achieve 30% revenue growth next year and the year beyond that, there is so much baked into these stocks, that it really does not matter. As a result, any deviation from what the market expects of them can mark them down by a lot.And that's the reason why investors should shy away from sectors that sell for astronomical multiples, because when they deviate from market expectations, the markdown can be a lot more than what investors can imagine. And like I have said before, the sector can fall by 70% from current levels and still not be considered reasonably priced by my metrics.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1968571,58641,2014-01-27T00:05:00-05:00,,"In my previous article, I listed 7 reasons not to join the sell-off party for 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). However, in spite of the 21,063 page views which my article received, DDD's free fall continues.I'm sorry I failed to convince enough bulls to fight off the bears. English is not my native language: I cannot thoroughly express the logic and beauty of holding on to 3D Systems shares. DDD went down further to $78.75 during the after-hours trading last Friday.The sharp fall is allegedly attributed to Citron Research's latest report on DDD. However, learned investors already know that Citron's latest negative assessment of 3D Systems is just as mischievous as the one it issued last February 14, 2013. Citron called DDD a ""bubble stock"" and we all knew how 3D Systems performed last year. Citron's earlier report did not deter investors from letting DDD fly after February 2013.This is why I hate day trading - the stock market is sometimes very susceptible to rumors and black propaganda. Shorts have no qualms exploiting gullible investors. I'm sticking to grinding online poker. At least in poker, no short-selling propaganda or half-truths can meddle with my win/loss variance.Citron Research Might Be Credible But Not InfallibleI do not want to get into a credibility contest with Citron Research. They are the experts in digging up all the inadequacies of a company. I cannot disprove all their claims about 3D Systems. I leave it to individual investors to do their own due diligence over the said report.However, I strongly disagree that 3D printing's future is purely industrial - it's consumer and small-scale manufacturing. 3D Systems' current weak consumer sales numbers are not indicative of the future. Five or ten years from now, 3D printers will be as endemic as inkjet printers. Device sales and printing materials will drive DDD's future, not its low-margin service bureau.Furthermore, I think I'm not the only one who knows that product reviews on Amazon are easily manipulated. There are guys in my country who get paid for posting ""product reviews"" on Amazon and other online stores. I believe most Seeking Alpha readers are 10 times smarter than me, many of you will agree that the use of Amazon product reviews weakened the value of Citron's report.If DDD's financial success is all an illusion, how did it get away with it for so long? I look at the company's financial records and I see steady revenue and net income growth over the last 5 years.How did 247 institutional investors overlook the ""illusion"" that 3D Systems created. Mutual funds and investment firms hold 63% of floated DDD shares. These big investors have their own analysts and they have access to insider or confidential information. It is more prudent to believe the wisdom of 247 large investors.None of these big investors have recently unloaded their DDD shares. These expert fund managers most likely did not believe the Citron Research report. If they did, they would have dumped their DDD immediately last Friday. In my opinion, it is more prudent to believe the wisdom of 247 institutional investors than one research company.Also, no insiders have dumped their DDD shares this year.I am also not questioning the credibility of Terry Wohlers, but he isn't a god to be all-knowing and infallible. If you are willing to pay $3,950 for Wohlers' 2013 Report then you can verify Citron's claims. I can't afford it, so I'll stop delving further into Citron's reasons why 3D Systems is overvalued.I noticed that the intro of Citron's latest report on DDD included a recommendation to buy Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) instead.Why does Citron value Stratasys more than 3D Systems? Is market-darling DDD so overrated that its true value is lower than SSYS? I know that experts at Macroaxis give SSYS a 79% probability to go bankrupt in the next two years. 3D Systems only has 2.9% chance of going bust. I can also see that 3D Systems has higher operating and profit margins. There's no compelling reason to dump DDD and replace it with SSYS.Since the fall of DDD, the 209.33 P/E of SSYS is now higher than that of DDD's 173.22. If Citron Research really cares for small investors, it should have not recommended SSYS in its negative assessment of DDD. 3D Systems clearly makes more money than Stratasys. Besides, insiders only own 6.3% of DDD shares while 42.2% of SSYS shares are owned by Stratasys insiders.I therefore refuse to believe Citron's master-of-illusion potrayal of CEO Reichental. He doesn't own 40% of 3D Systems to have the worst of ulterior motives. Citron call DDD a bubble stock but did not say the same about SSYS. Since its debut on the market, SSYS has also gone Icarus high. Speaking of bubble categorization, SSYS did +925.41% while DDD only managed +508.3% during the same period.ConclusionThe big decline of 3D Systems last Friday was largely due to a negative report from Citron Research. A report which I found to be far from being infallible.I suspect that many susceptible investors who believed Citron's assessment that DDD's success is just an ""illusion"", panicked last January 24 and they caused the big drop. Profit-taking may have also been a factor - or maybe it's a real market pull-back. I don't really know - I'm not a qualified financial analyst.I just look at charts online, and because I understand elementary mathematics, I find DDD was and is still a better buy than SSYS. You can sell DDD for profit now... or buy more and wait until Avi proves Citron is wrong again this year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in DDD, over the next 72 hours.

1971651,24491,2014-01-28T04:06:14-05:00,,"What is stock analysis? Well, there are some that think it has everything to do with the dividend. There are others that only look at charts. There are others that think analyst estimate misses (notice how this is equivalent to companies' earnings beats) are a way to gauge the trajectory of a stock. And yet there are others who are lost in medieval times. We, as investors, need to move beyond these individual frameworks and start taking a holistic view. Let's take a look at what we mean as it relates to our analysis with 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD).As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In 3D System's case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $73, about in line to where it is currently trading.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis, it scores high on our scale. 3D Systems posts a VBI score of 6 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the firm, its unattractive relative valuation versus peers, and bullish technicals. We compare 3D Systems to peers F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• 3D Systems earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 45.6% during the past three years.• 3D Systems is a leading provider of 3D content-to print solutions including 3D printers, print materials and on-demand custom parts services for professionals and consumers alike.• 3D Systems has a good combination of strong free cash flow generation and manageable financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 10.4% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 1.1 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 15.5%.• What once seemed like an unattainable pipe dream is now a very powerful means of production. 3D Systems is seeing strong demand from manufacturing customers, and the firm's consumer products have recently hit Staples' shelves with a positive reception from consumers.• The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 30.3% during the past 3 years. We expect its revenue growth to be better than its peer median during the next five years.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital - ROIC - with its weighted average cost of capital - WACC. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. 3D Systems's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 45.6%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 11.7%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. 3D Systems's free cash flow margin has averaged about 14.5% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At 3D Systems, cash flow from operations increased about 67% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 150% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisThe estimated fair value of $73 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 102.1 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 47.8 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 28.5% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 30.3%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 17.3%, which is above 3D Systems's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 11.9% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For 3D Systems, we use a 11.7% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $73 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for 3D Systems. We think the firm is attractive below $47 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $99 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate 3D Systems's fair value at this point in time to be about $73 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of 3D Systems' expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $102 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $73 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1995431,53552,2014-02-05T11:00:43-05:00,,"Prior to today, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) was one of the most beloved stocks on Wall Street. Unfortunately for investors, that changed abruptly this morning after the company pre-announced extremely disappointing results (press release available here). Shares are down 25% today and have fallen 40% from their 52-week high. Has DDD finally fallen too much or is there more downside ahead?3D Systems is now looking to earn $0.83-$0.87 for all of 2013 compared to the $0.93-$1.03 that it previously had guided to. This would imply that DDD's fourth quarter was far weaker than analysts were expecting. Analysts were looking for $0.30 in the quarter, and it appears 3-D will deliver about $0.20. Importantly, that figure is down from last year's earnings of $0.26. 3-D is also guiding to $513-$514 million in revenue for the full year, which is within its previous guidance of $500-$530 million. Based on this guidance, fourth quarter results should be in the $153-$155 million range, which is in the vicinity of analyst estimates ($155.7 million).Interesting, this revenue result is a lot stronger than last year's figure of $102 million. Essentially, DDD is growing sales 50% annually, and about 30% of this growth is organic. However, none of this growth is flowing to the bottom line. 3-D is blaming an unfavorable product mix for this. Like with traditional printers, printers have lower margins than their supplies have. As a consequence if the company is selling a higher proportion of printers, it will see a margin decline. Now in the long run, this is actually good news. Obviously, printer sales are needed to generate future supply sales. By selling more printers, future supply sales will increase, which given their higher margins are fantastic for profit growth.Given the company's 2014 guidance, this scenario is not playing out. In 2014, EPS will be $0.73-$0.85 on revenue of $680-720 million. In other words, 3-D is expecting revenue to grow 36%, but earnings will fall between 2% and 16%. Similarly if we look back to 2012 (results available here), the company earned $1.25 on sales of $353 million. Even though the company has doubled revenue, it is earning less per share. Interestingly in that report, the company expected 2013 EPS to be $1.00-$1.15. The company is reporting results well below that guidance, which has to leave investors a little concerned about whether DDD will even meet 2014 guidance.When earnings fall over a three year period that sees revenue double, there is more that is going on than an unfavorable product mix and higher R&D investments. It is a warning sign that commoditization is hitting the industry. 3-D printing is starting to become a crowed space with other companies like Stratsys (NASDAQ:SSYS), ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), and Voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET) competing for business. Further, it is well known that traditional printer giant Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) is interested in entering the sector. Of course, HPQ has unparalleled resources and could afford extremely low pricing to gain share and push competitors out of the market, which would be horrendous for DDD's margins.At the end of the day, profit growth and not revenue growth drive stock prices higher. While DDD clearly has a fantastic track record of growing sales, this growth is of little value without corresponding EPS growth. Instead, investors are faced with a company growing revenue dramatically but simultaneously earning less money. Even after this drop shares are trading 69x 2014 earnings even though EPS is below 2012 and 2013 levels. This valuation makes little sense, and the only reason to buy DDD is on the hopes of a takeover. In an industry quickly commoditizing, profit growth will be extremely difficult to achieve.Now, some investors may continue to believe that DDD can turn its problems around and get revenue growth to translate into profit growth despite its inability to do so since 2012. In this scenario, I wouldn't be willing to pay more than 36x earnings (equal to annual revenue growth). Using this valuation, DDD shares should be trading at $28-$30, which suggests nearly 50% of additional downside. Even for those bullish on 3-D printing, this company remains extremely expensive. This quarter was the canary in the coal mine so to speak. While shares are down quite a bit, fair value is even lower. Paying 70x earnings for a company with declining EPS is a likely way to lose money. As painful as it may be for some who are long at higher prices, DDD is a must sell given its lack of profit growth.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1968751,20229,2014-01-27T04:08:06-05:00,,"Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing as it is frequently referenced, is truly a promising development. Today's 3d printers can 'print' or fabricate an item in over one hundred different materials, from plastic polymers to metals to ceramics. The technology dramatically reduces the time and cost manufacturers invest in building prototypes. It is possible to identify design errors earlier and reduce travel to production facilities. This means more efficient use of resources and a reduction in waste. Manufacturers can create high quality, precision end-products such as prosthetic limbs and dental implants or components and parts for unique, complex machines such as space craft.The technology behind 3D printing has been around since the 'go-go' 80s. Stratasys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSYS) and 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) are veterans in the industry. Back in the day they called it solid imaging or stereolithography. The financial industry debacle and the ensuing recession of 2009-2010 threw a wrench in 3D printing sector progress. However, even though the economy has fumbled about for recovery, 3D printing solutions have gained favor among manufacturers and appear to be on the cusp of widespread adoption. Most market forecasts are like that of IDTechEx (idtechex.com), which pegs compound annual growth in the 3d printing market over the next ten years near 20%.Large market opportunity and above average growth prospects have made it possible for the veterans to finally produce profits. However, it has also enticed new competitors to the field such as Voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET) and The ExOne Company (NASDAQ:XONE). The rough and tumble of competition has driven a few into the hands of others. Stratasys in particular has bulked up its product line and extended its market share through acquisitions. (See my post Stratasys: Rebalancing Act with Follow-on Offering on the Seeking Alpha platform).Now that the industry has taken off, one question investors should be asking is, which players have the financial resources to keep up the pace? Which can keep their product lines fresh with new capabilities? Which will be able jump on acquisition opportunities?Since there are limited financial details available for the likes of privately held 3D printing companies such as EOS Optronics GmbH and EnvisionTEC GmbH, I looked at just the four public companies mentioned above to see who has the power in the 3D printing sector.It is not enough to just look at the cash balance to measure financial muscle. Instead we need to look at how well cash resources meet operating and investment needs. There are a few handy measures that provide some light on financial strength. (In all the measures that follow I used the 2012 and 2013 annual and quarterly financial reports filed by each of these companies with the SEC. All can be found at SEC.gov.)First, let's take a look at a measure called the Defensive Interval. It tells us about how well operating expenses are supported by a company's most liquid assets. Of the four, The ExOne Company has the highest Defensive Interval - current assets are 7.1 times operating expenses. Voxeljet has the lowest defenses at 1.9 times.Yet, support for operating expenses at the present run rate is not really what we are worried about. We are more concerned about how each company is able to finance growth in sales as 3D printing achieves widespread adoption. The Financing Interval tells us about the turn of new business and how much of it needs to be financed by the company with working capital.The first thing the Financing Interval tells us is that in the 3D printing business inventory sits around on average for a good five to six months, but once the sale is made customers are relatively quick to pay the bill. For our group of four, the amount of sales uncollected in accounts receivable range from two to three months worth. This means that on average the 3D printing companies are waiting about eight months from the time they lay in inventory to the time they finally see some cash roll in. They get a bit of a respite from the burden on cash resources through credit from suppliers. The average period of credit from suppliers is about sixty days.Wahlah! We have the Financing Interval - the amount of time the company waits for cash to roll in less any period of credit they get from suppliers before they have to make payment on inventory and other costs of sales. For our group of four the average is about six months.It is no surprise that 3D Systems, perhaps the most seasoned of the 3D printing companies, has winnowed its Financing Interval down to four months. This means 3D Systems must come up with working capital to pay for the inventory needed to support sales over a four month period. Based on the pace of sales in the last twelve months, that amounts to about $46.5 million for 3D Systems, or about 14% of cash on the balance sheet at the end of September 2014. Even if sales grow it appears 3D systems has the means to bankroll the cost of those sales.The three others have longer Financing Intervals - ExOne, 6.6 months; Stratasys, 5.0 months and Voxeljet, 7.5 months. However, they are well endowed with cash relative to the cost of their sales. Thus even though they have a longer wait in their respective sales cycles to make a sale and then collect, each has been able to build up ample cash hoards to see them through that period. Voxeljet in particular is well endowed with cash since its U.S. offering of American Depository Shares in October 2013, when the company raised US$64.6 million in new capital.Voxeljet had to tap the equity market to build up cash because operations have yet to generate cash. The other newcomer to the sector, The ExOne Company, is in the same boat with operations using cash rather than generating positive cash flow. Stratasys converted 3.9% of its sales in the most recently reported twelve months to operating cash flow, while 3D Systems turned a whopping 11.6% of its sales to cash.Conversion of sales to cash is vital. In the long run that is what drives the engine of growth. We will look at one last measure - Free Cash Flow. This tells us how much cash is available for investment after the company has taken care of working capital requirements and maintenance investments. Over the last twelve months 3D Systems turned out over $40 million in Free Cash Flow. It should be no surprise that The ExOne Company and Voxeljet have no free cash flow. Likewise Stratasys has had to tap into cash reserves to supplement new cash flows to pay for planned capital expenditures. Over the last twelve months 3D Systems turned out over $40 million in Free Cash Flow.The lack of free cash flow has not been an obstacle for Stratasys in its growth plans. It has used its high flying stock to raise capital in the equity market and as currency for acquisitions. Stratasys has no debt, but each of the other three has lain in a bit of debt to make ends meet. Voxeljet had $10.7 million in long-term debt and capital leases on its balance sheet at the end of September 2013, but may end up using some of the proceeds from its ADS offering to pay it off.Conclusion:Clearly each of these four publicly traded companies has built up some financial girth - enough to be real 'influencers' in the market for 3D printers and materials. However, 3D Systems is perhaps one with the greatest ability to act aggressively and sustain growth without diluting shareholder interests. 3D Systems not only has a strong balance sheet with low debt and plenty of cash resources, but it has achieved an operating model that generates enough cash to support current and new business - the ultimate competitive power.Neither the author of the Small Cap Strategist web log, Crystal Equity Research nor its affiliates have a beneficial interest in the companies mentioned herein.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1976181,56202,2014-01-29T10:14:08-05:00,,"3D printing technology has gathered a lot of steam in the past few years. Investors who had invested in companies such as 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) earlier are now sitting on big gains. 3D Systems has seen terrific growth in the past, but will it continue doing well with competition from Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ)?With growing competition and bigger players venturing into 3D printing, it seems like the honeymoon period for 3D Systems is over. Although the market for 3D printing is predicted to be worth $8.41 billion by 2020, it seems like 3D Systems is running out of fuel due to the following reasons.Increased competition2014 will witness the expiry of various patents related to 3D printing. This will give birth to various new 3D printer manufacturers and Hewlett-Packard is one of them. The expiry of patents means new companies save on royalty costs and research and development for innovating new 3D printers.One can certainly see tough competition, as every company wants to have a bigger bite of the 3D printing market. Hewlett-Packard is one of the companies looking to establish its hold in 3D printing in 2014.HP is a known brand among customers globally, and has an established marketing network. HP is all set to embrace the 3D printing business and is planning to launch 3D printers which are more cost effective with higher speed. These features will give HP an advantage over 3D systems.The main area of HP's interest is industrial, where speed is an important factor for productivity and HP would be favored over 3D Systems. 3D Systems has a slight advantage in the home consumer segment as it has a few models targeting the consumer market. But 3D Systems needs to be aware of the fact that various Chinese manufacturers are also stepping in and stiff competition is on its way in the consumer market.In addition, HP has a global marketing network which is much bigger than 3D Systems, which should give it a huge advantage when it launches its own products.Another company which poses a threat to 3D Systems is Stratasys, the second-largest company in the segment. Stratasys' Objet30 OrthoDesk 3D printer is already one of the most preferred 3D printers in the digital dentistry market. The market for dental lab equipment was valued at $5.5 billion in 2011, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.7% from 2012 to 2018 to reach $7.6 billion in 2018. So, Stratasys is making a move in the right market.The advantage of Stratasys' Objet30 OrthoDesk 3D printer is its cost effectiveness and ease of use, which fits in the budget of a small-size dental lab. As compared to printers from 3D Systems Objet30 OrthoDesk provides increased production capacity by eliminating bulky storage space of the printers.HP's financial positionFinancially, HP has a strong cash reserve of $12 billion. This can be an advantage for HP as it will have the necessary resources to develop a low-cost, high speed 3D printer. Last year, HP spent $3.4 billion on research and development. So, once HP enters into the 3D printing market, it will be able to allocate a big research budget for innovating 3D printers and this may create trouble for 3D Systems. The bottom line is that HP will become the largest company making 3D printers in terms of market cap, and it will have pockets deep enough to even acquire 3D Systems.Price warPrice has always been an area of concern for any product's acceptance and its success. So, another area of concern for 3D Systems when it comes to pricing is the news of bigger players like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) entering the 3D printer business. This can further intensify the price war that 3D Systems may face with these giants stepping into this segment. The cash reserve of these big players can always hit companies like 3D Systems in the price wars.Also, Chinese manufacturers have always been tough competitors. A Chinese manufacturer, TierTime Technology, is one of the largest manufacturers of 3D printers in Asia and the third largest in world. The company aims to be the leader in 2014 and hurt 3D System's business.Conclusion3D Systems has run up almost 70% in the last one year and has a steep P/E of 166. The company is facing competition from all sides and so I think it would be best for investors to stay away from it. The advent of HP and Chinese players, along with the expiry of patents, can erode 3D Systems' advantage in the industry, and so investors shouldn't buy it anymore for their portfolios.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1985501,44981,2014-01-31T14:01:50-05:00,,"I wrote an article about 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) at the start of December. In that article, I tried to calculate the fair value for 3D Systems based on the discounted cash flows model. Naturally, the calculated value showed that the stock was overvalued based on future cash flows. I say naturally because the industries with hyper-growth tend to have stocks that are usually overvalued due to the excitement about the future growth prospects. My valuation article was about finding out how much ""over excitement"" (overvaluation) was present in the stock at the time, and the results showed that it was substantial.Most of the readers were not happy with my valuation and accused me of being too negative. However, my regular readers will know that I have a bullish stance on the 3D printing industry in the long-term, and I have been giving unbiased commentary on the stocks in this sector. My valuation was based purely on the free cash flows model and the future expectations about the company. I have always valued stocks based on the long-term growth prospects rather than short-term developments.This Citron report has brought 3D Systems close to its fair value over the past few days, while I agree in part with the report, I believe it is too harsh. My valuation model showed that the stock should be trading close to $54 (I developed the model before the company announced new range of printers and partnership with Hershey's). These two steps will add considerably to the future revenue growth and free cash flows. After the adjustments to the model for these two events (upward adjustments in revenue growth), fair value comes close to $62-64 per share. However, nothing has changed for 3D Systems in terms of growth prospects and the industry dynamics. In fact, the position of the company has been enhanced due to these recent deals. I will try to further assess the situation of the industry.As I have mentioned above, the stocks in this sector are trading at a premium due to the excitement around the 3D printing technology. I believe valuing these stocks based only on fundamentals will a wrong approach. In this article, I will be mainly focusing on the future growth potential of the industry and how it will help 3D Systems continue its impressive growth.Industry Dynamics Have not ChangedThe industry dynamics for the 3D printing industry have not changed drastically - we are still seeing massive growth and the industry is still at the hyper-growth stage, and 3D Systems and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) are the two biggest players in the industry. Due to the better established network and global reach, both of these companies are ahead of their rivals. It is natural for an industry with hyper-growth to attract more players; however, it will not be easy for the new entrants to take on these two players. Moreover, we have to take into account the segments of the industry. For example, the consumer 3D printer segment can be further divided into hobbyist segment and the small scale businesses - businesses that cannot afford the large-scale printers or do not have the operational need for the large-scale printers.Similarly, the industrial as well as the medical devices segments can be further divided into segments. In the industrial segment, we are seeing companies adopt 3D printing technology, not just in the metal 3D printing but also in the food industry. As I talked about 3D systems partnering with Hershey's in my previous article, there are a lot of outlets where these companies will continue to drive future growth. Stratasys has been investing heavily in increasing its sales network and R&D - ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) is coming closer to its customers in order to educate them through PSCs (product service centers), and 3D Systems is partnering with a number of companies. All of these steps show that the big players are making their moves to gobble up more market share.Acquisitions are NecessaryCompanies can grow through two means: Acquisitions, or developing the technology internally. Acquisitions are a faster way to grow and the company took this path when it decided to expand. Ideally, a company will try to make an acquisition which gives the highest level of synergies. However, when we are talking about a segmented market, some acquisition might not bring the desired level of synergies. As I mentioned above, the market for 3D printing is highly segmented and the 3D printing companies cater to a wide range of customers. 3D Systems has focused on the consumer segment and most of the acquisitions have been in this segment.Now, acquisitions of small action figure manufacturing companies might not be a big deal or the best acquisition in terms of synergies; however, it cannot be denied that there is a feasible revenue growth opportunity available. In fact, the market is growing at a rapid pace. Similarly, 3D printed confections section also has a lot of growth potential, and the recent partnership with Hershey's shows that the major players in the industry are willing to use 3D printing on a large scale. Moving forward to the acquisition prices, there are a lot of factors that companies take into account while acquiring a business - the future growth opportunity, the fear of business growing and becoming a competitor, the ability to complement an existing product etc. We have seen technology companies pay massive amounts of cash (Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for Instagram and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for Waze - sometimes acquisitions are made to capture more market share or to capture one specific segment. Most of the 3D Systems acquisitions have been focused on growing its market share. In some cases, the company has paid over the top; however, the long-term growth potential has been the main determinant of these deals.Why 3D Systems will not FailThere are a number of reasons the company will not fail, in my opinion. I have listed some of these reasons here.3D Technology is Becoming Mainstream: The technology has been around for over two decades now; however, it has just started to take the center stage. The technology is becoming extremely popular and the acceptance is increasing. As a result, 3D printing companies have been able to record massive growth in revenues. According to IDC, the 3D printing industry will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 59% over the next four years. In the same time period, the revenue of these companies is expected to grow at about 30% annually.One of the Biggest Players: 3D Systems is one of the biggest players in the industry - it will be naive to think that the company will not focus on developing better technology and enhancing its current portfolio of products. R&D is a major expense in the sector and the company will continue to work on new and improved products. The most recent addition to the company was the acquisition of The Sugar Lab -- this acquisition has opened a completely new market for 3D Systems. 3D printed edible confections can become a substantial growth driver for the company.Strong Sales Network: 3D Systems has global presence and the company has one of the strongest sales networks in the sector. The company has been focusing on partnerships with regional players in order to increase its global footprint. These partnerships and strong ties with customers will allow the company to grow in both consumer as well as industrial segment.ConclusionThe threat of increased competition in the industry is present due to the massive growth potential. However, the assumption that any company can enter and trump 3D Systems or Stratasys is wrong, in my opinion. Both of these companies have built a strong presence in the industry and any new entrant will have a big fight on its hands. The stocks are still slightly overvalued - however, it is normal for the industry. The most important thing to remember is that the future growth opportunity is real. Furthermore, the investors in this sector should always be ready for the wild swings in the price due to the volatility. However, I maintain my bullish stance for 3D Systems and believe that it will continue to grow in the long-term.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1995481,22775,2014-02-05T11:08:28-05:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has just pre-announced its Q4 and FY13 figures. Let's make it short: they are ugly. The company expects its non-GAAP FY13 EPS to be in a $0.83-$0.87 range, below its guidance of $0.93-$1.03 and consensus at $0.96. For FY14, 3D Systems expects revenue to be in a$680m-$720m range and non-GAAP EPS between $0.73 and $0.85, vs. $671.3m and $1.27 respectively for the Street.In its press release, 3D Systems explains that the earnings miss is mainly attributable to increased R&D spending and sales & marketing initiatives to sustain growth. The strategy makes sense … but also suggests that revenue growth is much costly than initially anticipated.We are also concerned that the entry into the consumer segment is starting to weigh on margins, relative to expectations. Gross margin was only flat in Q4, while it was slightly up in the previous quarter.In all, we stick to our view (see our previous SA article here) that 3D printing is a promising business … but that expectations have gone too far. We believe that we are still at an early stage of the EPS downward revision process for 3D Systems: some key patents are set to expire between 2014 and 2017, notably the laser sintering patent (owned by 3D Systems) which is due to expire in February 2014. This should spark pricing pressures across the industry as open-source hardware printers will be able to integrate laser sintering. Current competitors are likely to take this opportunity to offer much cheaper printers and new competitors are likely to emerge. In our view, the potential gross margin pressure stemming from this increasing competitive environment is not yet reflected in consensus forecasts.Against this backdrop, we view 3D Systems' valuation as unsustainable. Post warning, the stock (current price $57) is trading at roughly 70x its 2014 EPS. Even assuming 3D Systems gets back to 30% earnings growth trend, its valuation would compare badly to Google's: 20% EPS growth for a 2014 P/E of 22x, i.e. a PE/Growth slightly above 1x.In conclusion, we remain sellers of 3D Systems and printer makers and buyers of software vendors Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) and Dassault (OTCPK:DASTY).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2015031,22775,2014-02-12T13:31:23-05:00,,"Bulls vs. Bears. Huge market opportunity vs. overly optimistic consensus expectations and bubbly valuation. The debate has been intense in the last days as investors had to digest 3 warnings in a row from ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD).Valuing companies in a booming industry is always a difficult task. But in our view, a DCF (discounted cash flow) valuation is well suited to this kind of mission as it enables to capture the long-term potential (revenues and margins) of any company.Therefore, we have decided to perform a DCF valuation of 3D Systems, well actually 2 valuations (blue-sky scenario and bear case), to better assess how the current stock price compares to the bull and bear theses. Please note that we have used 3D Systems' non-GAAP figures which exclude non-cash items (even if the exclusion of some items, such as stock-based compensation expenses, could give rise to discussion) and that 2013 & 2014 figures are consensus forecasts.Blue-sky scenarioWe use a discount rate of 9.8% (with a beta of 1.2x, reflecting 3D System's higher risk compared to the stock market) and make the following assumptions:- Organic revenue growth accelerates to 35% in 2015-2017 (vs. around +30% organic in 2013-14) and then very gradually softens.- In 2023, 3D Systems generates more $7bn revenues (vs. $514m in 2013) and still delivers an impressive 25% revenue growth (i.e. close to the current level).- EBIT margin recovers sharply in 2015 and 2016 following the 2014 dip and then gradually improves.- In 2023, 3D Systems displays a 26% margin, and is therefore much more profitable than hardware makers (HP for instance has a margin slightly below 10%) and close to software makers' margin levels.- Growth rate in perpetuity is 3.5%, consistent with world GDP growth across different economic cycles.We get to a $83 valuation, or c.20% upside.Source: AtonRâ PartnersBear caseWe use a discount rate of 10.4% (with a slightly higher beta of 1.3x) and make the following assumptions:- Organic revenue growth accelerates to 30% over 2015-2016 and then gradually moderates as competition increases and as the technology matures (pricing pressures).- In 2023, 3D Systems generates more $4bn revenues (vs. $514m in 2013) and still delivers a comfortable 15% revenue growth.- EBIT margin slightly recovers to 19% in 2015-2016 and then gradually declines as pricing pressures hit gross margins.- In 2023, 3D Systems displays a 16% margin (roughly in line with the 2014 level), and is still more profitable than hardware makers …- Growth rate in perpetuity is 3%, slightly more conservative than in our blue-sky scenario.We get to a $26 valuation, or c.60% downside.Source: AtonRâ PartnersConclusionWe believe that the risk/reward is clearly not attractive for investors: a 20% upside in a blue-sky scenario is not sufficient in our view to offset the huge downside risk potential.Importantly, we believe that 3D Systems' momentum has turned negative for the first time in a while recently following several warnings in the sector and that the earnings downside risk is still high as competition is likely to heat up following patent expiries (see our recent article on this issue).We remain sellers of the stock. Anyway, if you want to test your own assumptions on 3D Systems (more bullish / bearish ones), leave a comment and we will run our DCF model for you.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1961491,58641,2014-01-23T03:44:39-05:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has been in decline since January 2 and it may continue to fall due to market anxiousness. However, a rebound before 2014 ends is highly probable. Despite its current stratospheric high Price/Earnings ratio of 191.41, I firmly believe that DDD still has enough potential to go higher than its current price of $88.26.3D Systems is the leader in additive manufacturing. It posted a 172.91% Year-To-Date increase last year in spite of the November sell-off. It has a healthy balance sheet and is not in danger of running out of cash soon. The short interest on DDD also showed a significant reduction of 10 million shares from October 2013 to December 2013. Several recent positive events convinced me that 3D Systems has not yet reached its peak.Based on my research, DDD shares are worth holding on to because the company has a big chance to rally again this year. My bullish sentiment on 3D Systems is due to the following reasons:1. The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) has teamed up with 3D Systems to produce printable edibles. This deal can usher in new markets for 3D printers. Mothers and daughters will try their best to come up with custom confectionery products for their own consumption, or for sale to others. This is a long-term proposition but it still ensures 3D Systems has an early lead in printing consumer food.2. Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) recently upgraded its popular Photoshop CC image editing program to make it compatible with 3D printing. Photoshop users are in the millions. I'm sure amateur and professional graphic artists will find ways to monetize the 3D printing update of Adobe Photoshop. Some of them will likely buy a Cube 3D printer for small-scale 3D printing.3. The new Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) RealSense 3D embedded camera for tablets, notebooks and laptops will help 3D scanning and printing become more accessible to consumers. Intel is on a mission to sell 40 to 60 million Bay Trail-T and Cherry Trail-T-powered tablets this year.The world's largest semiconductor company is bent on grabbing market share for its tablet chips from ARM-based products like the APPLE (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPad and Samsung Galaxy Tab. 3D Systems is one of the main beneficiaries of Intel's ambitious plan.Intel will be bundling 3D Systems' Sense 3D scanning and printing software with RealSense 3D cameras. RealSense 3D-equipped products will be available by the second half of 2014. Intel has signed up Lenovo, HP (NYSE: HPQ), Acer, Asus, Fujitsu, and Dell as OEM partners for 3D scanning-capable Windows 8 tablets and notebooks.4. The iSense accessory for the iPad also taps into a rich user base. Apple has sold more than 170 million units of the iPad since its original release in 2010. The iSense scanner attaches to the iPad and let people wave it around physical objects to create realistic 3D models.3D designs can further be edited or enhanced using the bundled software. iPad owners have the option of sending their 3D scans to Cubify.com for printing.5. The 3rd-Generation Cube 3 Home 3D printer is more affordable. This sub-$1,000 printer from 3D Systems will likely popularize 3D home printing. The Cube 3 is a Plug-n-Play 3D printer that offers multi-material and dual-color printing. It has a faster printing speed and an easier way of replacing 3D printing materials. Hobbyists and home-based entrepreneurs will be tempted to buy this cheap printer.6. Recent acquisitions show 3D Systems is also bent on expanding its revenue streams. The company recently purchased Gentle Giant Studios last January 3. Gentle Giant is a leading manufacturer of licensed 3D toys, movie characters, and collectibles. Its library of works includes characters from blockbuster Hollywood movies like Star Wars and Harry Potter. Gentle Giant also creates licensed collectibles from Marvel and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS).3D Systems also bought Village Plastics last December. The privately held company specializes in producing thermoplastic 3D printing filament. Village Plastic is an expert in producing custom extruded products.Lastly, 3D Systems acquired 3D ceramics printing specialist Figulo Corporation. These newly-acquired companies are all consumer-oriented. The deal with Intel and the release of the iSense accessory for the iPad plays also focuses on the individual, rather than the enterprise user.7. Revenue growth will likely continue to grow by double digits this year. 3D Systems' impressive 34.08% five-year average revenue growth performance might even improve as 3D printing becomes more popular with ordinary consumers.Credit Suisse estimates that the 3D printing industry has a Compounded Annual Growth Rate of 20-30%. By 2020, the 3D printing industry is projected to grow to $11 billion. For 2014, Credit Suisse estimates that the industry will gross around $3.8 to $4 billion.ConclusionKeep holding on to your DDD shares, 3D Systems has the momentum for exponential growth. The company has a high chance of posting another 30%++ increase in gross revenue this year. The deals with Hershey and Intel are solid tailwinds. The iSense provides a ready market, and the Cube 3 will help 3D printing get into more households.The high P/E and Price/Sales ratio of the company are justified by the recent positive developments I just enumerated above. Here's one more chart to convince you that 3D Systems is the best additive manufacturing company to bet on right now.Disclosure: I am long INTC, .

1961441,22775,2014-01-23T02:57:43-05:00,,"3D printing is a great technology and we are confident that 3D printers will deliver on volume expectations. But the expiration of key patents from 2014 onwards is likely to spark increased competition and to pressure ASPs (average selling prices) and gross margins of the 3D industry leader, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). We believe that the earnings downside risk is not reflected in consensus expectations and stock valuation, making 3D Systems the perfect candidate for a sell-off. In our view, it's time to switch into safer plays, such as Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), to play the 3D printing revolution.ExOne and Stratasys disappointAs we all know, the figures reported last week in the 3D printing space were not really supportive: ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) warned on Q4 revenues due to delayed orders, and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) announced a slightly light 2014 EPS guidance ($2.15-2.25 vs. consensus $2.33) despite a solid revenue outlook (+40%, $670m at midpoint vs. consensus $656m). In our view, the figures themselves were not specifically worrying:1/ ExOne talked about delayed (not cancelled) orders and the read-across for 3D Systems and peers from this report is limited as ExOne is still a small player in the 3D industry with pretty high order and revenue volatility on a quarterly basis.2/ Stratasys slightly missed on earnings as the company decided to increase investments in sales & marketing and R&D in order to sustain growth. But importantly, the company did not disappoint on the top line, suggesting that end-demand remains healthy.The Wall Street reaction (sharp declines for both stocks) was more worrying in our view. It suggests that consensus expectations now stand very high (revenue growth guidance of 40% does not impress anybody), that 3D printing stocks are priced for perfection… and potentially that some investors got blinded by the prospects of this technology.Against this backdrop, we view the coming patent expiries as a significant threat to 3D Systems stock price.Bright future for the 3D printing industry but significant patent risk ahead for 3D SystemsIt's no secret that the 3D printing industry has a bright future. McKinsey forecasts that $11trillion or 15% of goods worldwide will be produced by additive manufacturing (3D printing) by 2025 (you can download the full report here), and estimates the economic impact of this ""disruptive technology"" between $230bn and $550bn a year, vs. $3.4bn today!Despite this healthy demand outlook, there are reasons to be concerned about the revenue and margin outlook of 3D Systems: some key patents are set to expire between 2014 and 2017, notably the laser Sintering patent (owned by 3D Systems) which is due to expire in February 2014.This should spark pricing pressures across the industry as open-source hardware printers will be able to integrate laser sintering. Current competitors are likely to take this opportunity to offer much cheaper printers and new competitors are likely to emerge:- Mainly, Chinese manufacturers offering cheap printers- But also, unexpected players such as Groupe Gorge (OTC:GGRGY), a French company which was not active at all in 3D printing until recently- Some large end-customers such as GE Aviation also plan to develop in-house 3D printers and technologies to suit their specific needsPotential gross margin pressure not reflected in consensus forecastsIn all, the laser sintering patent expiry could act as a wake-up call for investors who tend to overlook the patent risk. We believe that the ASP of printers is likely to fall sharply from H2 2014 onwards, suggesting significant pressure on gross margins going ahead: prices go down, but costs remain high due to continued marketing and R&D efforts as illustrated by the Stratasys warning.In our view, this is not factored in consensus expectations: analysts expects 3D Systems to grow revenues by 31% in 2014 and 29% in 2015... and to grow EPS by 34% and 32% respectively (see Bloomberg data below).Even if 3D Systems delivers on revenue growth expectations, we struggle to understand how EPS will grow faster. And importantly, the valuation (2014 PE of 69x) does not leave room for error.Switch out from 3D Systems into design software stocksThere is a safer way to play the 3D printing revolution in our view: design software makers such as Autodesk and Dassault Systemes (OTCPK:DASTY). Both companies will be key beneficiaries of the 3D printing take-off: as the installed base of printers grows significantly, the scalability of the software model will offer huge EPS growth going forward. And they offer much more decent valuation levels (31x 2014 earnings on average) and earnings growth expectations (leaving room for upside).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

As an investor who likes to use 'a business mindset' to analyze stocks, I want to share my thoughts on 3D Systems' future prospects and its intrinsic value, so investors would have an idea of when it might be a good time to buy or stay away from the stock.Company Overview3D Systems is a leading maker and service provider of 3D printers, print materials, on-demand parts and 3D printing services for professionals, manufacturers and consumers. The company pioneered 3D printing over 25 years ago, and the founder, Charles W. Hull (Chief Technology Officer), invented stereolithography, which is the technology behind 3D printing. Today, the company makes all kinds of 3D printers, print materials, on-demand custom parts, scanners and software. These solutions allow users to design their products and print them as prototypes and moving parts more rapidly and cost-effectively than through the traditional manufacturing process. Users can print toys, shoes, moving parts for cars, models, tools, hearing aids, food, etc. The materials that can be used for 3D printing include thermoplastics, metals, ceramics, and edible sugar.As of Q3 2013, the company earned most of its revenues from the sale of 3D printers, print materials and related services. In terms of revenue by geography, the company earned 54.9% of its revenues from the U.S., 24.1% from Europe and 21% from Asia-Pacific.Future Growth and ProspectsI believe that 3D Systems has enormous growth opportunities in the professional and consumer markets as 3D printers become more popular, practical and affordable. The company has been growing rapidly in the past 5 years through acquisitions as well as organic growth. For example, for the first nine months of 2013, its total revenue grew 42.3% compared to the same period of last year. And in the past five years, its total revenue grew between 40 to 55% each year (see below image), except in 2009 when the company was still recovering from the 2008 recession.(Source: 2012 Annual Report)While 3D printers are largely used by designers and professionals, 3D Systems is creating 3D printers such as the Cube-series that are tailored to consumers. I believe that the 3D printing industry is still in its early stages-even though the technology has been around for over 25 years-and 3D printers will eventually be used by most consumers like our existing printers. ""The question in my mind is not 'Will we have a 3D printer in each home?' but 'Which room will it be in?'"" said Avi Reichental, the CEO of 3D Systems. ""Will it be in your garage? Will it be in your kids' room, or the man cave... Or the wardrobe?"" (Source: 3D Systems Investors)Intrinsic ValuationAt the time of writing, I believe 3D Systems' current stock price of $91.58 per share or $9.4 billion in market cap is largely overvalued. Based on my estimate, its intrinsic value should be somewhere between $51.8 and $73.3 per share (or between $5.3 billion and $7.5 billion in market cap). I used a Discounted Cash Flow model to estimate the company's intrinsic value. In addition, I used the company's cash flow from operations instead of free cash flow because the company is still in its early growth stage and because its free cash flow has not been consistent in the past few years.I estimated 3D Systems' intrinsic value in three scenarios: Fair, Conservative, and Optimistic Valuation.At this moment, I believe that the fair valuation scenario is most probable where 3D Systems' current intrinsic value should be around $73.3 per share or $7.5 billion in market cap. This means that the company's current stock price is traded a large premium and that investors expect the company's revenue and profit will grow by at least 40% each year in the next five to ten years to justify its current market cap of $9.4 billion.The Bottom LineBased on 3D Systems' business and growth prospects, I believe it is a great mid-cap stock for long-term investing. However, its current stock price is traded at a large premium and I would suggest waiting for the stock to drop below $73.3 per share or $7.5 billion in market cap before buying it, because that would allow for a better margin of safety.If you like this article, please check out my Newsletter where I publish my monthly stock picks that can help investors outperform the market.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1958161,44981,2014-01-21T17:43:50-05:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) had a blockbuster year and the stock went up over 100%. The 3D printing space is extremely exciting as the companies come up with something new almost every day. The technology is getting wider acceptance on the domestic as well as industrial level and the 3D printing companies continue to show stellar growth.DDD data by YChartsNew Products3D Systems has continued its tradition of coming up with new products and it has introduced its new 3D printer series, ChefJet. The 3D printer is capable of printing edible substances out of sugar in the user's desired shape designed through its application, the ""Digital Cookbook"". Its advanced version, ChefJet Pro, is bigger in size as compared to ChefJet but is capable of full color printing of edible sugar. A few other companies have come up with similar idea in the recent past. This includes NASA, which is designing Pizza printing for its space programs. Furthermore, simple sugar printing has been used to develop vasculatures as 3D printed organs for experimental purposes. With the launch of this new series, the company is looking to capture a small niche - we are already seeing small candy stores offering custom made candies and other confectioneries. This new line of products will go a long way in fulfilling the need of this niche and support the future revenue growth of 3D systems.Partnership with Hershey'sAs I mentioned above, the industrial use of the 3D printing technology is increasing and manufacturers are adopting this technology. Hershey's (NYSE:HSY) is the latest manufacturer to strike a partnership with 3D Systems to produce chocolate and Candies in innovative ways. This segment of the market has substantial untapped potential as 3D printing will give Hershey's considerable flexibility in production. Hershey's is a $22 billion dollar company and the largest chocolate manufacturer in United States. The company last reported $6.6 billion of annual revenue and $660 million of net profit selling chocolates and a few other products. The details of the partnership have not been disclosed; however, it looks like the company is targeting the food industry and this partnership is certainly a massive success for its future plans.The ChefJet series cost $5,000 dollars while ChefJet Pro printers cost $10,000. This means that would mostly be used by professionals in the edible industry. Besides chocolates, it could be used in the toppings of different edibles like cake. It could be used to shape candies for thousands of candy manufacturing companies out there. $10,000 might look a substantial investment for a small business like a candy shop - however, it will be a long-term investment and generate substantial revenues. In addition, the printer will allow the vendor to have more operational flexibility and efficiency, which might result in lower operating costs. Above all, a 3D printer in the shop can bring competitive advantage to the business, and in this business, competitive advantage would be differentiation and innovation.Acquisition of Xerox3D Systems recently acquired the solid Ink engineering and development teams of Xerox for a sum of $32.5 million. This includes 100 Xerox contractors and engineers to step into the research and development of 3D Systems. Xerox is widely known for 2D printing but the company is involved in research to find out how to print electronic circuits. The Solid Ink printers could be used on wide scale for making prototypes and designing new product shapes. This way research and development departments of many organizations would save their time and costs by using this solid printing. It would also allow them to make their products even more accurate to their expectations and make as many adjustments as they want with absolutely no difficulty.ConclusionI have been extremely positive about the prospects of the 3D printing industry and I have maintained in my previous articles that most of the 3D printing companies will prove to be solid investment in the long-term. 3D printing industry has come a long way over the past two years. The recent deals by 3D Systems indicate that the company is ready to explore another untapped opportunity, which should result in further revenue growth. The company is already doing well in the consumers, industrial and medical applications segment.Furthermore, 3D Systems have also partnered with Samsung (OTC:SSNGY) to demonstrate an app for the Galaxy Note 3 - the app can make custom inserts for the Galaxy Note 3 cases. Recent developments indicate that the company is on track to continue its impressive growth and the industry is showing no signs of decline in growth. In fact, the growth seems to be picking up as more and more manufacturers are adopting 3D printing.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1939131,22148,2014-01-10T13:09:46-05:00,,"The combination of 3D printing projected to grow annually at 20% and the substantial stock gains in 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) should already concern longs. The sector is undoubtedly hot and growing sharply, but new investors are paying up front for years of 30% growth long into the future.3D Systems is a leading provider of 3D printers, print materials, and on-demand customer parts for professionals and consumers. The company has a market value approaching $10 billion, but revenue is only set to reach $515 million in 2013. Even more concerning is the stock price sitting near $100 and earnings per share likely to not even reach a $1. The stock has even gained so much in the last few months that the chart below even shows it out of touch with fellow competitor Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS).New Report Suggests Steady GrowthThe key takeaway from a new industry report is that the 3D printing sector is likely to continue growing at a 20% annual growth rate. Industry experts Wholers and Associates continuously list the growth rate closer to the mid-20% range, but the importance is the rate of change in the forecast. In the table below, Freedonia continues to forecast roughly the same growth through 2017 that occurred in the previous six years.Scary ChartWith the 3D printing industry growing roughly at the same rate with no change in expectations, than the stocks in the industry should contain some level of consistent valuation multiples. In essence, the stock should gain relatively at the same rate as the industry give or take a few points depending on market share gains. In the case of 3D Systems, the company itself lists 30% organic growth in the latest quarter while analysts forecast 29% revenue growth for 2014.Those numbers are both solid and suggestive of a stock that would gain roughly 30% in a given year and not the 800% gains over the last two years. Well that's where the market has gotten carried away. The below chart highlights the scary and somewhat parabolic move in the enterprise valuation multiple of revenues. In a normal stock, the blue multiple on the chart would mostly trade sideways with a possible shift upwards from a multiple of 3x to 6x, but it should never go parabolic and increase from nearly 5x at the start of 2012 to reach 20x currently. This type of chart is a clear sign that investors are overpaying for current growth and in fact paying for years of growth to come.DDD EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsInvestors need to remember that this chart highlights the excessive gains in the stock. Considering it factors in the revenue growth into the multiple, it shows a stock out of touch with reality. Do investors really expect the EV to reach a 25 or 30 multiple of revenue?ConclusionThe parabolic nature of the chart should scare investors. 3D Systems needs three years of 30% revenue growth and zero stock gains in order to get the EV multiple of revenue back down to a still elevated 10x. Even more concerning for 3D Systems investors is that the ratio is now so far ahead of primary competitor Stratasys. If anything, Stratasys is the better value now, though the likely outcome is 3D Systems coming back to Earth with Stratasys remaining grounded at these levels.The 3D printing industry remains in a fantastic bull mode, but investments typically don't end well at these lofty multiple.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1938761,40031,2014-01-10T10:37:29-05:00,,"Shares of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) have risen 161% in 2013, and the potential for a further increase in share price is still there. The latest move of the stock price was accompanied by a meaningful reduction in short interest, which has decreased by more than 10 million shares in less than two months. I believe that the short-squeeze is near its end, and that the share price will not rise as fast as it did in the last couple of months, but there are three main reasons I am still bullish on the prospects for 3D Systems, and the whole 3D printing group: growth acceleration, innovation and acquisitions.1. Growth accelerationThe acceleration in revenue growth was in my opinion the main reason for the sharp rise in the share price. Revenue growth accelerated from 31% in Q1 2013 to 44.5% and 49.9% in Q2 and Q3, and the fourth quarter expectations are for a 53.4% increase in revenue. Strong growth in revenue is a result of stronger growth in the consumer segment (which was a cause of concern prior to the earnings announcement) and an aggressive acquisition policy. Another area of strength is the new metal printing segment, and management was very excited about the potential demand in this business segment. On the earnings side, the company is delivering and guiding lower, but for a good reason. It has increased spending in order to take advantage of rising demand and the overall interest in 3D printing.However, the accelerated growth and a substantial increase in share price have brought the stock's valuation to nosebleed levels. 3D Systems' price to sales ratio is close to 21, as opposed to Stratasys' (NASDAQ:SSYS) P/S ratio of 15. With current consensus estimates and a same share price by the end of 2015, the P/S ratio of 3D Systems could go down to 12 in two years, which is still a quite high number. However, analysts are expecting 3D Systems' revenue to grow 29% in 2014 and 2015, and we could see revenue growth much higher as the technology continues to improve and demand increases. I believe that the first quarter results and FY2014 revenue guidance for both 3D Systems and Stratasys will be crucial for the 3D printing industry in the next couple of months. If they provide full-year revenue guidance at least 10% above analyst estimates, it might be sufficient for a further increase in share price.2. Innovation3D Systems has introduced numerous products and initiatives last year, and is expected to keep pushing out new products and services this year. The latest new products and services include:- New iSense 3D scanner, which was displayed for the first time at the 2014 International CES in Las Vegas. iSense is the new consumer scanner for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad. iSense can be used on anything and the user doesn't need to stand still or place an object into a box as required with other 3D scanners.- Third generation of its popular home 3D printer, Cube(R) 3, the first plug & play consumer 3D printer with a price tag under $1,000. The new Cube printer is faster with simultaneous multi-material and dual-color printing, has high-definition 75-micron layer thinness for finer-res prints and instant material loading that is easier than changing an ink cartridge.- New CubePro 3D printer, ""the only simultaneous triple-color, multi-materials, large capacity, prosumer printer available today"". The new CubePro was displayed at CES in Las Vegas.- New CubeJet 3D printer, priced under $5,000. CubeJet delivers full-color, high-resolution parts for a wide range of modeling and real-use products, and is designed for small businesses, entrepreneurs, hobbyists and educators.- Cubify® 2.0, a comprehensive consumer destination for 3D printer enthusiasts. Cubify.com is a platform that enables hosting, publishing and production of large scale branded and licensed 3D printable content. Cubify should increase the adoption and demand for 3D printing in the consumer segment.- 3D Systems announced a collaboration with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) to mainstream the adoption of 3D scanning and 3D printing. Intel's 3D camera enables scanning capabilities for creating 3D models directly from a tablet or computer.This is just a small part of the latest announcements that are aimed at increasing the adoption of 3D printing. New products and initiatives will certainly have a meaningful impact on the future revenue stream.3. Acquisitions3D Systems is the most aggressive company in the industry, with numerous acquisitions in the last couple of years. Last year's Phenix acquisition is important for the company, since it brought the expertise of Phenix in metals printing, which is an important potential market.In December, 3D Systems acquired a portion of Xerox's Oregon product design, engineering and chemistry group and related assets for $32.5 million in cash. The agreement is designed to leverage both companies' 3D printing capabilities to accelerate growth and maintain leadership positions. 3D Systems and Xerox already have 15 years of collaboration, which produced 3D Systems' best selling ProJet series 3D printers.3D Systems also made two smaller acquisitions in December and one in January. Figulo corporation and Village Plastics were acquired in December 2013, while Gentle Giant Studios was acquired in early January 2014. All three acquisitions are consumer-orientated.While there are integration risks, 3D Systems has done a great job of integrating the acquired companies. Acquisitions are and will continue to be an important component of 3D Systems' future growth.RisksIn my last article on 3D Systems, I wrote about the short-term concerns for the company. The main cause for concern was the parabolic move and high-volume selloff in November. The other concern is the decoupling of 3D Systems' and Stratasys' valuation, in terms of their respective P/S ratios. 3D Systems' share price remains extended at the time of writing, and it is trading at a 30% premium over Stratasys' P/S ratio. The market has ignored the valuation concerns, but it was certainly helped by a massive short-squeeze in the last two months.Source: Stockcharts.comHowever, the main risk is the expected slowing down of revenue growth this year. The market is counting on continued strong growth, and guidance for 30% revenue growth in 2014 (which would correspond to current consensus estimates) would be a huge disappointment.Conclusion3D Systems had a great year in 2013, and the company stands to benefit in 2014. Accelerated revenue growth, new products and services and future acquisitions are the fuel that might keep the share price rising this year. Fourth quarter earnings and FY2014 guidance will be crucial for the company and the 3D printing group in the next couple of months, and will determine the price direction for the rest of the year, notwithstanding a negative macro event.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1922161,56922,2013-12-31T01:58:10-05:00,,"Voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET) was the target of the short sellers in the recent past, this impacted the valuation trends in late November and the company is still struggling to regain share price momentum currently associated to 3D printing industry. The company's CFO commented recently that Voxeljet is not currently focused on the share price. But the market normally factors share price trends in the investment decisions. One might say that this is worrysome news for the company but as we mentioned in the previous report that Voxeljet is susceptible to takeover and some current developments points toward Voxel merger or a friendly takeover by a large 3D printing company i.e. 3D Systems . This renders the historic share price performance of Voxeljet irrelevant to the decision of investment in Voxeljet. Rather the acquisitive potential of the company make it a viable investment opportunity. The following analysis will cover the acquisitive potential, financial feasibility of acquisition and the synergic benefits associated with the merger if it goes through.Pointers toward Voxel acquisition:The 3D industry as a whole is going through a consolidation phase. Both 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) are pursing aggressive acquisition strategies to capture the anticipated high growth market. This makes smaller companies a target for acquisition and hence Voxeljet is a candidate for acquisition.There is one significant development which causes us to believe that Voxeljet is on the verge on being acquired by 3D Sytems; one of the big players of the 3D printing industry. Here goes, 3D Sytems website is displaying Voxeljet VX1000 and VX500 in its product section with production printers. The printers are named as casting printers and the information source is Voxeljet website. This is an interesting development as it indicative of relation between the both companies.This is a snapshot of 3D Systems production printer page on the website. This clearly mentions Voxeljet in the subheadings. This could mean that 3D is interested in acquiring Voxel or it could be entering in a partnership with Voxeljet. Either Way, the valuation will be affected.Voxeljet shares are trading on a low side when compared to other 3D printing companies. This also makes Voxel an acquisition target. 3D Systems may be thinking of sealing the deal when the shares on a low side and can get a better deal. Furthermore, the silica based material offered by Voxeljet could be another reason for 3D Systems' potential interest in Voxeljet.The above mentioned details make us believe that Voxel will be acquired by 3DSystems and once it does it would benefit 3D Systems, Voxeljet and specifically the stock holders of Voxeljet. The stock of 3D will not be affected much because it is already trading on a premium when compared to its future prospects.Synergy:The acquisition of Voxeljet can bring synergic benefits to the whole group (i.e. formed after the acquisition). The main synergies are outlined below.Capacity and speed:Voxeljet is famous for the build capacity of its industrial printers. The VX4000 has a build capacity of 4m×2m×1m while 3DSystem currently offers a build capacity of 1.5m×0.75m×0.55m. On the other hand the print speeds of 3DS printer in impressive. These two feature combined together will substantially reduce the printing time and hence a distinguished competitive advantage for the group.The silica advantage:Voxeljet offers a Silica based material which has a good bending strength and can be used to cat metals as such as aluminum, magnesium, cast iron and steel casting. According to Voxeljet ""Today, 3D printing is used in conventional applications and all other situations that require the rapid and efficient production of sand molds - whether for architecture, restorations, aviation and aerospace or the production of designer furniture"". The company generates around 50% of its revenue through services including the casting moulds services. This means that the services revenue could be increased to the printer sales revenue if appropriately used. By acquiring Voxeljet, 3D Systems can use the casting expertise thereby increasing its service revenue which is currently a low proportion of the total revenue of 3D. The main reason 3D might be interested in Voxel is its ability to make casting equipment using sand i.e. inorganic material because it open doors for services revenue growth. The company is displaying Voxeljet's printer as ""printers for casting patterns"" indicating that 3D sees value in Voxel's sand material and casting abilities.Technology and reach expansion:Acquisition of Voxeljet means gaining access to 170 US and international patents and patents applications. The company's Powder binding AM technology would also expand the technology base of the 3D Systems and in fact benefit the whole group. On the other hand, With Voxeljet, 3DS will have a better access to the European markets and will be well positioned to grow in the Europe if 3D printing grows there. Furthermore, 3DS will also benefit from the Voxel's position in the automotive and film industry of US. All in all, this potential acquisition will enhance the technology portfolio and the geographic and multi industrial reach of 3DSystems.Financial feasibility:The acquisition of Voxeljet will require funds. We will now analyze the value of the Voxeljet and the 3D's ability to arrange those funds in order to acquire Voxeljet.Value of Voxeljet:In stock terms:The shares of the company are trading in the range of $32-$37. The market cap of the company is around $356 million. So, an open market bid around $400 million for 100% stock will tempt the investor to sell the stock and 3D would gain a controlling share. But, this scenario is remote as 3D Systems is displaying Voxel's printer on its website. There seems to be an understanding between the management of both the companies. So a more likely valuation will be based on the enterprise value of the company. The Value of the company using the Enterprise value approach is calculated below:*The MV given in the latest quarterly reportIn asset terms:The company has around $20 million of assets. This excludes the current IPO net proceeds. Incorporating the IPO's proceeds translate to asset balance of around $80 million. Even if a premium of 25% is paid to acquire the assets of voxel. The value would be around $100 million. The company does not have significant intangible assets on the balance sheet hence higher premium for technology cannot be incorporated in the calculation.Based on above two calculations, we believe that 3DSystem will be able to seal a deal at a price tag ranging $250-300 million.3D Systems financial ability:3D has a cash balance of around $345 million. The company also generates OCF (average) of around $39 million per annum. It would not be possible for 3DSystems to pay the consideration for the acquisition wholly by cash without a credit bridging facility or a financing arrangement because paying $300 million in cash would bring the Current ratio below 1 resulting in working capital problems. So full cash payment is not feasible. However, the purchase is still financially feasible because 3D can offer consideration part in cash and part in stock offerings to the existing shareholders of the Voxeljet. So, the bottom line is 3D can manage the acquisition.   Conclusion:The acquisition of Voxeljet is in the cards for 3D Systems and this consolidation would further consolidate the 3D printing industry. The acquisition will bring synergic benefits especially capacity, speed and casting ability to the 3D systems. It will also enhance the reach of 3D Systems and the services segment will be able to generate a larger share of the revenue of the company. The acquisition, if goes through, will further strengthen the industry printing position of the company relative to Stratasys. With this acquisition, 3D Systems will emerge as the leader in industrial 3D printing. As far as Voxeljet is concerned the investor will get value for their money by acquiring cash and stock interest in 3D systems. So, both the Voxeljet and 3D Systems are a strong buy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1907771,56202,2013-12-19T12:49:03-05:00,,"3D printing companies have defied gravity, and their shares have appreciated considerably over the last few weeks. Out the few players in this industry, only 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) are the ones which generate a significant amount of revenue and possess a great chance of returning value in the long run.However, I think that investors should pick 3D Systems over Stratasys in order to benefit the most from 3D printing. While shares of both companies have appreciated considerably this year, 3D Systems is the clear winner. Moving forward, I expect 3D Systems to outperform Stratasys. Let's take a look at the reasons.Industrial printing3D Systems has strong prospects, and it expects to generate nearly $500 million in revenue this year, with sales to the industrial sector accounting for the majority of its revenue. 3D Systems possess a long list of customers that will help it to outperform Stratasys. Out of all the clients, General Electric (NYSE:GE) interests me the most.Last year, when General Electric announced the acquisition of Morris Technology, it was widely assumed that the company would jump into the additive manufacturing industry, posing a threat to the existing companies. However, when GE announced that 3D printing will account for nearly 50% of its manufacturing, it became a growth driver for the 3D printing business.Presently, less than 10% of General Electric's manufactured products use 3D printing. With annual sales of roughly $150 billion, half of GE's industrial output would be an enormous growth driver for 3D printing companies, and given that GE is already a customer of 3D Systems, it may benefit the most from this opportunity.Moreover, in order to dominate the industrial sector, a company will have to develop printers that print materials like metal at a fast rate. 3D Systems may have already jumped ahead of Stratasys by acquiring Phenix Systems, a leading global provider of Direct Metal Selective Laser Sintering 3D Printers based in Riom, France. The company also recently completed the acquisition of Village Plastics.3D printing is expected to evolve into the next generation technology for industrial manufacturing. According to IDC, 3D printing is moving toward mainstream adoption, and 3D Systems look set to capitalize on this growth opportunity, considering its recent moves.The consumer segmentThough the industrial segment holds the key to success for any 3D printing company, the consumer segment will also play a key part. Up until a few weeks ago, the competition between 3D Systems and Stratasys was pretty cold. 3D Systems only had the Cube and CubeX printers, while Stratasys was making its presence felt by acquisition of MakerBot. This acquisition gave Stratasys an upper hand over 3D Systems in the consumer segment, as it unveiled a highly user-friendly and economical 3D scanner called Digitizer.However, now it looks like 3D Systems has blown Stratasys out of the water and has been making some interesting moves to cement its presence in the consumer segment. Firstly, 3D Systems has added Seiko-I Infotech and Synnex Corporation to its list of global sellers to boost sales of its 3D printers. The company also struck up a deal with Sindho Ink to distribute the Cube and CubeX printers in South Korea.Moving on, the company recently unveiled a new 3D scanner called Sense. Sense is priced at only $399 and this could well prove to be a game changer for 3D Systems as it is a lot cheaper than Stratasys' Digitizer.Lastly, 3D Systems recently completed the acquisition of Village Plastics, a manufacturer of 3D printing filaments. Village Plastics is one of the leading manufacturers of 3D printing materials, including ABS, PLA, and HIPS. 3D Systems stated that it plans toThe company also said it would continue to support all of Village Plastics' existing customers.ConclusionThe opportunity in 3D printing is sizable, and these two companies have been making some interesting moves to gain ground over one another. However, 3D Systems has been winning the battle so far. The company is profitable and has been making acquisitions to strengthen its market share. It is moving into the consumer market with Cube, and analysts expect robust earnings growth in the future.Also, Stratasys' earnings are expected to grow at a CAGR of 10% over the next five years, which is way behind 3D Systems' projected rate of almost 25%. Hence, I believe that 3D Systems is the better pick of the two if you're looking to benefit from the growth of 3D printing.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1905671,56922,2013-12-18T13:39:54-05:00,,"3D is A Safe Bet in a Volatile Industry3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), a 3D printing company, has the potential to revolutionize the manufacturing process in the long term. Currently, the main market for 3D printing is prototyping. Consumer printing holds growth prospects for the companies in the 3D printing industry. However, the most potent growth factor in the long term will be the ability to print in a cost effective and time efficient method. Speed of printing is the major barrier for the mass production of different objects.Shares of 3D Systems are trading at almost three times higher than its growth prospects. PEG ratio is around 3.5x which means that investors are paying 3 times the growth factor of the company. In my recent update on 3D Systems, I advised investors to stay clear of any IBM buyout rumors but still buy the stock for its 3D industry leadership. Since then the shares have appreciated approximately 15% despite the negative sentiment surrounding 3D stocks such as Organovo (NASDAQ:ONVO), Voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET), and others. The company has made a few very interesting moves in the last couple of weeks and has further cemented itself as the safest 3D player in the market.Acquisitions3D Systems was recently involved in the acquisition of two rather small companies; Village Plastics and Figulo Corporation.Village Plastics is focused on filament based materials including 3D printing of those materials. Its portfolio includes ABS, PLA and HIPS 3D printing material. Village Plastics Co. is a family operated business dedicated to exceeding customers' expectations.3D Systems ""plans to immediately integrate Village Plastics' materials and manufacturing technologies to accelerate the development of advanced filament-based materials for its growing Cube® and CubeX™ 3D printers"". Moreover, Village Plastics' existing customers will be ""provided full access to [3D Systems'] complete portfolio of design-to-manufacturing products and services"". The company will gain synergistic benefits as the filament materials experience would complement the print offerings of 3D Systems. ""Village Plastics brings significant filament-based material development know-how and large scale manufacturing expertise that are vitally important to our Cube 3D printer consumer and prosumer growth initiatives,"" said Avi Reichental, President and CEO, 3D Systems. ""With the Village team on board, we expect to be able to enhance the profitability of this growing category and fast track the delivery of new high-performance filament-based products for the benefit of our users worldwide.""Figulo Corporation is a provider of 3D printed ceramics to a wide range of customers including artists, designers and architects. The company offers ceramic products including tableware, kitchenware, tiles and bathroom ceramics. 3D Systems plans to ""immediately integrate Figulo's 3D printed ceramics into its Cubify® ecosystem and its professional cloud printing service, Quickparts®, and to leverage Figulo's considerable ceramics materials and process knowledge to enhance the commercialization of its own line of end-user ceramic 3D printers for home décor labels, pottery shops, artists and hobbyists."" The cloud based ceramic manufacturing model will enhance the 3D printing ecosystem of 3D Systems. ""With Figulo on board, we are enhancing both our Cubify and Quickparts capabilities and significantly expanding our materials and process expertise and know-how to fast track the commercialization of ceramic 3D printers,"" said Reichental.By going through the details of the acquisitions it is relatively clear that 3DSystems is trying to address the consumer printing market along with its prototyping business. These two acquisitions are a positive move as both Village Plastics and Figulo will enrich the material base of 3D Systems. Figulo brings the added advantage of ecosystem enhancement, i.e. the cloud based printing model. The ceramic décor business is a good acquisition because it has growth potential as far as consumer printing is concerned. The consumer printers of 3D Systems are ranked among the top 3D consumer printers. Hence, the move to focus on consumer printing is sensible and 3D Systems will benefit from the growth in consumer printing in the coming years.EuroMold 20133D Systems unveiled its new products at EuroMold 2013 held in Frankfurt, Germany. The company introduced 12 new products including two new production 3D printers; ProX™ 500 and ProX™ 950 SLA System. The latter is amongst the largest and fastest 3D printers available today.The company also launched ProJet 4500 which creates full-color, durable plastic parts and ProJet 550X, a multi material 3D printer.The launch of ProJet® 1200 is worth mentioning. Tagged with a $4900 price, it is targeted towards professionals like dentists, jewelers and electronic components makers. This printer uses 3D Systems' new VisiJet® FTX Green material (a durable and rigid material that is tailored for plastic prototyping and casting patterns) making it ideal for jewelers, dental labs, and designers of very small detail products such as collectibles and electronic component parts.The GeoMagic capture and the consumer oriented Sense 3D scanner will also assist the company in improving its printing ecosystem. Consumers and professionals will upload models by scanning and a whole wide range of models will become available on the 3D cloud.Overall, the EuroMold offerings further strengthened the portfolio of 3D Systems.Bottom Line3D Systems is turning its attention towards consumer printing, as the recent acquisitions indicate. Consumer printing has growth potential and the company is moving in the right direction by entering into ceramics along with the filament materials business. Cubify is already in the market's spotlight. Any favorable growth conditions in consumer printing will directly benefit 3D Systems as it is well positioned to compete with MakeBot, Stratasys' (NASDAQ:SSYS) consumer printing business. In our opinion, the recent acquisitions by 3D Systems make it an even stronger candidate in the consumer printing market. On the commercial front, the company offers a wide range of products including products differentiated form its competitors. Therefore, I believe the 3D industry is growing and 3D Systems will capitalize on that growth and will continue to witness improving valuations. The biggest hurdle for entire industry is the speed of 3D printing and cost of materials; with its rich patent portfolio, 3D Systems is best placed to break that barrier.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1907331,23810,2013-12-19T10:40:48-05:00,,"Welcome to the deepest dive into the 3D printing sector, what the different business models are all about, and how a fair value for shares can be calculated in this hot technology space. It is important to understand the difference between all of the companies involved in this area in order to separate the firms with real potential from the pretenders that are simply riding the coattails of the others. In recent weeks, we have witnessed several companies' stock prices soar by being mentioned as players in this technology, even with no real products or revenue to show. We need to look into the various technologies and product holdings and analyze each of those individually, then analyze how it pertains to a portfolio for the future and the potential of those businesses.We hope that potential investors are presented with a thorough and comprehensive view of the 3D printing sector, and at the end, can look at the facts presented and the insightful research in order to support our decision to buy or sell shares in the various companies examined. The discussion begins with an overview of the 3D printing technology and the different businesses and potential products being developed.What is 3D Printing and the History Behind the Technology?The 3D printing technology began in 1986, but did not gain importance until 1990. It has traditionally not been popular outside the world of engineering, architecture and manufacturing and is still in the very early stages of applications to multiple industries.3D printing is also known as desktop fabrication. For creating an object, you need a digital 3D model. You can scan a set of 3D images, or draw it using computer-assisted design or CAD software. The digital 3D model is usually saved in STL format and then sent to the printer. The process of ""printing"" a three-dimensional object layer-by-layer with equipment is quite similar with ink-jet printers, and we believe this is the most difficult aspect of the technology that those not familiar with it have trouble visualizing it.Nowadays, almost everything from aerospace components to toys are being built with the help of 3D printers. Potentially, one of the most important applications of 3D printing is in the medical industry. With 3D printing, parts of a patient's body can literally be built cell by cell. 3D printing can provide great savings on assembly costs because it can print already assembled products, and that is why this is such a disruptive technology to multiple industries. 3D printing is going to impact so many industries, such as automotive, medical, business & industrial equipment, education, architecture, and consumer-product industries. Many different materials can be used for 3D printing, such as plastic, polyamide (nylon), glass filled polyamide, stereolithography materials (epoxy resins), silver, titanium, steel, and wax.Companies Involved or Mentioned in 3D Printing Recently - Separating Players from PretendersAs of late, many new companies have emerged in this space, and investors are having difficulty separating the true players from the posers. The stocks of all of these companies have been extremely volatile lately, and understanding each company, its technology and the supporting fundamentals, are key when making an investment decision in this space. Expect some ups and downs in the short term, but long term, 3D printing will provide investors great returns, as long as investment are evaluated wisely and not based on hearsay.3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) - 3D Systems Corporation develops, manufactures and markets 3D printers, print materials, on-demand custom parts services, and 3D authoring solutions for professionals and consumers.

The company's 3D bioprinting technology works across various tissue and cell types, and allows for the placement of cells in the human body. It offers the NovoGen MMX Bioprinter, a commercial hardware and software bioprinter platform to create tissues for research and development. It is another early stage company with what sounds like a great technology. The company recently filed for a secondary share offering. Investors should wait and see as this company develops the technology and begins to generate more revenue. Organovo's market cap is currently $721.78 Million.Camtek Ltd. (NASDAQ:CAMT) - Camtek designs, develops, manufactures, and markets automatic optical inspection [AOI] systems and related products. AOI systems are computerized systems that optically inspect various types of electronic product components for defects caused during the manufacturing process. The company recently clarified exactly how involved the firm is with 3D printing by saying:This is an extremely early stage product with no proven results. A very speculative play in the 3D printing space that had its 15 minutes of fame when it was heavily covered for about a one week period. CAMT has been extremely volatile and has seen the company's market cap approach almost $200 Million within the last couple of weeks, but the recent pullback places the company value at $116.88 Million.Industries Impacted by 3D PrintingThree-dimensional printing will have a major role in future manufacturing. Up until now, 3D printing has been most useful in creating prototypes, but 3D printers will increasingly produce critical parts and finished products in many of today's major industries. The following are the major industries that have already seen the impact of 3D printing and its increased role in the economy.Food: Food products such as chocolates that are shaped like company logos, names, and other unique objects will be widely printed. Anything that can exist in liquid or powder form - in other words, ingredients that can then be extruded through a nozzle or syringe - can be printed. This includes sugar, cheese, sauces, and others. Estimates show that by 2020, food will potentially make up 5% of the overall 3D printing market.Medicine: Medical solutions will be more customized for individual patients. Any simple soft-tissue organ such as an ear, finger, or kidney can be 3D produced and will soon be widely used. Metal hip implants, skull implants, orthopedic insoles, body braces, and jaw transplants have already been manufactured on 3D printers. This is where Organovo has entered the discussion as a player in the 3D printing space in the field of medicine, as the company has been attempting to produce living cells and tissues through the use of 3D printers. This is currently the highest growth area in the space, and by 2020, could approach roughly 25% of the overall 3D printing market.Military: Much of the machinery for the military is complex and produced in relatively low volumes. Many parts are custom and replacement parts are constantly needed. We will see the instant production of replacement parts on-site in remote locations through 3D printing. The first 3D printed gun was already created earlier this year, raising new questions about potential regulations posed by the government in this space. As technology continues to develop, this is another high growth area in this space that could approach 5% of the overall market by 2020.Electronics: Designing and 3D printing electronics with optimal shape and styling properties will be common. 3D printing is ideal for the complex geometric features needed in small, compact electronic circuit boards that use multiple materials ranging from low conductivity plastics to high conductivity metal materials. Headphones and other consumer electronic products and components have seen a significant impact from 3D printing. Electronics is one of the early movers in this technology space, as companies offering these products have seen the benefits of 3D printing already. By 2020, the electronics area of business is expected to provide roughly 20% of revenue in the 3D printing industry.Jewelry: Jewelers will potentially abandon traditional manufacturing processes and use 3D printing to create custom, limited-edition chains and necklaces. Companies can instantly produce beautiful pieces that previously required large-scale, complex, and expensive machinery. As long as the materials are available, these new 3D printers along with CAD technology with allow companies in this space to move away from traditional methods of production. This will be a great technology for this industry as these significant price reductions in cost will be able to be passed on to consumers. By 2020, the jewelry area will potentially make up about 8% of total industry revenues.Consumer Products and Toys: Children can potentially download 3D design files for the toys, modify, and customize them endlessly, and then 3D manufacture them at home. Many companies like Oakley sunglasses are already utilizing 3D printing as well as many other consumer electronic accessory companies looking to cut costs, but not quality. Consumer products and toys is currently the largest portion of industry revenues right now in this space and by 2020, will make up about 20% of revenue in 3D printing.Automotive: 3D printing will manufacture vehicle parts and even whole cars. High-end, specialty cars that have relatively small production runs will particularly benefit. Motorcyclists and bikers will also be able to order customized helmets that are printed to fit the biker's individual head size and structure. Automotive on demand parts are an extremely interesting part of this business and will be a significant portion of business for all companies in this space going forward. It is expected that by 2020, automotive parts will constitute 10% of total revenues.The Future of 3D PrintingThe 3D printing industry is poised for huge growth in the next several years. By 2021, the industry should hit upwards of $10.8 Billion, with a compound annual growth rate of a healthy 23%. Much of that growth will come from the healthcare, manufacturing, and aerospace industries. Although the Americas currently lead the world in this new technology space, Europe is slated to surpass it in terms of revenue by 2020.Factors contributing to the 3D printing industry's growth include advances in technology, the ability to shrink time frames, expiring patents, and heavy government investment. The industry will push into more materials such as polymers, metals and alloys, ceramics, sand, and even living tissue. The bottom line here is that the 3D printing industry is wide open and poised for continued innovation and investing as it is only in the infant stages. Companies getting in on the ground floor of a global explosion will reap huge benefits for years.In 2013, combined end-user spending on 3D Printers will reach $412 million, up 43 percent from spending of $288 million in 2012. Enterprise spending will total more than $325 million in 2013, while the consumer segment will reach nearly $87 million. In 2014, spending will increase 62 percent, reaching $669 million, with enterprise spending of $536 million and consumer spending of $133 million.As the products rapidly mature, organizations will increasingly use 3D printing's potential in the company's product development and manufacturing operations. In the next 18 months, we see potential consumers moving from being curious about the technology to finding reasons to justify purchases as price points, user applications, and functionality become more attractive and easy to use. This continued adoption of the technology will lead to strong growth prospects over the next 10 years.Major retailers have the means to market the technology to consumers and enterprise buyers, generating demand for the devices and revenue by selling printers and supplies, as well as from sales of individual 3D-printed pieces. One of the largest companies involved in the space currently is Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS), which is a prime candidate to sell printers and finished 3D printed items. The presence in the market will have an impact on average selling prices and high demand of sales of consumer 3D printers by 2017.Below is a list of some of the major companies around the world participating, using, and investing in 3D printing technologies. Overall, there are more than 8,000 customers worldwide utilizing different technologies.Growth Drivers for the Future of the IndustryThe hype around consumer 3D printing has made many companies aware that the price point and functionality of 3D printing has changed significantly since the introduction of this technology, driving increased shipments beginning in 2014. Most businesses are only now beginning to comprehend all of the ways in which a 3D printer can be cost-effectively used. This means that this technology is still in the very early stages of adoption and has still not been fully grasped by many industries with regards to the potential surrounding overall use. 3D printer prices will decrease over the next several years due to competitive pressures and higher shipment volumes, even after new devices with higher performance, functionality, and quality are introduced.Sales Growth is another key metric to look at in the 3D Printing Sector. Growth across all areas of business and companies will provide a sustainable business across many sub-sectors. As these companies continue to diversify into higher growth and margin areas, investors should look for this metric to improve significantly over the next five years.All of these best of breed companies boast a nice Gross Profit Margin of at least 44.59%, which outpaces others involved in this space and the other underdeveloped firms in 3D printing. The companies also generate a nice amount of Cash Flow Per Share for relatively young companies in a new technology. As these firms continue to generate larger cash flow per share, we would expect to see potential share buybacks on any pullbacks as the majority of growth is expecting through 2020.Each of these companies is in a strong position from a financial standpoint as each company currently has very low Debt to Capital and Debt to Equity ratios and plenty of cash to expand business operations and execute on growth strategies going forward. In an industry that requires large investments for future growth, these companies have had early success with continued focus on and investment in the firm's most profitable businesses and other high growth areas with acquisitions.Obviously when looking at these measures, there is great room for improvement going forward. When specifically focusing on the ROA, the companies are performing well when it comes to the operating efficiency based on the firm's generated profits from total assets, when compared to other early stage technology companies involved in other spaces. The ROE shows the improving performance in terms of the shareholders' rate of return on investment in the company as compared to traditional rates in the past, and this is a metric that will continue to improve. The ROI of shows the firms efficiency in utilizing invested capital. These companies have outperformed its peers in new age technologies and with big opportunities approaching in the near future, expect this outperformance to continue.What Investors Need to Know3D printing stocks have been on a tremendous run this year in terms of share price, but still have major potential to move significantly higher as the companies grow at an incredible rate. Investors and Wall Street have seen these companies as highly volatile plays in a new industry. The recent pull back in share prices has created an opportunity, and these companies will continue to thrive as best of breed in this space. We believe that the aggressive international business model will provide huge growth opportunities for these companies going forward. The next set of earnings releases will give investors insight into how the beginning of 2014 is shaping up so far.Expect these three companies to continue to outperform in the 3D printing space, as the firms have the industry's best business models and management teams. The second half of the year proved that the companies could weather volatile markets, while positioning for growth next year. With strong continued revenue growth and value added acquisitions, investors will continue see the stocks move higher. We recommend buying 3D Systems, Stratysys, and ExOne, as continued momentum and strong earnings growth will continue. We expect to see these stocks gain an additional 25% in share price over the course of 2014 based simply on earnings growth alone.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1905621,54222,2013-12-18T13:36:52-05:00,,"Shares of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) have appreciated more than 60% in the last few months. Consequently, I have seen many analysts claiming that 3D Systems is a good short candidate for now. 3D Systems might be overvalued, but is it a good short play? I don't think so. 3D Systems has sent short sellers running for cover in the last few months, and I don't think that its share price will fall anytime soon. Thus, shorting 3D Systems will prove to be a very risky move. Let's see why.Why are investors shorting 3D Systems?There are a few reasons which have led certain investors into believing that 3D Systems is a good short play. The primary reason why investors are shorting 3D Systems is because they believe it is overvalued. Many authors, most of whom who have a short position in 3D Systems, have highlighted the fact that 3D Systems is vastly overvalued, and have stated that it is a worthy short candidate. At a trailing P/E of 175, 3D Systems is quite expensive. But those betting on shorting the stock shouldn't forget that it is the only one among its peers that's reporting a profit.Another reason which I have been reading about for a very long time is 3D Systems' mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Many analysts and authors have claimed that since 3D Systems has acquired over 40 companies in the last few years, it is difficult to accurately calculate the company's organic growth.Lastly, certain investors seem to believe that 3D printing is largely overhyped and it will never fulfill its potential. While 3D Systems has constantly and consistently shown growth, it is extremely unlikely that 3D printing will not be successful. Though I agree with the fact that 3D printing will take few years to evolve into the next-gen technology for industrial manufacturing, it is certainly not a far-fetched idea.Why 3D Systems is not a good short playNow that we have seen why investors are shorting 3D Systems, let's analyze those reasons one by one.Shorts have been claiming that 3D Systems is overvalued and it will come down eventually. While I agree with the first bit, I don't think its price will drop considerably in the near future. Many analysts have high hopes for 3D printing and have even estimated it to triple its worth by 2018. 3D Systems, being the leader of the pack, should definitely capitalize on this growth.The company has been working consistently to fortify its presence in the industrial as well as the consumer sector and it is highly unlikely that it will not yield good returns in the long run. 3D Systems unveiled six new printers at the EuroMold and this indicates that it has enhanced its research and development strategies.Moreover, the company has realized that metal printing will be the most important aspect for driving its growth in the industrial segment, and consequently, it had acquired Phenix Systems earlier this year. 3D Systems unveiled the new ProX 300 Direct Metal printer, the first fully rebranded Phenix printer now included in the Direct Metals portfolio. This new production printer leverages Direct Metal Sintering (NYSE:DMS) technology, which is capable of producing fully dense, chemically pure end used metal parts.Moving onto the second reason, I don't believe that 3D Systems' acquisition strategy has done any harm. 3D Systems reported a 30% year-over-year organic jump in its revenue. Thus, I don't see why it is difficult to analyze the company's organic growth.Furthermore, given that 3D Systems is estimated to triple its value in the next five years, I don't see why growing via M&A is a bad thing. Including 3D Systems' acquisitions, its revenue grew nearly 50% as compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year. Also, focusing more on acquisition doesn't mean that the company is not spending on R&D. As I already said, 3D Systems has launched many new products this year and it has a perfect balance of M&A and R&D for driving growth. In fact, it had almost doubled its R&D spending in the last reported third quarter.The company had reported 44% growth in revenue in the last quarter and the future also looks promising. According to analysts, 3D Systems can grow its earnings at a CAGR of 24.40% over the next five years, and this is certainly an impressive growth rate.Conclusion3-D printing technology is still in an early stage of deployment, but the opportunities in this industry are massive. 3D Systems has been making the right moves to perform better than its peers. Therefore, I believe that thinking of 3D Systems as a short play isn't a good idea, especially considering the fact that it has been growing through both acquisitions and organic moves. Hence, even though the stock might appear overvalued, it isn't going down anytime soon as it is growing at a rapid pace.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1879171,23625,2013-12-05T05:09:46-05:00,,"Monday, 3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD) announced the immediate availability of its new ProJet 4500 3D printer. The ProJet 4500 will be the first full-color and continuous-tone 3D printer available. It will be the first available 3D printer to create strong semi-rigid parts in a wide spectrum of colors by the pixel-by-pixel process of additive manufacturing. 3D Systems also advertised the product as safe for office, easy-to-use, and as having increased efficiency due to fully integrated material recycling which also reduces waste. What does this announcement mean for analysts?3D printing has been one of the hottest sectors of the year. Since January, we have seen 3D System Corp. stock double from $38.45 to $77.64. One of the things that's great about DDD in addition to the potential it carries to massively disrupt the way things are made are its earnings. In each of the past 4 quarters, DDD has shown year-over-year growth in both EPS and Revenue. The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors. You can share your own estimates as well by visiting www.estimize.com.The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for DDD to report 30c EPS and $152.28M Revenue in February while the current Estimize consensus from 4 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 33c EPS and $136.21M Revenue.Over the past 2 reporting quarters, DDD has failed to live up to the high expectations of both Wall Street and the Estimize community. This hasn't stopped analysts from setting the bar even higher for FQ4'13. Investors are hoping the ProJet 4500 could be the device to turn the pattern of underperformance around.Making the jump from monochrome to full color finished products further improves the attractiveness of 3D printing. The 3D printing revolution has always been about lowering costs and enabling users to create whatever parts, models, or finished products they need. By reducing the need for painting or further post processing and allowing the user to print in full color, the ProJet 4500 will go even further in eliminating steps in the manufacturing process. Wall Street and Estimize analysts have both revised their revenue estimates even higher after Monday's announcement.Disclosure: none."
1894031,25120,2013-12-12T04:40:44-05:00,,"Investors in 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) continue to be at the right spot, with shares having more than doubled already in 2013. A new research report from analysts at Jefferies is adding to the bull case, with shares approaching fresh all time highs.Despite the strong momentum and continued growth, I am much more cautious and stay on the sidelines on severe valuation concerns.Jefferies Is BullishAnalysts at Jefferies initiated coverage on 3D Systems with a ""Buy"" rating which is accompanied by a $102 price target. The price target suggests some 27% upside from Monday's closing levels.Analyst Peter Misek believes that 3D printing will create long term value by revolutionizing mass manufacturing. Near term growth is driven by prototyping, which is expanding from industrial to broader enterprise applications. The consumer opportunity might be interesting, but is overhyped according to Misek.Despite this, 3D Systems is the most complete player in today's world. The company has the best product breadth, patents and best mix of margin materials and software. While short term growth must come from prototyping, Misek sees a solid future ahead when it addresses mass manufacturing on a mainstream basis.ValuationAt the end of October, 3D Systems released its third quarter results. The company ended the quarter with $343.4 million in cash and equivalents. Total debt, including capital lease obligations stands at $18.8 million, resulting in a net cash position of $325 million.Revenues for the first nine months of the year came in at $358.6 million, up 42.2% on the year before. Earnings rose a much more modest 17.3% to $32.9 million on the back of higher effective tax rates. At this pace, annual revenues are seen around $515 million, as GAAP earnings could come in anywhere between $40 and $50 million.Trading at $80 per share, the market values the company at $8.3 billion, or operating assets around $8.0 billion. This values operating assets of the firm at 15.5 times annual revenues and roughly 200 times earnings.Given the growth stage and further capital needs, 3D Systems does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveInvestors in 3D Systems have seen great returns in recent years amidst the hype, or increased attention about 3D printing. Shares have steadily risen from levels around $10 at the start of 2012 to end the year at $40 per share. Shares more than doubled again in 2013, currently trading at $80 per share after trading as high as $85 per share.Between 2009 and 2013, 3D Systems is expected to show very solid growth. Earnings are set to more than quadruple to levels just north of half a billion. The company has been solidly profitable as well in recent years, expected to show further growth in net earnings this year.Investment ThesisWithin investing, the valuation of a company is always the key question. Yet in many established names there are arguments to make for a modest 10-20% over, or undervaluation. Yet for biotechnology firms, or promising firms like 3D Systems at a premium valuation, it is pretty much an all or nothing story for long term investors. As a result, investors in 3D Systems should expect to see quite some volatility on the road.While the third quarter results were well received, I am a bit more cautious on the guidance. 3D Printing related revenues are very strong. Reported revenue growth for the third quarter came in at 50%, higher than reported revenue growth of 42% for the first nine months of the year.The full year revenue guidance implies fourth quarter revenues of $129 million at the midpoint of the range, plus or minus $15 million. This represents 27% year-on-year growth, and actually implies a decline in quarterly sales on a sequential basis.This guidance is a bit disappointing to me, knowing that the company stressed the focus on market share expansion, over earnings. The diversity in terms of positioning allows the company to extend the first mover advantage.As an example of this commitment is the recent unveiling of the Micro-SLA 3D printer for dental labs and jewelers at an ""affordable"" price tag of $4,900. Other fresh news includes yet another acquisition, this time of 3D printing company Figulo, which is focused on ceramics. Luckily 3D has access to a very expensive currency, in terms of its stock price to finance these kind of deals.For now the company focuses on building its leadership position, while operating under the well known business model named after Gilette. It is selling printers, probably a bit cheap to drive sales of consumables which carry solid margins and make future revenues and cash flows more predicable. The ""subsidized"" hardware sales should boost adoption and the market potential.Discussions about GAAP or non-GAAP earnings are hardly relevant with the business trading at more than 15 times revenues. What matters is if 3D printing has real growth and 3D Systems will be a market leader in the future. In that case, shares are probably very cheap. In most of the other alternatives, investors will undoubtedly see significant losses. The road to the future is long and many things can happen. While acquisition rumors have already pushed up shares a few times, a $10 billion deal seems quite aggressive, even for the largest established technology names out there. Few boards will be happy to sign of an acquisition of a business generating revenues of $500 million per annum.Back in February of this year, I last took a look at 3D's prospects. I noted that red flags are emerging as operating performance continues to deteriorate. I concluded to remain on the sidelines on valuation concerns. Yet I noted that this slight bearish stance does not automatically translate into a short thesis, driven by irrational market behavior. This has indeed materialized with shares having doubled in the meantime.Despite the move and continued growth, I have to reiterate my stance. I remain on the sidelines with a slight bearish stance. While a $100 valuation could indeed happen as suggested by Jefferies, I am sure there are better alternatives out there offering 25% potential with a better risk profile.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1879061,25096,2013-12-05T03:31:56-05:00,,"The history of the stock market is littered with the ashes of glamour stocks that were in a potentially dynamic sector, or had access to an exciting new technology, but were bid up to absurd levels, ultimately causing substantial losses for market participants. 3D printing is the latest example of an industry, which similarly to the Cloud, will grow at an extremely rapid rate for a reasonable period of time into the future. Because the expectations are universally high, the industry as a whole trades at uniquely expensive valuations despite the fact that many of the companies in the industry are negligibly profitable, and the competition is about to pick up considerably. 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) is an example of a highly promotional and acquisitive company that utilizes aggressive accounting practices and a high stock price to grow. Market participants are valuing the stock way too richly and will likely take substantial losses as things play out over the next few years.Source: 3D 2012 10KAt this point in time, 3D printing is largely a corporate endeavor as the scanning models have been quite sophisticated and the printers are expensive. While there is considerable innovation occurring in the types of materials that can now be printed, there are extensive limitations to the practicality of these printers on a widely used basis at this time. At the same time, I believe there is little doubt that many of these issues cannot be resolved in the ensuing decades and 3D printing will gain a great deal of manufacturing market share. There is already demand for rapid prototyping of products so there is little doubt that the industry itself will ultimately become a bastion for profitability and growth. The company has increased its offerings for the consumer but I'm less optimistic that there is a real need for 3D printing at the home, but people once said the same thing about PC's so I'm not claiming to be an oracle on the sector. At current prices and capabilities, I feel confident in saying that 3D printing isn't likely to be consumer story in the near future, as there are only so many plastic key chains and cheesy toys that the consumer can take.The printing/razorblade business model is incredibly solid, in which the three-dimensional printers rely on consumable materials such as metals, plastics and other composites to create end products. Just like with ink, the higher margins are on the consumables instead of the hardware. 3D is expanding its retail footprint to get more points of distribution for its products. In addition, the company is trying to acquire and develop its own proprietary materials to enhance its competitive position. Proprietary materials and top of the line printers, which can manufacture a variety of different materials, are likely going to be the key ingredients to identifying the winners as this industry progresses.3D Systems has used acquisitions to fund much of its growth and increase in offerings and materials. Most of these acquisitions were very expensive and the companies acquired had little in terms of sales or profits; luckily for 3D Systems the company was able to use its expensive stock as the acquisition currency. I don't blame the company for using its expensive stock as a currency to enhance its competitive position; if at any point the stock were to drop considerably the acquisition binge would halt, since 3D doesn't generate the cash flows necessary to organically expand at the same rate. Also a reduction in 3D's stock price would likely necessitate write-down's on its pricey acquisitions. 3D is intelligent to use its overpriced stock but what I do disagree with is how the company is being valued in the market. Between 2008-2012, 3D Systems had only invested about $280MM in R&D expenditures. Over the first 3 quarters of 2013, the company has invested about $28MM in R&D. As of 9/30/2013, the company had amassed $324MM of Goodwill, highlighting the fact that the company is using acquisitions in lieu of R&D. This is a key thesis in Jim Chanos's bearish positions in Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Dell, which has led to tens of $billions in write-downs. Keep in mind that this $324MM is in excess of 1/3rd of 3D Systems book value. Don't be shocked when goodwill write-down's become a real story for 3-D, but the ""good"" news is that non-GAAP earnings won't reflect any issues.On October 29th, 3D Systems reported 3rd quarter earnings results for fiscal 2013. Revenue grew 50% to $135.7MM, thanks to a 76% increase in printers and other products revenue and 30% overall organic growth. Net income in the quarter increased by 31% YoY to $17.7MM, or $0.17 per share. Non-GAAP earnings were $0.26 per share for the quarter. 3D printers and other product revenue grew to $59.8MM on a 66% increase in printer sales. Materials revenue growth rate increased to 30% and contributed $33.2MM to revenue for the quarter, while services revenue rose $11.7MM to $42.7MM. Healthcare solutions revenue grew 39% for the quarter, and contributed $16.9MM to total revenue. Consumer products revenue was $13.5MM in the quarter, primarily from printer sales. Consumer products revenue includes the Cube and CubeX printers, print materials and other cubify.com products and services.For the first nine months, revenue grew 42% to $358.6MM and gross profit margin expanded 120 basis points to 52.3%. Over the same time period, net income has grown by 17% to $32.9MM, or $0.34 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, the company earned 4.66 per share for the first nine months of 2013. 3D uses extremely aggressive accounting where the non-GAAP results exclude the tax affected impact of amortization of intangibles, noncash interest expense, nonrecurring acquisition, integration, and severance expenses, including gain or loss on acquisitions, the impact of litigation settlements, stock based compensation, and noncash loss on conversion of convertible debt. While this accounting might be reflective of cash flow, it does not provide accurate metrics towards the value creation or destruction of the business. Stock based compensation is a significant expense and certainly shouldn't be disregarded, and when a company is as acquisitive as 3D how non-recurring are these charges? No other industry outside of technology uses this type of accounting and I've yet to see why it would ever be appropriate, and when management teams focus on silly metrics, I proceed with caution.For example, non-GAAP net income was positively impacted by adding back $6.2MM of amortization expense, $0.7MM of acquisition and integration expenses, $3.1MM of stock based compensation, a $2MM loss on conversion of convertible notes, and $0.1MM of noncash interest expenses, which were partially offset by a $4MM tax impact related to the items just discussed. For the 3rd quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses amounted to a whopping $33MM, or 24% of revenue. For the first 9 months, non-GAAP operating expenses amounted to $95.9MM, or 27% of revenue. These are huge numbers for a very small earnings base and management's focus on this type of data allows them to pay rich prices for acquisitions that spur revenue growth, without highlighting the negative aspects of these decisions. Management is only partly responsible as the analyst community and the investor base are guilty of allowing management to get away with this chicanery, by upgrading the company and assigning an absurd valuation.3D's market capitalization is approximately $8 billion at prices around $78 per share. This is about 17 times trailing twelve months sales, which is rich for any industry. The company has reported GAAP earnings of $44MM over that same time period or $0.65 per diluted share, so the company is trading at about 180 times earnings. This is still a small industry and the barriers to entry aren't that difficult that a well-capitalized competitor such as a Hewlett-Packard or International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) couldn't encroach, and at the least impact margins dramatically. Below is a table that shows what 3D Systems net income would look like assuming 10%, 15%, 25% and 35% growth rates over the next five years. Even in the most optimistic scenario, net income would be just less than $200MM in year 5. This means that assuming 35% net income growth for five years, 3D Systems is currently trading at 40 times year 5 net income. That is utterly absurd and it doesn't even take into account that 3D lacks the cash or cash flow to attain this growth organically, therefore I would juxtapose that the actual EPS growth numbers would be far inferior, implying a much higher P/E ratio.The question that needs to be asked is ""could a sophisticated company take say $5-7 billion to replicate 3D Systems' business?"" I believe the answer is yes that they very likely could, as there is still a great deal of innovation necessary for 3D printing to become more practical for a greater number of products, so what is proprietary today, might not necessarily be highly relevant three years from now. Better capitalized competitors can pay rich prices to acquire their way into growth like 3D Systems has, while still investing much more into R&D to develop their own printers and materials. If Hewlett-Packard or Lenovo were to invest $500M-$1 billion into this area, I believe that both companies' could potentially become very viable threats to 3D Systems. 3D only has around $1 billion in total assets and most of these comprise of goodwill and intangibles, which were acquired at rich prices, so $5 billion or so in investment could likely lead to a far superior business than what 3D currently offers, especially when you consider HPQ and Lenovo's experience in traditional printing. Because the market capitalization is not high enough that a silly acquisition couldn't be made, I'd be wary shorting 3D, but I surely wouldn't invest in this business anywhere near current prices. I've been looking to sell calls way out of the money, but the bid/ask spreads are quite wide so I've yet to establish a position. If the company is acquired, shorting the stock of the acquirer might not be a bad proposition if the price paid is even close to current levels.Disclosure: I am short DDD.

1921721,56262,2013-12-30T16:20:01-05:00,,"Shares of almost all 3D printing companies have appreciated considerably this year. Even though analysts are expecting 3D printing to be worth more than $5 billion by 2018, I don't think investing in 3D printing companies, mainly 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), is a good idea. Investors have bid up 3D Systems in the hope that its technology will revolutionize the industrial manufacturing process and it will also have a massive presence in the consumer segment. However, I don't think that 3D Systems will be able to fulfill these expectations any time soon, and it may take many years to justify its valuation. Therefore, in my opinion, investors who want to see good returns in the long run should invest their money in Organovo (NASDAQ:ONVO) rather than 3D Systems. Let's take a look why.Why 3D Systems is overhypedAs I already said, investors have bid up 3D Systems in the hope that it will revolutionize industrial printing and also that 3D printers will become an everyday household object in the future, but I don't see this happening anytime soon. I have already discussed why 3D Systems will not revolutionize industrial manufacturing in my previous article. Now, let's take a look at the reasons why I think that 3D printers will never become an everyday household item.Unrealistic expectationsOf course, there are many things you can make with the help of a 3D printer, but people seem to ignore the fact that they will need a very expensive high-end 3D printer, which use resins or lasers, to print these objects. Many people blindly believe that they will be able to manufacture a range of products on a low-end printer (which costs roughly $800), which is definitely not true.Limited materialsAs of now, 3-D printers can only print in plastic, resins, and certain metals. These printers are not capable of printing products in mixed materials and the majority of the products that are used today are manufactured by a combination of materials, and this adds to the limitations of 3D printing.Complex usability3D printing is not a user-friendly process and you will need a CAD model to print any desired product. And it goes without saying that you will need to learn how CAD works in order to make a model and mastering the program can take years. Therefore, it is certainly not rational to assume that 3D printers will become an everyday household item in the future.Strength3D printers use layer-by-layer technique for manufacturing an object, which ensures homogeneous strength. The product which has been manufactured may look exactly the way you wanted it and will have uniform strength throughout, but it will be weaker than the traditionally manufactured products.Why Organovo may yield better returnsIt doesn't take a genius to point out that all 3D printing companies are overvalued and Organovo is no exception to it. However, while shares of 3D Systems have appreciated because of hype and unrealistic expectations, Organovo has grown primarily due to increase in institutional ownership. Therefore, even though it is overpriced, I think investors should consider buying it as its value may not come down because of higher institutional ownership.Moreover, since Organovo has embarked upon a completely different approach to 3D printing, it doesn't have to face stiff competition. By comparison, 3D Systems will have to compete against the likes of Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), Voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET), and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE). In addition, since Organovo's technology is different and unique, its growth will not be restricted by the aforementioned problems.Moving onto the growth prospects, Scientia Advisors has estimated that it sees a market opportunity worth more than $500 million for Organovo by 2018. As of now, the company has been successful in its attempt to develop functional liver tissues and it aims to broaden its portfolio to heart and kidney cells. For a company that presently has almost no revenue, this is a pretty big opportunity.Furthermore, it is well known that drug companies risk losing billions of dollars when one of their drugs enters the market and then fails clinical trials, primarily because of liver toxicity. To solve this problem, Organovo is planning to make bio-printed liver assays available for purchase by December 2014. I recently read a bearish article claiming that these liver assays do not hold much promise because liver assays are already being sold, however this is not true.Organovo's liver assays are nearly twice the thickness and can be printed with small lining of blood vessels, thereby making them a much better option for clinical testing than the presently available assays. In addition, Organovo has generated 3D printed livers which can last for almost 40 days (700% longer than its previous 3D printed liver).Also, additional data shows that Organovo's 3D liver assays exhibit dose-dependent responses to acetaminophen, an identified liver toxicant, and that the poisonous effects can be assessed using both standard screening assays and histopathological assessment of the treated tissue. The data demonstrates that these liver assays can potentially have value in assessing toxicology problems in human liver over a lengthy period of time, including sub-acute and multiple dose effects.ConclusionInvestors have no doubt made a lot of money in 3D Systems with shares up almost 160%. However, the prospects might not be able to justify the valuation going forward. In comparison, Organovo is doing something pretty unique and it could prove to be a better buy for the long run. The market opportunity is huge for Organovo, as we saw above, and the stock looks set to yield good returns in the long run.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1882031,44981,2013-12-06T08:48:02-05:00,,"At the end of March this year, I wrote an article and gave 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) a price target of $47, at the time of writing that article the stock was trading just above $30. However, since then the stock has more than doubled and currently trades over $77 per share. In this article, I have tried to incorporate new data and the future contracts along with new products and tried to analyze whether the increase in the price is justified or it is just a short-term rise. Let's first take a look at the model and assumptions used in the model. Along with the assumptions, I will also provide pro-forma earnings and valuation models.Model and AssumptionsI have tried to keep my assumptions in line with the expectations of the company. For future growth in revenues, I have used organic growth number that lies somewhere between the forecasted growth number for 2013. Revenues for the company are growing at over 35% per year, at the moment. For the first five years (hyper-growth period), I have used a 30% growth rate in revenues. However, the growth in revenues will start to fall to eventual 4% over the next four years in the valuation period. 3D systems is aggressively adding to its product portfolio as well as new geographic regions. As a result, I believe my revenue growth assumptions are in line with the growth shown by the company.On the expenses side, I have followed the same approach and assumed a declining growth rate in manufacturing expenses due to economies of scale and operational efficiencies. At the moment, 3D systems have a gross margin of around 51%, which I believe will go up during the hyper-growth period, and then finally, it will settle around 57%. Total operating expenses are currently around 34% of the total revenues. However, these expenses are expected to come down as a percentage of total revenues as the increase in revenues has been much larger than the increase in operating expenses. Also, as the company establishes itself in most of the geographic regions, the operating expenses will grow at a slower pace. Furthermore, tax rate at the moment is around 10% -- I have used a flat tax rate of 12% for the sake of simplicity. There is some tax benefit carried forward as well for the company - as a result, predicting the exact tax rate for the company becomes a complicated matter.Pro-Forma Earnings(Click to enlarge)Pro-Forma earnings shown above have been calculated using the above mentioned assumptions. According to my calculations, 3D Systems should be able to maintain solid operating and net profit margins even after the hyper-growth period.ValuationFor valuation, I have used a 13% discount rate, which I believe is appropriate for a high growth volatile stock. However, 3D Systems have shown that the company has solid basis for growth and a strong product portfolio, which will ensure the impressive growth in revenues. As a result, the discount rate may come down further for some investors - however, I believe 13% is an appropriate discount rate at the moment for the company.(Click to enlarge)For the free cash flow calculation, I have taken net income as the starting point. All of these net income figures represent projected net income based on above mentioned assumptions. To reach at free cash flows, I have made adjustments regarding, depreciation, amortization, interest expense and other non-cash items such as restructuring expenses/gains, gains/losses on equipment sale and taxes. Furthermore, investment in fixed and working capital has also been taken into account.Free cash flows beyond 2022 have been projected at a constant growth rate of 4% and discounted at the discount rate of 13% (adjusted for growth rate) to calculate terminal year free cash flows. After calculating free cash flows for each year, I have discounted those free cash flows at 13% to reach at the present value, and added them to achieve $5.54 billion in discounted free cash flows. According to my free cash flow model, 3D Systems' stock should be trading at around $54 per share. At the moment, the stock is trading at around $77 per share.ConclusionThe free cash flows analysis indicates that the stock is currently trading at above its fair price. It shows that the current stock price does not represent the true picture of the company's business; rather it is due to the excitement among its investors. In the short-term, the stock price might remain inflated - however, in the long term, I expect the price to converge to the fair value. On the other hand, companies in rapidly growing sector can have longer periods of inflated stock price due to the positive news. I believe the 3D Systems stock is currently overvalued based on the hard facts and the figures. However, I will keep my stance on the stock as a solid long-term investment, albeit a bit expensive at the moment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1874781,40031,2013-12-03T15:48:48-05:00,,"Shares of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) have rallied 40% in just three weeks after the company announced third quarter earnings on October 29. Since November 19, the stock corrected almost 20%, and has been trending higher over the last two weeks. After checking the most recent short interest data, it is certain that the 40% run was mostly fueled by short-covering, since the stock interest decreased significantly in the first part of November. My view on the short-term prospects has not changed over the past two weeks, and I believe that 3D Systems is still vulnerable, and that risk outweighs reward at the moment.Significant short-covering in NovemberThe most recent short interest data shows a 6.5 million shares decrease in short interest as of November 15. This translated into strong buying demand which pushed the shares of 3D Systems higher in the first 15 days of November. Short interest decreased to 20.6% of free float, from 27.5% at the end of October. The short interest is still high, especially when compared to Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), which has just 5% of its free float shorted as of November 15. It will be interesting to see the new short interest data, as I suspect that further short covering has stopped the decline of 3D Systems.3D Systems short interest, courtesy of Nasdaq.com3D Systems still trading at a P/S premium over StratasysIn my previous article on 3D Systems, I noted that 3D Systems is trading at a premium over Stratasys on the basis of their respective price to sales ratios. This is still the case, and 3D Systems' P/S ratio is still 17% higher than Stratasys'. The disparity started at the beginning of November, when 3D Systems' rallied 40% and Stratasys did not follow suit, as it rose less than 20% in the first part of November. The fundamentals do not justify the higher valuation for 3D Systems, since both companies have grown revenue at a very similar rate over the past several quarters, and both are expected to deliver similar revenue growth in the future. I would justify this premium just on the IBM acquisition rumor, but I still believe that the acquisition is highly unlikely.Group impact - voxeljet and Organovo selloffMost of the stocks related to 3D printing have sold off significantly at the same time 3D Systems did. voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET) dropped 54% in three days, although it has recovered some of its losses in the ensuing days. Organovo (NASDAQ:ONVO) corrected 42% in two days. Both stocks were targets of negative research reports: voxeljet by Citron Research, which called the company ""a total joke"", while Organovo crashed after fellow Seeking Alpha contributor published a quite bearish report. Both voxeljet and Organovo are far from their recent highs, but Stratasys and 3D Systems have rallied following their selloffs and are not far from their all-time highs. However, the rally attempts came on lower volume, implying weak demand, although this could also be attributed in part to the Thanksgiving holiday, when trading volume is traditionally lower.DDD data by YChartsConclusionI am still concerned over the short-term prospects for 3D Systems, because of the following:The risk still outweighs reward in the near-term. However, the long-term prospects of 3D Systems are still intact, as long as the strong growth is there.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1849051,56202,2013-11-19T11:03:53-05:00,,"About a month ago, I wrote an article about how 3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) prospects can make short sellers retreat. While my prediction seems to be coming true as the short interest in 3D Systems has declined from nearly 33% to 29% in the month of November, the reason behind this doesn't delight me. When I wrote that article, 3D Systems was trading at approximately $62, but now the share price has surged to over $82. The primary reason behind this jump is the International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) acquisition rumor.Investors have bid up 3D Systems on the hopes of an IBM takeover, but I think these unconfirmed rumors are baseless, thus this rumored deal will never materialize and eventually, 3D Systems will experience a pull back in its share price. Therefore, for the time being, investors should not consider buying 3D Systems.Why the IBM acquisition is unlikely.As it is evident, IBM's acquisition rumors are the primary reason why 3D Systems' share price has jumped nearly 29% in the past one month, but I don't think that this deal will go through, mainly because of two reasons.1. At $90 per share, 3D Systems is too expensive for IBM to acquire.2. Financially, the acquisition does not make sense for IBM.Let me elaborate on these reasons. As far as reason number one is concerned, IBM will have to spend over $9.25 billion if it wishes to takeover 3D Systems at $90 per share. Despite my belief that 3D Systems has strong prospects, it is still overpriced. At present, 3D Systems has a forward P/E ratio of 64.41 and if IBM shells out $90 per share for its acquisition, its P/E ratio will rise to roughly 85.To put into perspective, let's compare it to other big names like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple has a forward P/E of 11.06. This means that if IBM pays $9.25 billion for the acquisition of 3D Systems, it would assume that 3D Systems' earnings will grow almost eight times faster than Apple's, and this scenario is improbable, if not impossible.Analysts, according to Yahoo! Finance, expect 3D Systems' earnings to grow at a CAGR of 21.55% over the next five years. In comparison, Apple's earnings are expected to grow at 14.27%. Hence, paying eight times more than Apple's expected earnings growth rate doesn't make sense for IBM as 3D Systems is not expected to achieve that.Moving on to reason number two, IBM ended the previous quarter with a cash balance of $10.2 billion and debt of $36.2 billion. In addition to that, IBM's board sanctioned yet another share buyback worth $15 billion. Now that IBM has already approved the buyback plan, it's obvious that it will have to take a loan of $9.25 billion in order to purchase 3D Systems.So let's do the math. Under the best case scenario, this loan will have an interest rate of at least 2%, which will add approximately $180 million to its interest expenses annually. Currently, 3D Systems' EBITDA is $112.22 million, which is well short of the $180 million annual interest. Therefore, IBM's debt will keep on piling up for the next few years.Presently, the 3D printing market is worth roughly $3 billion and analysts are expecting it to be worth $8.41 billion by 2020. Assuming that 3D Systems commands a 30% market share in 2020, it will generate nearly $2.8 billion in revenue and at present, it has a profit margin of 9.52%. If analyst estimates are spot on, based on this profit margin (which may reduce as the 3D printers become cheaper), 3D Systems will generate a profit of approximately $270 million by 2020, but by that time, the deficit in the EBITDA and interest will also increase. Therefore, even under the best case scenario, it will take IBM many years to breakeven; hence this acquisition doesn't make sense.Conclusion3D Systems has run up to quite some extent after the recent rumors, with its trailing P/E now at almost 180. But as we saw above, 3D Systems' acquisition by IBM is not a concrete possibility and when the rumors lose steam, 3D Systems could decline to its pre-acquisition rumor levels, making it a stock to stay away from right now.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1873471,57571,2013-12-03T09:37:08-05:00,,"Adoption of 3D printing is on the rise with its application now extended to manufacturing final products. 3D printer manufactures like 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) are leading the race to grab this new market opportunity. Use of 3D printing for final part production increased to 28.3% of overall 3D printing applications in 2012 from a 3.9% share in 2003.This share is expected to rise with General Electric (NYSE:GE) announcing the use of 3D printing to make more than 85,000 fuel nozzles for its new Leap jet engine. This process is more efficient than its previous system of manufacturing nozzles from 20 different parts. This technology also makes the finished product lighter and stronger to withstand extreme temperatures. GE's adoption of 3D printing isn't new; last year, its subsidiary, GE Aviation, acquired Morris Technologies. This company now manufactures parts for GE's jet engines by deploying 3D printing manufacturing techniques. To meet the current demand for jet engines, GE plans to invest in the development of new 3D printing technology for fulfilling the demand of jet parts. As part of its investment, GE will triple its current 3D printing staff and expand its factory floor fourfold in the next five years.This announcement has created new opportunities for 3D printer manufacturers. GE Aviation's business development leader for additive manufacturing stated that the existing printers aren't efficient enough to meet the demand, and GE would have to buy 60 to 70 expensive machines to achieve its targets.I think both the companies 3D Systems and Stratasys have a wonderful opportunity ahead. 3D Systems might have an edge, as the company has a good relationship with GE, and its market leadership position as a 3D printing solution provider will help it earn a big slice of this market opportunity.However, Stratasys is also a tough contender that has also been providing its 3D solutions to GE. Since the acquisition of Makerbot this year, the company has expanded its addressable market, with entry into the growing low-end consumer segment. Stratasys reported Non-GAAP revenue of $126.1 million for the third quarter of 2013, representing a 39% year-over-year increase. Last year, the company acquired Objet, and the combined company is now one of biggest 3D printer companies. The acquisition of both Makerbot and Objet resulted in the strong revenue growth for this quarter.How is 3D Systems getting ready for ""Project Ara""?Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Motorola Mobile unit recently signed a deal with 3D Systems that names 3D Systems as hardware partner for its ""Project Ara,"" which aims to create modular smartphones. 3D Systems will provide its additive manufacturing (3D printing) expertise to support large scale production for 3D-printed modules and user-customizable smartphones.Project Ara, Source:www.theregister.co.ukMotorola Project Ara announced last month to provide users with a simple way to customize their phones with the help of 3D printing.As part of the deal, Motorola appointed 3D Systems for creating multi material printing capabilities to build handset modules like chassis, battery, etc. Motorola isn't first one to enter the modular handset market; there were a few trials earlier, but due to high prices involved, customization has remained a future concept. This is expected to change with 3D printing. Use of this technology will help make this project commercially successful.Choosing 3D Systems doesn't come as a surprise; the company has been providing its technology for various manufacturing applications, which also involves customized jewelry. 3D Systems' ready to print technology has been solving complex manufacturing problems across various industry verticals, and now it's time to grab the opportunity in the mobile customization segment. I believe that being a hardware partner to Motorola in Project Ara will help it capitalize on a new market opportunity, as customization is the future of mobile devices.Strong move toward the consumer segment3D Systems is known for its Cubify printers in the consumer segment. Recently, the company launched a product in 3D Scanning, therefore providing end-to-end service from scan to print. The company launched Sense 3D Scanner, which claims to be the only 3D scanner to deliver instant physical photography for capturing scan-able moments.The Sense is priced at $399 and will position 3D Systems in the scanning market, thus competing against Stratasys. Makerbot, which is owned by Stratasys, launched Digitizer, priced at $1400. This is a rotating desktop 3D Scanner for scanning a small object. Unlike Digitizer, Sense takes an altogether different approach; instead of keeping the object on a scanner, this handheld device automatically conducts object recognition. Through its software, the device scans the object multiple times for making a 3D printable file. This product will be tough competition to the already available 3D scanning products, including Makerbot's Digitizer, and Sense's much cheaper price might give it an edge.Both 3D printer manufacturers have now locked horns in 3D scanning with their respective product launches. Makerbot started shipping its product in October, while 3D Systems' Sense is now available for purchase. Although the official sales figure hasn't been released, both products are expected to receive a good response from the market.Conclusion3D Systems' Motorola Deal and the launch of its 3D scanner have created bright prospects about the company's chance to grab the 3D printing opportunity. In addition, GE's decision to use 3D printing to manufacture its fuel nozzle has added to this market opportunity. I believe the company has a strong upside potential and will sustain its revenue growth in the future. Its trailing twelve month P/E currently stands at 162.68, while it's forward P/E for the year ending December 31, 2014 is at 59.18. Its PEG (for an expected five years) ratio of 3.19 is much lower than Stratasys' 6.44. Considering the earnings growth rate, this indicates the company is undervalued, and therefore I recommend a buy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1842712,56262,2013-11-15T07:41:04-05:00,,"Shares of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) have appreciated nearly 23% in the month of November as investors have bid up the stock hoping that International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) will acquire it. Currently, the stock is trading at around $78, but since I think that the chances of IBM acquiring 3D Systems are really low, I believe 3D Systems' stock price will come down once these rumors fade away. Therefore, I think investors should stay away from 3D Systems for now and refrain from buying shares at these levels.Why IBM's acquisition of 3D Systems is highly unlikelyEven though IBM has struggled to increase profits and revenue, the company has been aggressively buying back shares, which has consequently driven up its stock price and earnings per share. This strategy has overshadowed IBM's dismal quarterly performance and has pleased investors. IBM has also been focusing on growth through acquisitions, but acquiring 3D Systems may be too far-fetched. Let's take a look why.$90 per share is too cheap3D Systems has a sturdy business structure with strong growth prospects. According to Credit Suisse, the 3D printing industry is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 20% and will be worth $12 billion by 2020, and rumors suggest that IBM is interested in buying 3D Systems for a ""premium"" at $90 per share. But, given that 3D Systems is the leader in an industry which is projected to quadruple in the next few years, I think $90 per share is too cheap and 3D Systems management would look for a higher bid. However, as we would see later in the article, IBM might find it difficult to pay even $90 per share for 3D Systems due to its cash flow problem, putting an end to the hopes of any such deal and triggering a fall in 3D Systems' share price.3D Systems has strong prospects and it expects to generate nearly $500 million in revenue this year. While sales in the industrial sector will account for most of its revenue, the company has also been strengthening its consumer business. 3D Systems already had Cube and CubeX printers in its armory, but last week, it also launched Sense 3D scanner, which could mark a major breakthrough for the company. At a mere price of $399, Sense offers a complete integrated 3D scanner and software, and is $1,000 cheaper than Stratasys' Digitizer. In addition to that, 3D Systems has also enhanced its seller network by striking up a deal with Seiko-I Infotech, Synnex Corporation and Sindho Ink. These tie-ups are expected to drive sales of 3D Systems' printers going forward.Moving on to the industrial sector, 3D Systems has a long list of customers that will drive its margins in the future. Out of all the customers, General Electric (NYSE:GE) interests me the most. Last year, when General Electric announced the acquisition of Morris Technology, it was widely assumed that the company would jump into the additive manufacturing industry, posing a threat to the existing companies. However, when GE announced that 3D printing will account for nearly 50% of its manufacturing, it became a growth driver for the 3D printing business.Presently, less than 10% of General Electric's manufactured products use 3D printing. With annual sales of roughly $150 billion, half of GE's industrial output would be an enormous growth driver for the 3D printing companies and given that GE is already a customer of 3D Systems, it may benefit the most from this opportunity. Therefore, I don't think that IBM will be able to acquire 3D Systems at $90 per share.IBM's cash flow problemAssuming that IBM is able to acquire 3D Systems for a price of $90 per share, it will still need to shell out nearly $9.25 billion. According to Yahoo! Finance, IBM has $10.27 billion in cash and has a debt of well over $10 billion, and if this deal goes through, the company will only be left with $1 billion in cash. And given the fact that IBM's board has authorized yet another share buyback worth $15 billion, it is evident that the company will not be left with enough cash to take over 3D Systems after this. Therefore, I think that these rumors of IBM acquiring 3D Systems will not materialize.ConclusionThe PEG ratio of 3D Systems is over 3, which indicates that the market is putting a pretty high valuation on it. So, according to these figures, the stock of 3D Systems is overpriced. A lot of this overpricing is a result of rumors of an acquisition by IBM. But as we saw above, 3D Systems' acquisition by IBM is not plausible and when the rumors die down, 3D Systems might come crashing down, which is why investors should stay away from it, for now.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1847741,40031,2013-11-19T01:54:13-05:00,,"Shares of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) have gone parabolic since the Q3 earnings report. The stock is up over 40% in the last three weeks, and is highly vulnerable at the moment, and we could see the stock pull back and consolidate its recent gains, and Monday's selloff may be a starting point of an intermediate correction. While there are short-term headwinds, as the price and valuation are getting too high, the long-term prospects for the company and the 3D printing industry remain intact.Abundance of good news and investor optimism propel the shares higherThere was no shortage of good news surrounding the 3D printing industry. After the earnings report, which I thought was better than it looked at a first glance (the stock sold off in the first couple of hours of trading after the earnings announcement), the company announced that it had expanded its partnership with Japan's Cannon Marketing to distribute its advanced 3D manufacturing 3D printers. The deal expands Cannon's offerings to include all of 3D Systems' advanced manufacturing portfolio. Under the terms of the agreement, Cannon will market and sell all of 3D Systems' advanced manufacturing 3D printers, including its direct metal printers. This is in accordance with the company's expansion plans, and is especially important for further penetration of its direct metal printing business, which the company is expanding after the Phenix acquisition earlier this year. The direct metal printing is one of the segments where the company sees significant demand.On November 8, 3D Systems launched Sense, a $399 3D scanner, designed and optimized for 3D printing. The scanner is meant to work with 3D Systems' Cube printers, and its Cubify.com cloud printing platform. This was 3D Systems' answer to Stratasys' (NASDAQ:SSYS) Makerbot Digitizer scanner, which costs $1,400. 3D Systems claims Sense has ""the most diverse scan range in its class,"" and can scan objects as large as 10' x 10', while Digitizer supports a maximum size of just 8"" by 8"". Both 3D Systems and Stratasys are following each other's moves this year, as they fight for market share in the consumer and the industrial segment.Peers also up significantly and vulnerable to a pullback3D Systems was not alone, as most of its peers surged higher in November. Voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET) is up almost 100% for the month, as it went higher with its peers, and after a favorable earnings report. Voxeljet's venue increased 77% year-over-year in Q3 and as gross margin expanded from 38.2% in Q3 2012 to 45.6% in Q3 2013.Stratasys and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) were the worst performers in the group, and both rose around 20% in November. There was no news from Stratasys to push the shares higher, but Stratasys went along higher with other 3D printing companies. ExOne managed to overcome another poor earnings report, with earnings and revenue below analyst estimates, and the full-year revenue guidance at the low point of the range.DDD data by YChartsValuation disparity3D Systems and Stratasys have traded at a similar price to sales ratio for most of the time this year. This is not the case as of early November, since 3D Systems' P/S ratio now stands at 17.9, while Stratasys' P/S ratio is 15.2. There might be an explanation for 3D Systems' premium, and that is the recent rumors that IBM (NYSE:IBM) might buy 3D Systems for $90. If the buyout rumor is the only reason for 3D Systems' 40% rise in November, the upside seems limited, since the price is near $90, and the downside risks are increasing. There is also a possibility that Stratasys goes up to match 3D Systems' elevated P/S ratio. With the abundance of good news and media hype, I would not be surprised if all the stocks in the group go up in the next couple of weeks, but I believe it is prudent to be careful at this juncture, and at least take some profits off the table, or protect the downside.ConclusionI tend to be careful when investors get overly confident, and when the price of a stock makes a parabolic move. Such is the case with 3D Systems, and other stocks in the group might also suffer if the leader of the group goes down. The abundance of good news caused the market to become overly optimistic about the prospects for 3D printing stocks, and they are vulnerable to an intermediate pullback and/or a consolidation of recent gains. There is just one reason to be optimistic about the short-term prospects of 3D Systems - the IBM buyout rumor. If it turns out to nothing, 3D Systems' price might pull back up to 30% in the next couple of weeks or months.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1845792,53482,2013-11-18T04:37:08-05:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) develops, manufactures and markets 3D printers, print materials, on-demand custom parts and 3D solutions. The company has been a popular stock pick this year for those wanting to ride the 3D printing super-trend that is taking the world by storm.However, investors have a habit of getting ahead of themselves in growth markets and it looks like that is now happening with 3D Systems.3D PrintingThere is no doubt that 3D printing has a very bright future and its possible applications are seemingly limitless. From cosmetic breast implants to building jet engines, most of us are now aware of the coming revolution.The problem is that valuation measures for 3D Systems have skyrocketed this year and there is now enough uncertainty to make the current high stock price unsustainable.Fast expansion disguises numbersAlthough 3D Systems' finances look impressive, it is important to note that the company has acquired no less than 39 companies since 2009. While this has helped put DDD into a more competitive position it also makes it more difficult to accurately analyze the organic growth that 3D Systems is creating.Insider sellingAnother cause for concern regards the fact that chief executive, Abraham Reichental, recently sold off a fifth of his own shares in the company. 3D printing is regarded by the street as the next big industry so it does not make sense that the CEO would sell such a big position.Increasing competitionThere is also the problem of newcomers coming to market that could hurt 3D Systems over the longer term. A couple of years ago 3D Systems was one of a few players in the industry but we are now seeing many more competitors, with the likes of Voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET), and Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) entering the field.Indeed, with Hewlett-Packard likely to enter the 3D printing game sometime in 2014, there are obvious dangers to the notion that 3D Systems is the ultimate 3D printing play.With $13bn in cash, Hewlett-Packard has the resources to make a big impact on the industry.3D Systems no longer has a major competitive advantage and the fear is that investors will begin to move away from the 3D printing industry per se and instead focus only on a select number of companies within that niche. DDD has that potential but speculators have bid the stock up to unsustainable levels too soon.Soaring ValuationLast week the stock pushed through the $80 level for the first time and is now overbought on almost every timeframe.The move up has 3D Systems trading with a staggering PE of 173.53.Take a look at the below weekly chart and see how 3D Systems is now in parabolic territory:(click to enlarge)Parabolic moveParabolic moves occur when a stock moves up in such a fashion that the rise becomes exponential in nature. As the stock moves higher the price rise begins to look dangerously extended. The chart soon appears like the right hand side of a circle as it nears the diameter.Parabolic moves often occur at the end of bubbles and I have found them to be excellent opportunities to go short.As you can see from the chart of 3D Systems the stock is now in parabolic territory signaling that rampant speculation is taking place. 3D Systems may well go higher in the long term but the short term situation is telling us that upward pressure is so built up that a sharp downward move is imminent.Indeed, the drop in 3D Systems when it comes will likely be exaggerated by speculators scrambling to close their positions at once.You only need to look back to March of this year to see what happens after a stock turns parabolic. 3D Systems dropped to under $30 under a similar type of scenario.Another reason to sellWhile the chart pattern for 3D Systems is compelling, there are more reasons why 3D Systems investors should take their profits here.IBM buyoutRumors of a buyout from International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) look to be increasingly unlikely at current levels.With the sharp rise in share price, 3D Systems managers are likely to hold out for something more than the $90 offered by IBM. That will most likely lead to a backing off from IBM with any buyout likely to be delayed till 2014. The rumors that have helped propel 3D Systems towards the $90 mark will therefore deflate and the stock price will drop to more sustainable levels.UncertaintyWith such uncertainty looming, does 3D Systems really warrant a market cap valuation of $8.24bn?Certainly recent earnings for the company have been promising, with 3rd quarter revenues rising 50% to $135.7m. But we also mustn't forget that management cut its 2013 earnings forecast to 0.93 - 1.03 per share.3D Systems has a bright future ahead but the stock is simply too expensive to be a buying opportunity. No stock ever went up in a straight line (which is what the current chart is telling us) and the chance of a short sharp correction is now extremely high over the next couple of weeks.Parabolic moves like this one can precede sharp corrections of up to 50% and there is no reason why 3D Systems could not drop to $40 under the market forces of speculators liquidating their positions.This would give long term investors a great chance to re-enter positions. My price targets are more modest and I would look for 3D Systems to drop back to around the $60 mark.For now, those holding 3D Systems should consider liquidating their positions and awaiting a more favorable entry. For those more bold, 3D Systems offers a good opportunity for a high risk short position.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1812282,38201,2013-11-06T12:55:29-05:00,,"3D Systems (DDD) recently reported its third quarter earnings, and the company posted strong top line growth. 3D Systems has been the recipient of positive investor sentiments, which resulted in its stock price appreciating 88% YTD. Although the company currently operates in a low competitive environment, this situation is expected to change in the future due to the rise of small players and entry of new companies in the industry.Positive results and bright future3D Systems reported a strong third quarter revenue growth of 50% year-over-year due to strong 3D printer sales. The company's printers and other products division reported 76% year-over-year revenue growth. Due to its top line growth, the company increased its revenue guidance for the current fiscal year from $485 million-$510 million to $500 million-$530 million. Despite this top line growth, the company reduced its EPS guidance from $1.05-$1.20 to $0.93-$1.03.This is an important step towards capitalizing on the 3D printing market growth. As per Gartner's recent report, end user combined spending on 3D printers is expected to increase 43% year-over-year in 2013 and 62% year-over-year in 2014. Worldwide shipments of 3D printers priced less than $100,000 are expected to double in 2015, from the current year's estimate of 56,507 units.As mentioned in our previous article, 3D Systems' printers cater to all three market segments i.e. prototyping, direct digital manufacturing, and consumer. Therefore, the company is well positioned to benefit from the increased consumer spending on 3D printers.3D printer prices vary according to customer usage; industrial manufacturing printers have an average price of $75,000 per unit, while consumer printers used for personal use are priced from $1,000 to $3,000. The consumer segment is the fastest growing segment, and the current Makers movement is driving the demand of these products. 3D Systems' consumer solution revenue has grown approximately 309% year-over-year in the third quarter, while its revenue contribution has increased to 9.9% in the third quarter 2013 from 3.7% a year earlier. Makers movement is the trend where consumers employ ""do it yourself"" techniques and processes to create unique objects with the help of 3D printers. Although the revenue contribution of 3D Systems' consumer printers is low compared to its industrial printers, looking at the market growth, this segment's revenue is expected to provide significant contribution towards company's top line growth.3D Systems receives tough competition from Makerbot, which is a leader in desktop 3D printers. It's famous among households, entrepreneurs, small businesses, and designers. Stratasys (SSYS) has now acquired Makerbot, which is one of leading providers of industrial 3D printers. Makerbot has a wide range of products from its Replicator printers to its 3D scanner Digitizer, which are creating strong top line growth. Stratasys reported that Makerbot's first half revenue has increased 360% year-over-year, and due to the popularity of Makerbot's products among consumers, this revenue growth will sustain in the future. Stratasys will report its third quarter result on November 7 this year, and due to strong presence in industrial printers and the acquisition of Makerbot, Stratasys is set to post strong quarter results.Makerbot is a big threat for 3D Systems in the consumer segment, but 3D Systems has been investing heavily in R&D and in its acquisition strategy to expand its product offering. As per its recent third quarter SEC filings, up to now the company has completed seven acquisitions in 2013. These acquisitions have increased the company's target market due to its increased product offering, thereby contributing to revenue growth.Is 3D printing still an uncompetitive environment?3D Systems and Stratasys control the majority of the market. There are only four publicly traded companies in U.S. that operate in the 3D printing industry and two of them are listed this year. These are Stratasys, ExOne (XONE), Voxeljet (VJET), and 3D Systems. ExOne and Voxeljet have limited presence in the overall 3D printing market, but both companies are benefiting from the positive investor sentiments towards 3D printing's growth potential. ExOne's share price has almost doubled since its IPO in February, while Voxeljet received a positive response during its recent IPO. Both companies cater to a niche segment of 3D printers and supply products used by industries for addictive manufacturing, or 3D Printing. Though Voxeljet and ExOne might be smaller in terms of revenue compared to Stratasys and 3D Systems, both companies are seeing demand growth of their products due to the rise in the number of industries adopting 3D printing.The 3D printing industry will have a new player by 2014; Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) is planning to enter the 3D printing market with the launch of its first 3D printer. HP's CEO Meg Whitman announced that due to growth potential in the 3D printing market, HP will soon have its own 3D printer, which is currently under development in its R&D labs. HP is the leader in 2D printers, and this transition into 3D printers will extend its printing solution offerings. HP is looking for growth areas for its turnaround to offset its declining revenue from weak PC sales. HP has strong financial resources, which will help the company expand its footprint in 3D printing. Therefore, as the market becomes more competitive, users will benefit from a fall in the prices of 3D printers. Although the company has not given any specific detail regarding the type of 3D printer it is developing, the company has a strong R&D base, which can deliver a competitive product in the market. It is too early to predict HP's dominance in 3D printers, but this announcement will be a potential threat to the market dominance of 3D Systems and Stratasys.Conclusion:3D Systems is among the favorite picks in the 3D printing industry due to its strong product portfolio, which will capitalize on the current market growth opportunity. The company is currently trading at a 12 months trailing P/E of 137.48, and its forward P/E for next fiscal year is expected to fall to 45.44. Therefore, investors can expect growth in the company's earnings due to its strong top line growth.Although the market will become more competitive after the entry of HP, the company is investing heavily to sustain this growth in the long run. 3D Systems' current quarter results mirror the strong market growth fundamentals that the company is betting on.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Fusion Research is a team of equity analysts.

1807422,43161,2013-11-05T15:05:39-05:00,,"Before selecting a stock, there are a number of things that you need to consider in order to ensure that you are buying the stock of a high-quality company whose shares are poised to grow in value over time. Some of these concerns include what the company does, its competitive advantages, valuation, dividend payouts and sustainability, and earnings consistency.Another important thing that you need to consider is the financial condition of the company in question. You want to know if the company is able to continue paying its bills, and how much debt it carries. The balance sheet is one of the most effective tools that you can use to evaluate a company's financial condition. In this article, I will discuss the balance sheet of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) in order to get some clues as to how well this company is doing.I will go through the balance sheet, reviewing the most important items, in order to assess the financial condition of 3D Systems. The information that I am using for this article comes from the company's website here.Note that this article is not a comprehensive review as to whether 3D Systems should be bought or sold, but rather, just an important piece of the puzzle when doing the proper due diligence.This article might be a bit too basic for some and too long-winded for others, but I hope that some of you can derive benefit from it.Background3D Systems is a provider of three-dimensional printers, print materials, computer-aided design services, reverse engineering, inspection software tools, and on-demand custom parts services for printing on everything from plastics to ceramics to edible sugar. The company was founded in 1986.Over the last 9 months, products have accounted for 68% of the company's sales, while services were responsible for the other 32% of sales. 3D Systems got 55% of its sales over the last 9 months from the U.S., while getting 26% from Europe, and 18% from the Asia-Pacific region.Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe first line in the Assets column of the balance sheet is for the amount of cash and cash equivalents that the company has in its possession. Generally speaking, the more cash the better, as a company with a lot of cash can invest more in acquisitions, repurchase stock, pay down debt, and pay out dividends. Some people also value stocks according to their cash positions. Some of the larger and more mature companies tend not to carry a lot of cash on their balance sheets, as they might be more inclined to buy back stock with it, or pay out dividends.As of Sept. 30, 2013, 3D Systems had $345M in cash and short-term investments, which can be easily converted into cash. Over the last 12 months, the company has generated $46M in free cash flow. They have not paid any dividends, and have been net issuers of common stock thus far, preferring to reinvest their profits back into the business.Net ReceivablesReceivables constitute money that is owed to a company for products or services that have already been provided. Of course, the risk with having a lot of receivables is that some of your customers might end up not paying. For this reason, you usually like to see net receivables making up a relatively small percentage of the company's sales.3D Systems had a total of $114M in net receivables on its balance sheet, which represents 24.7% of its trailing 12-month sales of $461M. For fiscal 2012, 22.6% of its sales were booked as receivables, while that percentage was at 22.3% for fiscal 2011. Receivables accounted for 22.4% of company sales in 2010.While these percentages are considerably high in absolute terms, they are very consistent, which shows that they probably have more to do with the nature of the industry in which the company operates. I don't see any reason to press the panic button in this regard right now.InventoryWith manufacturing and service companies like 3D Systems, I like to keep an eye on inventory levels. I usually like to see inventory levels stable or slightly rising from one year to the next. If I see inventory levels rising, then I want to see revenues rising as well, to indicate higher demand for the company's products. I don't like to see rapidly fluctuating inventory levels that are indicative of boom and bust cycles. In some instances, if inventory ramps up without increases in volumes or revenues, then it may indicate that some of the company's products are going obsolete.As of Sept. 30, 2013, 3D Systems had $66.1M worth of inventory, which amounts to 14.3% of the company's sales over the last 12 months. At the end of fiscal 2012, this level was at 11.8% of sales, while at the end of fiscal 2011, it was at 11.0% of sales. This shows that the company's inventory levels are steady relative to the revenues. I don't see anything here that would indicate boom and bust cycles or the possibility of a large number of their products going obsolete. So, I see nothing to worry about here at this time.Current RatioAnother factor that I like to look at is the current ratio. This helps to provide an idea as to whether or not the company can meet its short-term financial obligations in the event of a disruption of its operations. To calculate this ratio, you need the amount of current assets and the amount of current liabilities. Current assets are the assets of a company that are either cash or assets that can be converted into cash within the fiscal year. In addition to cash and short-term investments, some of these assets include inventory, accounts receivable, and prepaid expenses. Current liabilities are expenses that the company will have to pay within the fiscal year. These might include short-term debt and long-term debt that is maturing within the year, as well as accounts payable (money owed to suppliers and others in the normal course of business). Once you have these two figures, simply divide the amount of current assets by the amount of current liabilities to get your current ratio.If a company's operations are disrupted due to a labor strike or a natural disaster, then the current assets will need to be used to pay for the current liabilities until the company's operations can get going again. For this reason, you generally like to see a current ratio of at least 1.0, although some like to see it as high as 1.5.The current ratio of 3D Systems is 5.20, which is outstanding.Property, Plant and EquipmentEvery company, regardless of the industry in which it operates, requires a certain amount of capital expenditures. Land has to be bought, factories have to be built, machinery has to be purchased, and so on. However, less may be more when it comes to outlays for property, plant and equipment, as companies that constantly have to upgrade and change their facilities to keep up with competition may be at a bit of a disadvantage.However, another way of looking at it is that large amounts of money invested in this area may present a large barrier-to-entry for competitors. Right now, 3D Systems has $41M worth of property, plant and equipment on its balance sheet. This figure is above the $34.4M that the company reported at the end of fiscal 2012, as well as the $29.6M that it reported at the end of fiscal 2011. Of these assets, 64% is in machinery and equipment, while 22% is in buildings and leasehold improvements. The rise in these figures over the last few years stems largely from 35 acquisitions that the company has made since the end of 2009.GoodwillGoodwill is the price paid for an acquisition that's in excess of the acquired company's book value. The problem with a lot of goodwill on the balance sheet is that if the acquisition doesn't produce the value that was originally expected, then some of that goodwill might come off of the balance sheet, which could in turn lead to the stock going downhill. Then again, acquisitions have to be judged on a case-by-case basis, as good companies are rarely purchased at or below book value.3D Systems has $324M worth of goodwill on its most recent balance sheet, which is well above the $240M that was reported at the end of fiscal 2012, as well as the $108M that was reported at the end of fiscal 2011. In 2011, the company's goodwill nearly doubled from $59M at the end of 2010. These increases are due to the 35 acquisitions mentioned above, in which the company acquired businesses that were involved in numerous activities such as manufacturing 3D printers, rapid prototyping, and digitizing film for radiology, oncology, and dental applications.Overall, goodwill accounts for 30.5% of the total assets of 3D Systems. Usually, I don't like to see goodwill account for more than 20% of a company's total assets for the reason that I discussed at the beginning of this section. Since 3D Systems is currently well above this threshold, this is an item of concern for me.Intangible AssetsIntangible assets that are listed on the balance sheet include items such as licensed technology, patents, brand names, copyrights and trademarks that have been purchased from someone else. They are listed on the balance sheet at their fair market values. Internally developed intangible assets do not go on the balance sheet in order to keep companies from artificially inflating their net worth by slapping any old fantasy valuation onto its assets. Many intangible assets like patents have finite lives, over which their values are amortized. This amortization goes as annual subtractions from assets on the balance sheet and as charges to the income statement. If the company that you are researching has intangible assets, with finite lives, that represent a very large part of its total asset base, then you need to be aware that with time, those assets are going to go away, resulting in a reduction in net worth, which may result in a reduction in share price, unless those intangible assets are replaced with other assets.3D Systems currently has $145M worth of intangible assets on its balance sheet. This is well above the $108M that it had at the end of 2012, as well as the $54M that the company reported at the end of fiscal 2011. These assets consist of customer relationships, patents, acquired technology, and non-compete agreements that were picked up by the company in its numerous acquisitions. Virtually all of these assets have finite lives, which will expire over the next 10 years.These intangible assets account for 13.6% of the company's total assets. While seeing these assets disappear from the balance sheet is not a good thing when it comes to the company's net worth, the fact that it will be done over a ten-year period gives 3D Systems ample time to replace those assets or bolster its balance sheet in other ways.Return on AssetsThe return on assets is simply a measure of the efficiency in which management is using the company's assets. It tells you how much earnings management is generating for every dollar of assets at its disposal. For the most part, the higher, the better, although lower returns due to large asset totals can serve as effective barriers to entry for would-be competitors. The formula for calculating return on assets looks like this:Return on Assets = (Net Income) / (Total Assets).For 3D Systems, the return on assets would be $86.7M in core earnings (non-GAAP) over the last 12 months, divided by $1.06B in total assets. This gives a return on assets for the trailing twelve months of 8.18%, which is decent. I also calculated the company's returns on assets over fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 for comparative purposes. This can be seen in the table below.Table 1: Returns On Assets At 3D SystemsThe numbers shown in the above table are decent returns on assets, and they show that management is doing a good job at making efficient use of what it has as its disposal. These returns have been consistently good over the last 2-3 years, although there hasn't been consistent growth in this figure. However, this is due to the company's asset base, which has grown faster than its earnings, which isn't always a bad thing. This is especially true when considering that the core earnings of 3D Systems have nearly quadrupled since 2010.Short-Term Debt Versus Long-Term DebtIn general, you don't want to invest in a company that has a large amount of short-term debt when compared to the company's long-term debt. If the company in question has an exorbitant amount of debt due in the coming year, then there may be questions as to whether the company is prepared to handle it.Right now, 3D Systems has just $184K in short-term debt. This figure is more than dwarfed by the company's free cash flow of $46M. Over the last three full fiscal years, the company has averaged free cash flow of $35M. With this kind of cash flow generation, $184K in maturing debt should not be a problem at all.Long-Term DebtLong-term debt is debt that is due more than a year from now. An excessive amount of it can be crippling in some cases. For this reason, the less of it, the better. Companies that have sustainable competitive advantages in their fields usually don't need much debt in order to finance their operations. Their earnings are usually enough to take care of that. A company should generally be able to pay off its long-term debt with 3-4 years' worth of earnings.Right now, 3D Systems carries just $18.6M of long-term debt, which is well below the $87.9M that the company reported just 9 months ago, at the end of 2012. It is also below the $139M that was reported at the end of 2011. This shows that the company has been doing a great job of paying down its long-term debt.Over the last three full fiscal years, 3D Systems has averaged $43.8M in core earnings, which is more than double the company's long-term debt. This means that the company could pay off its long-term debt with an amount that is less than six months worth of profit. With the company's cash position, earnings power, and free cash flow generation, this long-term debt shouldn't be an issue.Debt-To-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio, as normally calculated, is simply the total liabilities divided by the amount of shareholder equity. The lower this number, the better. Companies with sustainable competitive advantages can finance most of their operations with their earnings power rather than by debt, giving many of them a lower debt-to-equity ratio. I usually like to see companies with this ratio below 1.0, although some raise the bar (or lower the bar if you're playing limbo) with a maximum of 0.8. Let's see how 3D Systems stacks up here.Debt-To-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Shareholder EquityFor 3D Systems, the debt-to-equity ratio is calculated by dividing its total liabilities of $162M by its shareholder equity of $898M. This yields a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.18.This tells us that 3D Systems is in excellent shape with regard to its debt and equity positions.The table below shows how debt-to-equity ratio has changed over the last few years.Table 2: Debt-To-Equity Ratios Of 3D SystemsFrom this table, we can see that the debt of 3D Systems is very manageable when compared to its equity position. On top of that, the debt-to-equity ratio has declined a lot over the last couple of years. This is great to see when assessing a company's financial condition.Return On EquityLike the return on assets, the return on equity helps to give you an idea as to how efficient management is with the assets that it has at its disposal. It is calculated by using this formula.Return On Equity = Net Income / Shareholder EquityGenerally speaking, the higher this figure, the better. However, it can be misleading, as management can juice this figure by taking on lots of debt, reducing the equity. This is why the return on equity should be used in conjunction with other metrics when determining whether a stock makes a good investment. Also, it should be mentioned that some companies are so profitable that they don't need to retain their earnings, so they buy back stock, reducing the equity, making the return on equity higher than it really should be. Some of these companies even have negative equity on account of buybacks. However, 3D Systems is not one of these companies.So, the return on equity for 3D Systems is as follows:$86.7M / $898M = 9.65%This appears to be a decent return on equity, although nothing to write home about at first glance. In the table below, you can see how the return on equity has fared over the past three years.Table 3: Returns On Equity At 3D SystemsAt first glance, the returns on equity do not look good, due to the downward trend that we see Table 3. However, this is due to the fact that the company's equity position has increased nearly sevenfold since the end of 2010, as the company has paid down debt and effectively managed its other assets. The equity of 3D Systems has increased sevenfold, while the earnings have increased fourfold. This explains the declining returns on equity, which aren't as bad as they appear.Retained EarningsRetained earnings are earnings that management chooses to reinvest into the company as opposed to paying it out to shareholders through dividends or buybacks. It is simply calculated as:Retained Earnings = Net Income - Dividend Payments - Stock BuybacksOn the balance sheet, retained earnings is an accumulated number, as it adds up the retained earnings from every year. Growth in this area means that the net worth of the company is growing. You generally want to see a strong growth rate in this area, especially if you're dealing with a growth stock that doesn't pay much in dividends or buybacks. More mature companies, however, tend to have lower growth rates in this area, as they are more likely to pay out higher dividends.Right now, 3D Systems has a retained earnings figure of $49.3M. Below, you can see how the retained earnings have fared at 3D Systems at the ends of each of the last four fiscal years.Table 4: Retained Earnings At 3D SystemsWhile the current retained earnings figure of 3D Systems is not impressive, it is miles better than the deficits that the company was posting until the end of last year. In fact, the company has been profitable every year now since 2008, and the profits have been steadily growing, as can be seen by the declining retained earnings deficit that has turned into a growing surplus.ConclusionAfter reviewing the most recent balance sheet, it can be concluded that there are a lot of things to like about the financial condition of 3D Systems. For starters, 3D Systems has an extremely good current ratio, which shows that the company has more than enough current assets on hand in order to meet its short-term obligations in the event that its operations encounter an unlikely disruption. 3D Systems has solid returns on assets and equity, showing that management is making efficient use of the assets at its disposal. The company's short and long-term debt are all but negligible, as its earnings dwarf those figures. 3D Systems has a very low debt-to-equity ratio, which has been declining over the last couple of years. Retained earnings growth has also been very good, as the company is now able to reinvest some money back into its business.The biggest concern that I have with the financial condition of 3D Systems is its large amount of goodwill, which accounts for just over 30% of the company's total assets. The company has made 35 acquisitions since the end of 2009, for a total of over $400M. If some of these acquisitions don't pan out like management originally thought, then that could have a detrimental effect on the balance sheet, as some of that goodwill might disappear.While this is not a comprehensive review as to whether 3D Systems should be bought or sold, I think that the company is in very good financial condition at this time.More information on how I analyze financial statements can be found at my website here. It's a website that I created in order to help people make more intelligent financial decisions.Thanks for reading, and I look forward to your comments.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1805842,56262,2013-11-05T11:18:56-05:00,,"The hype surrounding the 3-D printing industry is huge, with many analysts claiming that this technology will grow into the next-generation technology for industrial manufacturing and production. I, for one, don't believe that this hype is justified and I remain highly skeptical of 3-D printing's future.There are numerous companies that are involved in this industry, which makes growth for any single company even more difficult. In addition, the arrival of new companies like Voxeljet will intensify competition further. 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), due to its diversified product portfolio and wide distribution network, is often projected to become the leader of this industry.However, I don't see it happening because of a few reasons. So, let's analyze these reasons and find out why 3D Systems and other companies like Stratasys may not develop into the next-generation leaders of industrial manufacturing.3 Risks to the 3D industry1. Time consumption and efficiency3D printing consumes a large amount of time for printing a product. The process of 3D printing can last from a few hours to a few days. Hence, 3D printing does not stand a chance against industrial machines that can produce thousands of products every hour. In addition to that, industrial machines produce fully finished products that can be directly loaded onto a truck, while the 3D printing process lacks this feature. The 3D printing procedure would require an extra step of removing the printed product from the printer, and casing it before it can be shipped. This, evidently, will increase the lead time and capital consumption.The time consumption can be reduced considerably by stacking multiple printers together, but it will be unpractical primarily because of a few reasons like:2. Strength and materialThe strength of the finished product is another issue which comes with this technology. Since this technology uses layering techniques, the printed product will not be as strong as the conventionally manufactured product.Also, a 3D printer usually prints in plastic, therefore it will not find its use everywhere. Most of the things we use today are made from a blend of different materials, so this fact will restrict the utilization of a 3D printer.3. Extremely high costA 3D printer is very expensive and on top of that, the material used in printing is also not cheap. A traditional industrial manufacturing machine may cost more than a 3D printer, but these machines make up for it by producing finished products at a much higher rate than the 3D printer.These are the few reasons why I believe that a company like 3D Systems might not be able to live up to its present hype. Moreover, 3D Systems has been surviving on the back of acquisitions. The company has made a whopping 38 acquisitions since 2011. This means that 3D Systems has been acquiring most of itstechnology instead of developing it. Of course, bulls might point out toward certain moves such as the company's recent product launches. 3D Systems recently made its affordable Cube 3D printers available at Staples as it looks to reach a wider customer base. In addition, it made another acquisition in the form of The Sugar Lab, a California-based start-up micro-design firm engaged in the 3-D printing of real sugar.But then, 3D Systems is not a good value and given the challenges expected in the 3D printing industry, I think it is best avoided right now. 3D Systems' P/E ratio of more than 130 is something that would put value investors off and if the company's growth rate slows down, it would see a major sell-off as a short float of 33% suggests.But a company worth looking atA less talked about 3D printing company which, in my opinion, has a bright future is Organovo Holdings (NASDAQ:ONVO). Unlike the other 3D printing companies, Organovo works on the development of 3D bio-printing technology. The technology, which prints out functional human tissues on demand, may sound futuristic, but it's not too far-fetched as Organovo has been able to do it. The company aims to improve upon this technology and produce actual body parts in the future.As of now, the company can produce live human tissues that can replicate the native human biology, making the process of researching new medicines much quicker. In 2010, pharmaceutical companies invested almost $50 billion in research and development of new medicines and treatments, but the FDA approved only 20 new medicines.On an average, a new medicine takes 12 years of research and $1.2 billion worth of investment to bring to market; therefore this technology will enable the pharmaceutical companies to eliminate potential drugs and save money.Even though Organovo is in its early stages of development, major players like Pfizer have already started to test it out. Organovo's agreement with Pfizer expired just before the end of 2012, and Organovo has been waiting to hear back from Pfizer to see if the company wants to continue using Organovo's products. Also, last month, Organovo announced that it has penned an agreement with Roche. Roche would be using Organovo's innovation for exploring the use of 3D liver tissue in toxicology.Also, Scientia Advisors has estimated that it sees a market opportunity worth more than $500 million for Organovo by 2018. As of now, the company has been successful in its attempt to develop functional liver tissues and it aims to broaden its portfolio to heart and kidney cells. For a company that presently has almost no revenue, this is a pretty big opportunity.Organovo has embarked upon a completely different approach to 3D printing, which will give it a competitive edge over other 3D printing industry players. Also, since the company doesn't have to compete against any kind of industrial manufacturing machines, time and money parameters are not an issue.It is difficult to value Organovo at present since it is a developmental stage company. Its revenue over the trailing twelve months is just $1.14 million and so, conventional valuation metrics such as the P/E ratio or the PEG ratio won't be of much help. However, the market opportunity is huge for Organovo as we saw above and in my opinion, investors would be better off spending more time researching about it rather than 3D Systems.A potential threat?On the other hand, Organovo seems to be without any strong competitors. For instance, Yahoo! Finance lists no competitor. However, researchers at a Chinese university recently managed to successfully print human liver cells, with 90% of the cells coming out of the printer alive. But since it is not a big corporation, and given the fact that Organovo already has tie-ups with big pharma companies, it doesn't face much of a threat from the Chinese university at present.Conclusion3D Systems, no doubt, is a pioneer in the 3D printing industry. But given its steep valuation and potential challenges as mentioned above, I think that it is better to look at a company like Organovo that's focusing on something groundbreaking. The exact time frame when Organovo will become a good investment is something which cannot be stated explicitly, but as long-term investors, one should be ready to hold for a longer period of time because as Warren Buffett says, ""Our favorite holding period is forever."" Hence, investors will need to be patient if they are investing in Organovo as the company is in its nascent stage. If Organovo is able to achieve what it has set out to do, then it would probably turn out to be a good investment in the future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1822012,56922,2013-11-08T08:08:53-05:00,,"3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) is a holding company based in Delaware. It operates through subsidiaries based in the US, Europe and Asia Pacific and distributes its products all over the world. It is a global provider of 3D printers, print materials and on demand custom parts to professionals and consumers. They also provide X-ray scanners for medical and mechanical purposes. In addition, 3D Systems specializes in product related services. In the trailing twelve months, 3D Systems generated 68.2% of its revenue from printers and hardware products; while 31.8% was generated from the related services provided. Geographically speaking, the company derives around 45% of its revenue from outside the US.Market performanceShares of 3D System are trading around $70.01. The share price fell to $29.72 back in March 2013 but that was a consequence of a stock split in February 2013. After the stock split the shares became more marketable and liquid, hence showing an improving trend since then and growing by 122%. This growth is also because of the investor's confidence in the future of 3D printing and its growth.Thesis and catalyst:3D printing is a business with a strong growth prospect provided it expands into the everyday household market. Currently, 3D Systems Corp. is providing products and services to large manufacturing companies like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). This industry has a potential to dominate the conventional global manufacturing systems like CNC Systems, plastic modeling and metal casings manufacturing. By enabling a machine to produce objects of any shape on the spot and as needed, 3D printing really is ushering in a new era in manufacturing (Harvard Business Review, 2013). Moreover, as 3D printing takes hold, the position of China as leading manufacturer would change and the power will shift towards companies in the 3D printing business.Consumer industry PotentialResearch shows that demand for household printers will triple by 2018. As mentioned above, consumer 3D printing is a strong growth candidate; but the question is, will it achieve the levels of growth that are anticipated? To answer that, we have to take into consideration certain facts about consumer printing. Currently available 3D printers are expensive and the consumers are likely to be hesitant when buying a printer that can print a product at a high cost while the same product is available in the market at a lower price. Yes, the hobbyist will buy them but that would not affect the growth substantially. To gain maximum benefit, the printers would have to be manufactured cost effectively.Some other question marks include the quality of the printing, user friendliness of the printer, printing with material other than plastic and the cost-benefit as mentioned earlier. Despite all these reservations, Gartner estimates the rise in printer demand to be 49% in 2013, which would increase to 75% in 2014 and almost doubling in 2015. This view can be supported by the fact that printer related patents are expiring in 2014 which could open a window of innovative printers for consumers. More companies will enter the market, facilitating the evolution of 3D printers and reducing their price. All of this validates an increased demand in the future which is dependent on an evolved and cost effective printer production offered at low prices. To conclude, consumer printing is a very promising industry provided that companies find a way to reduce production costs and develop printers that are user friendly.There are two main catalysts, discussed below, that would affect the company's growth and share price in the long term and one catalyst that would affect them in the short term.Consumer printingThe products that are used by common households have far more growth potential as opposed to doing business with the big corporations. New product launches in consumer printing can usher in a new era of growth for the company. 3D Systems Corp. has launched a consumer 3D printer named Cube for a price in excess of $1200. Furthermore, it is available only in some select shops. It is very expensive for household use and it is not clear whether this printer can print in a cost effective manner. Printing materials are also expensive. A $49 cartridge can manufacture about 13-15 phone covers. It is very expensive even if we ignore the capital cost of the printer. So, a major barrier to entry in the consumer market is the cost of providing such products and the very low margins; because if 3D Systems does provide consumer products in future they should not charge a premium price. Consumer printing is a market with growth potential but the company needs to manage the cost of production efficiently. That is why 3D Systems is increasing its investment in R&D and has allocated 95% more funds to it. It is safe to assume that it would eventually find a cost effective solution to produce consumer products and when it does, the earnings as well as the share price will move in a favorable direction.Consolidation of the industry:The other important catalyst is whether the company succeeds in obtaining a majority share of the 3D printing industry. In the wake of this, 3D Systems has acquired more than 11 companies since 2011. Their main competitor, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), is also following an acquisition strategy. This strategy could lead to the market being dominated by these two companies, enabling them to lock out customers and charge higher premiums. It also creates barriers to entry for other companies to enter the market. If this strategy succeeds, the 3D printers market would be controlled by just two companies and they can enjoy higher margins from corporate clients. If a well branded company like Hewlett Packard enters the market, it could pose a threat to the growth of 3D Systems. So, consolidation of the industry is a must to secure a long term earning and price growth.New Products:3D Systems announced recently that it plans to commercialize a number of significant new products including several new breakthrough advanced manufacturing printers and scanners at Euro Mold 2013. ""We encourage everyone to join us for the largest and most exciting Euro Mold exhibit in our history,"" said Cathy Lewis, 3D Systems Chief Marketing Officer. This is a promising development and could boost the sales if the products are advanced and ""ground breaking"". 3D Systems will also be presenting their consumer printing products, branded content and fun to print applications during the expo. This expo will help 3D Systems to increase their clientele and arguably set foot in the consumer printing market which in turn could have a long term impact on the company's growth. In short, the expo is a great opportunity for the company to further improve its image and share price.ValuationThe EPS of the company stands at $0.83 which is expected to grow to $0.97 in the coming year showing EPS growth of 16.90%. P/E ratio of the company stands at 54.3x, meaning investors are willing to pay $54 for a single dollar earned. By this rule, the market is quite confident in the growth of the company. On the other hand, growth estimates by analysts tells a different story. The PEG ratio of the company is over 3, this indicates that the market is paying for much more growth that the sell side thinks the company is capable of. So, according to these figures, the stock of 3D Systems is overpriced. A lot of this overpricing is the results of rumors of an IBM buyout of the company. Once these rumors fail there will be a major slide in valuations of the company but an actual buyout will take price to the speculated $90 per share.Despite the bright future of the 3D printing industry and steady revenue climb of DDD, the company is still way over valued. At these prices the market is paying a forward P/E of over 50x. To take this into perspective, let's compare this to the forward P/E of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) which is currently around 40x. If IBM (NYSE:IBM) is actually willing to pay a $90/share price for DDD, it would assume that they are paying a P/E of around 80x. This would mean that IBM expects the growth of DDD earnings to be almost double that of Facebook. I believe this is highly unlikely and there are minimum chances that the company will be acquired at a P/E of 80x. Moreover, long time followers of IBM would verify that over the years the Big Blue has tried to divest from hardware and even more from hardware segments focusing on the consumer market. This makes it more unlikely that IBM will go for a company that is looking for hardware growth from the consumer sector.Conclusion3D printing has the potential to revolutionize the manufacturing process and the opportunity for growth is substantial as Gartner predicts. 3D Systems Corp. is an experienced company in this industry and has the potential to cash in on the growth factor of this market. It has already stepped foot into the consumer printing market and is on an acquisition spree to acquire a large proportion of the industry. If the hurdles of high production costs, lack of user friendliness and quality in consumer printing are overcome then the company could be on its way to great success.On the other hand, if 3D Systems manages to overcome its primary competitor (build a low cost advantage etc.), Stratasys, adequately, it will see even brighter growth prospects. The Euro Mold Expo in December will also help 3D Systems to engage in consumer marketing. Over all if, and it is a big ""if"", the company tackles consumer printing and achieves some level of consolidation, it will grow. Statistics, by Gartner, validate this. The company will grow, no doubt, but the market is valuing the growth more than it should as we have observed in our valuation.I believe the DDD has a bright future ahead but is way overvalued at these prices. The rumors of an IBM acquisition will play out and the prices would come down. That depreciation would be an ideal entry point for investors looking to buy and hold this industry leader. Short term investors can play the over valuation by short selling but there is high risk involved in all short selling strategies.Risk factors:1.

1782402,40031,2013-10-29T12:29:26-04:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) reported Q3 earnings inline with analyst estimates, while revenue was ahead of expectations. The company has also increased full-year revenue guidance, while lowering earnings guidance, which is a consequence of increased research and development and sales and marketing spending. This was all more or less expected, as I wrote in my earnings preview on 3D Systems. The company is executing very well, and has decided to sacrifice short-term profitability in order to gain market share, as management said that the demand for its products is unprecedented.Higher than expected revenue and in-line earningsThe company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.26, in-line with analyst consensus estimates, and 24% higher than in Q3 2012. Revenue increased 50% to $135.7 million, ahead of estimates for $132 million. Gross margin expanded 80 basis points to 52.4%, despite the negative impact of an unfavorable product mix and the acquisition costs of RPDG and CRDM. As in the previous quarter, 3D Systems' management said that it will further increase research and development spending, as well as sales and marketing spending in order to capitalize on opportunities in a fast growing market.Products revenue increased 56% while services revenue rose 38%. 3D printers and other products revenue increased 76% to $59.8 million. Print materials revenue rose 30% to $33.2 million. This presents significant growth acceleration over the last quarter's 12% growth in materials revenue, and is one of the segments I considered important in my earnings preview. Consumer solutions revenue was $13.5 million, which is more than double the segment delivered in the first six months of 2013. The 50% total revenue growth represents the second straight quarter of acceleration, since revenue growth in Q1 and Q2 was 31% and 44%, respectively. And since the company increased full year revenue guidance, revenue is expected to grow 53% in the fourth quarter, based on the mid-point of the new guidance.Significant increase in R&D and marketing spending3D Systems has significantly increased R&D and marketing spending in the third quarter. The company's R&D expenses went up 95% to $10.8 million. 3D Systems is making investments to support its near-term opportunities and expand its product portfolio. The company is also accelerating developments of key products, channels and technologies to capture more market share in production applications and the consumer segment. Phenix direct metals 3D printers were the area of significant interest and compelled the company to accelerate new products development and capacity investments.Guidance3D Systems increased full-year revenue guidance to $500 million to $530 million, from a previous range of $485 million to $510 million. The mid-point of the new revenue guidance is $10 million above the current consensus estimates. As a result of increased spending, the company lowered full-year earnings guidance to $0.93 to $1.03. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.01, which was lower than the company's previous earnings guidance range of $1.05 to $1.20. Since the company is sacrificing short-term profitability, I believe that the overall guidance is quite positive, especially considering the acceleration in the overall revenue growth and strong showing of consumer solutions.Momentum stocks break down - a cause for short-term concernIn the last couple of days, we witnessed a sharp correction of momentum stocks and/or increased volatility. Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), LinkedIn (LNKD) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are off their highs, and there was a serious breakdown in numerous Chinese momentum stocks. This is a worrying sign, and could lead to an intermediate market correction, which might negatively impact 3D Systems as it might feel the weight of the general market.Conclusion3D Systems is delivering strong and accelerating revenue growth. The particular segments I was watching all came in better than expected: revenue growth came in better than expected (the significant acceleration of materials revenue growth is particularly important), and the results of the consumer initiative are finally visible. Gross margins improved despite the increased spending. The company has decided to sacrifice short-term earnings growth in order to increase market share and management aims to take advantage of ""unprecedented advanced manufacturing and consumer demand."" Although the initial market reaction was negative with the share price down in the first few hours of trading, my view is that the results are better than they look at first glance. The lowered earnings guidance is not a reason to be concerned, and the long-term prospects for the company's growth and profitability are intact, or perhaps better than previously thought. There is one reason for concern over the short-term prospects of the share price - a breakdown in momentum stocks, and the increasing risks of an intermediate market correction. Also, take a look at my article on Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and the possible effects it might have on 3D printing companies.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1780542,40031,2013-10-29T00:44:57-04:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is near its all-time highs going into earnings Tuesday. The company is delivering robust revenue and earnings growth in the last couple of years, and the growth trends are expected to continue. The growth was driven by an aggressive acquisition strategy, as 3D Systems acquired more than 30 companies in the last couple of years, and the overall growth in the 3D printing industry. Here is what we should look for in the Q3 report.DDD data by YChartsContinued strong growth of printer sales3D Systems should continue to deliver strong printer sales in the third quarter. Management was particularly excited by the tremendous demand for its products, and has decided to ramp up research and development, as well as sales and marketing spending to capitalize the significant growth opportunities. 3D printer and other products revenue surged 108% in the second quarter. Phenix acquisition was completed in the second quarter, which will further strengthen the company's product portfolio, and enhance its position in the fast growing aerospace, automotive, defense and healthcare manufacturing industries.Accelerating materials revenue growthMaterials revenue growth was the slowest growing segment in the second quarter, with a 12% increase in revenue. The company expects the materials revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year. Materials sales usually lag printer sales, and given the significant printer sales growth in the last couple of quarters, materials revenue growth should accelerate significantly in the next couple of quarters. This should contribute to further gross margin expansion, as the materials segment has a much higher margin than other business segments.First visible results of the consumer initiativeThe third quarter should show the first visible results of the enhanced consumer initiative. The company has signed distribution deals with Synnex (NYSE:SNX) and Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) recently, and it will be interesting to see if there are visible results of the initiative. William Blair reported in late September that Staples sales checks pointed to weak consumer demand and William Blair could only confirm the sale of two Cube printers.A boost in R&D and sales and marketing spending3D Systems announced in the Q2 report that the company has decided to increase research and development and sales and marketing spending, to fully capitalize on the emerging opportunities and the tremendous demand for its products and services. This should put pressure on profit margins, which should be offset by higher materials revenue, which carries the highest gross margin. So, the gross margin should be flat or expand slightly in the second half of the year.High expectations equal high volatility3D Systems is always very volatile after the earnings announcement. Revenue growth deceleration, margin compression and weak results of the consumer printer sales would have a negative impact on the share price after the earnings announcement. Revenue growth (particularly materials revenue growth) and gross margin are the key metrics I will be looking at after the report is out, as well as the update on the consumer initiative. Wall Street has high expectations, which are reflected in the company's valuation. If the company falls short on what it promised, the share priced could be severely punished.Conclusion3D Systems is expected to report robust third quarter growth. We should see the first visible results of the enhanced consumer initiative, and accelerated growth in materials revenue. Although the accelerated revenue growth in the materials segment will bring gross margin expansion, this should be partly offset by increased R&D and sales and marketing spending. The key metrics to watch in the third quarter report are: revenue growth (particularly materials revenue growth, and consumer printer sales) and gross margin. High volatility after the report is to be expected, and the share price could be punished if the company falls short on what it promised.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1827492,56262,2013-11-11T00:55:13-05:00,,"Though the technology of 3D printing (additive manufacturing) is still in its early stages of development, many analysts are estimating that it will grow at a CAGR of 20%-30% for the next seven years and will nearly quadruple its value by 2020. It was widely assumed that the pioneer of the 3D printing industry, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), was well positioned to capitalize on this growth, but the impending arrival of another big-name player in the form of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) may restrict 3D Systems from fulfilling its potential.Why 3D Systems May Not Succeed3D Systems has to steer clear of many roadblocks before it can fulfill its potential, and the arrival of Hewlett-Packard has further added to those difficulties. I will tell you why I think HP can pose a major threat to all the existing 3D printing companies, but first let's take a look at the challenges faced by 3D Systems.High Time ConsumptionThe method of producing a simple product via 3D printing can consume plenty of time and can even last for a couple of days. By comparison, conventional industrial machines can churn out thousands of fully-finished products every day, and there's no way a present-day 3D printer can compete against that. Also, the fact that a 3D printer does not produce a fully-finished object and requires an extra step of removing the object from the printer, further delays the printing process.So, when analysts projected that the 3D printing market will be worth $12 billion by 2020, they assumed that additive manufacturing will replace the process of industrial production. However, given the fact that the industrial manufacturing process is a lot faster, this assumption seems irrational.High CostThe cost of setting up a traditional industrial machine is very high, but it makes up for it with its efficiency. This however, is not the case with 3D printers. Not only is a top-end 3D printer highly expensive, but the material used in printing is also not economical. And given the slow speed of 3D printers, spending over the odds for setting up multiple printers won't be considered profitable.Can Hewlett-Packard Dethrone 3D Systems?Hewlett-Packard's CEO, Meg Whitman, recently told the Canalys Channels Forum in Bangkok that the company is planning to enter into the 3D printing market by mid-2014. Whitman claimed that HP sees this industry as an exhilarating business opportunity and aims to become a leader in the 3D printing market.Though Whitman didn't reveal much information as to what 3D printing products HP will be offering, she stated that the company will focus on reducing the time consumption and bringing down the costs of 3D printers, which will give it a huge competitive advantage over 3D Systems.With a market cap of more than $49 billion, Hewlett-Packard will become the biggest player in the 3D printing industry. Therefore, the thought of producing faster and cheaper 3D printers isn't too far-fetched for HP as the company has enough resources to fund the Research and Development (R&D) of this technology. To put into perspective, HP spent more than $3.4 billion on R&D in the preceding year, therefore it's evident that the company will not shy away from spending on R&D once it enters the market.Furthermore, with more than $13 billion in cash, Hewlett-Packard can even consider acquiring other small name players like Arcam AB (OTC: OTCPK:AMAVF), Organovo (NASDAQ:ONVO), and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), which will diversify its product offerings. All these companies have an annual revenue of less than $50 million, but they are enhancing their revenues rapidly by improving their product offerings and may become a takeover target for Hewlett-Packard in the future.Also, the expiration of several key patents that prevent competition in the market for most advanced 3D printers means that HP will not have to spend a massive amount of time on creating more sophisticated high-resolution 3D models.3D Systems A Lost Cause?3D Systems will have to continue to innovate in order to fortify its position as the market leader. The company has been overindulged in acquisitions and has taken over 38 companies since 2011. This string of acquisitions has helped 3D Systems to improve its product offerings, and the latest acquisition of The Sugar Lab has further diversified its portfolio. So far, this tactic has been working well, but the company will have to lay more emphasis on technological innovations in order to proficiently challenge HP.Moreover, 3D Systems has added Seiko-I Infotech and Synnex Corporation to its list of global sellers. The company expects these additions to drive its sales in the future.Furthermore, HP doesn't appear to be targeting the home-consumer market, which plays to the advantage of 3D Systems as the company recently strengthened its position in the consumer market by launching two printers called Cube and CubeX. The company also strengthened its seller network by striking up a deal with Sindho Ink to distribute Cube, and CubeX printers in South Korea. This implies that 3D Systems' presence in the consumer market is prominent and this should help the company to perform better than its existing peers even after the arrival of HP.Comparing The FundamentalsAt present, 3D Systems is trading at roughly $70.40, and with a trailing P/E ratio of 152.38, it is obvious that the stock is expensive. By comparison, HP is trading at $25.94 and has a forward P/E ratio of 7.09. Therefore, investors looking to benefit from the 3D printing business will have an economical and more diversified option in the form of HP, when it enters the market. In addition, a high dividend yield of 2.40% will also tempt investors into buying HP's stock.ConclusionHewlett-Packard's entry into the 3D printing market is great news for the industry as a whole, but might upset the sales of all the existing players due to the aforementioned reasons. Since HP hasn't entered the market yet, investors should hold onto their 3D printing investments. But, if the company manages to ""walk the talk"", it will prove to be a better investment than 3D Systems. So, investors looking to profit from this industry should keep an eye on Hewlett-Packard as it has the potential to become one of the biggest companies of the industry.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1765612,56202,2013-10-23T16:37:33-04:00,,"Given the intense competition in the 3-D printing market, it can be a tricky task for investors to pick the right company. As of now, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is one of the best picks among all the 3-D printing companies. There are many big name players in the 3-D printing industry that can have a considerable influence on the performance of 3D Systems in the future, specifically General Electric (NYSE:GE).A New Customer?Last year, when General Electric acquired an additive manufacturing company called Morris Technology, it was widely assumed that GE would move into this lucrative market to challenge the existing 3-D printing companies. However, now it seems as if GE has no such plans, which is good news for the existing 3-D printing companies as they will not have to compete against GE. In fact, GE is planning to increase the practical uses of 3-D printing. The company has estimated that this technology will account for more than 50% of its manufacturing in a time span of 20 years. As of now, 3-D printing only accounts for about 10% of General Electric's manufacturing process, but this count is expected to grow 25% in 10 years.General Electric has been using 3-D printing for the manufacturing of fuel nozzles for the LEAP engine, which it manufactures for use in Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 737-MAX airliners. By expanding 3-D printing on an industrial scale, the company has been able to reduce time and money consumption significantly. This goes on to show that 3-D printing will evolve into the next-generation technology for wide-scale industrial production.As of now, GE has business segments in aviation, energy technology, and home and medical appliances. Therefore, GE's increased adoption of additive manufacturing should lead to an increase in demand for 3-D printers, which ultimately should benefit the printer makers.Short Sellers Not a ConcernHowever, an increasing amount of short sellers has instilled some fear in the company's investors. It won't be rational to buy a company with high short interest and blindly hope against all odds that the short sellers got it wrong. Despite the increasing number of short sellers, 3D Systems remains the pioneer of the 3-D printing industry due to its strong business structure. So, let's take a look at what the company is doing to expand its business. But first let's take a quick look at 3D Systems' short interest as compared to its peers.As made evident from the table above, though the short interest in 3D Systems is lower than ExOne, it is considerably higher than its primary rival Stratasys. The primary reason behind this rising short interest is shareholders' increasing concern about 3D Systems' acquisition moves. The company has spent lavishly on the acquisition of 38 companies, the latest one being The Sugar Lab, in order to add to its product offerings. 3D Systems has been issuing debt offerings and stocks to make up for the acquisition costs, which has further added to the woes of investors. Nonetheless, 3D Systems' debt seems to be controllable, primarily because of the huge growth opportunities in the 3-D printing industry.3D Systems is the leading player in the 3-D printing industry, which is projected to grow 200% by 2018. The company's earnings are estimated to attain growth rates well above the industry average. To capitalize on this growing industry, 3D Systems is working on product innovations. So far, in 2013, 3D Systems has launched four new printer products and nine new ProJet printers. To expand its presence in the consumer market, the company also launched Cube and CubeX. To guarantee the sale of these products, the company has been bolstering its worldwide reseller network. Over the last six months, the company has added Seiko-I Infotech and Synnex Corporation as global sellers and this is expected to boost its sales in the future.Conclusion3-D printing technology is still in an early stage of deployment, but the opportunities in this industry are massive. 3D Systems has been making the right moves to perform better than its peers. Therefore, I believe that the high short interest in the stock is unfair and the large proportion of the company's stock being sold short exposes to a short squeeze. But if 3D Systems is able to sustain the expansion of its international reseller network along with innovating new products, the short sellers will be forced to buy back the shares.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1720962,54222,2013-09-30T12:59:00-04:00,,"With time, 3D printing is expected to evolve into the next generation technology for industrial manufacturing. Over the years, 3D printing has witnessed the introduction of new technologies which has extended its utility from prototyping to digital manufacturing. Though this technology isn't new, the installation of the machines required high capital investment, but the introduction of new technologies has largely reduced the scale of capital investment required.Direct digital manufacturing has many benefits and this has resulted in increased demand in numerous industries. Due to growing demand, industry consultants estimate that the 3D printing market will grow at the rate of around 20% yearly.As a result, there's big opportunity for companies like 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS). ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) is another player in the 3D printing industry, but unlike 3D systems and Stratasys, the company hasn't been very consistent, missing earnings estimates in every quarter since it went public. Surprisingly, the market has overlooked ExOne's flaws and the stock has gained an impressive 70% so far this year.The 3D printing market is expected to be worth $6 billion by 2017. Credit Suisse started the coverage of the sector with a positive review and predicted that the growth of this segment may exceed the high end of consensus estimates. Let's see how the three players are positioned to benefit from this growth.3D Systems -- The one to buy3D Systems is Credit Suisse's top pick in the sector as it was initiated with an Outperform rating and a price target of $62. With a variety of products that cater to prototyping and the consumer segment of 3D printing and a wide range of technology and materials, 3D Systems is expected to attain growth rates well above the industry average. This is clearly seen in Yahoo! Finance estimates, which show that 3D Systems' earnings are expected to grow at an annual rate of 21.55% over the next five years while the industry growth is expected to average 16%.In addition, 3D Systems has been on an acquisition spree and has acquired 38 companies so far to further strengthen its position. The company has also released a variety of new products, such as advanced 3D printers and new software that have been received well in the market. Such moves helped 3D Systems record more than 100% increase in its printers and other products segment revenue to $54 million in the second quarter.Recently, the company also started selling its affordable Cube 3D printers at Staples. In addition, the company also announced that it has acquired a California-based start-up micro-design firm known as The Sugar Lab. The Sugar Lab specializes in the 3-D printing of real sugar and is driven by 3D Systems' Color Jet Printing technology. All these moves point to the fact that 3D Systems is trying to pursue all possible areas of growth in the 3D printing industry and that's why investors should take a closer look at it.Stratasys -- The one to watchStratasys' coverage was initiated with a Neutral rating with a price target of $103. The Credit Suisse team wrote,""Stratasys has undertaken some major portfolio moves in the past 12 months, including the merger with Objet Systems (which added the PolyJet printing method as well as a strong Far East sales presence) and the recently closed the acquisition of MakerBot (providing a strong position in consumer markets).""This acquisition will enable it to compete against 3D Systems in the rising consumer and desktop market, where its presence is still weak. Makerbot recently unveiled Digitizer, a desktop 3D scanner which will scan small objects to make digital 3D models. The machine will not only be extremely user-friendly, but will also cost a lot less than professional scanners. The benefits of Digitizer should increase its demand and will put in into direct competition with 3D Systems' Cube 3D printer.Stratasys has not performed upto the level of 3D Systems as its share price has gained just 30%. In addition, Credit Suisse's Neutral rating also suggests that it is not superior to 3D Systems. Moreover, its earnings are expected to grow at a CAGR of 10% over the next five years, which is pretty low. This expected growth rate is below the industry's average. However, the acquisition of MakerBot could help Stratasys fight off relatively strong competition going forward and it also gives it a good start in the consumer market as against 3D Systems.ConclusionAs mentioned earlier in this article, the opportunity in 3D printing is sizable and these two companies have been making some interesting moves to gain over one another. However, 3D Systems has been winning the battle so far. The company is profitable and has been making acquisitions to strengthen its market share. It is moving into the consumer market with Cube and analysts expect robust earnings growth in the future. Hence, I believe that Credit Suisse's Outperform rating on 3D Systems is justified and investors should consider it for their portfolio.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1738232,40031,2013-10-10T08:24:11-04:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) sold off over the last several days, following the general market's weakness caused by the government shutdown crisis and the debt ceiling deadline coming closer. A longer general market downtrend could cause a more severe correction of 3D printing stocks, although the decline is likely to end if the political crisis is resolved soon. However, recent developments in the 3D printing industry are mostly positive, and will help drive long-term growth for 3D Systems and other stocks in the group.General market weaknessThe market has punished the high beta growth stocks over the last several days, with some of them falling even 10% and 15% in only one trading session, although 3D printing stocks did not have such a severe decline. ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) was the exception, as it is trying to recover from a precipitous decline it suffered in September. Prolonged weakness of the general market will certainly have a negative impact on 3D Systems and other related stocks in the group.Source: Stockcharts.comGeneral Electric to expand the use of 3D printingGeneral Electric (NYSE:GE) is expanding the uses of 3D printing and expects the technology to be involved in more than half of its manufacturing in 20 years. GE uses less than 10% of 3D printing in its manufacturing processes today, but that share should rise to 20% to 25% in 10 years and 50% or more in 20 years, says Christine Furstoss, GE's technical director of manufacturing and materials technologies in an interview with IBD. Last year, GE aviation acquired additive manufacturing company Morris Technologies, a move that was perceived as a threat to 3D printing companies. But GE has no plans to make its own 3D printers at this point, which is positive for 3D Systems, Stratasys, ExOne and other companies in the industry, as they do not have to compete with GE.Stratasys enters China's 3D printing marketStratasys has signed an agreement with The Aurora Group, China's largest electronics and office supply retailer. Under the terms of the agreement, Aurora will be the exclusive distributor of Stratasys' Idea Series of professional desktop 3D printers. This deal gives Stratasys a major presence in China, which accounted for $163.4 million of the estimated $2.1 billion 3D printing market in 2012. China's 3D printing market is expected to exceed $1 billion in the next three years, and might become the World's largest 3D printing market by 2016.3D Systems is already present in China, and has expanded its presence in late July, with a distribution deal with Tianjin Real Estate Development Management. Tianjin has begun selling 3D Systems' complete portfolio of professional and personal 3D printers. Both 3D Systems and Stratasys have clearly recognized the importance of such a big and fast growing market, and should focus on capitalizing this great opportunity.Weak Cube sales?In late September, William Blair reiterated the underperform rating on 3D Systems, citing valuation concerns, and after sales checks with Staples. Analyst Brian Drab called 112 Staples stores to gauge sales volume and consumer interest in 3D Systems' Cube printer. He has been able to confirm the sale of only two Cube printers. It appears that consumer adoption of 3D printers is not going so well. However, this does not dismiss the consumer initiative, and the effects will have to be measured on a longer-term time frame.Valuation3D Systems is trading at 37 forward P/E, the same forward valuation as Stratasys. Professional uses of 3D printing will remain dominant in the future, and the consumer initiative is a bonus field, which will bring long-term results. My short-term price target is $60, based on my own estimate of $1.50 EPS for 2014, and a forward P/E of 40. The EPS estimate is above the Wall Street consensus estimates, and is based on the company's enhanced efforts on international expansion, with the latest acquisitions in U.K. and France, and on fast adoption and growth in China. With that in mind and the overall long-term industry growth, I believe that the future estimates will be raised as the adoption of the 3D printing technology expands to other fields and across other geographies.ConclusionThe 3D printing industry is in its early stages of growth, and revenue and profits should grow as product adoption expands. Although the indication of weak Cube sales is a cause for concern, it is still too early and we should not jump to conclusions over the short-term consumer efforts of 3D Systems. The long-term perspective for both personal and professional 3D printers is still quite positive, as evidenced in GE's prediction for the presence of 3D printing in future manufacturing. A presence in China, probably the fastest growing 3D printing market in the world, is very important, and both 3D Systems and Stratasys are making efforts to capitalize the opportunity. I believe that once the weight of the market is lifted, 3D Systems will turn higher again.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1712502,23469,2013-09-25T10:14:08-04:00,,"The difference between a great company with a growth and a great growth stock must be understood to determine investing in 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). Yesterday, we discussed DDD in our daily recap article after they received an upgrade. Right now, what we see is a very compelling business with a stock that has gotten ahead of itself. Moving forward, the key to 3D Systems to us is that the company is able to get into the consumer market as well as continue to expand their corporate partners. Right now, we believe that 3D Systems is overvalued for their potential growth over the next several years and that areas of growth offer lower margins as well are purely speculative in their success. Yet, we believe that two catalysts (consumer printing and industry consolidation), if they play out more quickly, could provide potential upside even from today's prices.The first major place of growth for 3D Systems is with the everyday consumer. Currently, the company does the majority of their business with advanced manufacturing companies and healthcare solutions. The future of 3D printing, though, will also expand into the consumer. Currently, 3D Systems offers the Cube to consumers. Starting at $1299, the printer is quite expensive and available in a limited number of retailers. Right now, the company is working with Staples to sell the product, but as of Q2's earnings call, it was only in select stores. The price point, further, is a concern for us. What can one do with the Cube?The company's slogan is ""Creativity reimagined"" for the Cube. Right now, the majority of what consumers can do is create simple objects like toys, small home goods (hangers, napkin rings, pencil holders), jewelry, and more. Additionally, products can be no larger than 5.5"" x 5.5"" x 5.5"". For now, clients get 25 free 3D files to print. On top of the $1299 price tag, though, materials are expensive as well as files for printing are not free past 25. How much are materials? A single cartridge costs $49. How much can you print with a cartridge? The company markets that you can make 30+ simple, small models and/or 13-15 cell phone cases. At current prices, we cannot see the consumer being completely satisfied with the limitations of designs and uses along with the cost.Moving forward, the company has to be able to bring this price level down as well as expand the amount of offerings that the printer can do. Advanced manufacturers are able to make more intricate parts, automotive solutions, prosthetics, dental models, prototypes, and even tools. The advanced technologies and materials of the higher end printers allows for a larger array of potential printing solutions. If people could quickly print screws, nails, office supplies, kitchen tools, and much more, these products would appeal to a wider audience. The problem is bringing down the cost and increasing the offerings.From Fortune:What is 3D Systems doing to battle this issue?They see the opportunity and are expanding their R&D, and we are confident that they will be able to get this problem solved. They have led the way for sub-$10,000 printers that can do very high-tech things, but consumers in high volumes cannot afford a $100 printer to print off trinkets and accessories.Further, what does the lower-end printers do to margins. Paul Coster, analyst at JPMorgan, asked a great question of the company in the last earnings call, noting that the company was seeing a decline in growth on materials as well as lower-priced systems becoming more popular. He questioned the margin mix. In response, Damon Gregoire, Senior VP and CFO, commented:So, the company does realize that they will see less materials bought on this end as well as the margins for them will likely be lower as the printers also have to be priced more cheaply. That issue is a big one we see for DDD that we do not believe is resolved at this time. For that reason, we believe a more cautious approach to growth should be used. The potential, though, is tremendous. A safe and inexpensive printer can be very popular, but the margin mix and ability to get to that level are still question marks.Another major development over the next several years should be a consolidation of the industry. 3D Systems and main competitor, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), have been on the acquisition binge. DDD has bought over fifteen companies since 2011, and that trend does not seem likely to stop. The company can easily purchase small outfits to improve certain devices, and this route could answer the consumer issue. Overall, though, the shrinkage of the industry is a big benefit for DDD and SSYS. As fewer players are in the market and the company horizontally integrates, these companies can lock out third parties, raise prices, and increase margins. Further, as the company does this, they increase their barriers to entry. Creating 3D printing technology and having smart teams of some twenty companies acquired over the past three years can create a lot of advantages.This macro-trend in 3D systems leads to some of the pricing that we are seeing for the companies, but at the same time, the trend is still going to take some years to play out. Additionally, we worry about other non-3D companies getting involved at some point. It would make sense for companies like Lexmark (NYSE:LXK) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) to get involved. They won't be interested in DDD and SSYS at these levels, so they will likely attack at the private level. Moves like this would be tougher for DDD and SSYS due to the brand name recognition and channels that LXK and HPQ already operate.At current pricing, we believe it's time to ""wait and see."" Using a 25-30% expectation for growth per year in current trends, we come up with a $36 level for the company. In order to see the current levels that DDD is priced at, the company would have to see operating income grow to over $400M by 2017, which is how much they currently make in revenue. The only way that level is achievable is that the company sees a growth in margins through consolidation of the market, increased material demand, and good consumer demand to increase volumes. To see even more upside than current prices, we are looking at some very lofty five-year goals. With a price/sales sitting at 12.5 and future P/E at 40+, this growth stock has fully priced in a lot of its growth and then some. Yet, if DDD can release a 3D printer that can attract a very strong consumer client base and can see more consolidation of the market, $55 could be cheap. For now, we are not willing to speculate about execution and would rather price again when more information is available.Price Target AnalysisStep 1.Project operating income, taxes, depreciation, capex, and working capital for five years. Calculate cash flow available by taking operating income - taxes + depreciation - capital expenditures - working capital.Step 2.Calculate present value of available cash flow (PV factor of WACC * available cash flow). You can calculate WACC, but we have given this number to you. The PV factor of WACC is calculated by taking 1 / [(1 + WACC)^# of FY years away from current]. For example, 2016 would be 1 / [(1 + WACC)^4 (2016-2012). WACC for PCLN: 10.0%Step 3.For the fifth year, we calculate a residual calculation. Taking the fifth year available cash flow and dividing by the cap rate, which is calculated by WACC subtracting out residual growth rate, calculate this number. Companies with high levels of growth have higher residual growth, while companies with lower growth levels have lower residual growth. Cap Rate for PCLN: 4.0%Step 4.Calculate Equity Value - add PV of residual value, available cash flow PVs, current cash, and subtract debt:Step 5.Divide equity value by shares outstanding:Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

In recent quarters, DDD has seen immense growths in both revenue and earnings, with analysts attributing that success to the growing consumer and commercial interest in 3D-printing, though DDD did disappoint investors in Q2 with low earnings. For this quarter, analysts predict that DDD will continue to grow. However, obstacles loom in the horizon as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) has announced an entrance into the 3D-printing frontier in 2014.3D Systems is expected to report FQ3 2013 earnings on October 29th before the market open. The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for DDD to report $0.27 EPS and $12.962B revenue while the current Estimize consensus from 16 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is $0.29 EPS and $13.087B revenue. The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case, we're seeing a greater differential between the Estimize and Wall Street numbers compared to previous quarters.Over the past four months, the Wall Street consensus trend for EPS has risen from $0.24 to $0.27, while Wall Street revenue expectations have increased from $11.516B to $12.962B. The Estimize EPS and revenue consensus have surged throughout the quarter with EPS going from $0.26 to $0.29 and revenue decreasing from $11.601B to $13.087B.Over the previous 6 quarters, DDD has beaten the Wall Street consensus for EPS 4 times while beating the Wall Street Revenue consensus 5 times. Over the same time period, DDD has beaten the Estimize EPS consensus 6 times and the Estimize Revenue consensus 6 times.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on Estimize range from $0.26 to $0.33 EPS and $13.200B to $13.523B revenues. We're seeing a smaller distribution of estimates for DDD this quarter than normal. The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A narrower distribution signaling the potential for greater volatility post earnings, a wider vice versa.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is Justin, who projects $0.29 EPS and $13.322B revenue. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by our deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy.With profits increasing over the last four quarters, all analysts are watching if 3D Systems can continue to reproduce their success. However, recently HPQ has looked to growing its legacy operation of printing -- and to HPQ, the most logical direction to go is into 3D printing. Analysts are now watching to see in future quarters if HPQ's decision to enter the arena will have any real ramifications upon DDD and its future earnings."
1719642,24491,2013-09-30T00:57:14-04:00,,"One of the reasons our members love us is that we tell the story through the numbers. Every income statement says something; every balance sheet has a history; and every cash flow statement reveals a firm's true intrinsic value. The numbers talk--and we think every investor should listen to them. Let's see what they say about 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD).For those that know us, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation and relative valuation versus industry peers is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to consider buying. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. It's a robust process, but also very simple one to interpret.For example, if a company is undervalued both on a discounted cash-flow basis and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. The higher the better. 3D Systems posts a VBI score of 6 on our scale--this reflects our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the firm, its unattractive relative valuation versus peers, and bullish technicals. In the spirit of transparency, we show how our scoring system works through the course of the inevitable equity price cycle (relative to a firm's fair value range):Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• 3D Systems earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 45.6% during the past three years.• 3D Systems is a leading provider of 3D content-to print solutions including 3D printers, print materials and on-demand custom parts services for professionals and consumers alike.• 3D Systems has a good combination of strong free cash flow generation and manageable financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 10.9% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 1.1 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 15.5%.• What once seemed like an unattainable pipe dream is now a very powerful means of production. 3D Systems is seeing strong demand from manufacturing customers, and the firm's consumer products have recently hit Staples' shelves with a positive reception from consumers.• The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 30.3% during the past 3 years. We expect its revenue growth to be better than its peer median during the next five years.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. 3D Systems' 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 45.6%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 11.6%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. 3D Systems' free cash flow margin has averaged about 14.5% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website. At 3D Systems, cash flow from operations increased about 67% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 150% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that 3D Systems' shares are worth $49 each, which represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 68.6 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 31.5 times last year's EBITDA. This doesn't look like a cheap valuation, but it is supported by our future operating assumptions.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 24.2% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 30.3%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 17.6%, which is above 3D Systems' trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 9.2% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For 3D Systems, we use a 11.6% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $49 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for 3D Systems. We think the firm is attractive below $32 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $66 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate 3D Systems' fair value at this point in time to be about $49 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of 3D Systems' expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $68 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $49 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1712492,40031,2013-09-25T10:12:56-04:00,,"In my last article on 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), I argued that the short-term picture for the stock was mixed, and the stock did not make much headway until recently. Volatility, which largely followed the stock since the start of the year, has decreased significantly, and the stock seems ready to go higher.Recent developmentsIn late August, 3D Systems acquired CRDM, a U.K. based provider of rapid prototyping and rapid tooling services. 3D Systems intends to immediately integrate CRDM into its global Quickparts Solutions custom parts and manufacturing services. With this acquisition, 3D Systems positioned itself in the U.K., and the management considers it as a strategic and geographically important addition. The company is making efforts to position itself in Europe, as it acquired French 3D printer maker Phenix Systems in June.3D Systems has grown significantly through acquisitions, the latest being the 37th acquisition since 2009. The company may be stretching itself, as it intends to be ""Jack of all trades"" in the 3D printing business, which leaves it vulnerable to more specialized competitors, which might make better products and services. However, this strategy did not hurt the company yet, and the results are great so far.Bursting the bubble theoryAs 3D Systems is reaching new all-time highs, the valuation remains the main cause of concern for investors. These stocks trade at a very high forward valuation: 3D Systems trades at a forward P/E of 42, Stratasys' forward P/E is 41, and Exone's 109, so the future expectations are quite high. But the price remains the supreme fundamental, and it is telling us right now that the future is looking bright and investors are feeling confident that these stocks can live up to their expectations. 3D printing industry remains in the early stages of growth, and it is normal to pay a premium in order to participate. Another important fact is that these companies are investing heavily into expansion and that is another reason why the earnings are practically non-existent at the moment. When these companies reach their mature stage, the profit margins will expand and the valuation at that time will be much lower, as it is with the majority of mature companies.Stratasys led the way higher in August, it's 3D Systems' turn nowStratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) began its move higher after reporting earnings and revenue above estimates in early August. I noted in my early April article that this seems to be the pattern for the two stocks before they make their respective moves higher. As of early September, Stratasys corrected sharply on a negative WSJ column, arguing technological limitations will continue to hinder the mass production of many 3D printed objects, and also the high material costs and limited use of 3D printers. Subsequent drop in share price of 3D printing stocks was followed by secondary offerings from Stratasys and Exone (NASDAQ:XONE). 3D Systems took the leadership role and made new all-time highs this week, which is also consistent with the previous performance patterns, as they showed that 3D Systems took the leadership in the later stages of their respective rallies. 3D Systems has done very well when the group movement is taken into account, and has shown relative strength.DDD data by YChartsExone, the best performer in the group since the February IPO, has been the weak link in the last few weeks. In late August, the company announced a secondary offering, with insiders selling the larger part of the 2.7 million offering. Exone is now almost 40% below its all-time highs. The market has largely ignored the company's two disappointing earnings reports, at least until the secondary offering was announced. Another possible source of pressure for Exone was the lockup expiration on August 30, with 7 million shares coming out of lockup.Conclusion3D Systems seems ready to go higher. The company's acquisition strategy has been very successful so far, and the valuation concerns are overblown since 3D industry is in the early stages of growth. 3D Systems is positioning itself in Europe with two strategic acquisitions of Phenix in France and CRDM in United Kingdom. One thing that could drag 3D Systems down near-term is the weakness of Stratasys and Exone, since their correlation is quite high.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in DDD over the next 72 hours.

1687432,38201,2013-09-11T12:03:14-04:00,,"Over time, 3D printing, a process of making a three-dimensional object from a digital model, is expected to evolve into the next generation technology for manufacturing. Though, this technology is not a new phenomenon and the companies have been using this for prototyping and modeling their products since its inception in 1984, these machines required high capital investment.With the passage of time, 3D printing has seen the introduction of new technology, which has expanded its use from prototyping, to direct digital manufacturing, which is the process of making the finished product directly through 3D printing. Additionally, it has reduced the capital investment required for these printers.Direct digital manufacturing is cost effective, efficient, and can make complex design products. Looking at its benefits, industries like aerospace, automotive, consumer products, electronics, and defense manufacturing companies have started adopting digital manufacturing in their production processes.The research firm Wohlers Associates and Citigroup estimates that this technology could manufacture 50% of jet engine parts. This demand growth has created a new opportunity for 3D Systems (DDD), which is a pioneer in 3D printers.Survival of the fittest Adoption of direct digital manufacturing by more industry verticals has resulted in the demand for 3D printers, which manufacture parts to the customer's requirement. 3D printing technology is the future of product development; manufacturers can incorporate advanced design development into their manufacturing. The 3D printing market has witnessed a transformation from complicated to user-friendly machines. The application of these machines has extended from industrial bases to households.Looking at this demand growth, 3D Systems has been implementing initiatives to target a larger chunk of the 3D market. The company is a global 3D printing solution provider specializing in selling 3D printers and producing customized parts services. The company ranked fifth among the latest Forbes top 100 growing companies.So what makes 3D Systems a powerful name in the 3D printing arena? Well, the answer lies in the company's expertise in 3D printing, which capitalizes on growth in prototyping and the direct digital manufacturing market. The company has a wide range of products that cater to prototyping, direct digital manufacturing, and the consumer segment of 3D printing.To enhance its product offering, the company has been acquiring companies in the 3D space. The most recent acquisition was CRDM, which is U.K.'s leading provider of 3D printers, rapid prototyping, and rapid tooling services to sectors like automotive, aerospace, medical, and defense. Rapid tooling is the process of making a customized part of a model using computer aided designs. The company will integrate CRDM's services into its global Quickparts Solutions, which develops custom manufactured parts. CRDM's clients in the automotive industry include Formula 1, Aston Martin, and McLaren, while in its aerospace sector it has clients like Rolls-Royce. This acquisition will expand 3D Systems' product offerings and its footprint in the U.K.As per the Vice President and General Manager of Quickparts Solutions, 3D Systems,The global 3D printing market reached $2.2 billion last year, and it is expected to surpass $6 billion by 2017, as per Wohlers Associates report. Therefore, we are expecting that 3D Systems will leverage CRDM's expertise and customer base in the prototyping market for capitalizing on 3D printing market growth. The company reported 45% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of this year, and with its initiatives, this growth is expected to sustain in the future.Stratasys (SSYS) is another major player strategizing this 3D printing market growth. The biggest initiative was the completion of its $403 million merger with Makerbot in August of this year. Makerbot is a leading provider of desktop 3D printers, which are popular among households, entrepreneurs, small businesses, and designers, looking for a powerful 3D printer. This acquisition will set the stage for Stratasys to compete in the growing consumer and desktop market segment, where it has low presence since it previously focused on large industrial houses. Makerbot recently launched Digitizer, a desktop 3D scanner used to scan small objects to make digital 3D models.This machine's biggest advantage is that it is user friendly and can be operated by anybody irrespective of his/her understanding of 3D modeling software. Therefore, this machine can be used anywhere.Apart from its user friendly appeal, these printers cost much less than professional scanners. Professional scanners cost around $10,000 per unit and are complicated to operate. Looking at the 3D printing market growth, Makerbot can expect demand growth for its new Digitizer due to its various benefits. Acquisition of Makerbot puts Stratasys in direct competition with 3D Systems in the consumer segment. But, with the market leadership of Makerbot in the desktop segment, and its new product launch, Stratasys is set to give 3D Systems a tough fight.Another player in the 3D printers segment, ExOne (XONE), announced expansion of its production capacity through opening a new plant in Germany. This plant is expected to be operational by the end of 2014. We expect this new facility to provide double the capacity compared to the current capacity at its five leased facilities. This initiative will support the company's growth strategy to expand its footprint in the 3D printers segment, which 3D Systems and Stratasys currently dominate.Peer analysis among 3D market 3D Systems and Stratasys control most of the 3D printing market and are the biggest players in this segment, followed by a small concentration of other companies like ExOne, which is into 3D printers for design and development of industrial prototypes. Although 3D Systems and Stratasys control the market, ExOne's growth initiatives are expected to increase its presence in the market. Let's take a look at these three stocks' valuation to find future growth potential.All three companies' expected future performance is in line with the growth in 3D printing market. According to their P/E comparison, Stratasys and ExOne, which currently have negative EPS for trailing 12 months, are expected to generate earnings in the coming months. Looking at their forward P/E, all three companies are expected to increase their earnings, but 3D Systems and Stratasys are showing much more dispersion in their forward P/E metric as compared to ExOne, which indicates that investors can expect additional earnings growth from these stocks. This signifies the market leadership of both companies in the 3D market.Conclusion: Growth in the 3D printing market provides ample revenue growth opportunity for both 3D Systems and Stratasys. Looking at the current competition among 3D Systems and Stratasys, we feel that 3D Systems has an upper edge as its products provide an opportunity for growth in all three segments i.e. prototyping, digital manufacturing, and consumer. Acquisition of Makerbot provides Stratasys an opportunity to drive the consumer segment market, where it had low presence previously.We are expecting that both companies will perform in line with the market expectation and have capitalized on 3D printing market growth with their initiatives. Therefore, we are expecting both companies to compete neck in neck.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1668402,36191,2013-09-02T02:43:21-04:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) are dominant market players in the 3D printing industry, an industry acknowledged by investors for high margins and currently in a rapid growth phase. The growth of both companies relies on product development through research and development, as well as through vertical and horizontal integration via acquisition and mergers.3D printing giants, both DDD and SSYS, are aggressive in acquisitions for attracting potential investors. My article reveals the key factors for both companies showing future growth via acquisition. What are the internal and external resources needed to generate cash for expansion while safeguarding the shareholders' confidence and keep attracting their interest? The topic highlights each company's acquisition strategy which was in line with the existing business model and to foresee the impact of future sustainability of both companies.3D Systems Up for Additional Subscription of $300 million Common Stock for ExpansionOver the last three years DDD acquired twenty eight businesses worth $295.6 million, and the major cash generated was from the issuance of additional common stock, made possible because of high investor confidence in the consistent industry growth and their trust in DDD's business model.In the robust 3D printing sector, DDD has set the stage to issue additional common stock worth $300 million for 2013 and onward, backed by investors' high level of expectations that the money invested is a good bet with DDD.Generally, when an industry is in a growth phase, especially IT firms, most of the companies temporarily take a negative hit on EPS due to massive cash outflows and dilution of EPS. Luckily DDD's strategy in adding new products has not put any negative impact on EPS as the company's core products are still producing high margins and allowing the new products to settle in.The graphs below depict a brighter picture of the company in terms of increasing acquisitions that have been consistently taking full advantage of the demand in the market.Stratasys Took Highest Jump in AcquisitionsStratasys took the highest jump in acquisitions among its competitors by giving a firm commitment to buy MakerBot, tying up the 3D printer maker with a deal valued up to $604 million. An important aspect to note is that this was the industry's first large deal and has been undertaken by SSYS.SSYS is confident that it will have a full subscription of 4.8 million additional shares of common stock valued at a price of $84.60 per share. The subscription will raise an additional $403 million followed by 2.4 million additional shares valued at $201 million based on MakerBot's performance through the end of 2014. MakerBot's Replicator 2 Desktop 3D Printers were priced at $2,199, and the MakerBot Digitizer Desktop 3D Scanners -- at $1,400. The company expects to provide additional revenue of approximately $30.8 million by the end of this year.SSYS is well positioned to honor its commitment on its financial statement 2012 by carrying $113 million in cash to move forward to buy MakerBot. During the last three years SSYS was engaged in a close competition with DDD in business acquisitions and invested $61.8 million in the years 2010 and 2011, and still has cash available to proceed with the MakerBot buy worth $403 million.Net Cash flows from investing activities for acquisitionSource: Company's FinancialsLooking at the numbers, it is evident that SSYS's acquisitions are being managed better than its competitor because the company paid less and received more in revenues.Net increase in additional revenue from acquisition Source: Company's FinancialsThe past three years' data reveals that DDD's net cash flows were consistently positive, with the major contributions to the cash flows coming from financing activities in 2011 and 2012. In the year 2011, $148.96 million was raised through convertible notes proceeds and the issuance of common stock worth $62.05 million in the same year. $106.8 million was raised in 2012 from issuance of additional common stock.Net cash flowSource: Company's FinancialsWhat is Hidden Treasure for 3D Printing Industry?In my last article on ""3D System Set to Make Investors Very Happy - Part 2"", I highlighted the geographical presence of the 3D printing segment in which the lowest revenue generated was from Asian and Pacific countries. A region having ¾ of the world's population would be the biggest market for 3D printing moving forward.Manufacturing countries well known for their reverse engineering production methods, including China and Japan, are on top of the list and would be the biggest markets for 3D printers and software followed by India, Indonesia and Russia. I expect these markets have a potential to generate similar revenues as those of the USA and Europe.As this article covers the strategic growth of the companies through mergers and acquisitions, we can briefly consider the performance of both companies.SSYS reported a massive increase in sales by 82.45% compared to last year from its acquisition and mergers vs. DDD, which recorded a growth in sales of 17.71% in the last twelve months.DDD's EPS clocked in at 0.45 trailing twelve months, which shows the company's core products are efficiently supporting the company's net income while allowing new products and businesses to synchronize with the existing business model and not compromising its EPS. It has also been witnessed that the company's growth in sales is not that impressive compared to SSYS, whereas the industry's rapid growth may create an opportunity for DDD to tap into new markets.ConclusionIn connection with the above facts I maintain my ""BUY"" stance on DDD shares. The rationale behind my buy call is dependent upon DDD's efficiency in skimming high margins from its core products while the acquisition of new businesses puts minimal strain on the company's net cash flows.

If investors are expecting the kind of returns that Apple achieved from 2007-2012, they are probably going to have to look elsewhere as smartphones and tablets are nearly commoditized. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) should provide more successful products but that does not mean they will have an impact to the degree the iPhone and Android had on the lives of consumers and the economy.As when chips and desktops became commoditized after the tech bubble of the 90s, it may take a quantum leap in technology to ignite the present economy and market. The inconspicuously titled ""3-D Printing"" industry shows the potential to provide that leap forward. Describing these revolutionary devices as ""printers"" minimizes their significance. ""Printers"" print ink on materials for reading or viewing. What comes out of these devices are not pamphlets, books or photos.3-D printing, also called Additive or Rapid Manufacturing is defined by Wikipedia as a process of making a three-dimensional solid object of virtually any shape from a digital model. 3D printing is achieved using an additive process, where successive layers of material are laid down in different shapes. 3D printing is also considered distinct from traditional machining techniques, which mostly rely on the removal of material by methods such as cutting or drilling (subtractive processes).Some analysts contend that it may take a while before 3-D printing will replace modern manufacturing. That's a reasonable supposition but it doesn't need to ""replace"" modern manufacturing to experience tremendous growth. This caution discounts the entrepreneurial and creative spirit. Entrepreneurs have a propensity to develop new ideas for the utilization of new technology that critics and analysts rarely envision.As an example of creative and utilitarian usage of new tech, I came across this 3D printable cast:(No more having to shove a ruler down that old primitive cast when your broken arm itches)A catalyst to new markets When Apple's iPhone came out in 2007, it launched a new corollary industry that we affectionately call ""apps"". Millions of entrepreneurs arose around the globe creating new applications. Some apps entertain us and others make daily tasks easier, convenient and more efficient.I've heard investors ruminate upon the wealth they could have acquired had they invested in Apple in 2007 when iPhone was launched. 3-D manufacturing may well be a greater opportunity. The iPhone created global opportunities for millions of entrepreneurs to invent and easily get their apps to market. It became a ""virtuous cycle"". As those millions of new apps were made for the iPhone, it in turn made the iPhone all the more desirable to consumers. In a similar way to what the iPhone accomplished, 3-D manufacturing is beginning to launch many innovative products and companies.It is the Jetson-esque technology that science-fiction has long predicted.  Early in Internet history, one of the major problems I had with Internet retailers like Amazon.com was that (in my opinion) they were little more than glorified catalogs. I shorted Amazon back in 2002 for that reason. On November 21, 2002 I posted a blog about Amazon.com titled www.HYPE.com in which I wrote:I was dead-wrong on the Amazon call but the point is that ""teleportation"", which I emboldened in the AMZN post, for many products is here. This technology comes pretty close to the actual definition (linked). Not all products will be conducive to this technology but plenty are and millions more will be when entrepreneurs tap into this opportunity just like with apps. It is not difficult to see millions of entrepreneurs and companies selling their products digitally on websites like that of Amazon and having them download to their manufacturing devices in their homes. Subsequently, this could eventually impact UPS and FedEx in a way similar to the impact e-mail had on the United States Postal Service.As with many revolutionary pieces of technology, they are not immediately adopted by the masses; however, they are being sold at retail stores now and The UPS Store has recently begun offering 3-D printing services in-store. Such services may help fill the gap as the equipment gradually comes down in price and the technology improves.There are several major players within this industry and consolidation is naturally taking place. To name a few leaders they are 3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD), Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS), ExOne Co. (NASDAQ:XONE).The company in this sector that I am long as an investor is 3D Systems Corp. 3D Systems is a leader and has been acquiring smaller companies in the space. 3D Systems has been acquiring smaller players within the industry and may look attractive to larger companies seeking to reinvent themselves, especially a company that is well known for their ""printers"". After it fell asleep during the slow death of the PC (due to growth in usage of mobile devices), I would not be surprised to see HP make major acquisitions in this industry, in effect consolidating the consolidator into the HP fold.Acquisition speculation aside, nothing can be more obvious than the fact that this industry is a major part of our future. The nature of technology is and always has been to get better year by year and simultaneously become less expensive year by year. This industry is beginning to provide the next quantum leap that many investors are seeking.Defining it is one thing, seeing it in action is another.

In my article I plan on discussing the current players, and where the market may be heading and the best way to play it.Though the 3D printing space is still in its infancy, it is already having a major impact. Some of the uses for 3D printing are obvious while others are still waiting to be discovered.CommercialThe commercial 3D printing space can be used to revolutionize the concept of business. There is no longer a need for finished inventory, and when the products are ""created"" they can be designed specifically towards the customer (at no extra cost to the manufacturer). As the technology develops, so will the implementations and market, but for the time being it is already having a major impact.Invisalign (NASDAQ:ALGN) is showing how 3D technology can revolutionize an industry. The old metal braces are now out of use, with a great idea and the use of 3D printers. Now, your dentist can customize plastic aligners to fit exactly your mouth, which are replaced every several weeks for a cheap price.3D printers are also revolutionize the entertainment and movie business. Companys can now create a single 3D model, which can be molded to a full size mannequin and computer animation, as well as being used to create miniature models of the character. 3D printers are a great way of creating miniature models, lowering costs and allowing differentiation between models.Future Commercial UsesThe future of 3D printers is unknown, but part of it is coming into the light. Companies like Organovo (NASDAQ:ONVO) are using 3D printers to replicate human cells, and even organs, to help patients overcome certain diseases. 3D printing offers a distinct advantage over other treatments, as the human tissue is cloned/formed directly from the patients own cell(s).3D printers can even be used to replicate edible food, with the same taste, texture, and juices. Using 3D printers, chefs can prepare novelty and specialty dishes at the fraction of the cost and time (and even offer bigger portions). Perhaps the biggest future potential for 3D printers is in your own house...Consumer3D printers are a relatively new technology, and considered by many to big the next ""big breakthrough"". Imagine being able to create your own toys, food, or even furniture right from your house! The uses aren't the question - the question is how to get it into your house...There are many 3D printer companies, but I will analyze those with the biggest potential and a means of getting there:*Trailing Twelve Months (NYSE:TTM)The companies which have the most potential are those which are currently profitable on growing revenue. The main contenders for this title is 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) Organovo : 3D systems is growing revenue rapidly, and trades at a more realistic multiple (based on sales), while Organovo is currently a smaller company which will make it harder to expand. 3D Systems has the ""first mover's advantage"" spending millions on M&A, capturing strategic companies (as well as Stratasys which acquired MakerBot) like RPDG (manufacturing models using 3D printers for customers) and 81% of Pheonix Systems (metal printing solutions).3D Systems also founded Geomagic 3D Solutions (content to print solutions) and added to its Quickparts program in the most recent quarter. Quickparts is a special service launched by 3D systems (similar to 3-Ders.org) in which customers can buy 3D designs for certain parts that they need. Also in the quarter 3D Systems announced a partnership with Deloitte to ""accelerate adoption and implementation of advanced design and manufacturing solutions."" They are working to create a distinct advantage over their competitors:Currently, most of the 3D printer sales are in the commercial world. Companies compete by both services and materials. ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) has the ability to use both metal and glass for their 3D printers, while Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) has implemented their 3D printers for aerospace and architectural purposes.Why is this important for 3D Systems? 3D Systems is expanding both their product and service revenues through these mergers and acquisitions, trimming competitors' advantages. By being able to choose from multiple materials, for multiple uses, with multiple disegins, from multiple locations, 3D Systems will be the place to go for 3D printing. In the most recent quarter ending on June 30, 2013, 3D Systems earned more than $37 Million in service revenue - with the extension of Quickparts and Geomagic, the numbers are only due to increase. The great thing about the service revenue is that they already have the customer base in place, as well as the service, which allows them to earn a large amount of perpetual income.The majority of 3D System's revenue comes from their products which also come with high 60% margins which might drop with their growth. They are expanding aggressively into consumer printers through retail partners like Staples - while the potential is there, the margins on the printers are lower.Their revenue is expanding aggressively, but so is their spending and share count - much of the increase in spending is for SG&A, but the increase in R&D shows that 3D Systems is focusing in on their future.While the current evaluation of the stock might be a little lofty to some, it is one of the best ways to play the fast growing ""3D printing"" space... not only do they have the current prospects, but they are also positioning themselves for aggressive growth in the very near future - just like the 3D printing market.With a forward P/E of 37, and a short interest of more than 26%, there are many doubters. But when you look at the expected 24% revenue increase, and $350 Million in cash on the balance sheet, they are in a position for strong growth. Through their partnerships and M&A they are alligning themselves to be a major contender in the personal and commercial printing markets. While there is downside, 3D Systems is helping to create the building blocks for the entire industry, forming a new face for 3D printing.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1668392,54282,2013-09-02T02:37:15-04:00,,"According to Wall Street, 3D printing seems to be all the craze these days. Some of the hottest buzzwords this past spring were ""3D Printing"" and ""Additive Manufacturing"". Until recently, ""Additive Manufacturing"" was the more common of the 2 phrases. I would attribute that to the end users of the product, which for the last 23 years have been mostly large manufacturing corporations.I know you are thinking that there was a typo in that last paragraph - he must have meant 2 or 3 years, not 23. I started my initial research into the 3D printing area in October 2012, based on a bullish article that I read from Investors Business Daily.Upon researching the sector, I was surprised to learn that 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), the leading firm in the 3D printing revolution, has been a public company since November 1990. That's right, for over 23 years. That is right around when I got my first computer, with a 386 processor and 2 megabytes of motherboard RAM, a real burner at the time! And to think they were already ""3D printing""! It was hard to grasp at first that this sort of cool technology has been around for so many years and this was the first that I had heard of it, especially since I do consider myself an ""early adopter"" when it comes to new gadgets and electronics.Here is a 20 year, weekly candlestick chart for 3D Systems, just in case you think I'm full of bologna. images Some of the other players in the 3D printing arena are Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and The ExOne Company (NASDAQ:XONE). The ExOne Company is the newest player into the arena as the just had their initial public offering this year in February 2013. What a perfect time to have your IPO - in one of the hottest market sectors at the time. Simply brilliant.While the entire 3D sector is still hot, this article will focus on the sector leader, 3D Systems. One of the lessons I learned from Investors Business Daily a couple of years ago is to focus on the leader in the sector - one strategy that has definitely worked well for me.So if 3D printing has been around for more than 20 years, why has interest, as well as the share price, skyrocketed in only the last couple of years? Well, one of the first reasons I can think of when looking at their income statements is their accelerating revenue as seen in this next table.Now that is what I call some growth and it is getting better each year. We will come back to this superb growth in just a bit.So let's take a peek at just these last three years of accelerating revenue on the next chart to see how it has affected the share price. The next chart is a 3 year weekly candlestick chart. I like to look at weekly candlestick charts when analyzing long term trends as the weekly charts tend to remove most of the day to day ""noise"" and make it easier to see a stock's trend. Remember the old saying ""a stock's trend is your friend""? I want to make friends with 3D Systems.The first thing that catches my attention on the above chart is that if I want to purchase shares of 3D Systems, I sure will be paying a premium price for them. The highest closing share price on 3D Systems' first uptrend was $46.05 - that is where I drew the trend line on the above chart. If you want to learn more about trend lines, click here. After rebounding from a sharp correction, there has been quite a bit of consolidation above this level, a very bullish signal from a technical perspective.But increasing share prices usually don't happen without great fundamentals. So as I kept perusing the income statement, another item caught my eye - the net income for common shareholders. Although, this caught my eye in a negative way. The next chart shows decelerating earnings each of the last 2 years. That means that all of those accelerating top line revenue we discussed above isn't flowing to the bottom line. The year ended December 31, 2012 looks particularly horrible - the earnings grew by a ""paltry"" 10% compared to the prior year.Well, in performing my due diligence and reading several articles over the last few months, this article in particular from Investors Business Daily stood out and caught my attention.The article talks about rolling out the 3D printers to the consumer market. I know there are several costs associated with rolling out any new product to the consumer market. I am certain this has to be a reason as to why the margins were hit during the year ended December 31, 2012 and the net income only grew by 10% for the year as compared to 2011. If margins can start to expand again while revenue is accelerating, whoa boy! That sounds like a winning formula for it's share price! It also sounds like a plan to keep revenue accelerating in the near future, deploying the printers to the consumer market through big box retailers.I read in another article during my research, this one from Seeking Alpha, that expanding the line-up of materials that the printers can print with will help drive margins as well. There are specialty materials that command higher prices and produce higher margins. Improving margins can help make more of the accelerating revenue make it to the bottom line and should help boost the share price further. Higher earnings usually equate to higher share prices.Speaking of the share price, where is 3D Systems share price currently at? Well, let's look at the next chart, a 6 month daily candlestick chart.The last three months appear to have been a period of consolidation as the share price has mostly moved sideways, that was until just recently. On August 26, 2013, Ken Wong from Citi initiated coverage on DDD as seen on this real-time Seeking Alpha update and started with a $60 price target. 3D Systems popped on the news and it's share price started climbing on strong volume. 3D Systems closed today at a new 52 week closing high of $52.91.Like I mentioned earlier, if you want to purchase shares of 3D Systems, you will be paying top dollar for these shares. That sure makes investing in 3D Systems at these prices a little more risky. But where there is risk, there could also be a reward. When I want to purchase a hot stock in a hot sector, I use a scaling strategy to enter into a position.An example of a scaling strategy I use is as follows: let's say I want to own $10,000 worth of 3D Systems in total. Well, I would split that up into 3 separate buys, purchasing 25% of the shares I want in total in the first buy (which would be $2,500), 50% of the shares I want in total in the second buy ($5,000) and then the remaining 25% of the shares I want in the last buy ($2,500). Preferably, I am making each purchase at a higher price as the stock is trending upwards rather than averaging down as the share price is falling. I try to space my purchases approximately 2-3% apart from each other. The point of this type of trading philosophy is that I want to see positive chart action before I make each subsequent purchase. By the time I am making my second purchase, I should have more confidence and possibly confirmation of the stock's trend.How many times have you bought a stock only to see it go down soon after? I know I have. But if you had at least used the scaling strategy I described above, you would have only been 25% invested with your first purchase rather than fully invested. As I mentioned above, I prefer to make purchases while the share price is increasing and volume is climbing, not as the share price is falling. If the share price is falling and volume is increasing, there is a good chance those shares will be under water for the near future. If that is the case, I will then wait for a confirmation of the new uptrend before making any purchases at lower prices. I would rather miss a few percentage points as the stock starts to rebound than trying to catch the proverbial ""falling knife"" and end up further under water.So is 3D Systems worth the hypothetical $10,000 investment? Well, this is where I want to get back to the accelerating revenue in my first table above. Let's see how 3D Systems revenue looks on a quarterly basis so far in 2013.Revenue growth continues to be strong for the first two quarters of 2013. And if the consumer roll out of 3D printers works as anticipated during the 2nd half of 2013, 3D Systems could be poised to continue the streak of accelerating revenue in the near future. If 3D Systems can execute on top line growth, it's share price will follow as well. If they can increase their margins, that is a bonus. I have confidence in management's ability to execute on these fronts.Much of this article focuses on the upside potential, so let's look at a few downside risks now. What if management is not able to deliver accelerating growth due to slow consumer adoption? Will investors run for the exits? Maybe. Maybe not. I cannot predict the future but there is one thing I can assure you, I will be talking with the employees at my local Staples store to try and help gauge the consumer interest in the product at least on a monthly basis for the next few months. Now this won't necessarily be a representative sample of all Staples stores, but it could help to give me assurances during a time period when I expect 3D Systems share price to experience some volatility as it makes new 52 week highs like it did earlier this week.High growth companies require lots of re-investment of capital to continue the growth, as we have seen in the above table which highlights the decelerating earnings. This pattern could continue for another few quarters due to the massive roll-out of the 3D printers to the consumer market that I talked about earlier, thus continuing the streak of decelerating earnings, another potential risk.This sector has also been under a lot of consolidation as most smaller rivals continue to be acquired by either Stratasys or 3D Systems. While acquisitions tend to fuel growth, they usually take time to have an accretive affect on earnings. Matter of fact, earnings usually take a hit in the short-term upon acquiring another company. This could also negatively affect earnings in the short-term.However, despite these risks, I am confident that 3D printing is here to stay and is the future for small manufacturing, entrepreneurs, and now the ""general"" public. I am so confident, that I have already scaled into my position.Until my next article, good luck investing. I hope you enjoyed my first Seeking Alpha article!Disclosure: I am long DDD.

1654962,20568,2013-08-23T17:42:00-04:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is a remarkable technology company that holds many of the first patents on an amazing technology. Three-dimensional ""printing"" as it's called uses computer-aided design and manufacturing applications to recreate objects from a software blueprint, using special polymers to that are added in precise layers. In the industry, this technology is referred to as ""additive manufacturing.""I first discovered the company in January 2012 when a friend told me to watch a video of how one of the company's industrial-strength printers could replicate a working adjustable wrench in a few hours just from scanning its dimensions with their proprietary technology. The multiplicity of uses for aerospace, automobiles, and other durable goods in constant need of lighter and stronger parts seemed obvious.Game-Changing ""Wow!""One of the most exciting applications of the technology, I thought, was in medicine where doctors and scientists would be able to create precision anatomical/biological aids and replacement parts. Then I learned the company was launching a home version of their printer for about $1,200 with an online resource for ""design democracy"" and collaboration.I immediately went and bought the stock at $16 and traded it three times for average swing gains of 25% each last year. As you may know, the competition has been a hot story as well, with Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) moving from $40 to $105 in these same 20 months. This week, I almost bought DDD again because I liked the way the chart is consolidating between $44 and $50, threatening an upside breakout like so many others this year. In fact, DDD's chart looks a lot like that of Green Mountain Coffee (NASDAQ:GMCR) since May. GMCR just broke out above $82 this week.But then I took a look at the Zacks Rank for DDD, which dropped to a No. 5 Strong Sell this month. Upon further investigation, I found that the company has hit some bumpy patches in their growth story that caused at least two analysts to lower earnings estimates. The analysts are concerned about acquisition costs, sales growth execution, and R&D spending.Here are the EPS estimate tables that describe what's happened with the earnings outlook into next year:Click to enlarge image.Second-Quarter DetailsAlthough they missed the EPS consensus by 4 cents (18%), 3D reported overall solid second-quarter results on July 30. Revenue increased 44.5% year over year to a record high of $120.8 million, as all product categories contributed positively for an overall organic growth of 30.1%. That top-line number beat the consensus by $5 million.Revenues for 3D printers and other products more than doubled to $54.2 million from the year-ago quarter, print materials revenues grew $3.1 million to $29.3 million, and services revenues improved $6 million to $37.3 million. Healthcare solutions revenues increased 55% in the reported quarter, contributing about $18.9 million to total revenues.The healthy revenue growth is attributable to new product launches that were well-accepted by the market, resulting in a strong demand pull. During the reported quarter, 3D Systems introduced significant new products including professional 3D printers, advanced 3D print materials, and powerful new designer software packages.Despite a nearly twofold rise in research and development expenses in the quarter, 3D Systems recorded a gross profit increase of 46% year over year, while gross profit margin expanded 40 basis points to 51.8%. Management believed that the growth reflected the inherent strength of the diversified portfolio of the company, productivity of its sales channels, and effectiveness of its strategic initiatives to continuously focus on R&D and marketing program.Net income for the reported quarter was $9.3 million or 10 cents per share, compared with $8.3 million or 11 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. Although the absolute earnings increased year over year, it declined on a per share basis due to higher number of shares outstanding for the reported quarter. Excluding non-recurring items, earnings for second quarter 2013 were $18.9 million, or 18 cents per share, compared with $13.9 million, or 18 cents, in the year-ago quarter. The recurring earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by four cents.Cash flow from operating activities for the first half of the year was $12.8 million compared with $21.4 million in the prior-year period. Cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end was $349.3 million.Solid Growth, but Expectations Were HighFrom the subsequent downward estimate revisions, it's clear that the analysts were looking for more in this report. JPMorgan analysts pick 3D Systems as the leader in the space with 20%-plus CAGR growth and improving visibility and margins from a shift to materials and design ""authoring"" services.But they also see some execution challenges causing the company to need to raise R&D spending, so the analysts are keeping their price target at $44. William Blair analysts wrote that while the company reaffirmed guidance, they don't believe the targets are achievable -- this caused them to be one of the group that lowered estimates.As much as I'd like to own DDD for the long term, I think I can wait and buy it cheaper. What am I waiting for? A turnaround in these EPS estimate revisions. When the company gets through this rough patch, we'll know it as the analysts bump estimates back up.3D Systems: Free Stock Analysis Report (email registration required)Stratasys: Free Stock Analysis Report (email registration required)"
1649752,44981,2013-08-21T15:29:53-04:00,,"The 3D printing industry has been one of the fastest growing industries in the past two years, and the major players in the industry have gained substantial value. Players like Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) have been rising over the past three months. However, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has not seen much price appreciation in the last 90 days. Nonetheless, the long-term growth prospects of the company are intact. Recent acquisitions show that the company has no plans to slow down its growth strategy.Growing Portfolio and Global Penetration3D systems is working to achieve growth in five different segments: growing its Quickparts on-demand parts services, accelerating 3D printer penetration, continuing to expand its healthcare solutions offerings, building 3D consumer and retail products and services and expanding its integrated 3D authoring solutions platform.First of all, let's look at the quickparts segment -- 3D Systems made one acquisition in this segment during the last quarter. In May, it acquired Rapid Product Development Group, a global provider of additive and traditional quick turn manufacturing services. Once the integration is complete; it will allow 3D Systems to increase exposure in three different regions, namely, Asia, North America and Europe. In July, the company completed the acquisition of French based company, Phenix Systems. The company offers direct metal selective laser sintering, and it will be a nice addition to the quickparts segment. The most recent acquisition was announced on August 20, 2013. 3D Systems completed the acquisition of UK based CRDM, Ltd, a leading quickparts solutions and manufacturing services provider. The company caters to automotive, aerospace, defense and medical sectors.Moving on to the 3D authoring solutions platform, 3D Systems is integrating its design-to-manufacturing software tools under Geomagic Solutions brand. The initiative will combine comprehensive reverse engineering tools with mechanical CAD. The initiative will allow the designers to better manage the design and implementation sections.On the Printers front, the company is regularly adding to its already impressive portfolio of printers. 3D Systems launched ProJet x60 series of full color professional printers and new VisiJet PXL materials utilizing ColorJet Printing technology. The ProJet x60 series is built on the ZPrinter platform and further extends the range of addressable applications.Print materials are a vital segment of the company and it generates a substantial portion of its revenues from printing materials. 3D Systems is regularly adding to its printing materials portfolio and recently launched several new print materials -- Accura Xtreme White-200 plastic for SLA 3D printers, VisiJet SL Impact for ProJet 6000 and ProJet 7000 crossover 3D printers and M3 Black for ProJet 3500 and ProJet 3510 professional 3D printers are some of the newly introduced materials.Furthermore, the company is increasing its reseller network - during the last quarter, 3D Systems added Seiko-I Infotech (SIIT), Hawk Ridge Systems and SYNNEX Corporation.All of the above mentioned steps by the company indicate that 3D systems is efficiently managing its portfolio and the company is on track to growth.What are The Other Players Doing?Stratasys is the leading player in the industrial solutions segment. The merger between Stratasys and MakerBot is complete, and the company is making inroads in the medical devices segment. The laboratories are adding Stratasys printers to manufacture a variety of medical devices. German dental lab, DCD has increased its 3D printing arsenal and added another Object 3D printer. The transformation is allowing the lab to decrease the cost and the timeframe to manufacture the products. Increasing demand for Stratasys products and services have allowed the company to post impressive results. In the most recent earnings announcement, the company recorded 20% growth in revenues and an improvement in gross and net margins.ExOne, on the other hand, is a smaller player compared to 3D Systems and Stratasys. However, the company has been growing at an exceptional rate. Revenue and earnings growth has been phenomenal and the stock has gained about 60% in the past three months. The 3D printing industry is in its infancy at the moment, and the growth opportunity is immense. However, the growth opportunity cannot be exploited without spending on research and development. ExOne has announced that the company will be spending more on R&D to increase the number of materials used for printing.Conclusion3D Systems has been doing poorly over the past three months. However, I believe the long-term growth prospects are there and the stock will rise. The growth strategy of the company is solid and the execution is going according to the plan. Increase in the reseller network and quickparts segments will solidify the portfolio and support the growth in revenue and earnings.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1709682,23899,2013-09-24T04:45:58-04:00,,"By David StermanWhile working at an investment magazine back in the 1990s, I profiled a young technology company with a very intriguing product. This company had a small sales base and struggled to make profits, but its device, which could create fully formed objects in a microwave oven-size device, was right out of Star Trek.That company, Stratasys (NASDAQ: SSYS) was an early pioneer in the field of ""rapid prototyping"" -- or what's now known as 3-D printing. (Some also now call this the ""additive manufacturing"" market.) Stratasys, along with rivals 3D Systems (NYSE: DDD) and ExOne (NASDAQ: XONE), is no longer a well-kept secret. The first two stocks have risen more than 350% over the past two years, and XONE has doubled in value since its early 2013 IPO.Clearly, the market for these companies' devices is starting to take off. Stratasys boosted sales more than 30% in 2011 and 2012, its best growth rates since 2004. 3D Systems has boosted growth at an even more impressive 45% clip over the past three years. And all three are expected to boost sales at least 40% this year.The outlook ahead is also quite bright, as new applications are emerging in the automotive, healthcare, aerospace and consumer markets. Credit Suisse estimates the industry had roughly $2 billion in sales last year and sees that figure rising to $5 billion by 2016, or a 24% compound annual growth rate. The fact that these stocks trade for at least 35 times projected 2014 profits (and 88 times in the case of XONE) might almost seem justifiable. Investors are paying up now for expected high profit levels down the road.Yet even as investors bid these stocks ever higher, they may be missing some key speed bumps in the road ahead. It starts with competition.Last November, GE (NYSE: GE) acquired a pair of privately held 3-D printing firms, Morris Technologies and Rapid Quality Manufacturing. Although GE hasn't made a big industry push this year in terms of contract wins, the company has been bolstering its presence at industry trade shows, leading some to expect a bigger competitive push in 2014.Transforming powdered metal into finished metal parts is expected to be one of the biggest growth areas for the industry, and Sweden-based Arcam appears to have the industry's strongest capabilities in this niche. Arcam noted a big jump in orders and backlog when six-month results were released in August, leading to expectations of 60% to 65% revenue growth. Competition is also emerging from a handful of other privately held firms that includes EnvisionTEC, Eos and Micor.On the consumer side, known as desktop printers, Formlabs, Printrbot, Leapfrog (not the toy company), RoBo 3D and Solidoodle are all ramping up sales efforts.The problem with competition is that it tends to lead to more aggressive pricing strategies across the industry. And that will make it harder for 3D Systems and Stratasys to maintain gross margins above 50%, as they did in 2012.Also, a fast-growing industry means that many of these privately held rivals may soon look to go public (investment bankers likely see them as easy deals to get done in light of the strong investor interest). Once a flurry of new companies goes public in an industry, they use their IPO funds to speed up new product development and expand marketing efforts. So Stratasys, 3D Systems and XONE may be in a golden moment -- but, from a competitive perspective, one that may not last.Analysts at Credit Suisse are bearish on the prospects for XONE, as they believe that company has a weaker product offering and too shallow an industry presence. These analysts are more bullish on the outlook for 3D Systems, with a $62 price target that is 15% above current levels. (The neutral rating on Stratasys reflects a lush valuation for that stock.)Yet these analysts, in a recent comprehensive industry report, failed to take note of some potential red flags that investors should be aware of regarding industry darling 3D Systems.For starters, the company's organic growth rate is a lot less impressive than you'd imagine. Since September 2011, DDD has made 16 acquisitions, which is more than the rest of the industry combined. Fully one-third of the company's organic growth rate in the most recent quarter came from acquisitions, and analysts see organic growth slowing to 15% to 20% next year. (Deals completed thus far in 2013 explain the total projected growth rate of 24% in 2014.)All of those acquisitions have pumped up goodwill, and 3D Systems carries just $410 million in tangible book value. That's less than the company has raised in its multiple secondary offerings over the past half-decade, meaning balance sheet value creation has been nil.Also of concern: 3D Systems' accounts receivable spiked $18 million in the second quarter to nearly $120 million. That has raised concerns that the company is stuffing the sales channel in order to meet high quarterly sales targets that Wall Street is anticipating. Lastly, a drop in six-month cash flow (from $21 million in 2012 to $12 million in 2013) is disconcerting, especially when stated net income for the first six months of 2013 was $34 million.Risks to Consider: As an upside risk, both SSYS and DDD have the broadest product offerings in the industry, which makes them viable acquisition candidates to a large manufacturer that wants to enter this space.Although all three of these stocks sport very lofty valuations, 3D Systems appears to be the riskiest stock here, due to balance sheet and cash flow concerns. Fully 29% of this stock's float is held by short sellers, reflecting the mounting concerns around this seemingly impressive growth company.Original PostDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1628742,36191,2013-08-12T11:14:05-04:00,,"IntroductionIf you're looking for growth in the computer systems industry, should you invest in 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) to reap solid benefits in the future? In this article I aim to deliver a clearer picture on where 3D Systems currently stands.With the DDD stock expected to rise or fall after the Q2 2013 financial report, the current price may be a small window of opportunity to purchase DDD shares before the stock continues its upward ascent. Our argument makes a largely fundamental case for suggesting whether these days DDD stock is a smart bet for your future profits.Potential for GrowthThe largest US based 3D printing company is 3D Systems Corporation with a current market cap of about $5 billion. Here is one year share price movement chart for this company from YCharts:Latecomers to the game might wonder if this is real or just another over-hyped technology that will not live up to its promise in the long run.On 6 August, 2013 3D Systems acquired TeamPlatform that allows product design, engineering services and manufacturing companies to easily manage hundreds of small or large projects with data massive being shared and used concurrently. It delivers simple-to-use task management tools, project meta-data structuring capabilities and reusable workspace templates for effective, productive and affordable collaboration.3D Printing manufacturing technology is already having a major impact in the manufacturing and health care sectors. Wide spread use of 3D printing in the consumer sector may come sooner than many investors think.Research firm McKinsey Global Initiative (NASDAQ:MGI) lists 3D printing as one of 12 disruptive technologies emerging over the next decade. MGI suggests by 2025 the economic impact of 3D printing technology could beat $550 billion yearly with the greatest impact on consumer uses.Factoring the significant increase of inbound interest, 3D Systems made the strategic decision to step up certain discretionary expenses to accelerate the adoption of the company's products and services. The company almost doubled its R&D expenditures and accelerated its marketing spending over Q2 2012 in support of its opportunities and expanding product portfolio and sales channels. The company also increased its manufacturing capacity amidst heavier demand for its products and services.Tracking FinancialsOn July 30, 2013 3D Systems reported Q2 earnings amidst a healthy run-up in the share price in anticipation. Investors did not like what they heard and the shares dropped 6% before the opening bell rang and have continued in a upward trend since 7 August, 2013. The following chart tells the story:The company actually saw an impressive 44.5% increase in revenue, largely due to new product introductions ranging from enhanced printing materials to professional printers and new design software packages. However, earnings per share came in at $0.10 per share versus the year ago number of $0.11 despite an increase in net income from $8.3 million to $9.3 million.During Q2 2013, 3D Systems introduced significant new products including professional 3D printers, advanced 3D print materials and powerful new designer software packages.3D printers and other products' revenue for Q2 2013 more than doubled to $54.2 million on higher professional printer units. Print materials revenue grew $3.1 million over the 2012 quarter to $29.3 million and services revenue rose $6.0 million from 2012 to $37.3 million. Healthcare revenue grew 55% and contributed $18.9 million to our total revenue.For the six months 2013, revenue increased 38%, on an 85% printers and other products revenue increase and 26% organic growth. Gross profit soared by 42% and gross profit margin expanded to 52.1%.Obviously, the company's effective advanced manufacturing and consumer growth initiatives are fueling 3D Systems's growth.3D Systems vs. Key CompetitionRight now 3D Printing Systems has one major US based competitor, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), and one new player in the game, ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), which went public in February of 2013. All three companies have had banner years for shareholders with DDD up close to 88% year over year, despite the recent dip in share price. SSYS is up over 40% year over year and XONE's share price is up 156% since it began trading.The following table compares some key performance metrics for the three companies:Data from Morningstar on August 9, 2013ExOne caters to the extreme high end of the business market with printers with astronomical prices. It seems the company sold a grand total of five printers in Q1 2013; generating $4.2 million in revenue and for 2012 sold only 13 profits and failed to show a profit. Apparently investors are focusing on the potential should the company increase its sales volume.Compared to the market cap at XONE of $800 million, DDD and SYSS are giants at $4.7 billion and $3.4 billion respectively. If the hype about the potential of 3D Printing as a major disruptive technology is true, both Stratasys and #D Printing Systems should have bright futures.In the past Stratasys has primarily catered to the business enterprise sector but they are attempting to catch up on DDD's lead with consumers. 3D Printing Systems has a consumer oriented printer, the Cube 3D, now on sale at Staples outlets throughout the country for $1299.On August 1st 2013 Stratasys posted that its printers would be available in UPS stores in a test program. In addition, the company announced in July it was acquiring MakerBot, manufacturer of the Replicator 2, a desktop 3D Printer now available on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon is now offering the Replicator 2 for $2199.Over the past three years DDD has crushed SYSS in net income growth as well as a positive ROE.What Does the Future Hold?A recent study at Michigan Technological University calculated the total cost of 20 common household items and found a minimum/maximum price range of $312 to $1,944. With a 3D printer, a consumer could make those items over a weekend at a total cost of $20. Competition between DDD and SYSS should drive down the price of both consumer and industrial 3D printers, increasing market penetration.Industrial and medical apps are probably to continue to increase, to the benefit of all three of these companies. The battle will be for the wallet of the consumer. Now that Stratasys is making a serious bet in this space, the competition is likely to drive the price of a home 3D printer under $1,000. In addition, watch for expansion in available materials from which objects can be made. For 3D printers to go mainstream as did high priced 2D printers and other electronic gadgets, price and flexibility in materials and color processing are a must. Today, consumer printers are limited to one color and polymer plastics.Final VerdictThe growth potential for the above-mentioned companies is massive and lower prices are a key to the future, and not just in the consumer, industrial, and healthcare sectors. Many small businesses cannot afford the high price tag of today's costly printers. At more affordable levels, this is another play with explosive growth potential. Both 3D Printing Systems and Stratasys appear to be worthy investments, although perhaps not at present prices. Give the edge on the consumer market to DDD and should they come to rule that space, their investors will be very, very happy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Revenue surged 45% year-over-year to $121 million, handily exceeding consensus expectations. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 11% year-over-year to $0.20, slightly below consensus estimates. For a firm in a high revenue growth phase, free cash flow is solid year-to-date at $9 million, equal to 6% of total revenue.Image Source: DDD 2Q 2013 PresentationRevenue growth was broad-based, as ""products"" revenue surged 60% year-over-year to $83.4 million. ""Services"" revenue grew at a slightly lower rate, up 19% year-over-year to $37 million. 3D Systems also posted decent gross-margin expansion, up 40 basis points firmwide to 51.8%. ""printers and other products"" gross margins surged 250 basis points year-over-year to 45.6% and ""materials"" gross margins were 800 basis points higher than a year-ago at 73.6%. ""Service"" gross margins, however, declined 260 basis points to 43.8%. The firm's ""services"" segment doesn't experience the same operating leverage as its ""printers"" or ""materials"" operations, nor does it constitute a huge portion of 3D Systems' total gross margin dollars (at this time).Video Source: 3D Printing SystemsWhat once seemed like an unattainable pipe dream is now a very powerful means of production. 3D Systems is seeing strong demand from manufacturing customers, and the firm's consumer products have recently hit Staples' (NASDAQ:SPLS) shelves with a positive reception from consumers. Demand could even improve, as the firm added more technology to its arsenal. CEO Avi Reichental explained the firm's latest acquisition on the conference call, saying:""And a few weeks ago we completed the acquisition of 81% of Phoenix System, a leading global provider of Direct Metal Selective Laser Sintering systems that's based in rearm fronts.Phoenix designs manufactures and sales proprietary Direct Metal 3D Printers that can print chemically pure fully dense metal and ceramic parts from very fine powders with the granularity of 6 microns to 9 microns. Materials include stainless steel, tool steel, super alloys, nonferrous alloys, precious metals and alumina for a variety of advance aerospace automotive and patient specific medical device applications.""The only potential ""negative"" from the firm's report was the near-doubling in research and development costs. However, R&D only constituted 7.9% of sales - not a number we'd be worried about. In fact, we like to see the firm reinvesting in the business in hopes that such efforts will drive even further revenue expansion. In fact, it seems the firm is doing everything in its power to create value for its customers - something we believe is positive for the company's long-term success.SG&A increased 50% year-over-year to $36.2 million, equal to 30% of total revenue. Considering the firm's need to boost awareness around its products and support growth, we aren't too worried about this increase at the moment, especially considering the firm's hefty gross margin profile.Going forward, the firm reiterated its full-year revenue guidance of $485-$510 million, driving non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.05-$1.20. We think the Street may have been looking for a raise, but we think 3D Systems' guidance was strong nonetheless.Valuentum's Take3D printing seems to be gaining steam, particularly with businesses. 3D Systems is expanding gross margins and growing revenue at a rapid clip, but shares look fairly valued at this time.

However, there are still the under-covered areas on 3D Systems that are worthy of investor's attention. This article aims to help you see possible potential and risks associated you may face in the future.Reducing competition through vertical and horizontal integration and R&DIn my estimation, the company enjoys the status as being a market leader with a 25% market share followed by Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) with a 13% market share. Source: Bloomberg and Company FinancialsThe 3D Systems growth strategy focuses on faster product development and acquisition of small businesses striving to make perfect synergies, thus reducing competition and industry fragmentations.During the past year, 3D Systems faced macro headwinds in Europe and Asia Pacific which led the company to slash prices on high margin products. In anticipation of an economic slowdown, 3D Systems may not be able to meet its full-year target of $1.05 to $1.20 per share.Revenue by Geographic RegionAll geographic regions experienced higher levels of revenue in 2013 compared to 2012.(Click to enlarge)In millions of U.S. DollarSource: Company's FinancialsThis was principally due to continued global R&D spending which led to higher levels of printer sales and print materials sales. Revenue from its U.S. operations increased as a percentage of total revenue due to increasing acquisition activity in the U.S., including the acquisitions of Quickparts, Z Corp and Vidar.The banking crisis combined with the economic crisis in several European countries led to an increase in the negative impact of foreign currency translation for the European region, while a strengthening the Japanese Yen for most of 2013 resulted in a favorable foreign currency translation for the Asia-Pacific region.(Click to enlarge)Source: Company's financialsDDD posted total revenue of $120.8 million in 2QCY13 that grew by 44% year to year. However, the growth in topline revenue did not reflect in profit margins, which declined by 2% due to slashing of prices and increases in operating expenses, which increased by 41%.The important aspect to note is that the company entered into an acquisition of Rapidform scan-to-CAD reverse engineering and inspection software tools and ProJet-3510 model with a capability of remote touch-screen PC tablet and smart-phone integrated software, which would augment the company's position as a market leader in the industry. The company is capitalizing on its core competencies and this will have a positive impact on the company's bottom line.3D Systems Stock Grew by 75%A DDD share has almost doubled in price from $26 to $46 due to high margins on printing products and a strong research and development arm catering efficiently to the market's needs.(Click to enlarge)As analysts anticipate that the 3D printing industry has a capacity to flourish in the coming years from $1.7billion to $2.1billion and can grow three-fold until 2019, investors have taken a positive view of the stock in anticipation of the growth potential in the industry as reflected by the doubling of price despite an unfavorable P/E ratio compared to its industry average.Make or Break for Investors3D Systems is also focusing on developing a software and integrated tools segment that would eventually have a positive impact on revenues from services apart from hardware products.Data in thousands U.S. DollarIn light of the above facts, in my opinion, the company has more room to grow in the industry on the back of a strong research and development arm and a healthy range of product lines and after sales service. The company backed its adjusted earnings forecast of $1.05 to $1.20 per share on revenue of $460 million to $510 million for the year that I expect will be tough to achieve in CY13.My forecast on the Dec13 EPS is $1.01 based upon projected revenues adjusted for the economic slowdown in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Analysts still expect the industry to grow by 25% this year, as witnessed in 3D Systems last 6-month revenues, due to which I have revised upwards 3D Systems other income portion by another 25% with respect for its competitive advantage for introducing new software technology. With this state-of-the art technology, 3D System would generate more revenue to support its bottom line.Final VerdictI maintain a ""BUY"" stance on DDD, owing to the fact that it is in a growing industry and has more room to introduce new products in the industrial, professional and consumer segments. Moreover, the company stands to benefit from any revival in the European and Asian Pacific economies. Also, the demand for some of its new innovative products is inelastic, which enables the company to skim high margins before the competition forces the margins to come down.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1603322,31361,2013-08-05T02:33:32-04:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is a global leader of the pioneering 3D printing industry. Some speculate that it is destined to become the IBM of the industry.Healthcare professionals were among the first to embrace 3D Systems' additive manufacturing capabilities. 3D printing applications in healthcare range from precise dental and anatomical models and surgical guides to implantable devices, improved appliances for medicine delivery, custom hearing aids and prosthetics.DentistryAll we humans have the same body structure, but are very different in details. When it comes to replacing body parts, dental restoration or the like, every millimeter counts.It could be said that replacing or modifying body parts is a custom business and most medical parts and devices are custom-made in some ways.In conventional thinking ""custom-made"" is the direct opposite of ""mass produced"". The two cannot be mixed or interchanged.That is not so in 3D printing. 3D printing makes it possible and economical to make one copy or a millions copies of the same product in a slightly different way.The dental replacement business is an example.To speed up the dentist's routine and possibly make it cheaper, all it takes is a digital scanner in the office and a 3D printer to turn out crowns, bridges, and dentures. This approach is not only less invasive and more accurate but safer too, by making unnecessary the use of physical molds in the patients' mouth.3D Systems' good customer Align Technologies' (NASDAQ:ALGN) shows how successful this can be on an industrial scale.Align makes the ""Invisalign"" brand clear braces for the alignment of teeth. These braces straighten teeth with a series of removable, virtually invisible aligners. The Invisalign Teen program has additional features that cater to the unique orthodontic needs of teenagers such as wear indicators and six free replacement aligners.Last year Align has printed 17 million unique and distinct copies of its clear aligners. It is all done in a single factory with a space not larger than a good size meeting hall, using 65 automated printers.The factory is capable of producing millions of units, each unit carefully planned by human technicians and then approved by the dentists who ordered it, and each is different from all the others.Align Technology is based in San Jose, California with offices worldwide. The Invisalign system is offered in more than 45 countries and has been used to treat more than 1.5 million patients.In 2011, Align has added the maker of dental scanning systems, Cadent Holdings, Inc. With it came the brands of the iTero and iOC scanning systems and OrthoCAD digital services.It is now a complete circle. As a first step, the dentist uses intra-oral scanning to create a digital map of the patient's mouth. The order is digitally sent to Align's factory where hundreds of Align technicians develop dental plates in a high precision 3D image to correct defects in the teeth of patients from the United States, Europe and Asia. After correction, the file is sent back to the dentists for approval and once approved, the order is 3D printed and shipped to the dentist.Align's worldwide market share is still small, as most dentists like to work in the traditional way with brackets and wires and breaking tradition is a slow process. But the use of digital technologies for restorative dentistry is growing rapidly and intra-oral scanning is a critical part of it.As a separate development, in July 3D Systems has acquired the French company Phenix Systems which has dedicated medical metal printers and strong in the dental field.ProsthesesThe trouble with many prostheses is that they wear down, don't perfectly conform to the patients' limbs, and can present a stigma for patients who need them.With the help of 3D printing, scientists at Bespoke Innovations in San Francisco have created prosthetic coverings that perfectly mirror the sculptural symmetry and function of the wearer's remaining limb and can even be customized to conform to the patient's fashion style.In 2012, 3D Systems has acquired Bespoke Innovations and now the company is directly involved in the designer body parts business.Bespoke revolutionized design. Bespoke Innovations produces Fairings, a 3D-printed covering that can be personalized and worn around the existing prosthetic. Typically a prosthetic will exist either as naked hardware, essentially a pipe, or covered with foam in an attempt to match skin tone and tissue density. This is the first time there's been a third option. It costs $5,000 to $6,000 to print one of these legs, and it has features that aren't even found in legs that cost $60,000 today.Co-founder Scott Summit says:""I wanted to create a leg that had a level of humanity. It's unfortunate that people have had a product that's such a major part of their lives that was so underdesigned.""In the future, he also said, prosthesis will be ""treated more like eyewear, sold as fashion statement, than as a medical requirement.""The custom prostheses are printed using 3D Systems SLS (Selective Laser Sintering) technology.Selective Laser Sintering uses a laser to sinter (melt) objects from powder, layer-by-layer, to form a solid model.The system consists of a laser, part chamber, and control system. The part chamber consists of a build platform, powder cartridge, and leveling roller. A thin layer of build material is spread across the platform where the laser traces a two-dimensional cross section of the object, sintering the material together.The platform then descends a layer thickness and the leveling roller pushes material from the powder cartridge across the build platform, where the next cross section is sintered to the previous. This continues until the part is completed. Once the model is complete, it is removed from the part chamber and finished by removing any loose material and smoothing the visible surfaces.Bespoke 3D scans the client's remaining leg so that the new artificial leg matches. As the 3D printing produces the shape and contour of a real leg, trousers drape naturally and can fit more easily into boots. Amputees feel more a part of the world around them.BracesThe next mass-produced item on 3D System's agenda is the Wrist Brace.Bespoke Wrist Brace is an application that turns computer data into a very attractive design that is custom made, ventilated, stylish, cleanable and dishwashable, and allows the wearer to continue to function without any debilitating aspects of traditional hand braces.This application combines the use of 3D Systems' cloud printing technology, the Bespoke scanner, the Geomagic software, as well as the laser sintering technology, to create something revolutionary.It is a huge market: about 10 million wrist braces sold annually in the U.S., a market amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, as estimated by Frost & Sullivan.Insurance companies are moving towards preventable care and this item fits the bill. The average reimbursable amount per brace is between $250 and $450.The company is already working on an extension of the idea: pediatric braces. Pediatric braces are challenging to make, it sometimes takes multiple changes as the swelling shrinks and the compliance is not very good.With 3D Systems' braces kids will be able to swim and bathe and do everything they normally do.3D printing3D printing is manufacturing with a mouse click instead of hammers, nails and workers. Advocates of the technology say that by doing away with manual labor, 3D printing could revamp the economics of manufacturing and revive American industry as creativity and ingenuity replace labor costs that drove manufacturing abroad in the first place. With this new industry there is nothing to be gained by going overseas except high shipping charges.Traditional manufacturing involves a web of suppliers for parts and a closely monitored supply chain that includes delivery and warehousing. Companies must spend money to order parts in advance, to have them delivered, and to store enough of them to meet current demand. It's a profession in itself, and has created a computer software sub-industry devoted to supply chain management.But a 3D printer can short-circuit the process. Parts can be manufactured on site exactly when needed, and only as many as needed. The only lag time is the time it takes the printers to actually do the work. And the design specifications can be entered directly via computer.The companies that manufacture 3D printers are also manufacturers in their own right, producing custom runs of products in various materials. Manufacturing setup and breakdown times and costs are much lower with printers, allowing quick changeovers.Depending on the type of job at hand, a typical 3D printer can cost from $10,000 to more than $100,000. If rapid manufacturing is required, along with rapid tooling, direct metal use or the level of accuracy and durability that is only possible with SLA and SLS technologies, the price of the machine can run into six figures.3D printing was initially used by manufacturers and designers to build prototypes. It is still used for that but the new direction now is a movement toward consumer markets where mass production is needed for customizable products.Investor's summary3D Systems' second quarter revenue grew 45 percent from the prior year to a $120.8 million. Gross profit increased 46 percent and gross profit margin expanded 40 basis points to 51.8 percent.In the second quarter all revenue categories contributed to growth. 3D printers and other product revenues more than doubled to $54.2 million, print materials revenue grew $3.1 million to $29.3 million and services revenue rose $6 million to $37.3 million.Healthcare related revenue grew 55 percent for the quarter, resuming its growth trajectory and contributed some $18.9 million to the total revenue.During the first six months of 2013 the company has generated $12.8 million of net cash from operating activities. The second quarter ended with $349.3 of cash on hand representing a $193 million increase versus the end of 2012. This includes $272 million net proceeds from the common stock offering and $86 million paid for acquisitions.The stock price in the past 52 weeks ranged from $21.57 to $51.94. The company's market cap is $4.45 billion.Analysts were disappointed about some aspects of the performance. For example, JP Morgan analyst Paul Coster wrote:""The anticipated leverage from higher-margin materials sales is not being expressed in the business model, raising questions regarding utilization rates on new machines.""On the other hand revenue from sales of professional and production printers grew 78 percent in the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Damon Gregoire said on a conference call with analysts.A great many companies on the stock market wish they had the problems of 3D Systems.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1520662,24427,2013-06-25T14:49:41-04:00,,"The 3D printing and rapid prototyping industry is a wonderful advancement in engineering that opens up exciting opportunities for many industries. For companies that make and sell products en masse, it gives them the ability to turn a design into a prototype in perhaps one-tenth the time of traditional manufacturing methods. For companies that sell custom, one-of-a-kind applications, such as a personalized medical device, they can manufacture the finished product to exact custom specifications in a very short time. There is also the home market, which while still in its infancy and mostly used by hobbyists, may develop into something bigger.Anyone needing 3D printing services has two options; they can buy the printer and all the necessary accessories and set up a production environment in-house, or they can choose to outsource the production to one of many rapid prototyping services who utilize 3D printing machines. It's a simple procedure, whereby the CAD file is uploaded to the prototype service provider, and in many instances they can have it printed and shipped out in 1-2 days. The whole procedure is handled online without the need for human interaction.The concern here is not for the future of this industry. I think it's phenomenal. The concern is that the valuations of some of the companies that operate in this space, are now in ""outer space"" and meet many of the criteria to be classified as a bubble, as described by Robert Shiller, and reported in this New York Times piece. These are the criteria:The listed 3D printer companies in the USA are Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Ex-One (NASDAQ:XONE). We will explore the valuation of 3D Systems in this article.Market sizeThe respected authority on the additive manufacturing and 3D printers and services industry is Wohlers Associates. 3D Systems includes this chart from Wohlers in their January 2103 investor presentation to describe the estimated potential size of the 3D printer market.From Wohlers Talk Blog on their website, dated May 25, 2013 they elaborate a bit further:""The industry is expected to continue strong double-digit growth over the next several years. By 2017, we believe that the sale of 3D-printing products and services will approach $6 billion worldwide. By 2021, we forecast growth to reach $10.8 billion. It took the 3D printing industry 20 years to grow to $1 billion in size. In five additional years, the industry generated its second $1 billion. It is expected to double again, to $4 billion, in 2015.""Note that this does not include the rapid prototyping service industry; it's just for the printers and associated products and services. 3D Systems does have a few rapid prototyping services which they acquired, but according to a chart in this article by another SA author, the total purchase price of all of them combined was less than $30million in cash and stock, so not material for this analysis.For our purposes, we will use the 2021 Wohlers industry sales estimate of $10.8 billion and estimate the value for the entire industry in 2021, eight years from today. Here are my assumptions which I believe are reasonable.Based on revenue of $10.8 billion, 10% net profit margin, and a price earnings ratio of 14, the value of the entire industry in 2021 will be $15.12 billion. If that is the value in eight years' time, we need to discount it back to the present (2013) to get today's value. To do this, we need to make one last assumption about a discount rate. I will assume a discount rate of 15%, however if you think that is unfair, you can plug in your own discount rate and see the results. Discounting $15.12 billion back eight years at 15% gives us a net present value of $4.94 billion. Discounting it at 10% would be $7.05 billion.Here's the meat:3D Systems' share of total industry revenue is 16%. As of June 25, 2013 the Enterprise value of DDD was $3.98 billion. This represents 80% of the net present value of the entire industry value ($4.94 billion at 15% discount rate), however their share of the entire industry is only 16%! If we used the 10% discount rate, their share of our estimated industry value drops to 56% which is still over three times their market share. Based on this, we believe the company is overvalued by three to five times.Perhaps you think that their recent deal with Staples for a consumer 3D printer is the magic that justifies the value. Well, the market leader in the 3D printer space, SSYS, just announced a deal to buy the leader in the personal 3D printer space, MakerBot for $403 million in SSYS stock (trading at a forward price earnings ratio of 32). Even if 3D Systems CUBE printer were worthy of a similar valuation, it still does not change the picture above, detailing the disconnect between the company and the industry value.This is a competitive and fast changing industryA May 12, 2103 post by Wohlers on their website, questioning whether America still can dominate this industry gives the following statistic. ""Our preparation for the publication of Wohlers Report 2013 revealed some interesting data: 16 companies in Europe, 7 in China, 5 in the U.S., and 2 in Japan now manufacture and sell professional-grade, industrial additive manufacturing (AM) and 3D printing systems. (We use the two terms interchangeably.) This is a dramatic change from a decade ago when the mix was 10 in the U.S., 7 in Europe, 7 in Japan, and 3 in China.""The point here is that this is a competitive industry, and the landscape is changing.Buy versus outsourceIn thinking about market size, it seems to me that for smaller size companies that do not continuously have the need to make prototypes, it is far more efficient to outsource the 3D printing to a rapid prototyping service, especially if it can be shipped to you by the next day. I liken it to the days when color printers were the new thing. Most companies did not have one, because they were expensive and it made economic sense to go to the local print shop for the occasional time you needed something copied in color. The same logic applied to 3D printing in many cases. In addition the rapid prototyping companies have the product expertise and can justify carrying an inventory of different 3D process machines and supplies to print in a multitude of different materials and colors. If this business model is in fact more efficient, it would imply lower unit sales for the industry as a whole.Intellectual property value is not materialI could not say it any better than their own 2012 10K, p12, under Intellectual Property:""We believe that, while our patents and licenses provide us with a competitive advantage, our success depends primarily on our marketing, business development and applications know-how and on our ongoing research and development efforts. Accordingly, we believe the expiration of any of the patents, patent applications or licenses discussed above would not be material to our business or financial position.""This may explain their focus on doing acquisitions, of which they have done thirty two in the past three years, and of which they plan to do more. This intention was explicitly stated in their most recent public offering in May 2013, where they raised a fresh round of equity capital of approximately $237 million, excluding approximately $50 million worth of shares sold separately by insiders.Q1 earningsThere was some unusual behavior surrounding their most recent Q1 earnings report, reported here. Firstly, they announced a 3 for 2 stock-split on the same day they announced earnings, and secondly, they apparently only released the earnings to analysts twenty minutes before the conference call, which is unusual because they didn't have much time to study the results to ask meaningful questions. A quick perusal of their 10Q shows a net income of $2.65 million for the quarter. Without a foreign currency translation loss of $3.261 million their net income would have been $5.833 million. This was down from the previous year Q1 net income of $7.372 million. On a valuation of $4 billion, somehow it feels like a bubble to me.In closing, I want to reiterate that I think the industry is great, but that it's easy to get caught up in the bubble themes outlined by Shiller. I am not an expert on the 3D industry, but just trying to make sense of the valuations. Hopefully this gives you a new perspective.Disclosure: I am short DDD.

We believe the recent consolidation gives long-term traders an opportunity to initiate a position and we expect new highs going into earnings on the 30th of July. This article will explain why we like DDD, both fundamentally and from a technical point of view. We own the January $45 calls, risking 1% maximum in our portfolio.The 3D Story3D stocks have been on fire lately. We have seen a big run up in a number of 3D stocks. Look at Proto Labs Inc (NYSE:PRLB) which made a huge run in the last six months, the stock rising from $40 to the current price of $60. The same can be said with respect to ExOne Inc. (NASDAQ:XONE) which has also risen from $25 to $61. The hype in 3D stocks continues and we expect new highs in the near future. On the other hand, DDD has had a nice consolidation over the last few months and is now setting up for what we believe are new highs.Recent NewsOn July 15th, DDD completed the acquisition of Phenix systems. Avi Reichental, CEO of DDD stated, ""Phenix systems is a strategic and differentiated addition to our extensive 3D content-to-print portfolio."" DDD paid $15.1m for this acquisition. Phenix systems is the only selective metal sintering system that can fruit chemically fuel, full events, metal and ceramic parts from very fine powders with the granularity of 6 to 9 microns creating an unmatched portfolio with differentiated performance at every price point.On July 11th, DDD and Deloitte announced an extensive alliance to adopt and integrate 3D products.On July 10th, DDD announced that together with Innovation Factory of Chicago, it plans to power Chicago's bid to become an innovation hub and design.These big partnerships make DDD a great position for the future.In late June, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stated that the new Windows 8 will include an API that allows application developers to support 3D printers from MakerBot. MakerBot was recently acquired by Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS).Latest earnings reportThe last earnings report was a stellar one. Some key points:- Revenue grew over 31% over the previous year and came in at an impressive $102.1m. This included a 61% increase in printers and other product, and 22.1% overall organic growth.- Gross profit increased 38% and gross profit margin expanded 250 basis points to 52.4%.- Print materials grew to $28.7 million and made up 28% of total revenue, and services revenue increased some $5.1 million to $33.6 million and made up 33% of total revenue.- Revenue from U.S. operations increased 25% to $57.2 million on higher volume. Revenue from European operations grew 38% to $28.6 million in 2013. Revenue from Asia-Pacific operations increased 45% to $16.3 million.Fundamentals- Market cap of $4.35b- Float of 86m shares- 32% of the float is short as of June 28th.- Total cash of $95m (After Phenix acquisition).Technical analysisWe like the set up here. We believe the chart is forming a nice cup and handle that is getting ready for a big breakout to all-time highs. We are keeping an eye on volume as this will signify new highs are around the corner. The daily chart is shown below. We like the action over the 50-day moving average.The weekly chart is also one we like. We are looking at the 10-day moving average on the weekly as a level of support. Stochastics and volume look bullish.ConclusionWe remain bullish on DDD or 3D systems stocks. Most stocks are on a beautiful uptrend as seen in stocks like XONE, SSYS and PRLB. Our favorite remains DDD as a result of the cup and handle formation, bullish consolidation, rising earnings estimates and recent partnerships, together with the short float which can cause a short squeeze anytime.Disclosure: I am long DDD.

1493212,40031,2013-06-11T04:56:29-04:00,,"I wrote about 3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) mixed short-term picture two weeks ago, and the stock performance since the article was written was mixed and volatile. It did not make much headway, but is holding nicely given that the general market environment is also volatile. There is more positive news surrounding the company lately, and some cause of concern, since the main competitor Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) is reportedly in talks with Makerbot, which would allow Stratasys to compete with 3D Systems on the consumer side of the business, which was largely neglected so far by Stratasys.The big pictureThe general market has been experiencing selling pressure since mid-May. The distribution day count is mounting on the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY), with higher volume down days. The selling pressure comes from the Fed, and the market is worried about the earlier tapering of the Quantitative Easing. The recovery at the end of the week came on lower volume, showing that the buying power is weaker than the selling pressure in the preceding days. If the weakness in the general market continues, it will certainly pressure the price of 3D Systems in the near term.Good newsThe Wall Street Journal published a bullish article on 3D printing stocks last week. The article cited three big companies using 3D printers: General Electric (NYSE:GE), Ford (NYSE:F) and the toy maker Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT). GE's Aviation unit prints fuel injectors and other components in its jet engines. The engine is expected to be fitted for commercial aircraft by 2016. GE is also experimenting with 3D printing to produce a medical device - the ultrasound probe. The 3D printing technology could help cut costs of manufacturing. Ford has been using 3D printing since the 1980s to prototype automobile parts for test vehicles. Ford saves an average of one month of production time to create a casting for a prototype cylinder head. In the future, customers might be able to print their own replacement parts. Mattel engineers use 3D printers to create toy parts of almost every toy the company manufactures. In the future, consumers might print their own toys using the company's software. There is certainly a vast potential in 3D printing and the demand is going to strengthen as the technology improves and expands, the costs drop, and when there is a much wider use than there is today.In late May, 3D Systems announced an exclusive agreement with Synnex Corporation (NYSE:SNX), a major IT hardware distributor. Under the agreement, Synnex will sell and support 3D Systems' complete portfolio of personal and professional 3D printers and materials through its PRINTSolv Wide Format group in both United States and Canada. 3D Systems' CEO Avi Reichental said in the statement:This deal, along with the recent deal with Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) will certainly help to bring 3D printers into the market, and expand its use. The management promised a harder push in the consumer market, and it is delivering on that promise with these two deals. I am looking forward to the second half of the year, when the first results of the consumer initiatives are reflected in the company's financials.Will Stratasys focus on the consumer market?TechCrunch reports that Stratasys is in talks with Makerbot, the Brooklyn-based 3D printing company regarding a possible acquisition. Stratasys has yet to turn focus to the consumer market, as it currently makes high-end, professional 3D printers for industrial applications. Makerbot has generated $50 million in revenue this year. Makerbot makes the innovative Replicator, an easy-to-use desktop 3D printer, which sells in $2,000 to $2,800 range. The acquisition would allow Stratasys to compete with 3D Systems' Cube line. But, let's not forget the recent shelf offering of 3D Systems, as the company intends to use the funds for further acquisitions. They might try to acquire Makerbot too.ConclusionThe general market volatility might put more pressure on the stock price, and Stratasys' potential acquisition of Makerbot might help it to expand in the consumer segment of the 3D printing space. On the other hand, two recent deals with Staples and Synnex are very good for 3D Systems, and provide the company with an opportunity to sell much more products in the future. The Makerbot acquisition by Stratasys is just a rumor at the moment, and 3D Systems might bid for the company too. So, the short-term picture for 3D Systems remains mixed.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1462741,40031,2013-05-27T08:09:12-04:00,,"It took less than four months for 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) to make new all time highs, after a vicious correction in February and March, when the stock corrected more than 40% from the late January peak. The situation in the industry has changed for the better, and all stocks in the group moved to new highs in May. The volatility is still present, and we saw 3D Systems correct more than 15% since the peak on May 14th, and the price recovered somewhat afterwards, although the stock is 10% off its all time high.Recent developmentsMay has been packed with news concerning 3D Systems and the 3D printing group in general. I covered the previous developments up until May 5th in my previous article, and those included an in-line earnings announcement, the acquisition of Rapid Product Development Group and the raised full year guidance and the deal with Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) which will be the first major retailer to sell 3D printers.Since then, 3D Systems was added to the S&P 400 mid-cap index. The news sent the stock higher. On May 7th, the company announced a mixed shelf offering. The company sold 6.2 million shares and 1.3 million shares were sold by certain shareholders, including certain officers and directors and their affiliates. 3D Systems intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to finance future acquisitions of other entities or their assets and for working capital and general corporate purposes.The offering is worrisome, since it is the second time in a short period of time that the insiders are cashing out. And the intention of the company to use the funds for more acquisitions can go both ways, if the acquisitions are costly and hard to integrate. We will see how it goes from here, and the company has done well to integrate all the acquired companies up until now.3D Systems launched Geomagic Solutions and Cubify Draw in May. Geomagic Solutions is 3D Systems' integrated design-to-manufacturing software tool, which combines comprehensive reverse engineering tools with mechanical CAD. Cubify Draw is a mobile 3D printing app for iOS. Anyone with an iPhone, iPad or iPad Mini device can create printable content with their fingertips. The app is available in the App Store via free download. The company is boosting its efforts in the consumer segment, and the Cubify Draw is another example. The management said in the first quarter conference call that the consumer solutions will drive more significant revenue in the second half of the year.Analysts mostly positiveAnalysts have been mostly bullish on 3D Systems and 3D printing stocks recently. Janney Montgomery Scott initiated coverage on 3D Systems with a buy and price target of $56. Needham & Company raised the PT from $42 to $52. They also raised the EPS and revenue estimates, stating the RPDG acquisition. Canaccord Genuity reiterated the buy rating and raised the PT from $45 to $50. Canaccord believes 3D Systems can deliver upside to consensus estimates driven by strong printer and services revenue and as the company moves into the commercialization phase for Bespoke (carpal tunnel braces) in the second half of the year.The only downgrade comes from William Blair, which downgraded both 3D Systems and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) to underperform from market perform with no price target. The firm said there is too much hype surrounding the 3D printing industry and a cloudy future.Short interestThere were no major changes in the short interest in the latest reporting period. Short interest decreased by 0.8 million in the second half of April. It will be interesting to see the next short interest report, since the price increased 30% in the first half of May. The short interest level is still quite elevated at 30.7% of free float.Source for data: Nasdaq.comGroup movementStratasys and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) were highly correlated with 3D Systems recently, and have moved higher and lower together. Stratasys reported earnings on May 13th, which were better than expected, and it gave a lift to the group, and all three stocks reached new all time highs the next day. The next day was at the same time a top for the time being, since ExOne released earnings after the close on May 14th. Earnings and revenue missed analyst expectations, and ExOne plunged more than 20% in just two days after the earnings announcement. ExOne's share price has recovered since then, but is still about 10% off its all time high. Stratasys and 3D Systems are far more important for group movement than ExOne, since it only has a small part of the group's revenue.The group seems to be moving ahead of expectations, and their valuations are stretched at the moment. So, they need to keep delivering strong growth in the future in order to accommodate the high expectations. Exone's two-day plunge shows how vulnerable a stock can be if it delivers below expectations.Price and volume action remains bullish. There is still far more accumulation in the pattern, meaning higher volume on up days, and lower volume on down days. Subdued volume on down days suggests there is not much selling pressure. The similar case is seen in Stratasys' chart, and only ExOne has two major distribution days, following its weak earnings report. It is worth mentioning that the general market has also been very strong up until recently, and if the broad market environment stays positive, it improves the chances for 3D Systems to move higher.Source: StockchartsConclusionThe overall condition of 3D Systems is mixed right now. The company's growth efforts, its aggressive acquisition strategy and overall execution seem to be doing well and the price and volume action remains positive, with accumulation in the pattern. However, the insiders are cashing out recently and that raises a red flag. The valuation is stretched at the moment, and the company needs to keep delivering robust long term growth in order to justify the inflated valuation. I am still very positive on the long term prospects of 3D Systems and the 3D printing industry, and maintain my long term bullish stance, with a more careful short-term view, given the red flags sticking out.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

It may already be too late, since Forbes reported that the blueprints were downloaded nearly 100,000 times. It also highlighted the enormity of changes that will be taking place in manufacturing and trade. One of the 3-D printing companies to focus on is 3D Systems. The strong interest in 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) resumed in the last two months, and is justified.

1426541,25372,2013-05-10T23:02:30-04:00,,"In this article, I will explain why I incorrectly called a bust in 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) in January, and why I now consider the January-March sell-off to be a ""test phase"" in an ongoing reflexive boom. I will then outline reasons why the boom should continue, and why it should eventually reverse. I will also discuss the two ways it might avoid a reversal, and why I think these are unlikely outcomes. Last, I will discuss the future of the technology using the Gartner technology curve I mentioned in my previous article.BackgroundI had been a bit perplexed by the moves in 3D Systems' stock recently. I wrote a long article back in December arguing that 3D Systems was in a reflexive boom-bust cycle. I outlined a model for the process, and accordingly took a long position to cash in on the boom phase.I then called an end to the ""twilight phase"" on January 31st of this year, signaling the beginning of the bust. My model called for a rapid downward acceleration, which would have then led to low valuations that would merit a long investment. As such, I shorted the shares via stock and puts. I pulled my short trade on March 26th with a substantial profit. Positive results out of competitor Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) boosted the perception of the space, and a rumour of an acquisition of 3D Systems was floating around. I could not justify staying short.The perception seemed to be much more positive than I would expect in a reflexive bust. Normally, a bust would be followed by a phase of negative perception reinforcing the downward decline.Not a Bust, Just a TestNow, the reason is apparent. I was wrong that the company had entered a bust phase. Instead, I am more inclined to call the January-March sell-off a ""test period"".3D Systems was able to continue the boom using the same trick it has used until now: acquisitions. With two acquisitions in the quarter, Coweb and Geomagic, the company was able to boost revenues enough to satisfy investors. Importantly, 3D Systems was able to boost its gross profit margin by 250 basis points. On this basis, I expect analyst upgrades of the stock to follow.More of the SameThese acquisitions were paid for using cash generated by the stock issue in the second quarter of 2012:This is the same method the company has used for the past two years - using high priced stock to fund acquisitions, which grow earnings, seeming to justify the high stock prices. The stock price then increases, allowing further acquisitions, more earnings growth, and higher stock prices. The process feeds on itself in a reflexive manner.On May 1st, 3D Systems announced a new acquisition, RPDG, which will be accretive for the coming quarter. The acquisition will drain some of the $110 mm left on the balance sheet, so the company will use share issues to pad its cash balance, as announced on May 7.It is interesting that management is now explicitly stating that ""3D Systems intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to finance future acquisitions of other entities..."" So, using the logic outlined previously, investors can expect the cycle to continue for the reasonable future.Remember When Valuations Mattered?Valuations are certainly stretched. My favorite indicator for a growth stock is the PEG (Price/Earnings/Growth) ratio, and I tend to use trailing growth rather than future growth figures, because earnings estimates are subject to the prevailing bias. I typically like to invest in companies with a PEG less than 1.For the sake of argument, let's use the company's own non-GAAP figure of 43% year-over-year growth. Compared to a non-GAAP P/E of 54.42, this gives a trailing PEG ratio of 1.26. This would suggest that the company is overvalued, even by its own metrics.I dislike the use of non-GAAP figures - I believe management often uses these figures to paint a rosier picture than reality. For comparison's sake, on a GAAP basis, the earnings actually declined 4.9%, and the P/E stands at a whopping 95.I don't wish to reignite a decades-old accounting debate, but merely to point out that even by the most optimistic metrics (the non-GAAP figures above), the company is still overvalued.So why would I argue that 3D Systems is overvalued, but simultaneously invest in a long position?Ignoring the RulesAt this point, the perception is driving the fundamentals - the company can continue to use its stock as currency to fund acquisitions and thus earnings growth. As long as its stock price stays above intrinsic value, it can continue to grow its intrinsic value by selling its shares.Notice that the previously outlined model called for a decrease in earnings after the test phase:Let's compare this to a chart of 3D Systems.The decline in GAAP earnings has occurred in the middle of Phase 4 of the boom, as the model dictates. I believe that growth rates were impacted by decreasing share prices in the January-March period.If the reflexive logic holds, the share price appreciation during Phase 4 should allow the trend of acquisitions to continue stronger than ever, and earnings growth should pick up in the coming quarters on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.Even if valuations do go to absurd heights, investors (and analysts) often invent interesting ways of justifying the valuations. The increasingly positive perception should boost estimates alongside the stock price. Thus, the normal rules of valuation no longer apply, and the process enters far-from-equilibrium territory.Turning Point?The next logical question is, if this is a boom, where is the bust? And the answer is, it may still be a while off. Now that the boom has survived a test where valuations came into question, I believe that investors will disregard valuations more than before, and the perception will become stronger than ever.A bust would follow when expectations have gotten so far out of hand that even good results are not enough - investors will come to demand outstanding results.It is difficult to guess what event might lead to this. This could happen if there are no more viable acquisition targets left in the space. Or if 3D Systems has acquired so many targets that the government feels compelled to step in. In addition, perhaps the ""early adopter"" market will become saturated, and there may be a lag phase before later adopters begin to purchase. These are merely guesses, and there are no clear signs that any of these outcomes will take place.Nevertheless, I do argue that the ongoing increase in positive perception of the company should lead to an eventual disappointment of that optimism, however it manifests.A Boom Without a Bust?It is possible to have a boom without a bust. In order to prevent a bust, 3D Systems would have to exit the reflexive process at some point. Two ways it might exit the process are growing its operating cash flow enough to self-finance its growth-via-acquisition strategy, or growing organic earnings enough to justify its P/E.For 2012, 3D Systems financed 28.3% of the cash flow necessary for its acquisitions and capital expenditures, and in the current quarter, it financed 19.4%. So it is a long way from being able to finance acquisitions through its operations alone.As for organic earnings growth, it is difficult to break out the earnings alone, as the acquisitions affect profit margins. However, we do know that organic revenue growth is 22%, which is lower than the overall revenue growth of 31%. So it follows that the organic earnings growth is lower than the combined, and this growth rate is still not capable of maintaining the high P/E ratio.No Trough YetGartner, an IT research firm, has often used the ""Hype Cycle"" to describe the introduction of new technologies.3D printing as a whole did not experience a ""trough of disillusionment"" during the recent sell-off. Instead, it seems that news about 3D printed guns has only reignited the hype surrounding 3D printing technology. Enthusiasm and knowledge of the technology is increasing, not decreasing. Therefore, I argue we still have not hit the peak of inflated expectations. This strengthens the argument for a ""Phase 4"" type boom in the stock.Summary:Bottom LineThe long investment thesis for 3D Systems that I outlined previously is intact. The company has survived a test period, and I expect the result will be a perception that is stronger than ever, pushing both stock prices and earnings to new heights. The trend continues to be vulnerable to a bust, but there are no signs that this will happen any time soon. Thus, I am long the stock.I expect it to be a wild ride and not for the faint of heart. The tricky part will be knowing when to jump off.Disclosure: I am long DDD. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1417891,44981,2013-05-09T05:34:46-04:00,,"At the end of March, I wrote an article about 3D systems (NYSE:DDD) where I valued the stock based on future free cash flows. According to my assumptions and the model, the fair value of the stock came out to be $47 - at the time 3D Systems was trading at around $30. The stock closed over $43 on Wednesday May 8, 2013. Taking into account the sharp upward movement of the stock; I may have to soon adjust my price target upwards. The 3D printing industry overall has been branded as hype only, but I beg to differ. If we look at the two biggest players in the sector (3D systems and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS)); their rise has been backed by solid revenue growth and earnings.The 3D technology has slowly started to become an integral part of the manufacturing industry. Although the technology still has a long way to go, it has already made substantial changes in the production processes. The industry is still in its infancy and the boom will likely happen over the next decade. That is the reason I believe the rise in 3D systems and Stratasys' stock price is not hype, but reflects the future potential. Despite showing double digit growth, I do not believe these companies have hit the peak yet.Share Issue: What Does this Mean for Existing Shareholders?The company has been expanding aggressively through acquisitions. There are two ways to grow: acquisitions and developing new facilities and products - the first option is quicker and offers the company a chance to grab the growth opportunity in time. For a growing company, it is extremely important to have ample funds to exploit the growth opportunity. Debt, stock issue and cash flows from operations are the three most feasible options.The company is going to issue new shares in order to fund future acquisitions. In a normal transaction of this kind, the current shareholders will face dilution, and might not like the idea. However, 3D Systems' shareholders have shown a completely different attitude. The stock is going up despite the share issue. There is another interesting fact to keep in mind regarding 3D Systems' capital structure. The company has been able to sell convertible debt, which means even debt investors of the company have confidence in the future prospects of the company.A large chunk of these investors availed the option of converting their debt into equity, indicating they believe 3D Systems' stock is a better investment than holding its debt. The company had to report about $5.7 million in losses from these conversions, which brought its net income down. However, these charges are non-cash and there was no impact on the cash flows. I believe the management has a strong belief that over the next two to three years, the 3D printing industry can enter the boom stage and the company wants to be ready and well positioned to exploit this growth opportunity.Moving onto the details of the transaction - the stock issue will be worth $250 million and it will be priced on Thursday May 9. In addition, 1.3 million shares will be sold by directors, affiliates and certain officers. The company, however, will not receive any proceeds from the selling stockholders. Total Share count for 3D Systems have increased recently due to the new stock issues and debt conversion. However, as long as the revenue growth continues, the shareholders do not need to worry about considerable dilution. It also shows that the company is confident about the future growth in EPS and an increased number of shares will not bring down EPS.Total number of shares at the end of the quarter was 91.8 million, up from 76.3 million a year ago. However, the dilution in earnings did not happen due to the increase in number of shares. If we take out the non-cash expense of $5.7 million for convertible debt, the EPS for the quarter would have been between $0.11 and $0.12, considerably higher than $0.08 reported a year ago. If the organic growth of over 20% continues over the next year, the shareholders have nothing to worry about and the share issue will not cause dilution. However, if the revenue growth takes a hit, then we might see the double impact of increase in outstanding shares and a fall in earnings.Acquisition of RPDGThe newest addition the 3D Systems portfolio is Rapid Product Development Group (RPDG), a company mainly focused on industrial segment of the 3D printing industry. The company has operations in the U.S., China, Mexico and the U.K., and mainly offers rapid prototyping, tooling and production. The company uses Stereolithography and selective laser sintering techniques among others.RPDG will undoubtedly strengthen the industrial equipment segment of the company. There is no doubt that Stratasys currently has an upper hand in the industrial and medical segments and its portfolio is stronger than all of its competitors. On the other hand, 3D Systems' grip is weaker on the industrial segment and some investments like RPDG will further strengthen the position of the company.ConclusionThe new stock offering will be priced after the close of the market on Thursday. It will be interesting to see how investors react to the news. Till now, the response about the stock offering has been positive from shareholders, and I believe the company will be able to get a good price for its stocks. It is the ideal time for the company to raise cash through equity as the stock is consistently moving up.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1403761,40031,2013-05-05T14:13:22-04:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) reported earnings that inspired confidence, sending the share price sharply higher after the announcement. The rise was propelled further with the announced acquisition of Rapid Product Development Group and the intention of the company to integrate the capabilities into its Quickparts services as soon as possible. The organic growth was satisfying, and gross margins expanded with potential to increase further.Earnings highlights3D Systems reported a 24% increase in adjusted earnings over the same quarter last year on a 31% rise in revenue. The earnings increase was in line with analyst estimates, while revenue slightly exceeded analyst expectations. Gross margin improved 250 basis points from a year ago to 52.4%. CFO Damon Gregoire said in the conference call that there is still an opportunity to continue to expand margins on materials, as they have the highest profit margin. With more printers being placed into the market, the company will have an increase in materials revenue generation.Printer sales were up 61% compared to one year ago and organic growth was 22%. Print materials revenue increased 16%, and services and healthcare revenue rose 18% each. Gross profit margins increased across all categories. Printers and other products' profit margin rose from 38.7% in the first quarter of 2012 to 44.9% in first quarter of 2013. Print materials margin increased from 68% to 72.7% in the same period, while services gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 43.9%.The company introduced various new products, including eight new ProJet® 3510 professional 3D printers, the second generation of Cube and the new Cubex 3D printer, supporting the consumer initiative.New acquisitionA day after the earnings report, the company announced the acquisition of Rapid Product Development Group, and the intention of quickly rolling its capabilities into its Quickparts services. With the new acquisition, the company raised full year revenue guidance to $460-$510 million, and adjusted EPS to $1.05-$1.20.Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) announced on May 3rd that they will become the first major U.S. retailer to announce the availability of 3D printers. The Cube 3D printer is immediately available on Staples.com for $1,299.99 and will be available in a limited number of Staples stores by the end of June. The news translates well into the company's consumer market efforts. The management said in the conference call that the consumer products are selling ""extremely well"".Group movementStratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) have benefited from the good news from 3D Systems. Both stocks rallied sharply last week, and ExOne reached new all-time highs. The next test for all three stocks will be when Stratasys reports earnings, and they are slated to report on May 13th. ExOne will report earnings on May 14th. Stratasys is expected to report a 36% increase in earnings on 118% rise in revenue. The substantial rise in revenue is due to the Objet merger. All three stocks have exhibited constructive price and volume action since early March, with higher volume on up days and lower volume on down days. 3D Systems broke through the 50 day moving average line shortly after I wrote my last article, where I said:After the sharp upside movement, a consolidation would not be surprising for the 3D printing group.Source: StockchartsShort interestThe new short interest report reveals a further increase in short interest. The short interest increased by 800,000 shares to 27.3 million, representing 32.8% of free float. Since the latest report is from April 15th, there might have been a minor short squeeze with this latest move. We have to wait for the new data to confirm. The large short interest might cause a powerful short squeeze if the share price rises further, and 3D Systems keeps delivering high earnings and revenue growth.Source for data: Nasdaq.comConclusion3D Systems is back on track, with share price and fundamentals agreeing with each other and growing together again. The consumer initiative is doing very well, with new products and the first deal with a major U.S. retailer. The company is managing to increase gross profit margins, and expects the trend to continue. 3D printing is here to stay, and the shorts might get squeezed if the buying pressure keeps the last week's pace. However, a price consolidation might be in order after such a strong move last week, and earnings reports of Stratasys and ExOne will certainly have an impact on 3D Systems' short term price performance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in XONE, DDD over the next 72 hours.

1384281,44141,2013-04-30T11:05:04-04:00,,"This morning, 3D Systems Corp (NYSE:DDD) announced its 2013 first quarter results. 3D Systems has a market cap of $3.25 billion and so far occupies the leader position in the rapidly growing 3D printing space. Below I have provided an analysis of the earnings as well as a discussion on the upside 3D Systems offers investors.First Quarter Results3D Systems reported a non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.21 and GAAP EPS of $0.06, which met analysts' expected EPS estimate of $0.21. Revenues came in 31% higher than the prior year's $102.1 million due mostly in part to a 61% increase in printers and other product revenue. A gross profit margin of 52.4% helped bring in $18.9 million (non-GAAP net) and $5.9 of GAAP net income.During the first quarter, several personal and professional 3D printers were introduced as well as new software packages and consumer apps. 3D Systems has the most diverse product range when compared to its competitors Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), which has helped 3D Systems maintain its lead so far. And, with $110.5 million in cash and a commitment to more R&D, I think 3D Systems will occupy the top spot for a long time.A look at management's presentation on revenue and new product growth:Stock PerformanceUnlike most fast-growth companies, DDD shares have pulled back from their 52 week highs of $47.99 and now trade for $35.77 per share. This pullback offers investors what I feel may be one of the last opportunities to get in at a more reasonable price. Once the 3D printers and market develop more, I think there will be exponential growth in revenues and inventory turnover. The turning point will be when manufacturers start to identify exactly where and how they can use the machines, something that is taking time but will ultimately save them millions of dollars when compared to the traditional prototype and manufacturing processes.Bottom LineAnyone looking for big growth has everything they are looking for in 3D Systems. It's hard to be definitive on a growing company in a relatively new industry but it is undeniable that the demand is there and that 3D Systems is positioned to benefit from growth in any niche that develops. The only negative that I see from the earnings announcement is that while there was significant growth over what was produced in Q1 2012, revenues, gross profits and income were all relatively flat when compared to the subsequent quarters performance. Shares opened today down 3.66% or $1.42 per share this morning and they will most likely be very volatile over the next year. I personally will be buying on the dips.Disclosure: I am long DDD.

1462931,49761,2013-05-27T10:25:20-04:00,,"As many investors know, CAN-SLIM is the mnemonic for a screen of high growth stocks that was developed by William J. O'Neil, successful investor, entrepreneur, and founder of Investor Business Daily. O'Neil began using his CAN-SLIM methodology in 1953, and the approach is generally regarded as one of the most effective screens for finding high growth stocks that will lead their sector and trade to higher highs. CAN-SLIM is a tried and true screen for early stage high growth stocks like those we see in the 3D printing space with companies like 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), and Arcam Ab (OTCPK:AMAVF). These companies are on the cutting edge of what many believe will be a technological and societal leap forward over the next decade.Putting that aside for a moment, CAN-SLIM was developed with the goal of finding stocks before they make major moves, and the 3D printing stocks as a group have had a tremendous run over the last 12-18 months. This raises the question, can a company's stock that meets the CAN-SLIM screen and has already had a significant run continue to rise? History proves the answer is yes, and the stock may continue to rise precipitously over a period of years if it remains an innovative leader in a high-growth sector during a period of economic stability.With that in mind, I thought I'd filter 3D Systems Corp. through the 7 screens in the mnemonic to see where the company currently stands, (despite its recent gains) and this is what I found.3D Systems' core operational, non-GAAP* .21 EPS in the first quarter of 2013 was an increase of 23.5% from the first quarter of 2012 which came in at .17. Moreover, progressive EPS of .27, .32, and finally .39 during the remainder of 2012 demonstrate EPS growth that accelerated throughout the year. DDD missed the acceleration in progressive EPS in the fourth quarter of 2012 as compared to the first quarter of 2013 in part due to share dilution and exposure to foreign exchange risk. Analysts on average are expecting second quarter EPS of .24, which, if 3D Systems meets or beats, would show that EPS growth is once again accelerating.Here, 3D Systems has knocked it out of the park:Non-GAAP EPS for 2010 = .48 (up from a mere .05 for 2009) Non-GAAP EPS for 2011 = .81 (69% increase over 2010)Non-GAAP EPS for 2012 = $1.25 (54% increase from 2011)3D Systems' annual earnings growth speaks loud and clear, and explain why its lofty PE multiple is justified from the perspective of DDD bulls.Speaking personally, I don't know of any ""new product or service"" that will be as game-changing to our personal lives, and the world as a whole ten years from now as 3D printing. I know there are some who claim 3D printing is a fad, it's over-hyped, it won't be adopted by the general public, and so-on, but there were also plenty of doubters when the personal computer was in its infancy, and cell phones were the size of a shoe box. I believe the doubters of 3D printing in general and 3D Systems' role in its future will be proven wrong also.A good indicator of the size and strength of the personal and small business 3D printer market will take place at the end of next month, when Staples begins selling the Cube 3D Printer by 3D Systems in their stores.If online sales (already underway) and initial store sales are strong, then look for DDD and the rest of the 3D printing stocks to rally (again) as the imagination of the public and appetite for the technology grows.Incidentally, 3D Systems appears to already be selling the Cube on China's largest B2C web site, Jingdong Mall.Bottom line: Never underestimate the potential of the ""New"" factor of a company like 3D Systems.In DDD's case, the MFI has ranged in that sweet spot of 30-80 for almost all of the last 6 months. This is helpful in clearing up the supply/demand picture for DDD because while there have been some large volume spikes on days the stock fell precipitously during January and February, there were equally high volume spikes on share price advances in May. While the stock has traded in a broad range from $27/share to $52/share over the last 6 months, the MFI tells us that there has been, on average, more buying pressure than selling pressure, and (can I say ""printing""?), the ""S"" very nicely in CAN-SLIM.Here again, DDD outperforms. The stock's relative strength compared to all companies in the Investor's Business Daily database (available by subscription) comes in at a whopping 96, meaning DDD outperformed 96% of the stocks screened. That's strength. That's printing a titanium ""L"" down for ""Leader"" in the CAN-SLIM screen.In this case, 3D Systems is a mixed bag. Institutional ownership numbers tend to vary somewhat depending on the source, but each of the sources I researched reported institutional sponsorship growth in the last quarter of 2012, with institutions as net sellers (approximately 3M shares) in the first quarter of 2013.(Data from Fidelity Investments)I give 3D Systems a small ""i"" here and will wait to see what the institutional sponsorship is in the next quarter. If it continues to decline, it could be cause for measured concern.In a rising market as we're currently experiencing, a high-growth cyclical company like 3D Systems historically outperforms. It may sound trite to say ""the trend is your friend,"" but it is still true nonetheless.My conclusion is that 3D Systems Inc. currently meets all of the CAN-SLIM screening methodology with an asterisk for institutional sponsorship. While the recent gains in the share price of 3D Systems Corporation have been significant, I believe that trend will continue as 3D printing goes mainstream over the next decade and changes our lives in ways we are only beginning to imagine.* The use of GAAP vs. non-GAAP earnings has been a subject of intense debate for many years and goes beyond the scope of this article. I have chosen to utilize non-GAAP numbers for this article because it gives investors a more accurate interpretation of the historic and potential future organic growth of 3D Systems' core operational earnings.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1381031,45191,2013-04-29T09:57:57-04:00,,"Additive Layer Manufacturing, or ALM for short, is the process by which solid objects, of virtually any shape, are created from a digital model. ALM creates objects by repeatedly adding layers of a given material, one on top of another, and fusing them together. ALM is superior to traditional manufacturing processes given that it produces zero waste.As opposed to conventional manufacturing processes, which rely on the removal of raw materials to produce final products, ALM utilizes an additive process, whereby raw material/s is/are added, layer upon layer (similar to making a layer cake), until the final product emerges; thus it produces no waste.Given that a picture (or, more precisely in this case, a video) is worth a thousand words, I am going to save readers some laborious time reading and introduce a handful of videos I have collected on the subject:CommentaryThe range of products that can be produced with ALM is limited only by the size of the printer and the materials it utilizes; and the magnitude of change the technology will have on manufacturing processes and commerce cannot be overstated. ALM stands to revolutionize the way we think about producing and purchasing goods. Similar to the way in which Guttenberg's printing press and the personal computer changed the way people collect information and communicate with one another, ALM stands to change the way in which goods are produced, and the way in which consumers acquire finished goods. It is a major paradigm shift that has already begun, and for those who fear the powerful effects it will have on our society -- sadly, the genie is already out of the bottle.For many of those who still earn a living in a manufacturing environment, 3-D printing is not good news; however, for consumers it is fabulous news. Manufacturers stand to reduce their cost of goods sold by as much as 75% or more, and those cost savings will be passed down to consumers at an accelerated pace as the technology matures. Moreover, at some point in the not too distant future, individuals will more likely than not be afforded opportunities to produce their own goods as the costs for personal 3-D printers decline. This will have a profound effect on businesses and on commerce.Though personal 3-D printers stand to significantly reduce net costs to consumers, the technology, unfortunately, introduces a darker side to the equation as well. Given that 3-D printers do not discriminate against that which can be produced, the technology introduces the nefarious possibilities of producing undocumented, undetectable weaponry for the enthusiast and terrorist alike. For more on this subject, please reference the above video entitled ""Cody Wilson Interview with Glenn Beck.""Not all, however, is gloom and doom. The technology provides some very positive benefits as well. One of those benefits is the very apparent cost savings that will be achieved through a zero waste manufacturing process. Raw material costs, however, are only the beginning of the savings. Through a new print-to-spec, print-to-demand and print for local markets business model, manufacturers stand to significantly reduce inventory and shipping costs, as well as raw material and labor costs. Indeed, the changes will be dramatic.The road to printing paradise for manufacturers, though, is also fraught with certain pitfalls. Until now, entrepreneurs have encountered very high barriers to entry in the world of manufacturing given the significant start-up costs for most industries. However, give a creative entrepreneur a powerful computer and 3-D printer and watch imaginations soar. Furthermore, give a consumer an Internet connection and his or her own little manufacturing workstation and watch the winds of change really begin to blow. Need a new pair of shoes, a flower vase or replacement door handle for your refrigerator, simply go online, purchase the design specs, download the file and just click ""print."" Truly, it is a page taken directly from a Star Trek script whereby each individual possesses his or her very own replicator. Tea anyone? ""Earl Grey -- hot!""History:The origins of 3-D printing can be traced back as far as 1976 when the inkjet printer was invented. In the mid '80s the idea of printing with materials rather than ink was born and the concept of ""printing"" morphed into the idea of creating new ways of manufacturing.In 1984 Charles W. Hull, the co-founder, executive vice president and chief technology officer of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), invented a solid imaging process, which he called stereolithography. Stereolithography produces solid objects by successively printing thin layers of ultraviolet, curable material one layer on top of another. Hull coined the term ""stereolithography"" when he patented his idea under U.S. Patent 4,575,330. The patent, entitled ""Apparatus for Production of Three-Dimensional Objects by Stereolithography,"" was filed on March 11, 1986.In its early days, ALM (more commonly known as 3-D printing) was used primarily to design and create models, which were then used to aid in the production of goods using conventional manufacturing methods. Over time, however, print devices evolved and new materials were introduced, which allowed designers to create usable devices and components. With the introduction of these new materials, engineers and designers have been given the ability to produce complex structures with the mere click of a mouse button. For an interesting graphic on the history of 3-D printing, simply click print.CompanyFounded in 1986 by Charles (""Chuck"") W. Hull, 3D Systems Corporation has, to date, the broadest 3-D printer and 3-D printer support product selection available. DDD not only sells 3-D printers, it offers 3-D software and digital content solutions to personal and professional users alike. Through its On Demand 3D Parts solutions, DDD also offers custom-made part solutions to clients who may need specialty parts made ""on demand.""Like its inkjet predecessors, 3-D printers rely on consumable materials, which drive gross margins for DDD. With that fact at the forefront of managements' minds, in 2006 consumables were made proprietary to the systems DDD produces. Thus, a barrier was created for third-party material vendors who may wish to capitalize on DDD's success in this ever expanding field of technology. This action helped to anchor DDD's position in the world of 3-D printing solutions. To further protect its profitability, and its intellectual property, DDD operates under a ""closed-source"" model, which, primarily, relies on in-house product innovation, design and development. DDD also utilizes patent protections to limit competition and further widen its industrial moat.FundamentalsDDD has shown strong revenue growth over the past few years, but much of that growth has been fueled by acquisitions. Net income rose 11.43% from FY 2011 to FY 2012, and EPS rose 51.06% from FY 2011 to FY 2012, while operating expenses also increased an eye-opening 63.51%. Also of concern, is the fact that ROIC has shown a decline over the past three years, and its most noticeable drop occurred between FY 2011 and FY 2012 when the number went from 12.81 to 4.86 (a 62.06% decline!).CommentaryArguments for and against growth through acquisition have been made, and it is this author's belief that acquisitions can work if done correctly. First, certain synergies must exist. If, for example, the McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) wished to purchase Barnes & Noble, Inc. (NYSE:BKS) to capitalize on its cookbooks, the marriage between the two companies would be impractical. If, however, MCD were to make an offer to purchase Burger King Worldwide, Inc. (BKW) in an effort to gain market share, especially in areas where MCD's market share may be weak, then the deal would be much more sensible.Second, an acquiring company cannot overpay for the one to be acquired. Though a certain amount of goodwill is to be expected, especially where intangibles are concerned, exorbitant prices rarely serve to satiate the appetites of outrageous expectations.Third, the assumption of debt cannot be taken lightly. All too often companies assume high levels of debt from those companies being acquired. The acquirers often do so under the notion that the debt can be easily extinguished either through the issuance of new debt at lower interest rates, or through the issuance of new equity stakes, or through the ""added revenues"" the company expects to receive from its newly acquired source (the level of due diligence is often in question here); and all too often the assumptions are wrong. A case-in-point is Supervalu's (NYSE:SVU) acquisition of Albertson's, Inc. which took place in 2006. The deal buried SVU under a mountain of debt, ultimately leading the company to the divestiture of many of its assets earlier this year (narrowly sparing the company from almost certain bankruptcy).Fourth, the expedient elimination of redundant, weak or non performing assets is imperative. This is usually one of the most difficult aspects of acquisitions because it inevitably equates to job elimination. The acquisition of intellectual property, and the acquisition of those individuals capable of producing or enhancing intellectual property, can be an extremely valuable proposition for many growing organizations; however, supporting roles, especially those with excess personnel, can create tremendous drags on a company's profitability -- especially where the acquiring company may have overextended its reach.Finally, as opposed to those in mature and/or dying industries (again, SVU comes to mind), acquisitions are best suited for organizations in new, or relatively new, and growing industries.TechnicallyAfter experiencing some very choppy trading, and a rather significant decline between early April, 2011 to early January of 2012, the company's stock price went parabolic. From December 30, 2011, to January 23, 2011, DDD went from a low of $9.53 to a high of $47.99 -- an increase of 403.57%! From its high, DDD began a rather rapid descent to a low of $27.88, which was reached on March 18, 2013. As of Friday's close (i.e. 4/26/2013), DDD's stock price was above the 50-Day MA, situated at a per share price of $34.57. On balance volume has been choppy over the past few years but it currently appears to be in an uptrend.ConclusionDDD is in a very exciting industry that could very well see some explosive growth in the decades to come. Presently, however, the company's stock price appears rich at current valuations.DDD, however, is an optionable stock with LEAPS extending out as far as January 2015. For those who may be interested in initiating new positions in DDD, options strategies offer viable alternatives to entering equity positions outright.Though DDD's acquisition spree, which began in 2009, may be of some concern, the company appears to be doing a rather good job handling the absorption of the companies it has acquired. Long-term debt, as well has the company's debt-to-equity ratio, declined significantly from FY 2011, and the company's current and quick ratios are also in good shape, which indicate that it won't have any troubles meeting its short-term obligations.In sum, DDD and the technology it produces could very well prove to be the new technological powerhouses of the 21st century. For those who may be interested in investing in this burgeoning company, a wait, watch and ""print"" approach may be advisable. Nonetheless, this is not a story likely to go away any time soon.Note: Financial data obtained from Morningstar.com and the company's most recent 10-K.

1358941,40031,2013-04-22T14:14:56-04:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) had a rough ride in the last two months. Its 42% plunge from all-time highs followed a disappointing earnings release. 3D Systems appears to have bottomed in mid-March, as it was dragged higher by the competing Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), which I noted in my previous article. The company will announce earnings on April 30th, and it will certainly make a determining impact on short and intermediate-term price direction.Recent developmentsThe sentiment surrounding 3D printing stocks has changed for the better recently. Upbeat earnings reports from Stratasys and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) helped to put a stop on the declining price of 3D Systems. Meanwhile, the company is making efforts in expanding its reseller network. Three deals were announced recently, and the company expanded its presence in Turkey and Japan. The latest deal was with Hawk Ridge Systems, and gives the company increased exposure in the United States and Canada. Hawk Ridge is recognized as the number one worldwide SolidWorks reseller.Last week the company announced the immediate availability of Geomagic Design, a new suite of affordable CAD design solutions. 3D Systems acquired Geomagic in late February. Geomagic design is available in three versions, with the lowest price for the Geomagic Design Personal starting at $199, and the most advanced expert version starting at $20,500. These tools enable mechanical CAD design, allowing engineers, makers, consumers and hobbyists to go from concept to manufacturing.Earnings previewAnalysts expect first quarter earnings to rise 23.5% to $0.21 from $0.17 last year, on a 30.4% increase in revenue. There were no changes in expectations in the last sixty days, except for the decrease of consensus estimates for 2014, from $1.39 to $1.29.In the fourth quarter conference call, the management said it expects further increase in gross profit margins. Integrated materials revenue as a percentage of total materials revenue increased from 30% in 2009 to 63% in 2012. Integrated materials have the highest gross margin, and the trend of increased share of total materials is expected to continue, driving the gross margin higher toward the expected target of 56%. Current gross profit margin is 51.2%.The management also expects consumer activities to become a significant revenue driver in the second part of the year, so we should wait a couple of quarters to see the breakdown of this segment, as it was promised in the latest conference call.Short interestShort interest continued to rise in the two latest reporting periods, from 24 million shares at the end of February to 26.5 million shares at the end of March. The short interest as a percentage of the free float now stands at 31.2%. With such a high short interest, I expect significant volatility after the earnings announcement. If the company delivers above expectations and gives an upbeat guidance, we might see a significant short squeeze and a sharp rise in price. The opposite is true if the company fails to deliver, and an example of investor disappointment can be seen looking at the post-earnings reaction two months ago.Source for data: Nasdaq.comPrice Action3D Systems is up 18% since the mid-March bottom. It failed to close above the 50 day moving average line, which serves as resistance at the moment. Price action has been constructive recently, with more volume on up days, and lower volume on down days. The broad market is getting weaker, and that might pressure the share price. A decisive break above the 50 day moving average line on above average volume would be very positive for the stock. I suspect investors and traders will wait for the earnings announcement, and that trading will be subdued until then.Conclusion3D Systems has continued its efforts to expand the reseller network, domestic and abroad, with increased presence in Turkey, Japan and North America. Earnings and revenue growth are expected to continue, and the announcement at the end of April will provide investors with new information about the results of the recent efforts, and determine the direction of the share price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1384241,44981,2013-04-30T10:58:36-04:00,,"The 3D printing industry has some of the most exciting stocks at the moment, and 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is one of the fastest growing in the industry. The company has reported double-digit revenue growth in each of the last four quarters, which is remarkable given the current economic conditions. The revenue growth on average has been over 54% over the past four quarters. The company has been able to again show impressive growth in revenues when it reported its first quarter earnings today. As a result, the stock went up 2.90% in the pre-market. Let's take a look at the earnings.First Quarter EarningsRevenue for the company grew by 31% year-over-year and went up to $102.1 million. Printer sales were at the forefront of the increase in revenue, and recorded an increase of 61% during the first quarter. Whenever the revenue growth of 3D Systems has been discussed, organic growth has been an important element. Organic growth for the quarter stood at 22.1%, showing a slight improvement from the last quarter when the company reported organic growth of 22%. In my opinion, organic growth of over 20% is extremely impressive, and increased sales of printers and materials indicate that the growth will not slow any time soon.Printer and other equipment unit sales increased by a massive 81%, which resulted in a 38% increase in gross profit and gross profit margin went up to 52.4%, 250 basis points above the previous figures. Higher volume sales were the main reason for gross profit and margin expansion, and it also indicates the company is able to manage costs. Segment wise break-up shows that Services and healthcare were both the second fastest growing segments at 18% each. The slowest growing segment was print materials, which showed only 16% growth.3D Systems launched four new precuts during the first quarter and recorded best new product revenues compared to the last two years. New products revenue stood at $38.3 million, up 60% compared to the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter went up by 43% and stood at $18.9 billion, compared to year ago value of $13.2 million. GAAP net income was $5.9 million, slightly lower than $6.2 million reported for the same quarter last year. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter stood at $0.06, compared to$0.08 per share a year ago. However, non-GAAP earnings showed an increase of 23.5% and stood at $0.21 per share, compared to the last year's value of $0.17 per share. Operating expenses as percentage of revenue have also come down from 37.1% to 35.2%.Printers and other products are the biggest component of the total revenues at 39%, improving from 31% in 2012. As a result of massive increase in printer sales, the segment has become the biggest contributor towards total revenue. Previously the position was held by services segment, which now stands at 33%, down from 37%. Materials segment has also come down to 28% from 32% a year ago. Geographically, North America is still the biggest region for 3D systems and contributed 56% towards the total revenues, down from 59%. North Amercia's loss of share was divided between Europe (28% from 27%) and Asia-Pacific (16% from 14%).There was also an increase of about 32% in R&D expenses and 23% in SG&A expenses. However, the net effect was positive as these expenses came down as a percentage of revenue. Cash position for 3D systems deteriorated as the company reported $110 million in cash, compared to $155 million last year.ConclusionRevenue growth remains strong for the company, and increased demand for printers and materials should allow the company to continue its impressive growth in revenues. In addition, 3D Systems is launching a number of new products during the current year so expect this year to be the best in terms of new product launches. Its products are getting good reception from customers. I will maintain my bullish view of 3D Systems - it has considerable upside potential. The company has one of the strongest and most diverse product portfolios, which sets it apart from its peers.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1318541,40351,2013-04-03T15:09:36-04:00,,"The 3D printing industry is expected to become a $6.5 billion industry by 2019, rising from just a $1.7 billion market in 2011. Research firm Gartner believes that enterprise-class printers priced below $2,000 will be available in the market from as early as 2016. The firms operating in the industry today, particularly market leaders 3D Systems Corp (DDD) and Stratasys (SSYS), will have the first mover's advantage and will reap maximum returns in the long run as the niche starts becoming more mainstream. Although there are going to be some short-term hiccups, which has now become apparent, the long-term prospects remain bright.Both 3D Systems and Stratasys have released their quarterly results which continue to show revenue growth, although with some confusion over growth. Meanwhile, a relatively newer entrant ExOne (XONE) has now posted its first quarterly results following its IPO in February.3D SystemsThe industry leader was the first to report its fourth quarter results along with its three-for-two stock split in late February. Not only did the company's management perform the split on the day of its earnings release, the release itself was oddly timed and analysts only had 20 minutes for review before the conference call started -- which created confusion as the numbers had to be adjusted for the split. The business's revenues increased by 45% to $101.6 million, $2.3 million short of analysts' expectations, while its net income increased by 36.25% to $10.9 million. Excluding one off items, 3D Systems' earnings per share increased from $0.27 a year earlier to $0.39. This was significantly above the market's expectations of $0.26.For the full year, revenues increased by 53.5% to $353.6 million, which includes 22% organic growth, while net income increased by 65.7% to $67.9 million. The business is expecting revenue growth of 24% to 37% in the current year and earnings growth of up to 38%. The relatively modest guidance - compared to what the business has already achieved - was enough to disappoint its investors as its shares plunged by 9% on the day of the earnings release.StratasysStratasys quarterly results were better than analysts' expectations. The company earned revenues of $96.4 million which is significantly more than the market's expectations of $52.8 million and has gone up by 23% from $78.3 million reported in the same quarter last year. This translated into a net loss of $3.5 million as compared to a loss of $6.3 million a year earlier. In non-GAAP terms, the company's earnings were $16.3 million or $0.40 per share, which is 2 cents above analysts' estimates.For the full fiscal year, Stratasys's revenues increased by 30% to $359 million while its annual losses shrank from $30.9 million in 2011 to $21.6 million in 2012. The non-GAAP net income, excluding the $1.4 billion Objet's merger related and other costs, increased by 60% to $59.6 million or $1.49 per share. For the current year, the business has given a revenue and non-GAAP income guidance of $430 million - $445 million and $1.80 to $1.95 per share; which is above analysts' revenue and profit estimate of $421 million and $1.86 per share.ExOneExOne reported a quarterly net income of $902,000, coming from a loss of $2.77 million in Q4-2011 while it recorded revenues of $12.7 million, showing a massive increase of 369% from just $2.72 million in Q4-2011. The company did not release an EPS figure, but with 13.28 million shares, its earnings turn out to be $0.0679 per share, which is below analyst's estimate of $0.08 per share.For the full year, while the total revenues increased by 87% to $28.66 million, annual losses have increased by 27% to $10.17 million or $0.77 per share, which is more than analysts' loss estimate of $0.66 per share.More than half of the total annual sales (54%) have come from the sale of 3D printing machines while the rest came from selling 3D printed parts and materials (NASDAQ:PSC). A total 13 machines were sold in 2012 which takes the average price to $1.2 million. Given the relatively smaller size of the company, a slight increase in sales in the number of machines can give a significant boost to the company's overall sales. Moreover, this is also going to improve the ExOne's margins. The firm's gross margin in Q4-2011 was 14.6% but as revenues from machine sales multiplied from $0.2 million in Q4-2011 to $8.9 million in Q4-2012, its gross margin rose to 49%.For the full year, ExOne's gross margin increased, due to reasons explained above, from 23.8% in 2011 to 42.4% in 2012.In 2013, ExOne is expecting to earn revenues of $48 million - $52 million while most of this is going to come in H2-2013. The midpoint of this guidance, $50 million, would represent a 74.46% increase over 2012. The business expects its gross margin to remain between 42% and 46% in 2013.ExOne's rise was already anticipated but 3D Systems still leads in terms of gross margin. In the final quarter, both ExOne and 3D Systems recorded a year-over-year increase in quarterly gross margins. On the other hand, Stratasys has reported a drop from 52.47% in Q4-2011 to 46.15% in Q4-2012.Since February, ExOne's stock has risen by 23.5% while 3D Systems and Stratasys have been down 24.3% and 10.0%, respectively.The P/E ratio of Stratasys is still above 200, while that of 3D Systems has fallen to approximately 70. The EV:Sales ratio of both Stratasys and 3D Systems is well below that of ExOne but the latter, given its small size, has the greatest growth prospects.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1356691,36191,2013-04-21T09:03:17-04:00,,"IntroductionTechnological advances have made the production of objects now possible by printing. While printing was previously restricted to 2 dimensions, these advances have transformed the way production is carried out. With still a long way to go, two companies are battling it out to be the spearhead of 3D printing industry - 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS). For the time being, 3D printing is a costly process, which takes longer and results in products of inferior quality, when compared to traditional methods of production. With time, however, I expect this trend to move forward, allowing investors a great opportunity to latch on to the profits generated by these firms.The conundrum facing the two companies today is the correct selection of one of the following options to keep their business sustainable and profitable: focus on the niche and build products which are accessible to individual end users, or target mass producers, which would want to shift from the usual methods of production and adopt the new printing technology. 3D Systems, in particular, has taken an approach which focuses on 3D printer affordability and end-user friendliness for everyday use. This is a strategy that remains to be proven, with its demand and risk question marks. Stratasys, on the other hand, is focusing on becoming the go-to source for the high end, professional 3D printing and consumables.For 3D Systems, growth in revenue is expected to be around 24% to 37% for 2013. Earnings are expected to be between $1.00 and $1.15 per share, based upon strong demand for its products in 2012. A 23% growth in Q4 2012 revenue, coupled with a $28.6 million orders backlog, shows an encouraging forecast for the future. Stratasys has become the leading provider of printers for use in the medical sector. The company's recent launch of Object30 OrthoDesk for small orthodontic labs and clinics demonstrates the rapid growth of digital orthodontics. While this provides a welcome opportunity for the 3D industry, costs of manufacturing are still far higher than what is considered reasonable, resulting in high prices that are not within the reach of average consumers.Stock AnalysisContrary to the global market trends, which witnessed a massive loss in demand and output during 2009, the 3D industry began experiencing its boom as demand, awareness and use of the technology has become more widespread. Since 2009, 3D Systems and Stratasys have grown by 567% and 268%, respectively; phenomenal figures for a revolutionary invention which is still costly to operate. In comparison to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, the two companies obviously outperformed the market averages.What's important for investors now, though, is the present performance of the stock and the anticipation of expected returns for the future. That being said, the two stocks have grown phenomenally over the past year. However, growth in 2013-2014 will depend more on the adoption of 3D printing as a mode of preferred production, as well as the reduction in costs for using this service.Financial ReviewThe two companies do not offer a dividend at the moment and rely solely on earnings for rewarding investors. 3D System's 52 week range is from $25.56 to $71.98 per share, while it is currently trading at $34.26. Stratasys, on the other hand, has a higher 52 week range from $42.28 to $92.30 per share and its current trading price is $74.51.There are many ways to estimate the fair stock value of a company. For this purpose, we applied the discounted-earnings-plus-equity model developed by EFS Investment analysts to these competitors.Data from Morningstar and Financial Visualizations on April 20, 2013The calculations based on this model allow us to suggest the following: currently, all stocks are overvalued. In addition, EFS's fair stock price valuation indicates that DDD is trading at the highest premium over its fair value.3D Systems has enjoyed double-digit year-to-year growth in its revenues for the past four quarters. Over that period, revenue has grown by an average of 51.8%. The company is valued slightly more than its competitor, with their market caps being separated by $0.3 billion. Stratasys's higher price suggests issuance of a lesser number of shares in comparison to 3D Systems. The P/E ratio points towards Stratasys being overvalued compared to price and also to EPS. It only has a 21.6% EPS growth over the past 3 years, compared to 3D Systems' 249.2%. As far as margins and ROE are concerned, 3D Systems outperforms Stratasys again due to its superior value, while eclipsing its rival by more than 10 times.Make or Break for Investors3D Systems Corp has been very aggressive with its acquisition policy, and there are still doubts about whether it can generate organic growth, which is pivotal for future EPS. This is even more important, as it does not offer a dividend. The management encouragingly noted in the Q4 conference call that a large portion of this year's growth will be organic. That being said, the constant acquiring has helped 3D Systems to experience impressive metrics over the past three years and also helped to fuel investor confidence on the stock market.Stratasys, on the other hand, managed to acquire Objet inexpensively earlier in the year, which helped it grow as a company and also on the stock charts. It has the widest printing material array in the industry and around a $30 million backlog of orders, suggesting a high demand for its products. Stratasys is capitalizing on the one market segment which is showing promise for swift growth and demand for 3D printers - commercial manufacturing. While personal 3D printing continues to languish, medical and manufacturing are increasingly making use of Stratasys's services for 3D printing.This provides a conundrum for investors. Do they count on the past performance and stick with 3D Systems in the hope that it will emulate gains provided since 2010, or should they read less into the metrics and understand the industry dynamics, realizing that it is, in reality, Stratasys, which is making the right moves with its focused production and organic growth, which is the only way to achieve a profitable return on any stock. I understand that this industry is new, with a lot yet to be proven and accepted, which keeps me interested in these stocks, but only at a distance. However, this complicated decision is made easier for me due to Stratasys's potential for growth. Its products continue to tap into a much more lucrative market than that which 3D Systems has chosen.Morningstar provides the following rating for the two stocks - DDD: 2/5 buy, 1/5 outperform, 1/5 hold, 1/5 underperform. SSYS: 1/4 buy, 1/4 outperform, 1/4 hold, 1/4 underperform.Bottom LineStratasys and 3D Systems are stocks which will generate a massive demand in the future, but their potential is, undoubtedly, dependent upon the global reception of 3D printing as a tool of manufacturing. That being said, in my opinion, Stratasys has made the right call by focusing on manufacturing instead of personal user demand, as it will not only provide a greater return, but also will bring the costs of 3D printing down over time.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1343311,44981,2013-04-16T02:22:29-04:00,,"The 3D printing sector had an impressive week and almost all of the participants gained substantially -- 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) went up by more than 12% and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) recorded gains of about 13%. The increase in stock price was mainly due to the buy ratings by some analysts about Stratasys and 3D Systems. On the other hand, ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), another player in the sector, rose mainly due to the news that the company is looking to maintain a gross margin of over 50%.Although the past week was good for the whole sector, I will be focusing on 3D systems in this article. Specifically, I will try to explain how 3D systems can benefit from massive jewelry market, and how the jewelry industry is embracing 3D printing.Traditional Ways of Manufacturing and Global MarketTraditional manufacturing of jewelry involves a number of steps: First of all, the design is created - after creating the design; the next step is to create a basic model of the design. Once the primary design is created, then it is evaluated and minor changes are made, if needed. Final two steps involve creating moulds for mass production and manufacturing and finishing of the final products. The traditional ways of manufacturing can take days from creating the design to producing the final product -- 3D printing, on the other hand, can do the job in hours. The technology has made life easier for a lot of jewelry manufacturers by allowing them to design and produce the prototypes in a lot less time than traditional methods.The manufacturing process for jewelry involves a number of fine steps that need careful supervision. The use of 3D printing has allowed the manufacturers to bring down the costs and time needed for production. The technology has saved a substantial investment on die casting or investment casting, and it has also allowed the manufacturers to have more control over the manufacturing process and introduce customization. At the moment, the global jewelry market stands at about $150 billion, and the industry is rapidly adopting the technology. In fact, jewelry manufacturing is becoming one of the most important growth drivers for the 3D printing companies, after medical applications.Materials Available and Mass ProductionThe number of materials available for 3D printing is increasing due to the increased focus on research and development to meet the demand. The technology is now allowing the manufacturers to produce final products, which has increased the need to add more materials to the list. In the past two years, the number of materials used for 3D printing has increased considerably; 3D printers can now use titanium, stainless steel, silver and gold.Cookson Precious Metals is already manufacturing jewelry by using metal laser sintering in collaboration with EOS. In addition, BBC recently published an interesting article on how the technology is transforming the jewelry manufacturing industry. So, the materials are available and the manufacturers are adopting the technology - we have all the pieces in place to see a transformation in the jewelry manufacturing.Where does 3D Systems Stand in All this?3D Systems, unlike its peers, is focusing more on the consumer market. Most of its target markets are at the beginning of their growth phases. The company recently announced its collaboration with the Turkish jewelry manufacturer, Al-Mera. 3D Systems is one of the few manufacturers that offer solutions for the jewelry manufacturers. Its ProJet 3510 CPX and CPXPlus printers allow the manufacturers to save money on investment casting.On the other hand, the company is also providing materials for volume jewelry production. Last year, it developed Visijet Jewel, which is used in the ProJet printers and allows the manufacturers to cut the costs substantially in the manufacturing process.ConclusionIn my previous article, I developed a valuation model for the company and concluded that the stock will reach $47 per share. I have high hopes for the company because I see a lot of areas where 3D systems can grow in the future, and the jewelry manufacturing is one of these sectors. There is an incredible opportunity available in this sector, and 3D Systems is well positioned to benefit due to its early entry. I believe soon this segment will become one of the main revenue drivers for 3D printing companies. In addition, 3D systems has a large portfolio of materials - it should be remembered that the manufacturers will be needing a number of different materials for jewelry and other accessories, which the company possesses. As I have said in the past, 3D systems has a solid business model, which ensures that the company will be able to grow even if 3D printer sales come down in the future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1318451,39791,2013-04-03T14:46:25-04:00,,"Introduction3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD) is one of the most watched stocks in the market today due to its leadership role in the growing 3D printing industry. 3D printers are supposed to be the next high growth industry along with medical marijuana. This has made the stock price of all 3D printing stocks in the industry increase exponentially in a short period of time. ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) has seen its price jump after its IPO last month despite negative reports about the 3D printing industry. DDD is the biggest 3D printing stock with a market capitalization of ~$3 billion. However, some analysts have called the whole industry a bubble because these companies are trading at astronomical valuations, as the earnings are not big enough to justify such high stock values. I am not that skeptical about the stock like the rest of the DDD bears and think that the 3D printing industry has a bright long-term potential. 3D Systems is not some Chinese fraud and has real products with real revenues. However, I would not buy DDD stock hand over fist given the high valuation and would wait for a better entry point.What Does 3D Systems Do3D Systems is a provider of three-dimensional (3D) content-to-print solutions such as 3D printers, print materials and custom services. The company sells printers both for personal and professional use. DDD's professional printers are used for product development, for custom manufacturing of advanced oral and orthopedic restorative devices, custom jewelry, mass customized toys, action figures and collectibles. The company's personal printers are used to make custom products for home and school use. The company blends, markets, sells and distributes consumables, engineered plastic and metal materials and composites under several brand names for use in all its printers. 3D Systems also provides a variety of customer services, local application support and field support for all its stereolithography and selective laser sintering 3D printers. For its personal and professional 3D printers, it provides these services and field support either directly or through a network of authorized resellers or other sources.3D Systems - Advantages3D Systems - Risks3D Systems Financials3D Systems has got a decent balance sheet for a fast growing company, with net cash of ~$75 million and free cash flow of $49 million. The company has managed to increase both gross and operating margins in the last few years. The company's balance sheet remains healthy with a debt equity ratio of just 0.18 and both current and quick ratio remain above 3.The company has grown revenues at an annual rate of ~77% in the last 5 years (mainly through acquisitions). Analysts estimate that the company will grow by ~25% over the next 5 years, which is almost 9 percentage points higher than the rest of the 3D printing industry.Stock PerformanceDDD's stock has shown a stellar performance over the last year doubling to $32. Despite the 100% return, other competitors like Stratsys (SYSS) have outperformed DDD returning over 500% in the same time period. All 3D printing stocks have been on a tear over the last year outperforming the broader markets (S&P 500 and Dow Jones up ~12%). DDD stock has dropped by ~30% from its peak value of ~$45 reached in late January.Summary3D Systems is a highly volatile stock with both proponents and opponents holding extreme views about the company and its prospects. 3D Systems stock has come down quite a bit in the last few months due to concerns about excessive valuations. There are some issues about DDD such as quality of growth, expensive valuation, excess stock marketing etc. However, I think these problems are a bit exaggerated. 3D printing remains an exciting growth opportunity in a slow low growth world. I would watch the stock closely to see how it performs over the next year. I am not that bearish about the stock and hold a more neutral view. If the stock falls and the valuation becomes more reasonable, then I would not mind building a small speculative position.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1314501,40031,2013-04-02T10:50:29-04:00,,"3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD) experienced a steep sell-off in the last two months. The correction came after a tremendous 2012 move from split adjusted $10 to almost $50 at the start of 2013. It now appears to have formed a bottom, and might be ready for a new rise.I wrote about 3D Systems on three occasions, suggesting the short-term dangers before earnings, and in the latest article about a possibility for the stock to reach a short-term bottom. The bottoming process appears to be underway in the last two weeks. And the force behind the latest strength comes from the competition.Stratasys Inc. (NASDAQ:SSYS) reported earnings in early March, and gapped up higher on strong volume, and continued higher in a steady fashion since. 3D Systems continued to go down for two weeks, and then it stabilized around the 200-day moving average line. It is now almost 20% up from the bottom of $28, a correction of 42% since the late February top. Last week, The ExOne Company (NASDAQ:XONE), reported earnings, and they were perceived quite optimistically by the market and the stock rose 9.5% and made new highs. That certainly helped the group, as 3D Systems and Stratasys rallied too.The ExOne Company reported 2012 revenue of $28.7 million, up 87.6% over 2011. It sold eight machines in the fourth quarter. The company expects revenue to increase in the 65% to 80% range. Kent Rockwell, Chairman and CEO commented: ""We made solid progress in 2012. The recent technological advances of our 3D printing machines create persuasive economics for our industrial customers, who have demonstrated a growing interest in applying 3D printing in their manufacturing processes.""On the negative side, a VentureBeat article cited concern about a broad patent issue in 3D printing. In particular, a Stratasys patent for printing with chocolate is one example of such patents, where prior art could be claimed. It remains to be seen if the issue will be problematic for 3D printing companies in the future.History repeats itself?Stratasys has continued the ""tradition,"" as it rallied first and outperformed 3D Systems in the 2011 and 2012 upside moves. 3D Systems caught on later on both occasions and outperformed in the later stages of the rally. In that sense, it is a positive development here for Stratasys to go up first and outperform 3D Systems, and that might be indicative of the potential for both stocks to go higher in the near term.Source: StockchartsWhat can go wrong?3D Systems faces some challenges. The company has been very aggressive with its acquisition policy, and the question remains if the company is able to grow organically. The management noted in the fourth-quarter conference call that a large portion of this year's growth will be organic. And it expects revenue to grow in the 24% to 37% range, and earnings in the $1 to $1.15 range, which translates into 30% to 49% growth. The company trades at 25.6 forward earnings, and it needs to deliver on the high end of guidance to support the valuation. A miss in earnings or inline results would probably not satisfy investors, as we have seen after the latest earnings report.Short interestShort interest hit another all-time high in the latest reporting period. About 1.9 million additional shares were shorted in the first half of March, bringing the total short interest at 25.95 million shares, which is 30.7% of float. The increasing short interest presents a burden on the stock's performance, but may as well provide fuel for a substantial rally.Source for data: Nasdaq.comConclusionGiven the previous history of early outperformance of Stratasys, and a better overall situation in the group movements in March, there is now a better probability for higher prices for 3D Systems in the near term. Rising short interest might be a burden on the stock's performance, but if there is a positive catalyst for the stock, it could prove to be a benefit and a major short squeeze would be underway. 3D Systems certainly needs to deliver above expectations in order to give support to the valuation, and the next earnings report is certainly eagerly expected by investors and traders.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in DDD over the next 72 hours.

1325831,44141,2013-04-08T01:55:00-04:00,,"Despite the hype around 3D printing and the overall rise of the market this year, shares in 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) closed Friday at $31.25 per share, down 12% YTD. As with most new technology, the 3D printing market has no clear leader but I believe 3D Systems' product mix and strategy put it in perfect position to profit from the growing 3D printing demand. Now that DDD is selling at a more attractive price, let's take a look at the stock's recent performance, some fundamentals, as well as the hurdles it will need to clear in the near future.As the chart above shows, this stock had a strong run up until February this year despite the overall market progress. This could potentially spell more bad news, or a better buying opportunity (depending on how you look at it), for DDD shareholders should the stock get caught up in a market correction. Even with its recent downturn shares still trade up 93% over the past 52 weeks, but 34% off their $47.99 per share high.3D Systems reported top line growth of 45% in the last quarter on 90% higher printer demand. Entering 2013, 3D Systems had a backlog of $11.4 million, including $5.9 million of on-demand parts. As the business grows, DDD will continue to diversify its portfolio of products by adding new printers and related products. Management expects 2013 EPS to be between $1.00 to $1.15 on revenues of $440 million to $485 million. Like Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), 3D Systems sells its own printing materials which should also benefit from an increase in printer sales. Below is a look at 3D's revenue trends over the past four years.Market ExpectationsAnalysts have a mean target price of $41.50 and a median target price of $41.00 on the shares. The average estimated earnings per share this year is $1.05 on estimated revenues of $461.35 million, both in-line with management's expected ranges. 3D Systems has met or exceeded these estimates in each of the last four quarters per YAHOO! Finance.FundamentalsBelow, and compiled from data found on Morningstar, I have compared the financial ratios of 3D Systems to the industry averages as well as two of its main competitors Stratasys and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE).As we see above, based on all of the earnings and sales ratios (P/E, P/S, Rev Growth, Margins and ROE) 3D Systems is far and away the most attractively priced of the three. Compared to ExOne and Stratasys, only Stratasys comes on top of any of the financial ratios presented (P/B and D/E). The leader of a market is the one with the sales and at this point of the game, 3D Systems appears to be winning.ObstaclesBottom LineWhile it still is too early to declare the leader of the 3D printing market, I believe the winner will be the one who is preferred by the medical and other similar industries that can incorporate the higher end printers into their production models. By doing so, these industries stand to benefit from 3D printing by shortening the time it takes to create or modify a product as well as being able to carry smaller inventories. After its recent decline 3D Systems is a lot more attractively priced, and I would normally be interested at this point, but I feel a market correction is coming and am waiting to see if I they will fall even more.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1312191,22786,2013-04-01T12:57:09-04:00,,"Since peaking at nearly $48, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) dropped by nearly one third from its 52-week high. Shares changed hands recently at $32, and ended the first quarter of 2013 underperforming the Nasdaq index. Investors are looking for evidence that the sell-off in the stock is ending and that shares have support at current levels. There are 5 positive points that suggest the decline that began in January for shares of 3D Systems is over.Positives1) Strong Quarterly Earnings3D Systems generated strong sales last quarter. Fourth quarter revenue grew by 45% to $101.6 million. Sales growth was supported by a 93% increase in printer and other revenue. The company ended the quarter with a backlog of around $11.4 million. The other strong figures were:· Gross profit margins for 2012 were 51.2%.· Non-GAAP net income rose by 64% to $0.39 per share.· GAAP earnings were $0.19 per share for the quarter.· Non-GAAP net income in 2012 was $67.9 million, or $1.25 per share.2) Diverse Customer Base3D Systems does not have any customers that account for more than 10% of revenue. In 2012, each portfolio category contributed to revenue growth. Categories included printers, materials and services.3) High P/E Multiples Supported by Strong Sales3D Systems is valued at a non-GAAP P/E of 26. This is supported by strong revenue growth across all portfolio categories. In 2012, revenue for print materials grew 46%. Service revenue grew 33%, but 3D Systems expects the total services growth rate to moderate in 2013. Revenue grew from all geographic regions. In the U.S., revenue grew 67% to $196.4 million, while in Europe it rose 21% to $100.7 million. Asia Pacific region grew at the fastest rate to $56.5 million and up 93%.4) Revenue Growth Rate Exceeded Increase in ExpensesRevenue grew by 90% in 2012 over the previous year, while operating expenses increased 63%, from $74.13 million in 2011 to $120.6 million in 2012.5) 2013 ForecastRevenue growth is expected to be in the range of 24% and 37% in 2013. Earnings are expected to be between $1.00 and $1.15 per share (non-GAAP). The company experienced strong demand for its products in 2012, and expects this trend to continue.A number of concerns remain for 3D Systems.Negatives6) Accounts Receivables IncreasedAccounts receivables rose, causing day sales outstanding (""DSO"") to rise from 67 days in 2011 to 72 days in 2012.7) Anticipation of Strong Demand Already Priced InThe high valuation of 3D Systems may already be priced in by investors. Any unexpected drop in demand could push shares slower.8) Short Interest RisingBearishness rose steadily throughout 2012 and now stands at 25.95 million shares. Below is a chart of short interest volume, adjusted for the 3 for 2 stock split.Data Source: NasdaqComparison to Stratasys3D Systems has a market capitalization of $2.97 billion, a level similar to that of Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS):Data Source: Seeking Alpha3D Systems and Stratasys are highly priced, with an enterprise value of 8 times and 12.6 times sales respectively. Both companies also gave back most of the gains made in 2013:DDD data by YChartsStratasys beat analyst estimates when the company reported fourth quarterly earnings on March 4, 2013. The company earned $0.40 per share. Non-GAAP revenue rose 23% from the previous year to $96.4 million. The strong results helped shares reverse a downtrend in its shares.RisksTotal operating expenses for 3D Systems increased by $28.2 million recently, and now accounts for 28% of revenue. On the financial statement, there are some notable risks. Interest expense grew in 2012 by six times from the previous year to $12.4 million. Depreciation doubled to $21.2 million. Despite the increase in interest costs, investors recently converted two thirds of $152 million in convertible notes. This will reduce interest expenses by nearly $3 million to around $5.2 million per year.Source: SEC Form 10-KConclusion3D Systems and Stratasys are heavily followed, and are outperforming the technology-heavy Nasdaq index over a 1-year period. The Nasdaq is up around 8%, compared to a 101% gain for both 3D Systems and Stratasys. When compared to a shorter time frame, both companies are underperforming the index. The short term underperformance of 3D Systems suggests that investors should be cautious on 3D Systems for now. If profit taking dominates as the second trading quarter of 2013 begins, 3D Systems could continue to underperform. The drop in shares creates an opportunity for investors who missed the initial run-up.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1253111,40031,2013-03-06T16:43:03-05:00,,"It is an exciting and volatile time for companies in the 3D printing field. 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) reported earnings on February 25th, and saw its price slide down 20%, but then recovered and closed down 9%. Perhaps the confusion about split adjusted earnings guidance mislead traders and investors, but the drop was there and it was still significant, even being cut in half.I wrote an article a week before earnings and said that the stock faces short-term headwinds, but that the future is very bright. And as expected, volatility increased significantly before and after earnings. The stock sliced its 50 day moving average line in higher volume on 21st February and gapped down after reporting earnings. It tried to recover afterwards, but the move was in lower volume and so far failed after a three day rally attempt.Earnings highlights3D Systems reported adjusted EPS of $0.39 (before split), a cent over views, but missed revenue expectations, as it reported $101.6 million, and analysts were expecting $103.86 million. Revenue was up 45% over the same quarter last year, and 54% for the year, reaching $354.6 million.The management said on the conference call that the company introduced 16 new products, and that revenue from new products increased 70% to $131.9 million. Gross margin expanded 390 basis points to 51.2%. Organic growth for the year was 22.4% and 18.8% in the fourth quarter.The company experienced growth in all key geographic regions of the world, and performed well in European and Asian Pacific regions. North America was the strongest region, benefiting from acquisitions, which were mostly concentrated in the U.S.The company spent $183.7 million for acquisitions in 2012, and ended the year with $155.9 million cash on hand, which is a decrease of $23.2 million from the end of 2011.Management expects full year revenue in $440 million to $485 million range, representing a 24% to 37% increase, and non-GAAP earnings per share in $1 to $1.15 range, which translates into 30% to 49% growth. Large part of the growth is expected to be organic.Although revenue missed analyst estimates, the growth story is still intact and the long term picture looks very good and profitable for the company. Valuation looks better now with the price down, with forward PE of 26.72 and a PEG ratio of 1.41. Trailing PE is still quite high at 72.88. But it is often the case that you have to pay a premium to get a hold of a good growth story.CompetitionStratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) reported earnings that beat estimates and sent the stock higher. The rise comes after a steep selloff, which brought the stock down below its 200 day moving average line. The company completed the merger with Objet worth $1.4 billion, and the combined company should bring in synergy effects and the management expects the growth to continue in the future. The company sold 29,000 printers in 2012. The management expects a great growth opportunity in 3D design and analysis tools, which are becoming more functional and easier to use. David Reis, Chief Executive Officer of Stratasys said on the conference call: Stratasys has a trailing PE of 80.28; forward PE is 27.05 with a PEG ratio of 1.21. That puts it roughly at the same valuation levels of 3D Systems.Short interestShort interest of 3D Systems has decreased in four latest reporting periods, with the latest reporting period being the most interesting, because we saw a significant decrease in short interest, meaning many traders were satisfied with the price drop and covered their shorts. Share price at the time was around $40 (split adjusted), and we saw tremendous volume and a steep drop afterwards, so there might have been more short covering and a further decrease of short interest, especially if the company continues to deliver higher growth levels.Source for data: NasdaqPrice action3D Systems and Stratasys saw their share prices decline since the end of January. Both stocks lost about a quarter of their value from their late January highs. Stratasys' earnings announcement pushed both stocks higher, but 3D Systems ended the day down and it headed lower afterwards. The 50 day moving average line, which served as support earlier, might serve as resistance now. However, 3D Systems has yet to test it, because it did not manage to reach the line after dropping below it. Further price consolidation is needed after volatile movements these stocks experienced. The 200 day moving average might serve as a strong support level if the price decreases further.ConclusionAlthough volatile action is expected in the near term, and we could see lower price levels of 3D Systems in the near term, the long term story is intact. The company expects stronger organic growth this year, which is one of main causes of concern for investors, since much of the growth in the past came from aggressive acquisition policy. Valuations came down after the sell-off and new earnings numbers, and a premium is expected to be paid for being part of a growth story that 3D Systems and 3D printing present.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1286641,40031,2013-03-19T14:00:53-04:00,,"3D Systems' (NYSE:DDD) stock price has suffered greatly in the last two months. The stock has been hit several times with bad news that drove the stock price down. There has also been a strong surge in the short interest in the latest reporting period, suggesting increased bets on the further fall of the stock price.I wrote about 3D Systems two weeks ago, and cautioned about the short-term dangers the stock was facing, and at the same time, making a bullish long-term case. In that article, I wrote that: ""Further price consolidation is needed after volatile movements these stocks experienced. The 200-day moving average might serve as a strong support level if the price decreases further."" Indeed, the price has dropped to the 200-day moving average line, and went through it (albeit briefly) recently. Further digestion of the recent decline is still needed in order to have a more dependable and sustained uptrend in the future. The worst might be over for 3D Systems, but caution is still advised.Prices tend to bottom when things look the worstAnd things have been bad for 3D Systems recently. The debacle of the earnings release, when investors were confused with split adjusted guidance, and a revenue miss, prior bubble call from Citron, Seeking Alpha articles questioning the accounting methods... There was no shortage of bad news. The most recent event causing the stock to drop was the co-founder/CTO Charles Hull selling 500K shares on March 13, leaving him with only 461.5K shares. This might sound like insiders bailing out, but given Mr. Hull's age of 73, a pending retirement is more likely the cause. Although it all looks very bad for 3D Systems now, with all the bad news and a steep price drop, it is often the case that the price bottoms when the news and sentiment are the most negative for a stock. That might be the case with 3D Systems now.On a more positive note, Gabelli & Co.'s Hendi Susanto reiterated a hold rating, while citing that a recent visit to the company's headquarters left him ""incrementally more positive"" on the stock. Among other things the analyst noted:1. Printers will be the largest revenue growth driver, especially professional printers.2. Management foresees consumer printer pricing will evolve toward lower price points of $1,000 and eventually $500, while focusing on maintaining gross margins. 3D Systems CFO Damon Gregoire sees no meaningful direct competition among 3D printing leaders as each offers a unique set of competitive differentiations.3. 3D Systems still expressed interests in acquisitions.4. Management sets a long-term goal of 75-80% recurring revenue stream profile from materials and services.ValuationValuation looks much better now. Trailing P/E is still high at 62.79, but the forward P/E is 23.02, with a reasonable PEG ratio of 1.12. Having in mind these valuation levels and future growth expectations, the bubble theory is out of the way at these price levels.Short interestThe latest reporting period presents the largest short interest increase in the last year. Short interest went from 15 million shares to 24 million shares, a 60% increase in two weeks. That represents 28.5% of free float. This proves that the sentiment on 3D Systems is very negative.Source for data: Nasdaq.comPrice action3D Systems is still in a clear downtrend. The chart shows ample distribution, and no accumulation for now. The 200-day moving average line is the only thing in the way of a further decline in price. For now, there is no technical evidence of a bottom forming.Source: StockchartsHowever, the price moves of the competition might be indicative to 3D Systems. A stock is often tied to the movement of its competitors. Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) has a better technical picture. It too had sliced the 200-day moving average line, spent a few days below it, and then went sharply higher after the earnings report. If it makes a higher high, the current move would be a confirmed higher low, and hence might prove as evidence that a bottom is in place for Stratasys.Source: StockchartsThe ExOne Company (NASDAQ:XONE) is moving higher in its consolidation after the three-day surge following the IPO in early February. The company is yet to turn a profit, and is currently trading at very high valuation levels, with a forward P/E of 222.Source: StockchartsProto Labs Inc. (NYSE:PRLB) is trading above its 50-day moving average line. The stock has corrected after the gap-up after reporting earnings in mid-February.Source: StockchartsAll of the competitors have better looking chart patterns at the moment, and they might have a positive effect on 3D Systems' chart pattern.ConclusionFurther evidence of 3D Systems' price bottoming is still needed. All the bad news seems to be priced in, although more negative surprises still might appear. Valuation is out of the bubble territory. Chart patterns of the competition look better, and might help 3D Systems to find a bottom. The extreme negative sentiment, as highly increased short interest shows, might be indicative of a positive change coming soon. The long-term perspective of the company still looks very good, as it was presented in previous articles.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1305551,44981,2013-03-27T17:53:51-04:00,,"The companies operating in the 3D printing industry have experienced phenomenal rise over the past year. One company that has caught the eye of speculators as well as long-term investors is 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). 3D systems stock price has been extremely volatile, and it has rewarded smart investors and traders. Long-term investors of the company have also benefited due to the immense growth shown by the company over the past year. Despite strong growth and obvious potential in the industry; some investors still doubt the future growth potential of the company.While I believe 3D systems will experience price volatility in the short-term, I remain confident that the long-term prospects of the company are bright. Here, I have developed a free cash flow model for the company. I have valued 3D systems on the basis of future free cash flow generation ability of the company. In the following paragraphs, I will explain the model and assumptions used in the model. Along with the assumptions, I will also provide pro-forma earnings and valuation models.Model and AssumptionsI have tried to keep my assumptions in line with the expectations of the company. For future growth in revenues, I have used organic growth number that lies somewhere between the forecasted growth numbers for 2013. For the first five years (hyper growth period), I have used a 30% growth rate in revenues (3D systems expects organic growth rate to be between 24% and 37% during 2013). 3D systems is currently operating in slow growth segments of the 3D printing industry. However, as the industry experiences growth over the next decade, organic growth for 3D systems will increase. In that case, my assumptions might become conservative. For the following four years, I believe growth will slow down due to increased competition and low expansion opportunities. As a result, I have assumed a growth rate of 6% for the four years after the hyper growth period. Finally, I expect the company to grow at a constant rate of 3% after the first two stages of high-growth period.On the expenses side, I have followed the same approach and assumed a declining growth rate in manufacturing expenses due to economies of scale and operational efficiencies. At the moment, 3D systems has a gross margin of around 51%, which I believe will go up during the hyper growth period, and then finally, it will settle around 60%. Furthermore, the tax rate at the moment is around 10% -- I have used a gradually increasing tax rate that will finally settle at 25%.Pro-Forma EarningsPro-Forma earnings shown above have been calculated using the above mentioned assumptions. According to my calculations, 3D Systems should be able to maintain solid operating and net profit margins even after the hyper growth period.ValuationFor valuation, I have used a 17% discount rate, which I believe is appropriate for a high growth volatile stock. Discount rate is a unique component, which can differ for each investor. However, I feel a discount rate around 17% is warranted taking into account the volatility in the stock. Below table shows the calculation of free cash flows and fair value of the company.For the free cash flow calculation, I have taken net income as the starting point. All of these net income figures represent projected net income based on above mentioned assumptions. To reach the free cash flows, I have made adjustments regarding, depreciation, amortization, interest expense and other non-cash items such as restructuring expenses/gains, gains/losses on equipment sale and taxes. Furthermore, investment in fixed and working capital has also been taken into account.Free cash flows beyond 2022 have been projected at a constant growth rate of 3% and discounted at the discount rate of 17% (adjusted for growth rate) to calculate terminal year free cash flows. After calculating free cash flows for each year, I have discounted those free cash flows at 17% to reach at the present value, and added them to achieve $2.78 billion in discounted free cash flows. After calculating free cash flows, I deducted the total debt of the company to find the value for common stockholders. According to my free cash flow model, 3D Systems' stock should be trading at around $47 per share. At the moment, the stock is trading at around $30 per share.ConclusionMy valuation model is based on long-term free cash flows generation ability of the company. There might be deviations in stock price in the short-term. However, in the long-term, I believe 3D systems' stock will appreciate in value substantially. The company is already working on initiatives to grow its business worldwide. Recently, 3D systems announced a new reseller agreement with Al-mera, a jewelry leader in Turkey. The company is aggressively trying to exploit different segments of the market. I like how 3D systems is diversifying geographically as well as in its product offering, which can offer substantial value to the company in the long-term.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1311121,25255,2013-04-01T07:28:18-04:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) along with Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) are the two biggest players in an emerging industry called 3D printing. 3D printing is essentially a technology that allows the creation of a prototype or a copied object through a 3D printer. 3D printer are machines that work in a similar fashion to inkjet document printers.(Image from www.3d-model.ch)What you see above is 3D System's personal 3D printer which is called ""Cube"". In contrast to Stratasys, which is focusing on becoming the go-to shop for the high end, professional 3D printing and consumables, 3D Systems has taken a different approach.Along with offering a wide variety of solutions for professionals, 3D Systems is trying to become also the dominant player in consumer 3D printing. Through internal research & development and numerous acquisitions, 3D Systems is trying to create a 3D printer affordable and simple enough for everyday home use.And it has chosen two ways to earn additional & recurring revenue from the printers it sells. The first way is through proprietary cartridges that its printers use and which customers can get only from 3D Systems. The second way is through the creation of an online store where designers sell to consumers digital 3D designs for them to use. Furthermore consumers can have finished objects printed and delivered to them through ""cloud printing"". 3D Systems gets a fee for every transaction that happens in its store.However, 3D Systems made a mistake that may prove to be fatal for its 3D printer sales if it is not corrected soon enough. It charges more for its consumables than its competitors which may result in less sales as budget-conscious consumers may choose some other OEM's printer due to lower consumables cost.3D Systems' main competitor in the consumer market is a company called MakerBot. Makerbot offers a competitive consumer product that despite being more expensive than 3D Systems' Cube has some other advantages that make it quite popular.MakerBot isn't using expensive proprietary cartridges but consumables that work with a very wide variety of printers. Furthermore, in contrast to 3D Systems's design store, MakerBot has developed a user community, the ""Thingiverse"", where people can upload or download 3D designs for free.(Image from MarketBot.com)As 3D printing technology evolves, I expect this industry to develop a similar structure and economics with the current paper printing industry. Prices for retail 3D printers will continue to fall and OEM profits will increasingly depend on consumables instead of printer sales.3D Systems is well positioned to benefit from this trend through its proprietary cartridges although it will have to reduce its prices if it wants to stay competitive on the long run.Trying to see ahead in the 3D printing consumer market is a high risk proposition because of too many moving parts. Having said that, I believe that if 3D Systems brings down the prices of its consumables has a good chance to lead this exploding market.For us investors though, this just part of the story. There are some things about 3D Systems that should make investors cautious about buying its stock for the long-term.3D Systems has seen erratic behaviour concerning its shares. It has done two stock splits, a two-for-one in 2011 and a three-for-two in 2013. Since stock splits don't offer any value to shareholders there is an issue about the company's true motives for doing them. Furthermore the company has diluted shareholders by approximately 28% since the end of 2010.Moreover, the company is a serial acquirer with dozens of acquisitions over the past four years. This is a warning sign that the company may have trouble growing organically. Furthermore, it raises concerns about value destruction since serial acquirers tend to overpay for acquisition. This is especially true for hot, technology markets.As investors willing to buy 3D Systems stock we should account for a huge margin of safety to compensate for the above red flags and the chance that something goes awry with the company's growth prospects.Unfortunately, its current valuation of 36 times its 2012 free cash flow and 45 times its 2012 earnings per share is forbidding because it implies a 30% average EPS growth rate over the next decade. Even if 3D Systems achieves that kind of growth the risks involved (dilution, overpaid acquisitions) are too big to consider this a fair price.I will keep this stock on my watchlist but I'm not touching it above 20 times its current earnings per share.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

I was calling for a target of $46 (post-split, or $30), which was reached in the last 1-2 weeks. I have been thinking of accumulating shares recently and like the potential of the chart going forward.Fundamental analysisDDD is currently valued at $2.82 billion. It also has total cash of $155 million, which is very attractive as I believe the potential for buybacks of shares is possible in their next earnings report. DDD has a float of 84.9m shares, of which 70% is owned by institutions. 56.2% of the float is short, and I expect a short squeeze in the next few weeks. DDD also expects to earn $560m in revenues next year, which is massive considering their market capital.In DDD's last quarter, revenue grew by 45%. Sales growth was supported by a 93% increase in printer and other revenue. Gross profit margins for 2012 were 51.2%. GAAP earnings were $01.9 per share for the quarter.The company continues to diversify its product line. It also keeps finding new partners as seen recently with the Seiko-I collaboration.At the end of the fourth quarter, 8 hedge funds were bullish on the stock. Tiger Global Management has the biggest position worth close to $55 million. Criterion Capital owns $11 million. Ken Grifin's Citadel Investment Group also owns a hefty amount.The industry also keeps rating DDD very high. Recently in March, DDD was recognized as a company that is able to drive change, inspire information and deliver outstanding economic performance.Earlier in March, more news came out about something quite interesting. A guitar was produced by DDD as seen here.Recent technical analysis on DDDThe recent technical analysis shows some bullish action. DDD is now forming a base around $30 to $32 and is showing signs of consolidation. I like the recent move and the support over the 200-day moving average leads me to believe we can see higher prices, with first resistance at the 50-day moving average. Keep an eye on the descending trendline as I expect this to be broken soon.If we look at the weekly chart, we can see how stochastics are now reaching oversold levels. As one can see from the past, stochastics below 20 usually mean a reversal is imminent. I believe that DDD will now consolidate for a while under $35 but as earnings season comes, and with some increased estimates, I expect a run to $45 in the next few months.Conclusion3D stocks remain to be a topic of conversation daily. There are numerous companies in this field including other leaders like Stratasys Inc. (NASDAQ:SSYS). Other companies like Organovo Holdings (NASDAQ:ONVO) are looking into developing synthetic tissue. These are exciting times for the industry and I expect big numbers and exciting ideas going forward.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in DDD over the next 72 hours.

1250151,44981,2013-03-06T03:44:11-05:00,,"3-D printing is a booming industry with immense growth potential. 3-D printing has the potential to revolutionize the industry as well as our daily life. Companies operating in the 3-D printing industry have benefited hugely from the recent boom. The stocks of the companies operating in the 3-D printing industry are currently trading at considerably higher than the year-ago values. One company has been able to show stand-out performance and it has rewarded shareholders handsomely. Shares of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) more than doubled over the past year, before the company announced a three-for-two split. Carrying out a stock split indicates that the company is confident about the future earnings.3D Systems has shown remarkable top-line and bottom-line growth over the past year. However, the stock has been trading at almost 40x forward earnings, implying a growth rate of about 25%-30%. A sustainable growth rate in excess of 25% is a big task for any company, and it can backfire if the company fails to maintain that growth rate. 3D Systems suffered a hit recently, when the company announced fourth-quarter earnings. I believe the fall in price has corrected the valuation of the stock to some extent and it represents an opportunity to buy. I am confident about the growth of 3-D printing industry and expect 3D Systems to benefit from the growth potential.Massive Growth Potential in the Industry3-D printing has existed in the marketplace for decades. However, recently the launch of personal 3-D printers has made it a mainstream industry. At present, the industry is going through hyper growth period and industry participants have recorded eye popping growth. The increasing status of this technology and the huge number of uses discovered for 3-D printing has positioned this industry as extremely valuable. According to Wohlers Associates, the 3-D printing industry is expected to grow to over $6.2 billion by the end of 2019.The manufacturing sector is already benefiting from 3-D printing. Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) is providing industrial scale 3-D printers, which are being used by the companies to alter manufacturing systems. When companies need to change the manufacturing process, they use the printer to print new fixtures and place them in production lines. Ability to easily alter the manufacturing system has provided considerable flexibility to these companies. As a result, these companies are able to achieve operational efficiency.3D Systems Future GrowthMost of the growth for 3D Systems has come from acquisitions. The company reported 54% year-over-year growth; however, organic growth only contributed 22%. The company cannot rely on acquisitions for growth. 3D Systems will have to achieve higher organic growth in the coming years. At the moment, the biggest growth contributors in the 3-D printing industry are aerospace and medical devices manufacturing segments. Personal 3-D printing is still at the early stages of growth. At the moment, the company has the biggest portfolio of 3-D printers and it will benefit from the expected growth in the personal 3-D printers market. Furthermore, 3-D systems have a solid business model, which will allow the company to have substantial growth as the industry grows.The biggest portion of revenue for 3D Systems comes from the services segment. As a result, the company has lower dependency on the printer sales. Revenue growth will still be strong for 3D Systems even if the demand for printers declines. The company generates a major chunk of revenues from the material sales. As the personal printers market grows 3D Systems will be able to sell more materials and organic growth will increase. I believe even at the saturation point of the industry, revenues will remain strong for 3D Systems due to its strong position in materials segment. I believe the company is setting itself up nicely for the future growth with the acquisitions. We are yet to see the boom in the personal 3-D printing segment. When the personal printing segment takes off, organic growth for 3D Systems will increase substantially.ConclusionValuation before the earnings announcement was on the higher side for the company. However, I believe at current price levels, the stock price has moved towards fair value. There is always some premium attached to a growth stock. As a result, it is likely to trade at high price multiples. It is easy to guess that a stock a growth stock when a 54% year-over-year growth in revenue can bring the price down. Investors reacted negatively to the next year growth rates, which seems a logical decision. Investors were attaching lofty organic revenue growth expectations, which caused the stock price to go up. However, I believe 3D Systems can achieve strong organic growth in the coming years, and the stock price will move up substantially. I have positive long-term view about the company, and believe that it will be a major player in this rapidly growing market in years to come.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1234251,25120,2013-02-28T13:43:37-05:00,,"Shares of 3D-Systems (DDD) have witnessed quite some volatility during the first days of the new trading week. Shares ended last Friday around $38 per share, or the equivalent of $57 before the 3-for-2 stock split. Shares fell to lows of $31 on Monday on the back of the fourth quarter results, but have recovered to $36 at the moment.Fourth Quarter Results3D Systems generated revenues of $101.6 million for its fourth quarter of 2012, up 45.4% on the year. Revenue growth was driven by a 93% increase in printer and other revenues, and 18.8% in organic growth. Revenues fell slightly short of analysts expectations who on average expected that 3D Systems would report revenues of $103.9 million.The strong revenue growth resulted in a 60% increase in operating profits. Gross margins expanded by 460 basis points to 51.7% on positive operating leverage.The company reported a 63.6% increase in non-GAAP net income, coming in at $22.6 million for the final quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share rose by 44% to $0.39 per share. Earnings beat consensus estimates by a penny.Of interest is that net income grew much slower compared to non-GAAP income. Net income rose 36% to $10.9 million and has partially been inflated as a result of a $1.5 million benefit for income taxes. As a result of the diluted share base, net earnings per share were up only 19% to $0.19 per share.OutlookFor the full year of 2013, 3D-Systems expects to generate annual revenues of between $440 and $485 million. At the midpoint of this range, this would imply that annual revenues would grow by approximately 31%. The company guides for annual non-GAAP earnings between $1.00 and $1.15 per share.Note that the guidance for non-GAAP earnings already factors in the split ratio. As such, the guidance implies non-GAAP earnings of $1.50-$1.73 per share, before factoring in the split ratio. The company furthermore notices that its effective tax rate for the year will increase to ""normal"" 35-38% rates.The full year revenue forecast for 2013, at the midpoint of the guided range, tops analysts' estimates. On average, analysts expected 3D to guide for full year revenues of $442.2 million. The earnings guidance comes in line with analysts estimates of non-GAAP earnings of $1.05 per share.Valuation3D-Systems ended its fiscal 2012 with $155.9 million in cash and equivalents. The company operates with $80.5 million in convertible senior notes for a net cash position of approximately $75 million.The company generated annual revenues of $353.6 million for the full year of 2012, up 53.5% on the year before. The company reported a net profit of $38.9 million, up 10% on the year before. As a result of shareholder dilution, GAAP earnings per share inched up by just a penny, coming in at $0.71 per share. Non-GAAP earnings came in at $1.25 per share.Trading around $35 per share, the market values 3D-Systems at $3.0 billion, or its operating assets at little over $2.9 billion. This values shares at 8.2 times 2012's annual revenues and roughly 75 times its GAAP annual earnings.3D-Systems does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveShares of 3D-Systems have more than doubled over the past year. Shares rallied from levels around $15 during spring of 2012, to $36 at the moment. Shares did peak around $48 at the start of 2013, but have lost little over a quarter of their value in the meantime. Note that these share price levels are adjusted for the 3-for-2 split ratio.After years of stagnating revenue growth, or even declining revenues, 3D has grown aggressively over the past two years fueled by an aggressive acquisition strategy. The company has boosted revenues in recent years, but has consolidated earnings growth over the past year. As the share base diluted, as a result of this aggressive acquisition strategy, earnings per share have remained essentially unchanged over the past year.Poor Received FiguresIt is not surprising that shareholders react disappointed to the earnings release on Monday. While earnings came in line with expectations, revenues fell short. Given the hype in the 3D printing industry, the whisper numbers were higher than the reported results.Shares of 3D dropped as much as 20% in the first minutes of trading on Monday. Many investors and analysts got confused as the earnings forecast for 2013 was not comparable, given the stock split which became effective on the same day as the earnings release. This confusion could have been easily avoided by management and added to Monday's volatility. Shares recouped more than half of those losses in the remainder of the session as analysts worked things out.Still the prospects do not look great. The full year guidance for 2013 calls for revenue growth of 24 to 37%, which compares to annual revenue growth of 53.5% over the past year. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to grow by a similar 20 to 38%.Investment ThesisDespite the recent correction, shares of 3D Systems continue to remain in a ""bubble"" phase as I see a lot of red flags. One concern is the continued and widening discrepancy between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. Non-GAAP earnings for the full year of 2012 came in roughly 75% higher than GAAP earnings, as the company continues to treat recurring costs including stock based compensation and acquisition related charges as incidentals.Another red flag is that profit growth is slowing down, resulting in stagnant profits per share as the share base is diluting, despite strong revenue growth. Worse, this revenue growth is mostly the result of an aggressive acquisition campaign. This resulted in a ""goodwill"" asset on the balance sheet more than doubling to over $240 million in the past year.Another key concern is the continued discussion and issue of reliability of organic growth rates. Organic growth came in at 22.4% for the year of 2012, slowing down to 18.8% in the final quarter. As 3D continues to acquire re-sellers of its own printers, it artificially inflates organic sales growth by supplying its own printers to those acquired re-sellers. This practice has already resulted in a lot of furious discussions among commentators who wonder if 3D engages in ""channel stuffing"".Finally, 3D-Systems has financed much of its recent growth by making acquisitions financed with its ever rising stock. As shares have corrected 25% in recent weeks, this important source of financing future growth might dry up, or dilute shareholdings even more. As I wrote in an earlier article, following the acquisition of Geomagic:Another warning sign of a bubble is the recent public offering of smaller competitor ExOne (XONE), which went public a couple of weeks ago. In traditional fashion for high-demand public offerings, shares spiked up on the first trading day. From that point in time shares have also witnessed a serious correction.The growth engine of 3D-Systems might have stopped as the share price has seen a serious correction in recent weeks. Widespread red flags and disappointing earnings per share growth has resulted in some doubts about the valuation.At these levels I remain on the sidelines. Despite the prosperous long term growth prospects of the industry, the valuation is too high at the moment. Note that this does not automatically translate in a short thesis as the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.I remain on the sidelines with a slightly bearish stance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1224461,37231,2013-02-26T10:38:53-05:00,,"On February 25th, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) released its Q4 and full-year results. The market's reaction was mired by confusion and the stock price whipsawed during the trading day, reaching a low of $30.28 from its previous close of $37.97 in early morning trading and recovering strongly into the afternoon before giving up to close at $34.55. As background of my analysis of DDD, I recommend reading my previous articles here and here.The disorientation was presaged by a 3:2 stock split in the form of a 50% dividend that went into effect after close on February 22nd. After adjusting for the stock split, the previous closing price of $56.48 would have been $37.65. It is important to stress that the split was purely cosmetic - theoretically, the effect was a 50% increase in shares outstanding and a corresponding 33% decrease in the share price to account for the change. Those unaware woke up to a precipitous decline, which surely caused some panic selling.Undoubtedly, misunderstanding added fuel to the fire, as the stock continued to fall in the morning during the company's conference call. As late as 2:30 pm, people were still bungling the numbers and comparing pre- and post-split figures incorrectly (As an aside, among The Motley Fool and penny stock newsletters, one provides valuable investing ideas and the other is The Motley Fool). Q4 EPS slightly beat the aggregate analyst expectation of $0.38, coming in at $0.39 on a pre-adjusted basis. Revenue was a slight miss at $101.6 million for the quarter, compared to an average expectation of $103.9 million. And future guidance was actually rosier than analyst expectations, when adjusted for the stock split:Analysts previously expected revenue in 2013 to reach $442.2 million, and EPS of $1.58. The revenue figure remains unaffected by the split, but EPS expectations are dragged down to $1.05. As with revenue, analyst forecasts for earnings are decidedly in the lower range of the company's guidance. Enacting the stock split at close the day before an annual earnings report was insanity on management's part.Compounding the poor judgment, the company released its figures 20 minutes before the conference call, and analysts were scrambling to make sense of them as the call was ongoing. In a rare departure from the mood of most earnings calls, one analyst criticized management's release in an exasperated tone, and noted that his feelings were shared by most others on the call. Regardless, releasing results in an untimely fashion when partly missing expectations is not a strong look.The company beat at the bottom line, and fell short on revenue by 2%, even though sales grew QoQ by 45%. Yet the stock plummeted, as the bull story cracked. All of this confirms the notion that the stock had been priced to perfection. A slight miss unraveled the myth. The company had, for the last year, delivered a number of significant beats. Given anything but strong numbers, the froth the stock experienced was bound to subside quickly.At a cursory glance, revenue trends across all sectors remain healthy, with printer sales experiencing a YoY growth rate of 90.1%, materials sales at 46.2%, and services revenue at 32.8%.And gross margin rates have expanded annually by 390 basis points, as increased sales have led to improving fixed cost absorption.Confirmation and RepudiationDepending on their views and orientation, different segments of the market look at different things in earnings reports. As I wrote in ""3D Systems: How Market Dynamics Have Created a Bubble,"" bulls and bears are particularly polarized on the company's future, leaving little room in the middle. And earnings reports are viewed as a confirmation or repudiation signal of the story of a stock. The story bulls have clung to is that 3D printing will revolutionize industry and how the consumer creates. Revenue growth is the leading litmus test of the thesis. And the revenue miss in Q4, combined with a 2013 revenue outlook of growth in the range of 24%-37%, was not a powerful confirmation of that thesis. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the broader bear thesis, based on overvaluation, a bubble market, and the unsustainable nature of acquisition-driven growth, received further confirmation. Although total revenue growth for the year came in at 53.5%, the organic growth rate (excluding acquisition revenue for companies acquired in the past 12 months), came to a much tamer 22.4%. After months of criticism on how the company flushes out organic growth from its overall growth rate, concerns surfaced during the conference call, when Bryan Drab of William Blair & Company said the following:The company instead reported that organic growth for Q4 2011 was 8.8%. The consequence of this, as Drab says:Another concern that had been raised repeatedly is the manner in which acquisitions inflate what the company calls ""organic revenue growth."" During the conference call CEO Abe Reichental acknowledges that the company sells its own 3D printing machines into the new sales channels it gains through acquisitions.Reichental addresses concerns that the company is ""channel stuffing,"" but all of this is beside the fundamental idea. When DDD rolls up Geomagic, it will not include its revenues for the first 12 months, and only include growth from that initial base as ""organic revenue growth"" after 12 months. Yet as Reichental notes, the acquisition provides 3D Systems with access to 80-100 new resellers. After talking with employees at Geomagic, it became clear that these resellers focus on scanner equipment primarily (estimated 90% of sales). It is in this context that Reichental's following statement makes sense:The company is selling its own printers through newly acquired sales channels. These printer sales are treated as organic revenue because they are products that were either developed by the company or acquired companies past the 12-month mark. Yet fundamentally, these sales are not organic because they would not exist had the company not acquired the new reseller channels. This is a reiteration of the fact that the organic growth rate the company reports is not the same growth rate it would have experienced had it not acquired companies. As such, it is misleading of the company's future growth opportunities. Yet even the company's inflated organic growth rate is below the additive manufacturing industry's overall growth. In 2011, 3D Systems reported organic growth of 19.2%, which is far below the 29.4% growth of the entire industry, pointing to an eroding competitive position that is not indicative of a market leader in a growth industry.A Proliferation of Systems in Channels3D Systems claims it will have nearly 500 authorized resellers after it gains 80-100 more resellers in its acquisition of Geomagic. The sales channels operate at a basic level in the way that the automotive industry sells vehicles to end users. In the United States, there are around 25-35 ""dealers,"" companies like 3D Systems Z Corp, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), etc. who produce machines. In 2011, 31 producers manufactured at least one professional-grade 3D printer. Each of these dealers has authorized resellers, who have showrooms of their own, much like automotive dealers. After conducting channel checks of 3D Systems' resellers, it became abundantly clear that to be an authorized reseller, you must purchase the machines you wish to sell from 3D Systems. You can't run a dealership without any cars. You have to buy in. As one 3D Systems reseller said, ""They make you buy a system. If you want to sell a $50,000 machine, you have to buy a $50,000 machine for your showroom."" Another reseller explained that these models, if sold, have to be replaced by the reseller to continue selling 3D Systems printers.And every acquisition that increases 3D Systems' reseller count buys clients, but it also boosts revenues in the period as more showrooms buy models. Another industry insider called it a ""proliferation of systems in the sales channels."" After speaking to yet another reseller in the Northeast, I learned that a medium-to-large reseller has around two to four machines priced in a range of $75,000 to $200,000. The reseller mark-up is not significantly large. Under the assumption that the average reseller has just one machine, at an average purchase price of $75,000, that means 3D Systems generates $75,000 in revenue for every new reseller. These models are not usually sold to consumers, and if they are, the reseller has to buy a new showroom model from DDD. As per the 2012 10K, ""the Company recognizes revenue on sales to resellers at the time of sale."" According to the resellers I spoke with, the models have been on their floor on average for more than a year. My research confirms a previous Seeking Alpha article's conclusion, in which the author states:I estimate showrooming has positively affected revenue in 2012 by $17.65 million, under assumptions that are much, much more conservative than the reality I think is unfolding. In 2013, the Geomagic acquisition alone could have a potential $7.5 million impact.The effect on revenue in 2012 is staggering. Reported total revenue growth falls from 53.5% to 45.8%, while printer revenue growth falls from 90.2% to 63.8%. This showrooming phenomenon makes sense given how printer sales have so far outstripped material sales - the printers in showrooms are used less than those bought by companies for use.If the assumptions are toggled more realistically, the company could potentially have sold $25-$30 million in printers as part of the showroom effect in 2012. It is impossible to determine just how much these tangential sales have impacted revenue figures. Yet we do know that they have improved the sales numbers of the company, and they have rendered the company's organic growth rate calculations into aerated numbers with little predictive value for investors.The Incongruity of Non-GAAP FiguresGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles center on the accrual method of matching revenue and expense timing regardless of when cash is received. Many companies publish supplemental Non-GAAP results as well, in which they exclude non-cash charges and extraordinary items, claiming they provide valuable additional information on the company's performance.As the discrepancies between the two reporting methods have widened, many press releases and analyst forecasts focus on the Non-GAAP figures for 3D Systems. In 2012 alone, the gap between net income figures was $27 million, more than 69% of GAAP net income. Most problematically, the adjustments are made to take out certain expenses that have become recurring staples in DDD's business strategy. There are a litany of adjustments that make the Non-GAAP figures less indicative of future performance than the GAAP figures. Stock-based compensation recurs every year, and it dilutes equity holders even if it is not a cash expense. Amortization of intangibles primarily has to do with intangibles DDD gained by acquiring companies, which has become a mainstay of its strategy and which will continue in 2013 and for several years further. The same is true for acquisition and severance expense, as the company has begun the year with a significant acquisition. The idea that the company can claim all the revenue benefits of the acquisitions but disregard the expenses associated with them does not stand up to even the most basic logical standards. And the company incurred a loss on convertible debt because debt it issued was converted into shares, which again diluted equity. All of these have a material effect on the value of a share of DDD.For a company with such an unstable business model, neither GAAP net income nor Non-GAAP adjusted net income provides accurate color of the underlying business. If one were to look at 2012 free cash flows of 3D Systems, they would see how deleterious the acquisition binge has been to shareholders, who were entitled to free cash flow of negative $149 million in 2012.ConclusionToday's annual results were long anticipated, as longs and shorts held on to paradigms that were irreconcilable with one another. The company's future is promising but hampered by uncertainty in the industry and the stability of its own business practices. Some have criticized my articles as Ebenezer-esque. Yet an accurate understanding of how financial figures come about is an a priori consideration to valuation of the company. Some numbers are bulletproof. DDD's are not. Instead, they reflect a business that is much weaker on a fundamental level than the company's proponents claim. And if the company's results and future were so promising, there would be no need for their financial statements to be so opaque and muddled. The company needed great results to quell the short sentiment. Until it can deliver a rebuttal of the short thesis, it will continue to hemorrhage its lofty valuation premium.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1223741,30071,2013-02-26T05:38:08-05:00,,"3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD) reported 4th quarter earnings on Monday morning and it was also the first day of trading after a 3 for 2 stock split. Analysts had been expecting the company to earn 26 cents per share on revenue of $103.9 million. Revenue for the quarter was about $2.3 million short, but still up 45% year-over-year and EPS came in thirteen cents ahead of what the Street had been looking for.EPS benefited from gross profit margins expanding 460 basis points year-over-year. The company gave guidance for 2013 EPS in the range of $1.00 to $1.15 on revenue of $440 million to $485 million. At the midpoint of these ranges, guidance is ahead of analyst estimates for 2013. Analysts were also concerned about rising costs at the company impacting margins. Expectations had been high for 3D Systems, but an average quarter was not good enough for a stock that needed a win.The stock has been under pressure from short sellers lately who have argued the stock is a bubble ready to pop. They have pointed to revenue growth that has been driven by acquisitions, low R&D spending, and over-hyped technology as reasons to short the stock. I would add to these reasons that intangible assets increased 100% year-over-year and goodwill increased 123%. Furthermore, the company saw a $1.5 million benefit from currency translation in the 4th quarter of 2012 versus a $1.5 million loss from currency translation in 2011. These items are concerning and have given the shorts plenty of fuel with over 20% of the float now sold short, a number that has been rising.The technology has been cited as revolutionary for some time now and 3D Systems has said it will change the way we think about manufacturing. The technology has expanded with people now looking to print everything from new organs to houses in less than a day. However, 3D Systems appears to still be in search of the market for the technology that could become the core of the company. Now the company is selling printers to be used in manufacturing, prototyping, healthcare, and in your own house. That, added with numerous acquisitions, has only led to revenue of $350 million.When you look at 3D's valuation you can see the stock and the industry are trading at pumped up multiples on the basis of high growth rates. 3D Systems trades at similar multiples to its nearest competitor Stratasys Inc. (NASDAQ:SSYS). Both companies have forward P/Es in the low 30s, sky-high EV/EBITDA and EV/Revenue ratios, and PEG ratios of 1.96. The ExOne Company (NASDAQ:XONE) adds to the list of high multiple 3D printing companies. Additionally, you can see the 3D bioprinting company Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) has outperformed both 3D Systems and Stratasys, gaining almost 100% over just the last 6 months.Looking at a chart of 3D Systems you can see the run the stock has had and downturn the stock has been in since the end of January. One positive here is that the stock was down as low as $30.28 on Monday but it rallied to close at $33.64. This could be shorts cashing out profits, but it could also indicate a short- term bottom is in place. The most important thing to watch right now is the 200 DMA. If 3D holds above that it could put an end to the slide, if not there could be a lot more left to the downside.Investors looking to buy on the dip could push 3D Systems back up near the top of the down channel the stock is starting to create. This would create what I would consider a second bear flag sending the stock on another leg down-- potentially below the $30 mark. I would look to get short at around $35.50 per share.Data sourced from: Company filings, and Yahoo!Finance.

1206131,37231,2013-02-20T09:20:56-05:00,,"Sentiment surrounding 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has turned into bloodsport. Debate is colored by emotions run amok. The polarization of the opposing views has eroded any space in the middle. The long camp believes the company holds a market leading position in a manufacturing process that will revolutionize industry and bring creation to the home. The short camp tethers itself to valuation, claiming that the froth that characterizes current nosebleed prices of companies like 3D Systems will go the way it came. For all of this, it may be valuable to take a step back rather than a step forward into either camp. Without splitting hairs, DDD's value hinges on expectations of the future, which are subject to enormous uncertainty regardless of what side is ultimately right. As such, it is imminently logical that market supply and demand for the equity will be the strongest force in determining the stock's price in the near and medium terms. And unlike the final outcome of additive manufacturing, 3-D printing, or 3D Systems' place in that market, certain trends have taken hold in the economics of DDD's equity. Analysis of these supply and demand trends may be more valuable than our own opinions on 3D Systems' fate. As company insiders have unloaded shares into the market, institutional appetite has waned, and retail investors have eagerly flocked to fill the gap - a bubble is forming.Rampant Insider SellingConventional wisdom surrounding insider stock purchases and sales is well encapsulated in Peter Lynch's maxim, ""Insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise."" Between the market's trough in 2008 and 2010, executives and board members of 3D Systems bought over 100,000 shares at prices ranging from $4.37 to $13.19. Yet since, 2010, except for one 200 share purchase, there has not been a single insider buy on the open market. In 2011, the trend reversed itself abruptly - insiders have sold 1.9 million shares to the market while pocketing more than $71 million (Source: Yahoo Finance).Such precipitous activity cannot merely be an exercise in personal finance. It constitutes an overwhelming and undeniable trend. And it is a trend of certain consequence. Academic research has long documented that clusters of insider sales have strong predictive power over future equity prices. And insider transactions are a potent reflection of the fundamentals of the company. Insider sales of this scale are incommensurate with CEO Abe Reichental's soapboxing that 3-D printing promises to be ""as big as the steam engine was in its day, as big as the computer was in its day, as big as the Internet was in its day.""Finally, the insiders of 3D Systems have shown themselves to be savvy market participants in the past, buying shares of the company in the single-digits and selling them at an average price of more than $30 in the past two years. 13 executives and directors of the company have achieved stock compensation of over $67 million in the past two years. Putting this in perspective, the thousands and thousands of common equity holders have the right to net income over the same period of roughly $105 million. Even with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which utilizes stock compensation rampantly, insider sales over the past 6 months represent only about 30% of net income during the period. And DDD insiders hold more than 3 million remaining shares due to the company's generous stock compensation program, which they will continue to sell at current prices. Regardless of the phenomenon's predictive power, insider selling has increased supply of shares on the open market by nearly 2 million in the past 2 years.Institutional Interest Has DampenedInstitutional investors leverage market expertise, infrastructure, and cadres of analysts in an attempt to outperform the market. They are often looked to by investors who attempt to free ride these advantages. Institutional investors demonstrated strong demand for 3D Systems' equity in 2011. Firms managing over $100 million bought more than 32 million shares of 3D Systems and sold 8 million shares, for a bought/sold ratio of 4.04. These firms were a key demand sink in the market. But their interest has dampened in 2012 - they bought less shares and sold more shares than in 2011 for a bought/sold ratio of 1.53 (Source: WhaleWisdom 13F filings). Although institutional investors still bought more shares than they sold, appetite is waning.(Click to enlarge)The Ever-Eager Retail InvestorThe third and last component of market supply and demand is the retail investor. It is the demand of this third segment of the market that has sent 3D Systems shares soaring in 2012 and the beginning of 2013, even as insiders were dumping shares and institutional investors were easing off the pedal. During the largest institutional accumulation phase in 2011, the stock price was relatively flat. It was in 2012, when institutions scaled back their purchases, that the stock went parabolic. Its activity has come courtesy of an ebullient individual investor and momentum traders who have joined in for the ride.(Click to enlarge)This class of investors has clamored into 3D Systems on the back of sensational past gains from the beginning of 2012. Its accelerating climb has only fed the frenzy. It is this segment which has been responsible for the overwhelming demand mechanics that have seen the stock roar forward. And retail investors have been buoyed by the overwhelmingly positive coverage 3D Systems has received in publications including Investor's Business Daily, the Motley Fool, Seeking Alpha, and the general media. In the past month alone, 3D Systems has been mentioned in a total of 100 article headlines on Yahoo Finance, compared to 25 for Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), a company that is 3 times the size and has a 3-D segment of its own. Heightened media coverage is often the reflection of the public's level of interest. After all, 3D Systems' past financial results and the allure of a revolutionary technology make for an intoxicating story.Yet it is also this component of supply and demand that has contributed to the tremendous whip-saw seen in the stock in the days after it broke out of its range near the end of 2012. Institutional investors, after countless time spent on due diligence and analysis, are fairly comfortable holding their positions. Retail investors, in contrast, are a skittish bunch. A vocal minority of negative articles has had an outsized effect on the stock's price. After the short-seller publication Citron Research issued its take on 3D Systems, the stock tumbled 10% in 2 days. The notion that one individual's opinion dictated the erasing of $300 million in market value demonstrates just how bewildering the volatility of 3D Systems' equity has become.At the same time, the company's executives and board have pandered to retail investors, not only through their glowing remarks on the future of 3-D printing, but also through 2 stock splits in 3 years (a 2:1 split in May of 2011, and a 3:2 split announced in February of this year). In terms of valuation, stock splits are merely cosmetic. CEO Abe Reichental offered the rationale that ""the stock split will increase the market liquidity and broaden our investor base."" Yet prevailing research notes that increased liquidity effects are seen primarily in companies with low institutional holdings, a category 3D Systems does not fall under. Rather, it is an effort to encourage retail investors, who at least to some degree succumb to the psychological fallacy that a lower stock price means a stock is cheaper in absolute terms. And who could forget the company's ad hoc conference call and accompanying presentation to repudiate 2 negative articles recently published on Seeking Alpha? These actions are not standard. Management's care-taking of its stock price and retail investors makes imminent sense given the massive income they have reaped selling shares to the market at current prices.The Inflection Point of a BubbleWith overwhelming insider selling and a pullback of institutional investing, retail investors have catapulted the stock of 3D Systems into a bubble valuation. Technology research firm Gartner placed 3-D printing at the peak of inflated expectations in its 2012 emerging technologies hype cycle:(Click to enlarge)The market has become unhinged from fundamentals and latched itself instead to expectations. Even those expectations are ludicrous, a mentality individual investors have often succumbed to. Industry publications estimate the size of the entire additive manufacturing market to reach $3.7 billion by 2015. At its 52-week high, 3D System's market capitalization exceeded that number by $400 million.Yet it is easier to identify irrationality than to time its cure. When 3D Systems releases its Q4 results on February 25th, it will most likely meet or exceed analyst expectations. It will do so primarily on the back of revenue from the more than $190 million in acquisitions it has made since it reported Q4 results in 2011, and to a lesser degree through organic growth. Management has potentially tipped its hand regarding quarterly results when it announced a stock split on February 5th. Stock splits often contain a signaling effect that is indicative of management's belief that stock price will continue to grow. When the company announced a split in 2011, it handily beat analyst expectations in its next earnings announcement. Q4 results will most likely stoke the bubble valuation of the company further and act as confirmation to bulls. If this unfolds, the stock run up after results are announced will provide an ideal moment to take a short position, because without sizeable acquisitions, the company will begin to deliver much slower growth in Q1 of 2013 and beyond (analysts expect growth to slow down from 53% in 2012 to 25% in 2013 - I believe this to be on the fanciful side). As this occurs, the market's supply and demand dynamics will gather steam, with insiders continuing to sell, institutional investors taking profit, and retail investors abruptly moving on. Things tend to fall faster than they rise.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1201111,24276,2013-02-18T14:55:42-05:00,,"In the aftermath of a Consumer Electronics Show that featured a host of new 3D printers investors dumped both of the market leaders, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS).Since the show opened on January 8, SSYS is down by 18% while DDD is basically flat.I personally bought into DDD last November, paying $47.10 per share. With the recent ""collapse"" in the stock I'm now only ahead $1,200 on that investment. Oh noes.Stratasys offers some reason to be concerned. The company represents a merger of the old Stratasys Corp. with Objet, an Israeli company. These companies were the second-and-third leading players in the market before the merger. After they're done they'll be number one.But how well are they doing at that? Until the company's March report, we don't really know. Analysts are expecting earnings of 38 cents/share, which at its January highs of near $90/share looks steep. At the more recent price of $68, the expected earnings of $2.03/share come to a more reasonable multiple of about 33. What they're really buying is the top-line growth, which is expected to double, year-over-year, and keep rising from there.So the recent correction in the stock is probably just that, a correction. Corrections happen. It still looks like it will come good, but note that it doesn't play in the low end of the market. Instead, Stratasys is an industrial company, focused on working a broad line of materials for customers who can spend six-figures for a production-quality machine.DDD does compete in this consumer market, and at CES it introduced a line called CubeX, priced at roughly $2,500 to $4,000. It has a ""build volume"" of over 300 cubic inches - it can deliver a final product nearly a foot on each ""side"" - and the high end can produce an object ""as big as a basketball."" (A basketball was shown on its ""build platform"" to demonstrate.)Not bad, but Makerbot stole some of that thunder with a $2,800 machine whose build plane is smaller, but whose heritage is squarely in the open source mainstream and which has a better connection to consumer channels. Some analysts may have also been surprised by the ""deluge"" of products on offer for this new ""maker"" market - a full two dozen in all.But this reminds an old observer of the late 1970s, when an open operating system called CP/M created literally dozens of little PC companies. Consolidation followed a few years later, with IBM's launch of its PC, and the entry of many Japanese companies into that market.Still, there's more to this market than the consumer end. With its fairly full line of printers 3D is closer to the position of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) in that 1970s PC market, only it's aware of the opportunity and fully participating - HP famously rejected the Apple II.Investors were probably spooked on both issues by a call from Citron Research which called the area ""hyped."" But Citron is run by a short, Andrew Left, and it's a financial company rather than a tech analyst. In other words, the negative call was issued by someone who is selling something.Both these shares were due for a pullback. But when you have a fast-growing market, events like this are in fact opportunities, a chance to double-down. We should thank Mr. Left. It is likely these stocks were getting ahead of themselves, but their prospects remain fundamentally bright.Analyst estimates for DDD earnings in 2013 average $1.58/share. At its current price of below $60/share, you're looking at a forward earnings estimate of 38.6. High, yes, but you're also talking about a company growing at 25%/year, with trusted management. It's not unreasonable.Disclosure: I am long DDD. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1202341,38181,2013-02-19T09:45:06-05:00,,"A month ago I wrote an article entitled 3 Exciting 3D-Printing Related Stocks, which briefly gave an overview of some of the main industry players in the 3D printing market. As the article mentions, interest in 3D printing as of late has skyrocketed, and many (if not most) stocks primarily involved in 3D printing have seen their stock prices surge in the past few months. Industry leader 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) has seen its stock price rise over 200% within the past twelve months, while numerous other 3D printing related stocks have also experienced tremendous upward runs.The fact that the leading 3D printing companies have been generating real revenue and signing more deals only adds to the excitement. But amidst all the hype and speculation, there are those who question if the 3D printing industry really is so revolutionary, or even revolutionary at all. Most notably, on February 14th 2013, the well-known stock commentary website Citron Research (""Citron"") reported that it believes DDD is a bubble stock that is now trading at a heavily inflated price. Readers are encouraged to download Citron's .pdf report, which focuses on DDD but is highly relevant to anyone who holds a position in a 3D printing related stock, as its focus is not just on DDD but how the 3D printing industry as a whole has been heavily misrepresented.As with Citron's other hit pieces, Citron's report on DDD has already had a serious impact on DDD's stock price. Citron's twitter account @CitronResearch first announced coverage on DDD through this tweet (timed February 14th, 1:55pm), and DDD almost instantly then suffered a decline in its stock price from an influx of short sellers:Is Citron An Objective Research Website?For those unfamiliar with websites like Citron, it must be understood that Citron's primary motive is not merely to help prevent the general public from losing money by investing in overvalued companies. There is a real profit motive here, as Citron will short sell stocks it profiles before releasing negative reports. A look through some of Citron's articles shows that there is a disclaimer that Citron is short for every stock it attacks, and in this interview with Citron's founder, Andrew Left, it is openly admitted that ""short selling is my job."" As with the other stocks it has profiled, I believe it's very likely that Citron shorted DDD before releasing its negative report on the stock. This kind of business model is often cynically referred to as ""short and distort"" (rather like the opposite of ""pump and dump""), and critics argue that Citron has a strong incentive to paint the companies it covers in the absolute worst possible light, as the more the stock drops, the more Citron is able to profit.Andrew Left has been sued 5 times (none successfully) and no doubt has made numerous more enemies than that over the years by publishing negative reports on a variety of companies. And while there is a profit motive for publishing negative reports, I do believe that many of Citron's reports (especially on Chinese stocks) have been absolutely correct, and that Citron has done some valuable work in uncovering frauds in the past.What Investors Need To Know About DDD And 3D PrintingIn their DDD report, Citron makes numerous claims, which I will comment on here.For a multi-billion dollar company in such a hot industry, which is often marketed as having revolutionary technology, $6.5 million in research and development (R&D) expenses would seem like a very low figure. However, I'm not sure where Citron gets this number from. In its recent 10Q, DDD lists R&D costs for the 9 months ended September 30th 2012 as $15,397,000. In DDD's 2011 annual report, R&D costs are $14.3 million, and in 2010 it was $10.7 million. I emailed DDD's investor relations contact, and they too were confused about where the $6.5 million figure comes from (I can only assume that Citron made a mistake). According to its SEC filings, over the years DDD has spent tens of millions of dollars on R&D.It is true that 3D printing is not a new technology. There is a video from Good Morning America about 3D printing technology from all the way back in January 1989, which at the time of writing has a mere 3,475 views on YouTube. The segment focuses on Stereolithography (an additive manufacturing technology still used in 3D printing today), with the inventor of Stereolithography (Charles Hull) saying ""I think a good way to describe it is to call it a three dimensional printer."" It's interesting how similar the video is to many promotional pieces for 3D printing produced today. It talks about this new technology has the potential to influence or revolutionize a wide variety of industries, from the auto industry to cosmetics to computers. This was 24 years ago, but it could be just as easily used to market 3D printing today.For those unfamiliar with the technology behind 3D printing, Stereolithography is just one additive process that can be applied. Other technologies such as Digital Light Processing and Fused Deposition Modeling have also existed since the 1980s. Of course, the fact that 3D printing technologies have existed for years does not mean that DDD cannot experience strong growth in the years ahead, but it's important for investors to understand that this is far from being the ""next big thing.""A quick search shows that there are indeed a plethora of cheap 3D printers for domestic use that were not available many years ago. DDD's primary home 3D printer is the Cube, which starts at $1399 - a high price point compared to many other printers such as the Robo 3D printer ($599) and the Solidoodle printer ($499) which also come fully assembled. And while I am sure there are numerous uses for these relatively cheap consumer-priced 3D printers, at this stage they strike me as more of a fun novelty item than anything else, rather than something that would be needed in every household.DDD has certainly made a large number of acquisitions in just the past 3 years, most of which were under $10 million (it had one large acquisition of Z Corp and Vidar for over $135 million):This excellent article (""3D Systems: Has The Printer Jammed?"") raises an important point about how DDD may be acquiring companies to hide its declining revenue numbers. In DDD's pre-acquisition period (from 2000 to 2008), average annual revenue grew only 3%. Once DDD began acquiring companies in 2009, it was able to immediately count revenue from the companies it acquired, and thus substantially boost its revenue growth numbers. For the first nine months of 2012, Z Corp and Vidar (DDD's biggest acquisitions) had a combined $40.2 million in revenue, which DDD could add to its revenue numbers (which without Z Corp and Vidar were only $211.9 million) and count as growth.The key takeaway is that DDD is spending more on acquiring existing companies and technology than developing new technology itself, which doesn't jive with the perception of DDD being a revolutionary and exciting new 3D printing company set to explode.Another valid point, since there was a common misperception that DDD had been manufacturing parts for Boeing (NYSE:BA) aircraft. This is not the case - Boeing's supplier list for selective laser sintered nylon materials does not list 3D Systems. There has, of course, been plenty of talk about how 3D printing technologies can be used in the aerospace industry (along with just about every other industry known to man) but at this stage DDD is not yet involved.If 3D Printing Is Not Such A Big Deal, Why Have 3D Printing Stocks Blown Up?Citron's report attributes the rise of DDD over the past 12 months to DDD CEO Abe Reichental's strong statements to bring in investors (in this video he says 3D printing could be as big as the steam engine, as big as the computer, and as big as the internet), promotional video marketing from the Motley Fool and favorable analysts. I believe Motley Fool (which owns shares of DDD), with its huge email list and reach, has played the largest part in pumping up DDD shares.The Verdict on DDDDDD is far from being a worthless company. It has real revenue, and plenty of cash reserves. However, I do believe that its recent climb in stock price in the past 12 months from around $20 to over $60 is excessive, and largely a result of hype, speculation, promotion and misinformation about 3D printing. I don't intend to take a long term short position in DDD, but it would not surprise me at all to see the stock retreat back below $50 in the coming months.Are Other 3D Printing Stocks Also Overvalued?When an industry leader like DDD for 3D printing goes on an enormous run upwards, other stocks in the same industry tend to follow. And indeed, just about every stock involved in 3D printing (even stocks that are only partially involved in the 3D printing industry) have gone on strong upward runs recently. DDD's primary competitor, Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS), (which was also promoted by the Motley Fool) has a similar chart to DDD and could quite possibly represent another strong shorting opportunity for those who believe 3D printing stocks have become overextended. Even more recently (within 2013), small speculative 3D printing stocks such as Organovo Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) and Cimatron Ltd. (NASDAQ:CIMT) have exploded upwards, and are yet to seriously retrace. After the release of Citron's report, I certainly do not recommend going long on any speculative 3D printing stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1202521,40031,2013-02-19T10:30:38-05:00,,"There is much hype about 3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD) and 3D printing in general. The company is the largest by market cap, from companies involved in 3D printing. Its main competitor is Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS), and a recent IPO, The ExOne Company (NASDAQ:XONE).I have featured the stock in a recent quick pick article - 3 Short Squeeze Plays. At the time of writing, the stock was at/or near all time highs, and the situation has changed quickly since. And as I wrote in the article, short interest can serve both ways, putting pressure on the stock when the price direction turns south. The stock price is at a key level at the moment, getting support at its 50 day moving average line, with quite elevated volume recently. Stratasys on the other hand, broke down hard, slicing through its 50 day moving average, with no support at all. The most recent selloff was attributed to Citron Research, and their report on 3D Systems, calling it a bubble stock. There have been other worries about the company, with some questioning their accounting methods. The company will announce earnings next week, and could provide a ""make or break"" situation for the near-term stock movement, which has been volatile recently.Valuation and fundamentalsWith current valuations, the company seems overvalued. Trailing PE is 87.42; forward PE is 37.68, with a PEG ratio of 1.94, according to Yahoo Finance. Earnings growth was modest in recent quarters until the last quarter report, and is expected to soar, with analysts expecting 137% and 78% rise in EPS in next two quarters. Sales growth has been great, with an average rise of 52% in last four quarters, and with an expected growth rate of 48% and 27% in next two quarters. EPS trends are trending slightly up.Source for data: Earnings.com, Ycharts, Yahoo FinanceBut valuations are often not a proper indicator of potential of a growth company. Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) PE was 115 at the start of its tremendous run in 2003. A rise in the stock price of few hundred percent would also constrain investors and traders into buying the stock. That was the situation with Apple in all these years before the run ended late last year (I think it is better to say that the high growth phase ended). This might be the situation with 3D Systems, although it is not warranted. If the growth level of 3D Systems increases drastically, which is expected in the near term, and looking at exciting prospects of the technology, so would the valuation metrics deflate. Forward PE of 37 is not very high, provided the company keeps the growth rate, and analysts tend to miss hugely on the next quarter or year, and much more the further they look and project.You can look at this article as an example. Estimates for 2011 were 2011 were 0.55, and the company delivered 0.71 in adjusted earnings (nine months from the article), which was a 29% beat. And for the 2012, expectations were for 0.7 EPS, and if the 3D Systems delivers in-line for the last quarter of 2012, that would be a 64% more than estimated two years ago.On the third quarter conference call, the management noted the focus on 5 growth initiatives:1. Acceleration of 3D printer penetration, including projects in Zprinter brands, with new products and channel extension.2. Growth of healthcare solutions, with Bespoke and Vidar brands through expanded applications.3. Extension of on-demand parts services, including leading Quickparts brand and its organic growth, and through acquisitions and investments4. Building a significant consumer presence, including the Cubify brand.5. Integration of 3d authoring tools which include Rapidform and Alibre brands.The first three growth initiatives have delivered significant results, and are driving record revenue growth and earnings. The other two, in which the company is investing, are not yet material to revenue, but the management believes could represent a significant growth opportunity in the next 3 to 5 years, and they could potentially dwarf the existing business.Stratasys has not been as aggressive as 3D Systems, but it is enjoying the 3D printing trends. It has similar valuation as 3D Systems, with PE of 80.82, forward PE of 36.50, and a PEG ratio of 2.04. It will report earnings in early March. It corrected more, and sliced through its 50 day moving average after getting support at that level in late January.Source for data: Earnings.com, Ycharts, Yahoo FinanceProto Labs (NYSE:PRLB) does not produce 3D printers, but provides related services. The stock reached new highs after reporting better than expected results, but pulled back at the time when Citron issued the negative research report on 3D Systems.Price ActionThe stock had a tremendous run last year, rising 270%, and is currently up 11% year-to-date. Latest price action is of concern, with increased volatility and heavy distribution. Volatility is expected in the near term, especially with earnings release coming next week. The decline has stopped at the 50 day moving average, which might be a key support level. If it is breached, the fall might continue. If that happens, a new base building effort should take place, and an investor should be patient, as it could take months or longer in order to consolidate the volatile action it had. Peer price action, especially of Stratasys, is not good for 3D Systems, as much of a stocks' move is attributed to group movements.Source: StockchartsThis latest price movement reminds of similar cases that did not end well afterwards. Invensense (NYSE:INVN) had a chart that looked like this one of 3D Systems. Two tests of the 50 day moving average. Apple looked like this in early October. Both stocks broke down afterwards.Source: StockchartsConclusionDespite being overvalued at the moment, 3D Systems is a leader in a promising new technology. Analysts tend to underestimate growth potential of new promising companies with cutting edge and fast evolving technologies. However, the Citron bubble report should not be taken lightly, especially if on looks at examples of stocks that were short sale targets of the company. Current price action is wild and volatile, and the stock is currently at a key support level. Should it break that level, we may see a correction similar to those of Apple and Invensense. So, 3D Systems could provide a good shorting opportunity in the near term (if it breaks the key support level), and a great investment afterwards, and at a lower price level, if it continues to deliver solid revenue and earnings growth.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1200581,30951,2013-02-18T10:03:29-05:00,,"Whenever I look at a momentum stock (with off-the-wall valuation metrics, mind you), one of the very first things I take a look at is the short seller interest in the stock. Short sellers, generally speaking, aren't stupid, but they're not always right. When I see a stock that was previously highly shorted start to see significant and ""permanent"" covering, then I have to have a really strong case for why I would want to go in after so many others were proven wrong.However, when I see shares of a highly shorted (but rising) name continue to see a steady and marked increase in the number of shares shorted, I get the distinct impression that these short sellers view the share price increase as a ""gift"" and continue to further increase their positions. These shorts aren't usually individuals, but are in fact institutions/hedge funds who generally have done extensive research on the positions. They won't be so easily ""scared"" out of their positions when the stock marches up and, as unlikely as it seems during the stock's run, they usually win.Why Do Short Sellers Short?You probably think the following whenever a stock that you hold gets whacked on a particular day:I notice, in particular, whenever somebody makes a short call here on Seeking Alpha, the longs usually get freaked out, make ad hominem attacks on the contributor, and even send very rude messages to anybody who may think the contributor has a point (my inbox is filled with some nasty hate mail). However, you should no more ""hate"" a short seller than you should someone who is long. This is a market, and in order for it to exist, there need to be contrasting views.In fact, by hating short sellers, you may as well hate anybody who has ever hit the ""sell"" button on any particular stock. They're doing the same exact thing a short seller is doing: betting that the odds are good that the stock goes down from the sell point.With that out of the way, short sellers commonly short for the following reason:So, what's the short interest for 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) look like?The Shorts Aren't Giving UpTake a look at the trend in the short interest inNotice that the short interest has more than doubled since 2/15, meaning that even as the stock has tripled, the shorts have increased their bets all the way up, with only a relatively few of them giving up and covering (notice the ""spurts"" of covering immediately followed by more shorting). This is a red flag for those going long the stock, and I believe that we have seen this sort of thing before.Improving Fundamentals, But Not Organically?3D Systems is a momentum stock fueled by a string of earnings/revenue beats that appear to be fueled by acquisition after acquisition, as Mr. Georgi Dimitrov very deeply analyzed so keenly in his article, ""3D Systems: A Sobering Reality"". It is quite easy to grow all relevant metrics when you acquire businesses that generate revenue and free cash flow.It seems to me that despite the stock's rise, the short sellers know that it is only a matter of time before the revenue growth starts to slow considerably. However, the very real risk is that these acquisition sprees, coupled with further hype, could keep the shorts waiting (and/or feeling the squeeze) for months, if not years.The Stock Is Easily MovedOne thing that comes off as particularly interesting is that the stock is quite easily moved by groups such as Citron Research. The most recent downward move was caused by a report from the aforementioned firm that basically pointed out what many had been pointing out for months: 3D printing is a neat idea, but it probably won't bring the fundamental financial riches that people buying the stock at these levels expect. Now, it's not so much the content of the report that's striking, but rather the intense reaction that the share price saw as a result of the report:DDD data by YChartsThe volatility and sensitivity to even the slightly bit of negativity is indicative of just how tenuous of a position the company's lofty share-price happens to be in. This should give any serious investor some pause.This brings me to my last point: 3D Systems is exhibiting the classic signs of a bubble.Bubbles Everywhere...A Reminder3D Systems is a Wall-Street darling stock, which in the absence of fundamentals that support the stock price movement, translates into ""bubble that is about to burst"". Just look at this chart and tell me where you've seen it before:DDD data by YChartsIn case you've been living under a proverbial stock rock, here are some other examples of charts that looked exactly like that:RIMM data by YChartsBVSN data by YChartsGMCR data by YChartsMCP data by YChartsIt's very much like the typical penny-stock pump and dump, but with a bit more legitimacy since the companies (including DDD) don't trade on the pink sheets. The story, however, is always the same: the stock gets pumped and pumped up as the company keeps ""beating"" estimates and expectations from the sell-side. This leads to upgrades, flimsy explanations for sell-side analysts' earnings multiple targets, and a general hysteria. The dips are bought, the rips...are also bought, and the stock essentially is a money making machine for anybody who buys, and somewhat disastrous for those who short/sell...until the end.See, bubbles all end. Buyers get exhausted and move in to take profits, which obviously involves some selling. As the stock price sees selling pressure, others who are also sitting on paper gains start wanting to take profits. This, of course, leads to a whole bunch of stop losses from the day-traders and the swing traders being triggered, leading to even more selling. And, of course, on top of all of this, the guys shorting on technicals swarm in and lay waste to the stock.Some people try to ""buy"" this final dip, and you often see them screaming on message boards and StockTwits at how they're ""buying the dip"" and thanking the community for the ""cheap shares"", not realizing that they've just paid 100x earnings for a stock that everyone is now trying to get out of. They eventually get stopped out, or they're left holding the bag, watching their investment shrivel in horror.This is starting to look like the ""final"" dip, but it is not yet confirmed:If the stock manages to hold above the blue line (50 day moving average), then it's not yet time to pull the trigger on the short sale. However, if it breaks that line, then I believe that there will be a triple play of profit taking, technical shorts, and long traders' stop loss orders being triggered, leading to a quite steep decline. If it breaks the red line (200 day moving average), then this stock is toast and the stock will, more likely than not, drift back into the $20 range where it was before all of the excitement began.ConclusionI think the cat is out of the bag on the ""revenue growth by acquisition"" story and believe that the stock has been in a momentum-fueled bubble over the last year. While I do not suspect fraud, I do expect that this is very near the end of the run for the company's stock. You have a $3.4B company that trades at 8.6x book, 10.38x EV/Revenue, and 43x EV/EBITDA. All with a technical picture that is looking bleaker, and a bunch of shorts that have not been scared out of their positions despite the stock's run.Just be careful. Momentum stocks are fun to ride up when the getting's good, but at this stage of the game, the music could stop at any moment, and you could be left holding a very big bag. That being said, shorting such a low-float/high hype stock is still very dangerous. I wouldn't short it, but I would have a very difficult time going long for any reason other than a day trade.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1197581,38451,2013-02-17T09:36:29-05:00,,"3D systems (NYSE:DDD) is a company everyone talks about daily. Everyone has heard about 3D printers. DDD is the largest maker of 3D printers, machines that use software to make objects by laying plastic and other materials to the software specifications. This market is growing as products such as toys, medical devices can be reproduced at a cheap cost.The hype surrounding DDD and 3d printers has made DDD a darling of the stock market. Since 2011, the company's stock price has risen from $20 to a high of $70 in January of this year. The market continues to believe that DDD can grow well into the future.Fundamental analysisDDD has a hefty market capitalisation of $3.4billion, with only $442m in revenues estimated for 2013. The company has $183m in the bank and $131m in debt. There is a high % of float, 40% of the total 51.9million shares.What is alarming is the recent number of insiders selling their shares. A whopping 765,000 shares have been sold in the last 6 months, with no buys being made.DDD's P/E is also quite rich, with a reading of 87.42, with a forward P/E of 37.92 as of December 31st, 2013.Technical analysisLet's start by studying the daily chart. One can see that the volume has been increasing on down days. The long term support has been broken this week. MACD is turning down. All bearish signals.On the weekly chart, more bearish signals can be seen. If we use the 50% fibronacci retracement, one can observe that this takes us to the previous breakout level of around $46. I would be a buyer at those levels.ConclusionI like to conclude on one note. I don't doubt that 3d printing will continue to get more coverage, and I expect DDD to do well in the future. The question is: Has DDD run up too high too fast? I tend to believe so and would be a buyer again at around $46.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in DDD over the next 72 hours.

1134191,39581,2013-01-25T13:21:18-05:00,,"3D Printing Is About To Enter A Cool-Down PhaseMy underlying investment philosophy involves finding disconnects between underlying reality and the investment sentiment which, at times, represents it. I have written about it in the past, in my introduction to SA readers, including to go so far as to mention what I am going to make the focus of this week's article - 3D printing, its foreseeable future, and how understanding the modern sentiment cycle towards emergent technology can yield long-term wealth for patient, prudent investors.At this time, 3D Systems Inc (NYSE:DDD) is undergoing a ""blowoff"" movement, the final move in a long term trend before a cyclical reversal and downside prices. We recently saw sentiment in Apple stock (and the reason I am technically bearish on their stock (Earnings Smash has occurred since I drafted this article)) reach exuberant highs before reversing and catching ever-onward long investors in a hard-hitting blindside that has shaved almost 32% off of the invested principal of the many who were piling into the peak. I believe such a story is playing out for long holders in DDD and other 3D printing stocks right now, where we will see a huge shake-up followed by the opposite sort of price/fundamental disconnect - similar to the story that has been playing out with our excellent graphite gains of late.We are seeing similar action in both expectations and sentiment for 3D Systems and other 3D printing stocks. A huge disconnect between real, underlying fundamentals, and the buying and selling activity of shares which are supposed to represent this underlying fundamental foundation. I am going to focus on 3D Systems today, and make the case for why long shareholders should really think about selling their tremendous gains, and traders can begin getting set up for a short-sell opportunity.3D Printing And Its Long Term Potential3D Printing, which is something I've been watching for a few years now (I am a tech geek at heart, after all), really took off in 2012. News mentions skyrocketed this year:People, and investors, got really interested in 3D printing - 2012 was the ""hype"" year for 3D printing, and we saw share prices of companies involved in the field outperform the market staggeringly. There is a good reason for it - 3D printing is absolutely amazing.For those of you who aren't very familiar, the more technical term for it is ""additive manufacturing"". 3D printers work by taking a digital blueprint or CAD document and ""printing"" it out, layer by 3D layer. The current range of materials is fairly limited, especially for consumer model 3D printers, but it is ever-expanding, and new methods for introducing materials are being devised all the time. The most versatile 3D printers on the consumer market thus far are models made by Stratasys (formerly Objet).I highly encourage you to watch Stratasys' presentation on their 117-material 3D printer, and see what kind of amazing things this machine is capable of. The video can be found here. The scale on which 3D printers can actually work continues to grow smaller and smaller, increasing their application in a host of value-added and highly specialized industries.Here are a few of the most amazing things that 3D printers have done in the last couple of years:-Building synthetic bones so that surgeons can cheaply train for difficult operations-Successfully printing real, organic tissue - with the goal to actually one day print entire human organs-Creating custom-designed clothing that can be manufactured from scratch to your exact body measurements-Printing a custom, completely functional prosthetic beak for a bald eagle-Printing custom artificial limbs, made exactly to a patient's physical specifications, and costing less than 20% versus using the traditional methods of prosthetic production.-Printing off support devices for people with disabilities, for up to 90% off the cost of comparable technology using traditional methods of manufacturing. (this is a beautiful story, in and of itself, and demonstrates how wonderfully the market provides for people when it is unhindered)Those are just a fraction of the incredible and new things that 3D printing has enabled and accomplished in the past few years. It truly is an amazing story, and I think we are just at the tip of the iceberg in terms of long term accomplishment. You could say that I'm ""uber-bullish"" on the very long term prospects for 3D printing and the kind of prosperity it can create for humankind. This is about the most efficient voluntary resource allocation potential on the planet, where scarce goods are concerned, and the market and its relentless quest towards the most desired resource allocation (when unfettered) will make 3D printing a reality for millions more people in the years and decades to come.However, there are some major landmines on the road to progress, and human optimism has a tendency to outrun reality.Patent WarsSince the advent of copyright, it has seems that virtually any industry that attracts the love of its customers begins to go into civil-war mode. Gone are the days of simply out-competing a rival for your customer, replaced by the days of lawsuits and attempts at crippling within a massive web of patent and copyright laws. It is estimated that just copyright and patent trolling have cost society over $500 billion since 1990. This is not accounting for stifled innovation and hampered production, all of the could-have-been opportunity costs and artificial barriers to entry that patents and copyright impose.Luckily, business seems to be progressing faster than the patents. The real issue is going to be on the design/software side of 3D Printing. We are already seeing patents on 3D Printing DRM by one of the worst patent troll of modern history.This could create a bit of a tricky area for consumers who don't have the design skills to make their own products, but don't want to download a design for fear of getting charged with copyright violations. After all, in the modern era, governments are attempting to impose laws that jail you longer for illegally downloading music than for manslaughter. Consumers, who are estimated to be the major new market for 3D Printing in years to come, might be deterred in their purchases if individuals are being jailed for downloading infinitely-replicable, non-scarce goods to use in their 3D Printers.Furthermore, there is not just risk of design-side litigation gumming up the industry and dragging innovation to a standstill, but the true Sword of Damocles to the ultimate disruptive, wealth-generating technology of 3D printing is, in fact, the laundry list of major established industries that stand to lose enormous revenue streams if this marvelous technology is ever to become a household mainstay. You can expect armies of lawyers across thousands of industries to be licking their chops at the idea of suing 3D printer manufacturers for enabling the ""theft"" of non-scarce, artificially-denominated goods that their machines use.Hype is Vastly Outpacing SalesSales have been booming on the consumer end, even while more and more businesses are integrating 3D printing into their existing business models. However, sales are still a tiny sliver of actual consume market penetration, with 15,000 home 3D printers sold in 2011, and 60,000 sold in 2012. 3D Printing is very emergent stuff that the market is currently pricing for immense and immediate growth, and with hardly a hiccup.This is where we come back to the classic Gartner Hype Cycle, where expectations outstrip reality, come crashing down to a level of pessimism, and the fundamental situation continues to improve and roadblocks are overcome. Total 3D Printer sales for the entire consumer market are expecting to be around $1.3 billion for 2012. When stacked up against the market cap of 3D Systems, just one market participant in a market with ever increasing competition, at $3.61 billion, we need to see many more years of amazing growth to justify current prices.A Completely Different Business Model3D Printing, for all of its amazing accomplishments, still has serious roadblocks to overcome. For one, its cost-savings effectiveness is actually measured in the exact opposite way that the cost-effectiveness of traditional manufacturing is measured. Namely - traditional manufacturing makes sense when products are fairly simple, because economies of scale work in these types of environments.In 3D printing terms, the actual cost to produce something is measured in how much ""ink"" or medium is used. In traditional manufacturing, the total cost is affected by the number of value-adding inputs are required to make a finished product. The two are completely opposite.The general principle is that, the more internally complex something is, the more ""white space"" there will actually be, thus requiring the printer to use less ""ink"" than would be required in the same number of printer head passes to make a more ""simple"" object that will have less ""white space"". Think the difference between injection-molding a plastic handle for a vacuum cleaner, versus designing that handle to be an aesthetically pleasing complex lace of plastic. More material would actually be used for the plain handle, making it more expensive to print with a 3D printer. However, to traditionally manufacture a complex lacework design in plastic requires far higher input costs in terms of molds and fabrication.In order for 3D Printing to become effective for consumers to use en masse, we will need to see two things happen. Costs of the actual materials that 3D printers use must come down much further to justify in-home manufacturing of goods, and designers and engineers will have to re-think the way they put products together to make in-home fabrication more plausible than mass production.I believe both of these things will happen, but the market is currently pricing itself way ahead of the development curve, as we have seen time and again with emergent tech, and we are likely to see a slow-down period very soon where price action will come back in line with fundamentals.Sort of PC-ish, But Not ReallyPersonal computers were responsible for ushering in the digital age, moving many scarce goods into the non-scarce realm and freeing up hundreds of billions of dollars of resources over the past few decades. 3D printers will likely have a similar revolutionizing effect. Just as software has continued to come down in price over time, mostly due to more and more closed systems accommodating themselves to open, free/low-cost software that is instantly and infinitely-replicable, we will continue to see the cost of the raw materials that 3D printers require continue to fall.That being said, running a 3D printer is still a very expensive proposition right now. This is an ongoing cost barrier that will keep adoption rates far lower than that of PC's, because 3D printing must still rely on the ongoing input of various scarce goods. The price-demand curve of materials will take longer to reach a level of broad market penetration, simply because the units themselves must continue to go down in price along-side their usable materials. Since we have growth dependent upon two simultaneous systems of production that are both scarce (the printers themselves and their technology, and the ongoing use of materials required by these printers), adoption of 3D printers will occur at a much slower pace than PCs and their progeny, which are scarce objects using non-scarce digital goods.Many pundits within the 3D printing sphere have been calling for PC-like adoption and growth rates. This will not be the case until more of a technology plateau is reached in terms of what a typical machine can do, and until the cost of ongoing inputs comes down to a level that justifies consumer-use on a mass scale. We are still many years away from this.DDD - A Very Expensive Stock3D Systems is a component of the S&P 600 Small Cap Index. Since being added to the index on April 11, 2012, when its market cap was at $1.34 billion, it has skyrocketed up to top-ten market cap on the index. The average market cap of an S&P 600 Small Cap component is $923 million, putting 3D System's current $4 billion market cap over 400% greater than an average component.DDD is currently trading at an extremely rich P/E of 100, with a forward P/E of 43.73 as of Dec 31, 2012 - Today's forward P/E sits well over 50. This means that shareholders purchasing this stock are betting that revenue to will continue to grow at its blistering pace, and a perfectly happy that it will take almost 3 years of current revenue growth at these share price levels to bring its P/E below 20.00 and into ""conservative"" territory.On a historical basis, DDD has never been close to as expensive as it is now:They have also increased their debt levels in-line with the increases in their revenue, which means they have to ensure they don't fall into the trap of increasing debt and debt service costs, and diminishing returns on R&D and Innovation. The next year or two will be very telling, but current share prices are reflecting an exuberance that does not bode historically well for longs.Blow-Off Underway3-D Systems is exhibiting classic patterns of a blow-off peak right now. These types of moves are very difficult to pin down, because they tend to be exhaustive - volume has spiked dramatically along with the exponential nature of the rise, and internals are just starting to show signs of cracking. We could still see another $10-$20 move up from here, but we are beginning to look exhaustive with this monthly and weekly gap. The next few days will tell us if this is a classic Island Reversal pattern on a gap lower into next week.DDD has broken out of the constraints of all upper trend line and channel lines, and is now engaged in what is known as a ""throw-over"", the final move of a long term trend before a swift reversal back within the confines of its historical price action.Internal measures of buying and selling momentum are waning off, indicating that this move, when it does reverse, will do so swiftly and take many long investors by surprise. Initial target range is at previous support of $32.35 and resistance of $29.35, with greater bearish potential from there. Traders may target a short, upon confirmation of a reversal with an island-gap early next week, to this range.ConclusionsWhile I am a huge fan of the technology of 3D printing and its potential to raise human living standards drastically, I cannot let that get in the way of the reality of the situation - 3D printing still has huge leaps and bounds to go before it can fundamentally justify the exuberance and high prices we are seeing in 3D printing stocks today. The disconnect between fundamental realities and asset prices will narrow, as it always does, and we will likely see some great buying opportunities within this sphere over the next 12-24 months.If there is going to be a catalyst that will bring 3D printers closer to a PC-like potential adoption rate, it will likely happen when these stocks fall out of favor and have to crank up the innovation to please shareholders and keep customers coming. I will keep my eye on this market closely, and will do a follow-up when I am going to initiate some long-term long positions within the 3D printing industry.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in DDD over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: Upon either a weekly island reversal gap, or an outside daily reversal bar, I will initiate a short position - this may be further than 72 hours out, but it is not far."
1147401,41041,2013-01-31T13:41:01-05:00,,"In Search Of The Next Big Thing...My primary interest when it comes to investing is identifying macro trends that can be invested against. For me, there are few feelings as satisfying as the moment my mind clamps onto what I think is going to be ""the next big thing"".To date, my best moment came in 2003, when gazing down at my 15g iPod, I realized, what I really wanted, was for that sleek white beast to be my phone. Driving that desire, was my phone at the time, a Blackberry 6210, which I had nicknamed, the ""Bacon Skillet"".My loathing of the ""Skillet"" with its clumsy interface and buggy software, coupled with a hellish experience attempting to repair a Bissell carpet cleaner, left me with an irrational hatred of Canadian engineering that persists to this day. But, back to my point - At the time I saw a very big opportunity for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in mobile phones, an opportunity that was far bigger than the MP3 market, and as a result, went in big on Apple at a split adjusted $11.33.3D Printing: The Next Big Thing.To see how 3D printing works, here's a four minute mind-blowing example from National Geographic.The same technique used to create the wrench in the National Geographic video can be used with a wide range of plastics, metals and even organic materials.Now, here's how 3D printing is being viewed by the manufacturing community. From the CSC Leading Edge Forum, Fall 2012:""Good enough to serve markets that previously had no manufacturing capability at all"", is the key take away that I'm running with. While 3D printing currently has practical applications in automotive, aerospace, defense and healthcare, I still haven't seen an application that will spur mass adoption (Remember, it's the large macro trend I'm looking for).DIY adoption, is currently niche at best, with key barriers being material cost, availability of a wide material spectrum, speed and broad applications. While it's beyond amazing that I can design and print a custom smartphone case, or robotic toy, I don't think we've reached the tipping point of ""got to have it"" for consumers, or large scale/rapid adoption by industry. (It's important to note that 3D printing, is not new - the first applications began in the 80's - this technology is older than some investors.)For some ideas on what's being marketed in finished consumer 3D printing products and services:My Robot Nation - Design and print a robotFreshFiber - Personalized 3D Accessories for smartphones, etcSculpteo - Design workshop, 3D printing service and marketplaceFigurePrints - World of WarCraft figures and MineCraft 3D replicasShapeways - 3D printing marketplace and communityUrbee - Two-passenger hybrid car projectTaking A Look at 3D SystemsNow unfortunately, I'm not the only investor scanning the horizon for the next big investing opportunity. The importance of 3D printing is well documented in the media, with The Economist calling 3D printing, ""The Third Industrial Revolution"". For an interested investor, opportunities for a ""pure play"" investment are fairly limited, with two companies: 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) providing the best opportunity to invest in 3D printer manufacturers.As an investor, I was interested in 3D Systems based on the company's aggressiveness move toward the DIY and educational markets - the areas where I expect the broad market ""Aha!"" moment to occur.Now, let's take a look at the 3D System chart.Clearly, 3D Systems stock price is benefiting to a great extent as being ""one of the few investment games in town"" for 3D printing, with a tremendous run-up since the start of 2012. At the same time, the company's trailing EPS is not showing the kind of growth to warrant what has been a 13 month price spike.The Big Fear: I'll Miss The Next RevolutionIrrational emotions, whether directed toward Canadian engineers or stocks, rarely lead to healthy decisions. For a quick lesson, take a look at Apple's chart over the past 10 years.It's readily apparent that an investor, who carefully monitored the market, had plenty of time to take a position in Apple during its run. For a long investor, the timeframe is in years, so getting the research right, for me, is the best way to sleep easy after I've taken a long position. (A prime example was the $200 to $98 move by AAPL 2008-2009).I'm Waiting on 3D Systems3D printing is an amazing technology that will revolutionize manufacturing beyond our ability to imagine - in healthcare, experiments of printing soft tissue are underway and may lead to printed veins and arteries for operations!However, the ""noise"" from the media, the large number of interested investors and the slow maturation of the technology are likely to lead to over zealous price appreciation. Right now, I suspect 3D Systems falls into that category.That said, given the amount of money currently in search of return, and the ""noise"" behind the technology - it is conceivable that 3D will continue to run, at this time however, given current growth expectations for the company, I'm not willing to make a momentum bet on the stock.At this time, a possible strategy for an investor, especially if the stock continues to appreciate would be to consider taking a long straddle position for the earning release, Feb. 25, to take advantage of the stocks recent volatility.In the meantime, I plan on ingesting any and all information on 3D printing that I can find. This technology is likely to change the way we view manufacturing, as well as lead to the development of products that still haven't been imagined. I want to make sure I'm ready.Disclosure: I am long AAPL. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1100351,41081,2013-01-08T11:19:16-05:00,,"Until you're familiar with both sides of the story on a stock, you will never know it well enough to know when to hold it through volatility and when to fold.The bulls' thesis is that 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) is one of the leaders in the fast growing 3D printing market. The 3D market is set to grow tenfold over the next ten years; 3D Systems being a leader is likely to capture more than a fair share of this growth. It's already showing its credentials delivering 69% EPS growth last year and likely 100% next year and throwing off lots of free cash. They also point out that the stock has significant momentum and accumulation behind it.The bears claim that if 3D Systems increases EPS to $14 in ten years (from the current $0.68) it still won't be a good investment. At a PE of 15, $14 equates to a $210 price. This is just a 13% annual return to the investor based on the current price. They also feel that $14 EPS would be a stretch given the rate at which they are issuing new shares to buy growth. They also point to the hidden risks that come from the opacity of its acquisition-led growth strategy, which makes it easy for management to obfuscate its true financial picture. They demand a lower price, given the dangers.Overview of 3D SystemsQuality3D Systems appears to be a high quality company.It has a weak competitive advantage (customers using their printers are tied to their consumables) and a two to three year leadership position. 3D's acquisition strategy will also provide some protection from changing technology.It has fair, but improving, earnings quality. Its margins are improving as higher margin consumables make up more of its revenue (vs. lower margin printers). It also generates a lot of free cash. (Vital quality statistics RoA: 10.6% RoE: 18.3% FCF/Earnings: $50m/$53m.)It also has a solid balance sheet with low debt to equity and low debt to free cash flow. (Balance sheet statistics: Total Assets: $661m Share Equity: $416m Debt: $124m Cash: $184m Current Assets / Current Liabilities: $302m / $79m.)On the negative side it continues to issue new shares, diluting its share base, in order to finance acquisitions, a strategy that it plans to continue. To an extent this dilutes the quality of its free cash flow.GrowthWe love 3D Systems' historic growth and every indication is that the growth in its primary market will support solid growth for many years to come. The growth projections and future for the 3D market are very compelling (+20% per annum over the next five to ten years).And so far 3D Systems has stepped up to the base and taken a greater than fair share of the market growth. A caution is that half of its growth has been acquisition related, which makes it less valuable; it also makes it easier for management to manipulate earnings and cash flow. Though management claims 26% organic growth (we don't dispute this), some shorts have attacked their accounting. (Growth statistics: 3yr revenue growth: -18%, 42%, 44%. 3 year EPS growth: -ve comparison, -ve comparison, 69%. Last 3 quarters revenue growth: 63%, 53%, 57%. Last 3 quarters EPS growth: -14%, -38%, +71%. Last 3 quarters operating earnings growth: 43%, 75%, 800%.)The poor EPS comparisons in the March and June quarters were due to tax rebates and higher taxes.TechnicalsA glance at the charts indicates favourable timing for a purchase. The market is in a clear up trend. The stock is being accumulated by institutions with strong buying since October and the stock is being supported by its 15 day moving average.The only reason to hesitate might be that the price has run up over the past few days and is relatively extended from its 15 day moving average. A pullback to this line is likely.ValuationUnfortunately 3D Systems is selling at a PE of 90 and a forward PE of 40 based on consensus analyst earnings estimates. This leaves little in the area of margin of safety. Assuming 22% revenue growth over the next five years and continuing margin expansion to 60% gross margin, we still struggle to value this business using a DCF model at much above $26 (an implied PE of 38 vs. current earnings and 19 vs. 2013 earnings estimates.) Half the growth is acquisition related and financed through share issues. Even a rich 30 times next year's earnings would be $42 (vs. current price of $57).This high valuation significantly increases the risk to a long term holder, whilst for the short term holder it will likely introduce a high level of volatility into the share price - making it very easy to buy at the wrong time and sell at the wrong time.RecommendationI like the growth, I like the chart. I think the quality is fair to good, but the valuation is through the stratosphere.I think the bull thesis is right, investor sentiment is very positive and generally this will push up prices. The story is really compelling and is sure to shut down the rational brains of many investors. I can't help thinking that 3D Systems may well be the one who will be making the replicators for the Star Ship Enterprise. Why wouldn't you buy and hold that to the stratosphere and beyond?I also think the bear thesis is right, it's not worth the current price, but that won't stop a great story from suppressing the logical brain and leaving the animal spirits free reign to drive the price higher in the short run. Some of the bears have gotten their timing wrong and are in there a tad too early and have to resort to shock and fear tactics to accelerate their argument. The bulls don't seem to be letting it interfere with the joy of the moment.3D Systems is only for the experienced momentum speculator or if you have an edge in a better understanding of the 3D market. And only if you can set a stop and execute it, this is in the hands of momentum players and 3D hard cores. When it breaks it will likely lose half its market price quite quickly.Disclosure: I am long DDD.  I plan to reduce position size as (if) the stock advances.

1115201,36191,2013-01-16T12:43:24-05:00,,"IntroductionIn this article, we will look at the two publicly traded US based entries in the burgeoning market for 3D printing. The companies are 3D systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) and Stratsys Limited (NASDAQ:SSYS). We will examine some historical performance indicators, forward growth estimates, and macroeconomic issues in an attempt to determine which of the two is a better winning bet right now.Tracking FinancialsHere are the two companies for our analysis:Data from Morningstar on January 14, 2013What Does 2013 Have in Store for 3D Printing?This may be the year 3D Printing begins to live up to its billing as the ""next big thing"" for investors. In essence, 3D Printing technology isn't printing at all but rather a manufacturing process that creates 3 dimensional objects layer by layer. The process is a combination of CAD (Computer Aided Design) and CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing). A software program with a digital model of the object guides the ""printer"" as it builds the final product one layer or ""sheet"" at a time. Currently materials available are limited to a variety of polymer based substances and some metals.Industrial applications for 3D printing have been around for some time and are growing. Parts replacement and prototype modeling are two of the most common uses. It is the entry of this technology into the consumer market that has some investors seeing dollar signs in their eyes. Personal computers are now as common in most households as toasters. Will 3D Printers follow the same explosive growth path? That process has already begun and 2013 may accelerate the trend.3D Systems was the first publicly held company to enter the consumer market with its Cube 3D Printer in 2012, priced around $1,300. Prior to its entry into the market consumer choice was limited to 3D Printer Kits and the pricier entry from rival Stratasys Ltd, the Mojo, priced just under $10,000! Stratasys did classify the Mojo as a commercial grade printer. At the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show 3d Systems' latest entry, the Cube X 3D Printer, won a Best of CES award from the editors of CNET.If you look at the valuations of both 3D Systems and Stratasys it becomes clear the investing community sees the potential for 3D printing to be a game changing disruptive technology. Both stocks are trading at high multiples, but investors appear willing to pay for anticipated growth. Shareholders of both companies have been well-rewarded year over year, although the following chart from Yahoo Finance shows DDD has done quite a bit better. 3D Systems is up 250% compared to 125% for SYSS.3D Systems is a strong believer in growth by acquisition, having acquired 31 companies in just the last three years. Some investors view this as a bearish sign, preferring organic growth from within. However, the stock price speaks for itself. Although the company serves the commercial market as well with 3D printers, print materials, design services, and on-demand custom parts services, it is their aggressive pursuit of the consumer market that makes them stand apart.At the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show 3D Systems unveiled a test release of Cubify Capture, a service that will allow consumers to upload images from digital cameras, smartphones, or tablet computers to a website. The images will be transformed into computer models stored in the user account for later use with Cube 3D printers. This focus on the consumer market stands in sharp contrast to the business model of its largest publicly traded US rival, Stratasys.Stratasys Limited prefers for the moment to concentrate on professional users, largely in the engineering community. They serve government agencies and manufacturing clients from a broad array of industries, including aerospace, automotive, consumer appliances and electronics, educational, medical and military industriesSSYS has big name clients like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Ford (NYSE:F), Nike (NYSE:NKE), Xerox (NYSE:XRX), and Boeing (NYSE:BA). The recently completed merger with a privately held rival in Israel, Objet, will make Stratasys the largest US based 3D printing company by market cap. The merger will expand the technological base of the company's operations with three additions -- Fused Deposit Modeling (FDM) for quick and cheap prototype design, inkjet-based PolyJet for prototypes that require higher-level of detail and a finer surface finish, and Solidscape Drop-on-Demand (""DoD"") 3D wax printers for investment casting. The biggest benefit may be the fact the new Stratasys can now boast its technology has more than 120 different materials from which to produce final products. .Analysts and investors alike appear to see the merger as highly positive. The stock price continues to climb as have analyst forecasts for 2013. The average analyst estimate for earnings per share has risen from $1.33 for FY 2012 to $1.68 in 2013.The merger gives the new company added technological capability and a bigger customer base. However, history tells us mergers do not always proceed smoothly. The merger of Time Warner and AOL is now considered one of the worst in history. To date, little has been written about how the details of merging these Stratasys and Objet will progress, except for the announcement of an executive committee to handle the integration.Final VerdictWhile one could argue both these stocks are ""too hot to handle,"" if you believe in growth investing both are worthy of your consideration. Despite the entry of a larger and more capable Stratasys, the Financial Times recently reported a majority of analysts polled still see DDD outperforming the market.The press coverage DDD has gotten from its focus on the consumer market can make it easy for investors to forget 3D also has an impressive list of industrial customers, including Xerox, Motorola (NYSE:MSI), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), Johnson Controls (JSI), General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Ford. It appears that 3D Systems could be first to crack the consumer market with affordable desktop printers. Revenue generation from printer materials and design software could dwarf revenue from the sale of printers, following the classic ""razor blade"" model pioneered by the Gillette Company. Once proud Hewlett Packard rose to prominence on the back of its consumer market. If 3D Systems is successful at bringing its printers into the hands of the masses, shareholders will be very, very happy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1105461,24389,2013-01-10T12:51:57-05:00,,"By: Ahmed Ishtiaq3D systems (NYSE:DDD) was one of the best performing stocks of 2012, recording an astonishing gain of over 250% during the past year. Over the past twelve months, we did not just see a climb in the stock price. We also witnessed a change in the analyst estimates about the stock. A majority of analysts revised their estimates upward for 3D systems. There have been a lot of questions about the ability of the company to continue its growth. Some sections of investors are pessimistic about the future growth prospects and current valuation of the stock.I have a completely different opinion about the company. Pessimists were also raising questions about the valuation of the stock when it was trading at $41. I recommended the stock in my article on November 20, 2012. Since then, 3D systems have gained about 30% and returned handsomely to investors. I believe there is a lot of potential in the market, and the market is far from saturation. In my opinion, current valuation is still attractive due to the growth prospects. The company is growing at a rapid pace, and organic growth is complimented by acquisitions.Future Growth Prospects and UsesThe company has a brilliant business model. The biggest portion of revenues comes from its services segment. The company generates more revenue from materials than sales of printers. Even if, the sales of 3D printers slow down, which I believe is not likely to happen anytime soon; the overall revenues of the company will continue impressive growth. The company has revolutionized the 3D printing market. 3D printing will be extremely important in a lot of industrial applications. I do not believe the market has even been properly penetrated at the moment. There is a lot of room for growth in the market, and 3D systems is well positioned to exploit this growth opportunity.The company is penetrating the market with its affordable and competitive products. A lot of professionals need 3D printing to produce prototypes of the product before going through with the design. Furthermore, 3D printing will allow companies to customize products efficiently according to the needs of the customers. Industry experts are predicting that in five years, there will be a 3D printer in every home in America. If the prediction comes true, the company will have a lot of printing materials to sell. In addition, 3D printing will play an important role in the medical technology. Quality of medical implants can be enhanced with the help of 3D printing, and implants can be made according to the needs.3D systems has launched a new, bigger printer, which can produce big prints. It has a larger printing area and uses the proprietary smart cartridges 3D Systems uses with entry-level Cube printers. Furthermore, the company is growing through acquisitions. Recently, 3D systems announced the acquisition of Geomagic, a modeling software company. The acquisition will strengthen the applications portfolio if the company can augment future growth.Valuation and RisksThe stock is currently selling at 40 times the profit of 2013, which obviously makes it an expensive investment. However, long-term growth prospects of the company are good enough to justify the current price multiples. In the short-term, a new stock issue can be detrimental for the value of the stock. The company may want to take advantage of the valuation of the stock and decide to raise cash through a secondary offering. Another risk for the company arises from foreign exchange. 3D systems generates almost half of its revenues from its international operations. A strong U.S. dollar can affect the consolidated revenues of the company.CompetitionThe main competitors of 3D systems are Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and France's Dassault Systems (OTCPK:DASTY). Another company operating in the 3D printing market is MakerBot. However, MakerBot is not public at the moment. Table below lists important metrics for comparison.Source: MorningstarP/E ratios are substantially high in the industry, and valuation indicates the stock is currently trading at a premium. However, it is normal for a company with such growth prospects to trade at a premium. Margins and revenue growth are impressive for the company.SummaryThe stock has had a great start to 2013, and it has already gained over 15%. In the short-term, the stock may pull back a little. However, 3D systems can be a rewarding investment in the long-term. We are looking at a company with massive growth potential operating in a growing market. There is a lot of potential in the 3D printing market. I believe the stock will be able to record impressive returns during 2013. The increase in stock price may not be as high as the previous year. Nonetheless, there is a substantial upside potential with 3D systems. The stock will prove to be a winner in 2013.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: EfsInvestment is a team of analysts.

1115531,37231,2013-01-16T14:12:12-05:00,,"There are two moving parts to the fortunes of every growth company. They are the story of the company's prospects, and the results that confirm that story. In the case of 3D printing company 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), an alluring story has captivated analysts, institutional investors, and the common market participant alike. The technologies the company pioneered center around the idea of additive manufacturing, of creating an object by laying down successive layers of material and fusing them together to build something from the bottom up. When the technology was first pioneered, it promised to change manufacturing, which for centuries rested on the concept of subtraction of material to produce objects.The benefits of the new technology are vast. The design process has benefited from much more rapid prototyping. Customized products that were once economically unthinkable can now be produced as one-off items. Tooling and machining costs that encumber traditional subtractive processes do not exist in 3D printing. Material waste is minimized because it is being added as needed rather than subtracted to create the desired object. The technology has come a long way from its infancy in the 1980s, and a continuing improvement in its precision and quality has come simultaneously as its cost has gone down. These two trends have combined to usher in the beginning of the widespread adoption of the technology, from the automotive business, to the aerospace industry, to the health sector, to the jewelry market, to architecture design, and all the way to educational institutions. 3D printing promises to democratize innovation. New low-cost personal 3D printers have even developed a following among individual early adopters; communities for sharing designs and ideas have formed. As a testament to its development, the 3D market was estimated to total $1.3 billion in 2012. Wohlers Associates estimates the industry's historical compound annual growth rate at a lofty 26.4%. In its 2012 report, it predicts that the additive manufacturing industry will reach a size of $3.7 billion worldwide, and $6.5 billion by 2019, representing a CAGR of 17%. Other surveys of the industry expect the market to reach $5.2 billion by 2020, a lower but still impressive level of growth. The story of 3D printing is, then, firmly in place.The narrative of 3D printing has been complemented by several public companies with an exclusive focus on 3D printing, chief among them 3D Printing Systems , Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), and Organovo Holdings (NASDAQ:ONVO), as well as larger companies that are engaged in the industry such as Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), and Dassault Systemes SA (OTCPK:DASTY). This article focuses on 3D Printing Systems. The company has experienced explosive revenue growth over the past five years, and net income has turned considerably black, as seen below. The company has time and time again surpassed analyst expectations through its results.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)In short, 3D Systems' results have acted as confirmation of the 3D printing growth story. And the market has listened - since 2011, the company's stock price, as well as its trailing twelve month PE ratio, has soared. From the beginning of 2012 to today, the company is up 295%. Investor sentiment toward the company's future, as proxied by the incredible four-fold expansion in its TTM PE ratio, indicates that the market continues to expect confirmation of the company's growth story well into the future.(Click to enlarge)In all of this, one may see the most cut and dry of successful growth stories. An industry with incredible growth prospects and a company that has taken advantage of its market-leading position to grow even faster. 3D Systems' results over the years must be a clear confirmation of the story. Yet if one were to dig beneath the surface of this intoxicating narrative, a number of warnings signs begin to emerge. 3D Systems is, in fact, a company that has never delivered material free cash flows to its investors. It is a company that is heavily addicted to acquisitions that destroy, rather than create, shareholder value. In this light, the purpose of this article is to demonstrate that the story of 3D Systems is not one and the same as the story of 3D printing.Continually Negative Free Cash FlowsIn its most fundamental form, the generation of cash is the source of value companies create for their shareholders - this value can be theoretically returned in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. In the case of growth companies, shareholders expect positive free cash flows at some point in the future for their willingness to lend capital to a company today. 3D Systems, founded in 1986, had not generated any materially positive free cash flows for its investors in decades. At an on-face level, 3D Systems began to do so in 2009.(Click to enlarge)Yet the cause of this turnaround in the company's ability to create value is not centered in the growth of the 3D printing industry, which had been expanding at a heady clip for years, and whose rate of growth is actually forecast to slow down. In 2009, 3D systems began to actively augment its own strategy through an aggressive string of acquisitions. Since 2008, the company has acquired over 30 companies at a total price of $312 million.(Click to enlarge)These acquisitions have become part and parcel with 3D Systems growth strategy. In a 2012 interview with 3DPrintingIndustry, CEO Abe Reichental says of the company's acquisition binge, ""Our strategy (which we have been very public about) is to build the most compelling and attractive 3D content-to-print global platform for the benefit of manufacturers and consumers. Each and every acquisition we make is carefully linked to one of our five growth initiatives and provides an important technology, presence or service building block."" In its 2011 10K, the company notes that ""We are working to accomplish our growth initiatives organically and, as opportunities present themselves, through selective acquisitions, including those we have already completed."" With regard to the future, the 10K states, ""We have made, and expect to continue to make, strategic acquisitions that may involve significant risks and uncertainties."" Most recently, the company acquired Geomagic, a company that provides 3D software solutions, from a venture capital firm for an undisclosed amount on January 3.The central question that must be asked when forecasting 3D Systems' ability to create value in the future is what part of its revenue and earnings are generated through organic growth of the company and what part comes from its acquisitive behavior. A number of articles have attempted to ferret out the company's intrinsic growth rate by backing out the revenue the company has taken in from the businesses of companies it has acquired. Yet this form of analysis asks the wrong question. It is impossible to accurately back out revenue of acquired companies because the combined entity does not act equivalently as the two separate companies would. Synergies exist from the acquisition itself that render the comparison rather useless. Products are integrated, redundant employees laid off, sales channels and administrative functions are leveraged. In addition, 3D Systems discloses revenue figures for the businesses it has acquired only when they are deemed ""significant"" according to GAAP, which leaves more than 25 of their acquisitions with no revenue or income numbers whatsoever. The company began to break down what it terms organic revenue growth from its overall revenue growth in 2011. For instance, in the company's Q3 presentation, it states that whereas total revenue growth for the first nine months of 2012 was 57%, organic revenue growth was 24%.(Click to enlarge)The company's interpretation of what ""organic revenue growth"" represents is nebulous, but it states that acquired companies are treated as acquired revenue for the first 12 months. Subsequent to the one-year period, only growth on top of that original revenue is included as organic revenue growth. This framework contains a critical flaw. The acquisitions 3D Systems has made have inflated its own organic growth rate above what it would be absent acquisitions. The acquisitions have expanded the company's geographic reach and sales channels for its own products. For instance, in its investor presentation regarding its $35 million acquisition of Rapidform, the company lists these two synergies as reasons for the acquisition.(Click to enlarge)And in its press release regarding the 2012 acquisition of Z Corporation and Vidar Systems for $135 million, it notes that the acquisition ""doubles its reseller coverage globally."" The acquisitions 3D Systems has made over the past five years have benefited sales of its own products - the growth in sales of these products are categorized as organic growth, even though the numbers are higher than they would be had the company not acquired clients and sales channels through its acquisitions for its own products. This is not a problem in and of itself - it merely points to the fact that even the company's own breakdown of total revenue growth versus organic revenue growth is not entirely useful to its investors because it is not a true reflection of the company's growth rate had it not completed acquisitions. It also points to the notion that if 3D Systems is expected to grow at its current rate into the future, it must also be expected to make further acquisitions.If neither backing out revenue from acquisitions, as some analysts have attempted, nor the company's own breakdown of revenue figures can illuminate 3D System's true performance, what can? Due to the regular and ongoing nature of 3D Systems' acquisitions, they should be understood as capital expenditures and subtracted from free cash flow calculations. Acquisitions are seen as an extraordinary event and receive accounting treatment as such under GAAP; yet for 3D Systems, acquisitions are an ordinary part of business. Currently, the company categorizes acquisition costs in the Statement of Cash Flows as an Investing Activity labeled ""Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed."" When the company makes an acquisition, it assigns assets and liabilities of the acquired company to various of its own balance sheet items, such as ""Property and Equipment"" and ""Intangible Assets."" Any excess amount of the acquisition price over the balance between assets and liabilities acquired is categorized on the balance sheet as ""Goodwill."" For instance, of the fair price paid for acquisitions in 2009, it allocated assets and liabilities as follows, with the excess of assets - liabilities labeled goodwill.(Click to enlarge)The problem with this method is that it distorts the reality of the company's financials. As a case study, one can look to 3D System's largest acquisition to date, the combined purchase of Z Corporation and Vidar Systems for $135 million. In its Q1 2012 10Q, the company listed the entire acquisition amount in its Statement of Cash Flows, under Investing Activities, further under ""Cash paid for acquisitions."" And, it began to include the entirety of revenue generated by the acquired companies on its Income Statement (the acquired companies had revenue of over $56 million in 2011, which is the only proxy for their revenue in 2012 that is public). Yet, the costs of the acquisition barely affected operating expenses. When the company breaks out acquisition expenses in its 2011 10K, it notes that only $3.6 million in acquisition and severance expenses made their way to the Income Statement.(Click to enlarge)Another $3 million has been expensed for all acquisitions in the first nine months of 2012, but acquisition costs for the time period totaled $282 million. And although the company amortizes intangible assets it has acquired such as patents, it does not amortize the goodwill it has on its balance sheet from acquisitions, which now totals over $220 million. The company instead checks for impairment using its own future projections, and has never impaired goodwill and recognized expense for it. This runs contrary to common sense, given that, for instance, it discontinued products of Z Corporation such as the Zbuilder printer after it acquired the company. The acquired company's revenue has fallen post-acquisition yet goodwill from the acquisition has not been impaired. All of this points to the fact that the way that 3D Systems currently accounts for its acquisitions stilts its revenue and income figures. Whereas the company immediately realizes all the beneficial effects of each acquisition (revenue and net income) into its own top line, it only recognizes a fraction of the total cost of the acquisitions as expenses and amortizes only a part of the total assets acquired over a 15-year time frame. If the company had used its own research and development to develop the technologies and patents it gained from acquisitions, they would have been expensed the year they were incurred. If the company used its own sales force to expand its client base, the costs would have been immediately expensed as Selling, General and Administrative. Instead, they had already been expensed by the acquired companies and did not affect 3D Systems' Income Statement.To gain an accurate understanding of the true free cash flows that the company generates, all acquisition costs should be treated as capital expenditures, and amortized over their useful lifetime as intangible assets. Most broadly defined, capital expenditures are expenditures that create future economic benefits. When 3D Systems acquires companies, it acquires their technologies, products, patents, employee talent, facilities, sales channels, and customer relationships. Each of these are assets that will create future value for 3D Systems. Therefore, each of them should be treated as a capital expenditure, and not just an investing cash flow. Once this adjustment is made to the free cash flows of 3D Systems, it becomes apparent that it has never generated positive free cash flows for investors; rather, it has consistently generated growingly negative free cash flow, as seen below. Using the company's own forecasts for the 2012 year and an extrapolation of the remaining blanks from the first nine months of 2012, the company produced negative cash flow of $131 million. In 2011, it generated negative cash flow of $60 million. A view of 3D Systems' inability to generate positive cash flow provides a more accurate view of the value the company has created for shareholders than simply its reported revenue and net income figures.(Click to enlarge)3D Systems' Acquisitions Destroy ValueThe rationale behind acquisitions is that they will create value by harnessing synergies between the merged companies. 3D Systems' management espouses this view. In press releases regarding its acquisitions, it notes that acquisitions have allowed it to harness revenue and cost synergies, augment its product portfolio, and expand its sales channels. Most importantly, it traces its competitive advantage to being able to ""offer a comprehensive toolbox... we sell our customers the right tool for the job."" Its acquisitions have expanded its portfolio of product offerings, which include computer-aided design software, 3D printers across all price points, materials for printers, and 3Dproparts, a service which insources 3D production for customers. Yet for all the promise of synergy, the majority of empirical studies have found that acquisitions tend to destroy value rather than create it. Although 3D System's acquisitions have generated significant revenue growth, they have not been accretive to value. In order to finance its more than $300 million in acquisitions, the company has used a number of equity share offerings and convertible debt issuances, specifically designated for acquisitions. As seen below, cash flows generated from financing activities have been the primary source of acquisition activity (cash flows from investing), not cash flows from operations.(Click to enlarge)When assessing the success of an acquisition strategy, it is not enough to simply look at revenue and income growth. The real question that must be asked is whether the cost of capital used to finance acquisitions is higher or lower than the return on capital used. The point is simply illustrated by the following scenario: if one were to borrow from a bank at 10% to invest in a new business that has a rate of return of 5%, the individual would be destroying value. The rate of return on capital invested, therefore, must be higher than the cost of the capital used. The following data is used to calculate 3D Systems' annual return on invested capital and weighted average cost of capital:(Click to enlarge)Since 3D Systems began its acquisition strategy in 2009, its return on invested capital has declined considerably - the return it generates on its investments has fallen as its rate of acquisitions has increased. All of this makes sense given that acquisitions face severe difficulties that are amplified as more acquisitions are made. Incorporating more and more acquisitions into a company becomes more and more difficult logistically and culturally. Return on invested capital is a conservative proxy of the company's return on acquisitions made given the assumption that the company runs its core businesses better than new acquisitions. This holds for 3D Systems, which has seen revenue and net income declines for acquisitions like Z Corporation, one of the only acquired companies for which it breaks out previous and current data. Weighted average cost of capital represents the return expected by investors in both its equity and debt, derived from the expected return on equity of DDD stock and its own convertible debt issuances.(Click to enlarge)As seen in the graph above, since 3D Systems began to utilize acquisitions to generate growth, its return on invested capital has been lower than the cost of capital it has used to finance its acquisitions. The gap between the two lines represents the value the company has destroyed since it began its acquisitions, or roughly $6.5 million. Although these acquisitions have buoyed the company's revenue and income figures, they have not created any real value for investors. The allure of the 3D printing story has led investors to value 3D Systems at a price-to-sales ratio of 10.69. By contrast, the price to sales ratio the company has paid for its disclosed acquisitions has ranged from 0.90 for Quickparts to a high of 5.90 for Renshape and Digitalis. It amounts to an arbitrage of price-to-sales ratios in which 3D Systems uses its own inflated valuation to issue equity to acquire private companies at more reasonable market values, thus delivering outsized revenue growth.ConclusionEvery growth stock depends on both a story and results that confirm that story. In a myopic sense, 3D Systems' impressive revenue and income growth have confirmed the tantalizing 3D printing story. Yet it would be Quixotic to believe that a logical cause and effect exists between the promise of the 3D printing industry and 3D Systems' own exaggerated growth. In the case of DDD, a company that has operated for more than 20 years saw its fortunes change only when it began an aggressive acquisition strategy in 2008. As it has delivered results through this strategy, investors have sent its stock soaring higher, enabling it to continue to make more acquisitions by issuing equity at inflated prices. Yet the strategy is not one that a sustainable growth model is made of. 3D Systems has spent the last five years picking higher and higher fruit from the acquisition tree, and in the near future it will no longer be able to pick any further or deliver revenue growth that exceeds the lofty expectations it has created for itself. Inevitably the market will realize the disconnect between the company and its story, and the company's value will tumble abruptly to a much more realistic level.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

HP is expanding its own 3D business, while Stratasys is looking to grow internationally. There is no true correlation between 3D-printing and ink jet/laser printing offered previously by Lexmark (NYSE:LXK) and HP. 3D-printing is a manufacturing process that will change the way suppliers meet customer demand. HP and Lexmark's printing business is about outputting text and images to paper or photo. The advent of social networking and mobile devices appears to be taking a toll on the consumption of print.HP has numerous problems in its other lines of businesses, but the printing unit is not helping. Shares in the last 3-months are down, while 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) shares are up:3D Systems forecasts the 3D printer industry to grow at a CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) of 17% between 2013 and 2019. By offering acceleration to design-to-manufacture timelines, the company will experience growing demand for its products.3D Systems has all the ingredients that make the company a healthy one. It offers solutions to the healthcare industry, it is growing its presence in the consumer space, and it is expanding Quickparts services globally. The company has a broad range of 3D printing products that price from $1,300 to $950,000 to address personal and production customers, respectively.Revenue Growth3D Systems reported healthy growth in the last nine months. Revenue growth was especially strong in healthcare (up 82%) and in printers and other products (up 91%). This was helped by 11 new products being commercialized in that time.Recurring revenue represented 66% of total revenue in the 9-month period:(Source: 3D Systems)Valuation3D Systems is not inexpensive: the company trades at a price to book ratio of 6.3 times.

1077781,25372,2012-12-21T13:54:49-05:00,,"Investors in 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) could benefit from a discussion of reflexivity in stock prices.Companies engaged in reflexive processes possess a two-way relationship between the stock price and fundamentals. The stock price itself can be viewed as a function of perception and fundamentals.When fundamentals improve, the perception gradually turns positive, and the stock price increases. Management can use positive perceptions to provide cash flow for growth either through stock sales or debt issuance, which eventually cause higher earnings. Thus, perceptions and the fundamentals mutually reinforce each other.However, eventually the positive bias gets ahead of itself, and the earnings cannot keep up with expectations. The disappointment causes the stock price to fall, which reduces management's ability to raise cash flow for growth, leading to a decrease in earnings, and, in turn, more disappointment. This speeds up the crash of such reflexive processes, creating a boom-bust phenomenon.First, let's establish that there is reflexivity at play in 3D Systems Corporation.The company has been running at a negative free cash flow. Though it does generate operating cash flow, it has been aggressively growing via acquisitions and capital investments. It funds these investments mostly by selling stock.3D Systems Corp Cash Flow Summary for Last 5 Quarters:(in millions of dollars, quantities irrelevant to the discussion removed)Because DDD has been selling at such a high multiple of earnings (the P/E ratio currently sits at 77), it is advantageous for the company to sell as much stock as possible, to generate cash for growth.However, it is now generating more than twice as much cash from stock sales as it is from operations. This means that any decrease to the stock price can have a dramatic effect on the company's future growth plans. On the other hand, if the stock continues to appreciate, the company can get even more aggressive with growth initiatives, and boost earnings further.Since there is a reflexive connection between stock price and the fundamentals of the company, and the connection is a positive correlation, it qualifies as a potential boom-bust process. George Soros outlined the stages of such processes in his 1985 book, The Alchemy of Finance. Shown here is a replica of his model:In stage 1, the trend is largely unrecognized. In stage 2, early investors begin to recognize the trend, and the trend and perception reinforce each other. Stage 3 is a test of the trend and price moves. If the trend survives such a test, the perception and trend both become so strong and mutually reinforcing that the normal rules of stock analysis no longer apply (Stage 4). This continues until the ""moment of truth"" when the excesses of the boom are recognized (Stage 5). Usually, there is a twilight period (Stage 6) before another event spurs the short-sellers to begin in earnest (Stage 7). Stage 8 is the acceleration of the bearish movement by reinforcing negative perceptions and negative fundamentals. This movement often overreacts to the downside, leading to a slow rise afterwards.As shown above, the stock price tends to increase faster than earnings during the boom phase (stages 2-4). In 3D Systems Corporation's case, the 2012 Q3 earnings increased 87% year-over-year, while the stock price increased 140% over the same period, providing some additional evidence of the relevance of this model.I believe stage 3 has already occurred. Grey Wolf Research's article, which made various allegations such as channel-stuffing and overstating the organic growth rates, provided the impetus for a ~20% decrease in stock price - a test of the upward trend.However, management responded, and the subsequent rise in stock price shows that the response was enough to allay investor fears. JPMorgan and Sterne Agee both upgraded the stock recently, and BB&T Capital initiated the stock at ""Buy"", confirming that perceptions are as strong as ever.The rapid rises in stock price, the high multiple, and the positive perceptions provide evidence that we are now in far-from-equilibrium territory (Stage 4). I have, accordingly, established a speculative long position in the stock, both to maximize the profit during the remainder of the boom phase, and to alert me to the turning point. The turning point will likely be a significant news item that calls attention to the fact that 3D printing is still a niche market, and that rollout of the technology will take longer than expected. Alternatively, the allegations made by Grey Wolf could be valid, and an investigation could be opened. If either of these occur, I will reverse my position and begin shorting.3D printing may yet revolutionize manufacturing. But boom-bust processes are normal in the introduction of revolutionary technologies. Gartner, an IT research firm, has used its ""Hype Cycle"" for years to describe emerging technologies:The stages of the cycle are self-explanatory. Gartner stated earlier this year that 3D printing had already reached the peak of inflated expectations. I happen to disagree; I think the upward trend still has legs.Disclosure: I am long DDD.

1096831,25120,2013-01-06T09:06:51-05:00,,"Shares of 3D Systems Corporation (DDD) started 2013 on a strong note. Shares of the three-dimensional content-to-print solutions company rose 10.3% so far this year after the company announced the acquisition of Geomagic.The Deal3D Systems Corporation announced that it has agreed to acquire Geomagic, a leading provider of 3D authoring solutions including design, sculpt and scan software tools used to create 3D content.Combined, 3D Systems and Geomagic have a stronger portfolio in the 3D platform and industry. The deal adds complementary products and technology and boost the global marketing coverage. CEO Abe Reichental commented on the deal:Both parties did not disclose any financial metrics regarding Geomagic's operating performance or a price tag of the deal. The deal is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings in the full year after the completion of the transaction. The acquisition is subject to normal closing conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013.Valuation3D Systems Corporation ended its third quarter with $183.9 million in cash and equivalents. The company operates with $131.2 million in short and long term debt, for a net cash position of roughly $52 million.For the first nine months of 2012, 3D Systems generated revenues of $252.1 million. The company net earned $28.0 million for the period, or $0.52 per diluted share. The company is on track to generate annual revenues of roughly $350 million, on which it could earn around $40 million.The market currently values 3D Systems at $3.36 billion, which values operating assets around $3.3 billion. This values the firm's operating assets at roughly 9.5 times annual revenues and roughly 80 times annual earnings. 3D Systems does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveShares of 3D Systems have seen a great year in 2012, amidst the hype about 3D solutions. Shares steadily rose throughout the year from $16 in January to the 50s in December. After the rally in the first days of 2013, shares are exchanging hands at $59 per share.Between 2009 and 2012, 3D Systems increased its annual revenues from $113 million to an estimated $350 million this year. The company expanded its profitability from a break-even level to an expected $40 million this year.Investment ThesisDespite the lack of information, investors in 3D Systems applaud the deal with Geomagic, sending shares to fresh all time highs. They have all the reasons to do so, because the company's string of acquisitions over the past years has driven topline growth. Over the past years, the company spent hundreds of millions on acquisitions, including the purchase of Z Corp in 2012 for approximately $135 million.In the first nine months of 2012 alone, 3D Systems raised $220 million by issuing more stock in order to finance this acquisition-driven growth. As shares kept rising, the company continued to issue more stock, increasing the total number of shares outstanding by roughly 10% over the past year alone.As such, acquisitions enable 3D Systems to report higher growth, which propels the share price even higher. The company uses this to issue more shares at elevated prices in order to make even more acquisitions. This makes the company's operating performance directly tied to the share price performance, as a setback in the share price automatically reduces the capability to acquire.Between 2000 and 2009, the company consolidated total revenues just North of $100 million. Revenues started exploding with the acquisition spree started in 2009. An excellent article from SeekingAlpha colleague Douglas W. House digs deeper in the acquisition strategy and the firm's questionable way of reporting organic growth.The sky-high valuation, the strong recent share price performance and questionable growth figures resulting from the acquisition strategy are reasons enough to stay on the sidelines. While the long term prospects for the 3D industry remain good, the valuation has gone too far ahead.At the same time, initiating a short position is difficult as well. The timing of a short position is key, given that the market can stay ""irrational"" for a longer time than you can stay solvent. For me, the momentum at the moment is too strong to initiate a short position at this point in time.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1038241,26971,2012-11-30T12:26:34-05:00,,"By Damion Rallis, Senior Research AssociateWhile the share price at 3D Systems Corporation (DDD) continues its steady and impressive climb - up more than 200% since last November - a closer look at the company's governance profile reveals several troubling indications that 3D Systems could be due for a reversal. Not only has the 3-D printing company been involved in a public dispute over its accounting and disclosure practices, but a significant uptick in recent insider sales by key members of its board of directors would suggest that 3D Systems' overall ""B"" ESG rating is at risk when taken in conjunction with two of our primary assessment models, the Accounting and Governance Risk Rating (AGR®) and our Litigation Risk Model.In the past few months, 3D Systems' relatively volatile share price has caused quite a bit of buzz in the investment community. At the end of August, the company's share price stood at about $44 but then dipped below $33 by the end of September, back up to above $45 at the beginning of November, below $38 a week before Thanksgiving, and then back over $46 just a day or two ago. So what's going on? It seems that 3D Systems is at war with a couple of analysts on Seeking Alpha. First there was an article on October 23 by Gray Wolf Research called, ""3D Systems: At the Peak of Inflated Expectations,"" and then one by Douglas W. House on November 12 titled, ""3D Systems: Has the Printer Jammed?"" In short, one of Gray Wolf's main points was that the company's organic growth rate was ""highly overstated"" while Mr. House, referencing Gray Wolf's research, made the case that management at 3D Systems was ""hiding something"" as it has failed to properly disclose key financial data on several of its recent acquisitions. The ""obfuscation"" was a result of the company's acquisition strategy in which it incorporates its acquisitions' revenues into its own and ultimately ""overstates [its] true growth rate.""At the time of Gray Wolf's article in October, 3D's share price had already been in a mini-slump since the end of August, so no story there, right? But on November 12 - the same day on which Mr. House's article fortified the arguments of Gray Wolf's research was released - 3D's share price opened at $46.19 and dipped below $37 before closing around $38 at the end of the week. As a result, these research articles led to vociferous cries from some in the investment community of ""slander"" and ""malicious allegations."" Specifically, the authors were accused of ""bear raids."" According to an article from Seeking Alpha, bear raids typically represent a trader or group of traders' attempt to force down the price of a stock, for gain or to cover a short position, and are done by spreading negative rumors about the target company, ultimately putting pressure on the share price. Not only were fellow investors unhinged, but so was 3D Systems. In an official press release only two days after Mr. House's article was posted, CEO Abraham Reichental of 3D Systems announced that it was ""aware of certain recent articles and their materially inaccurate and misleading conclusions."" It went on to say (after threatening legal action) that the articles were ""malicious, irresponsible and self-serving"" and that it looked forward to ""discussing, fact-checking and clarifying these inaccuracies for the benefit of our shareholders, customers and partners, who we believe have been irrevocably harmed by these articles.""A mere week after Mr. House's article, 3D Systems held a conference call to ""discuss, fact-check and clarify several materially inaccurate statements and conclusions made in recently published articles related to various matters including its calculation of growth, accounting methods and acquisition activities."" The company dedicated 40 slides specifically to refute the allegations, going point-by-point to cast doubt on the researchers' findings. Notably absent from the conference call (despite repeated attempts to be included) were Mr. House and a representative from Gray Wolf Research. 3D's counterstrike seems, for the short term at least, to be relatively effective, its share price having spiked from $39.03 on the day of its conference call to nearly $42 at the end of the same week. While we have no interest in getting involved in their contentious game of cat-and-mouse (you can read Mr. House's rebuttal from November 26 here), our research indicates that there might be validity to the detractors' assertions.GMI Ratings publishes Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR®) ratings on approximately 18,000 companies worldwide. These ratings reflect a broad spectrum of accounting irregularities and weaknesses in corporate governance statistically associated with an elevated risk of adverse events likely to cause precipitous contractions of equity value. Specifically, the AGR model reflects patterns and anomalies in the areas revenue recognition, expense recognition, asset-liability valuation, high-risk events and governance practice. AGR ratings have been extensively tested and validated as a predictive tool that can help market participants minimize their exposure to riskiest companies. For more information, visit the GMI Ratings web page on AGR analytics.3D Systems' AGR Rating was ""Average"" as of December 2009 with an overall score of 85 (updated quarterly, the AGR score ranges from 0 - 100, with lower scores representing greater risks). Since then, the company's AGR rating has consistently dropped and, as of December 2011, fell into the ""Aggressive"" category. Currently, 3D Systems Corporation continues to be rated as having ""Aggressive"" Accounting & Governance Risk (AGR). This places them in the 26th percentile among all companies in North America, indicating higher accounting and governance risk than 74% of companies.Similarly, GMI Ratings' Litigation Risk model - a projection of the probability of shareholder class action litigation - shows that 3D Systems' litigation risk continues to increase, having dropped from 46 in June 2010 to its current score of 4, meaning ""High Risk"" and placing them in the 4th percentile of all companies in North America, indicating higher shareholder class action litigation risk than 96% of all rated companies in this region.It is our AGR Rating, however, where the true intrigue lies. One area of concern is the company's aggressive acquisition strategy. Since the quarter ending in June 2010, 3D Systems has acquired four companies per fiscal quarter compared to an industry mean of about one acquisition per fiscal quarter. Comparably large numbers of mergers and acquisitions is a red flag for corporate governance issues. In other words, an acquisitive nature is a characteristic of some companies' strategies, and is inherently risky. Acquisitive companies sometimes buy non-viable companies in order to boost short-term revenues. Another area of concern regarding the company's sagging AGR rating is revenue recognition, where 3D Systems has been red flagged for Operating Revenue/Operating Expense. Large operating revenues are the critical ratio of potential revenue recognition issues. Because of the potential impact that Operating Revenue has on earnings, this line item is susceptible to potential earnings management. Since the three-month period ending in September 2010, 3D System's ratio of total revenue to total operating expenses has been consistently above the industry median.3D Systems' governance profile includes other examples of practices that not only fail to benefit its shareholders but also serve to reflect our worsening view of the company's long-term sustainability risk. As an example of our concern, the company's board of eight directors includes two company executives and four directors who have served for at least 13 years, including the chairs of two of the board's four standing committees. While we see the value in experience, it is increasingly difficult to consider directors independent after so many years of service. Long-tenured board members can often form relationships that may compromise their independence from management and therefore hinder their ability to provide effective oversight.A key area of concern is the company's Executive Committee, which includes the CEO and long-tenured directors Chairman Walter G. Loewenbaum and Kevin S. Moore. The Committee, whose principal responsibility is to function on behalf of the board when it is not in sessions to guide the company's strategic planning, met nine times in 2011, the same amount of meetings as the full board. This runs counter to the intended nature of an independent board of directors. As a means of comparison, the average Russell 3000 Executive Committee meets only 1.6 times per year, an indication that 3D System's Executive Committee holds considerable power. As an aside, the majority of Russell 3000 companies holding more than nine Executive Committee meetings are companies from the banking and financial sectors.Furthermore, two long-tenured directors (including Chairman Walter G. Loewenbaum) serve together on the board of Luminex Corporation, raising additional concerns about intra-board relationships that can compromise non-executive directors' ability to act individually and independently. Also, Audit Committee and Compensation Committee member Daniel S. Van Riper has been flagged for his service on the board of DOV Pharmaceutical, Inc., which was delisted due to a violation of exchange regulations. In addition, the company utilizes a plurality director election standard without a resignation policy which means that in uncontested elections directors could theoretically be elected with only one vote. Overall, these features call into question the board's ability to act as an effective counterbalance to management.A board composition of this nature may contribute to policies which can further damage shareholder interests. 3D Systems' executive compensation practices reflect this possibility. CEO Abraham Reichental received fiscal 2011 total summary compensation ($2,728,038) worth well over three times the median total summary compensation ($742,625) for the other named executive officers (NEOs). This raises concerns about internal pay equity. In addition, a significant portion (45%) of NEOs' annual incentive awards consists of the Compensation Committee's subjective evaluation of personal objectives. While certain objectives may be quantifiable in nature, discretionary elements can undermine the credibility and effectiveness of a well-structured incentive plan. In fact, despite failing to achieve both of the company's annual financial targets, the CEO was still able to receive a discretionary cash bonus of $450,000 for such unquantifiable achievements as ""the attention that he brought"" to completing acquisitions. Discretionary incentive bonuses of this nature undermine the integrity of a pay-for-performance compensation philosophy. Furthermore, the CEO's equity award valued at nearly $1.7 million consisted merely of restricted stock awards that vest simply over time without performance-contingent criteria. Equity awards should have performance-vesting features in order to assure proper alignment with company performance.Finally, the company's insider trading activity raises several red flags. Most notably, no 3D Systems insider has purchased stock since September 2010. Since then, however, insiders have dumped nearly 2.3 million shares valued at over $82 million. In fact, the CEO has sold 321,353 shares valued at $13,832,418 since the beginning of September while Chairman Loewenbaum has unloaded nearly 200,000 shares valued at nearly $8.6 million since the beginning of August. Once again, while we are loath to make assumptions based on a high amount of stock trades - there are any number of factors that could force an individual to liquidate his stockholdings - there is evidence that could suggest that insiders know something that we don't know, despite their loud protestations.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1049861,24389,2012-12-06T14:39:18-05:00,,"By Ahmed Ishtiaq3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) has shown remarkable growth over the past year. However, the stock price has gone up even faster than the EPS and revenue growth. At the moment, the market for 3D printing is growing rapidly and 3D Systems have the advantage of being an early mover. 3D Systems' stock is currently trading at incredibly high multiples, which makes one wonder whether it is wise to invest or not. As a result, we decided to perform a simple valuation based on different revenue growth assumptions. Let's look at the model.Model Assumptions:3D systems have recorded incredible growth in its revenues over the past two years. On average, the revenue has grown at 40% during the previous two years. We have assumed revenue growth of 15%-40% over the next four years, and 5% constant growth rate afterwards. However, we believe that a revenue growth of 25% will be appropriate for the company. As a result, we will only discuss in detail the model with 25% assumed growth in revenue. However, we will also list the prices from other models with different revenue growth estimates.As the scale of operations is increasing for the company, the cost of sales is coming down. At the end of 2010, the company had cost of sales at 54% of its total revenues. However, by the end of current year, the cost of sales will be less than 45% of the total revenues. We have assumed a declining cost of sales, 43% of total revenues in 2013 which will come down to 40% by 2017. In addition, we have assumed a growth rate of 10% per year in total operating expenses and a tax rate of 17%.ProForma Earnings (Based on 25% assumed revenue growth):According to our estimates, the company should be able to report earnings of over $5 per share by the end of 2016. Furthermore, we expect 3D systems to have solid margins.Valuation:For the valuation purposes, we have assumed a discount rate of 10%. 3D Systems have a strong history of revenue growth and a solid business model. Taking into account the strong position of the company, we believe a discount rate of 10% is justified.There are two conventional methods to calculate the terminal year value; multiple of terminal year earnings and a constant growth model. We have used the latter, and assumed a 5% constant growth rate after the high growth period of four years. We believe 3D Systems will be able to generate impressive growth figures after the hyper growth period. Furthermore, the terminal year earnings of $5.45 are discounted using the single stage growth model, where the earnings are first adjusted for constant growth and then discounted by the discount rate of 10%. The single stage growth model also adjusts discount rate for growth by deducting the terminal growth rate from the discount rate. Once the terminal year value is calculated; it is then discounted to reach at the present value. On the other hand, earnings before the terminal year are simply discounted to reach at the present value. Finally, the discounted earnings are added to the discounted terminal value to reach at the true value/fair value of the stock. According to our valuation model, 3D Systems should trade around $50. The stock is currently trading at a discount to its fair value.Expected Prices under Different Revenue Growth Assumptions:We calculated different prices for 3D Systems with the help of our model. We have tried to present a range of possible scenarios through these assumptions. The lowest level of assumed revenue growth is 15% while the highest is 40% per year. The table lists the prices under different revenue growth rates; however, we have kept the discount rate at 10% for all the scenarios.Revenue growth anywhere under 21% in the coming years will mean that the stock is currently overvalued. Based on 15% assumed growth, the stock should be trading at around $30. However, if the company is able to maintain the current revenue growth for the next four years; the stock price can also go over $100. We believe the revenue growth will be somewhere between these two extremes. As a result, we have focused on 25% revenue growth.Summary:3D printing is growing at an exceptional pace, and there is a lot of potential in the market. It is possible for 3D Systems to grow at remarkably high growth rates due to limited competition. At the moment, there is only one established competitor in the form of Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) for 3D systems. We believe if 3D systems can maintain revenue growth above 25% in the next four years, it will prove to be a solid investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: EfsInvestment is a team of analysts.

1050861,28511,2012-12-07T01:28:09-05:00,,"No technology threatens to upset the current model of production more than that of 3D printing. The company that emerges as the leader in this field will most likely not be the last, but it will blaze the path for others to follow and build businesses that will render so much of our current infrastructure obsolete.3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) IPO'd on the New York Stock Exchange in May, 2011 and immediately began implementing an aggressive expansion strategy by first acquiring Alibre Inc, a CAD software developer, for an undisclosed amount. This was followed by more acquisitions during the year, the most notable of which was Huntsman's stereo lithography line, its own competitor that manufactures 3D printers and print materials for $41 million. The company started 2012 with a bang by acquiring more competitors -- Z Corp and Vidar Systems for $135.5 million in January.So far, DDD has made 16 acquisitions since its listing 18 months ago while its stock has gone up by 145.6%. The total number of acquisitions in the company's life is 31. To finance further expansion, DDD is planning a $100 million share sale. Within a short time, DDD has emerged as the industry leader through its takeovers in its attempt to consolidate the 3D printing industry.In the last week of November, the DDD launched the ProJet 3500 HDMax and ProJet 3500 CPX Max professional printers, its latest to date. This caused its shares to surge by 12% in a single day. Meanwhile, the company has also developed its latest customized '3D printed hand brace devices' for use in musculoskeletal medicine and are expected to be launched in the second half of 2013. The device aims to significantly improve the experience of orthopedic patients or those suffering from other chronic conditions. It has also entered into a long term agreement with the Smithsonian Institute to provide 3D services and devices.Following in the footsteps of Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) business model that threatened the dominance of conventional big box store chains, such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), DDD is the latest in the disruptive technological chain driving a revolution, not at the distributor level but at the producer level. With Amazon, consumers can save their time and fuel by shopping from home, cross-shopping and outsourcing their travel costs to make their lives more efficient. Similarly through DDD, 3D printing will also offer cost and time savings while delivering superior products designed according to individual's needs. This concept is in its infancy but the implications are clear; providing consumers a way to buy a made-to-order leather jacket or - in the extreme -- a new organ.It is the logical step forward from the current business model whereby non-customized products are manufactured at one place and then shipped around the world. Many of the complaints of the modern political left's critique of capitalism stems from this obviously inefficient model which is an outgrowth of more than 100 years of another shibboleth of the left, central planning of the economy through fiscal and monetary policy. Currency and wage arbitrages are at the heart of the modern globalized production markets - known as globalization -- which were facilitated by cheap oil and exasperated by government management of money, prices and interest rates.In an age of $15-20 natural gas (per million BTU) being paid by most of the emerging world, especially Asia, and $110 per barrel oil, that model is breaking down. Throw in the admixture of the internet, mobile computing devices and 3D printing and we are exploring near the opposite pole of Henry Ford's decree that you can have any color Model-T you want as long as it's black. These increasing fuel costs-- which will only increase in the future as Asia and South America's demand per capita renders obsolete the old demand curves-- increase the prices consumer pay for products and we are close to reaching the tipping point where that level of service will be inadequate.Consumers are demanding things now. Nike (NYSE:NKE) now allows their customers to build their own sneakers. Shipping companies like FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and the airline industry are feeling these effects in their bottom lines and struggling to pass on costs to them. Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus are not selling anymore old-school 747's, but rather are taking massive orders from smaller, regional carriers like AirAsia and Lion Air for their more fuel-efficient planes. Unless and until we have a similar disruptive breakthrough in air travel like that implied by the Synergy Aircraft - which is a long way from being commercially interesting - the cost of air travel and air shipping will become prohibitive for a greater number of activities.The promise of 3-D printing is that it extends the beauty of the original Toyota Production System - known now as Kaizen Ordering or Lean Manufacturing-- which was efficient and flexible, capable of transmitting a consumer's desires directly to the factory floor. It all comes down to the higher opportunity cost for the buyer and entrepreneurial risk for the producer, and in my opinion, the conventional production practices are simply not sustainable in the long run. The push towards localized printing is a classic spontaneous mutation due to market forces.There are plenty of smaller private companies in 3D-printing such as Asiga, Buildatron, Essential Dynamics and Formlabs but DDD's main competition comes from Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS). Several innovations in this industry have come from these smaller players, such as Formlabs's cheaper alternative 3D printer. Other conventional printing giants such as HP (NYSE:HPQ), have failed to make a name for themselves in 3D printing. In fact, the struggling HP took a step backwards when it ended its manufacturing and distribution contract with Stratasys in August-2012 and its consumer imaging division, which once dominated the visual production end-user tools of the world is shrinking at a double-digit rate. Meanwhile, Stratasys is only getting bigger with the merger with Objet Ltd being finalized.Over the year, DDD's quarterly income has almost doubled while Stratasys's has fallen by 12% while their revenues have increased by 57.3% and 24.4% respectively. The stocks of both the companies have skyrocketed this year and at this stage will be very volatile. But, the market always heavily values the future potential on disruptive technology. All talk of a bubble is very pre-mature given the infancy of this industry.Nonetheless, the two companies are operating in an industry that seeks to transform the production process and has far reaching implications in almost every other sector. Forward thinking investors should be willing to take a small position in this sector.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1025261,22762,2012-11-23T05:25:17-05:00,,"By Romain Dillet3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has filed a lawsuit against both Formlabs and Kickstarter for patent infringement. Formlabs is the manufacturer of a low-cost 3D printer called the Form 1. Thanks to the stereolithography printing technique, the Form 1 can achieve professional grade 3D printing in a small hobbyist printer. It quickly became a Kickstarter success. Yet, in 1997 3D Systems patented stereolithography applications and now wants reparation from Formlabs and Kickstarter who promoted the printer.The Kickstarter fundraising campaign topped $1.4 million in pre-orders in just under a week, making it one of the notable successes of the platform. Formlabs ultimately raised $2,945,885. Kickstarter is financially involved as it takes a 5 percent cut on each campaign, according to the BBC.Instead of using traditional melting techniques, Formlabs has opted for the ""gold standard"" in 3D printing - stereolithography, a high-precision positioning system designed to solidify plastics. It allows you to use thin structures in your original 3D model and achieve a level of detail never seen in home 3D printing, especially for $2,299.Similarly priced competitors, such as MakerBots, use a more traditional melting technique that doesn't lead to the same rendering. On the other end of the spectrum, high-end competitors cost anywhere between $10,000 and $1 million. The Form 1 was the printer aiming at bridging the gap between those two categories.But 3D Systems carefully patented stereolithography when it comes to 3D printing. According to the company, its patent portfolio is well-known in the industry, and feigning ignorance won't be enough to defend the Form 1.When we initially covered Formlabs' Kickstarter success, the company claimed that it managed to keep costs low because a few patents had expired. Co-founder Maxim Lobovsky didn't state which patent exactly, but 3D Systems believes that Formlabs infringed claims 1 and 34 of U.S. Patent No. 5,597,520.Aside from direct patent infringement, 3D Systems claims that the crowd-funding campaign has caused ""immediate and irreparable injury and damage to 3D Systems"" by promoting the new printer.Formlabs and Kickstarter declined to comment.Original post"
1029061,24391,2012-11-26T17:00:17-05:00,,"On Monday, Nov. 12, I published an article about 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) that caused an unexpected stir. No one was more surprised than yours truly. I do not contribute many articles to Seeking Alpha and the ones that I have published have not garnered much attention. The day my article went live, I had only 87 followers. Even today, I have less than 200. I do not think this reflects the profile of a market mover, do you?The only reason that my article ruffled feathers is the drop of DDD's share price the day my article went live. The human mind constantly sees patterns and relationships, cause and effect, if you will, where none exist. Longs are always sensitive to atypical drops in their holdings. Most seem to expect their favorite stock to continue its upward trend unabated, especially during a bull run. When a countertrend move occurs, longs cast their net to find the villain. It always seems to involve some sort of conspiracy. Is it a true bear raid? Could the perpetrators be members of a stock pool similar to the ones that were commonplace in the 1920's (I doubt it; it is illegal now)? Could it be shadowy hedge funds, unscrupulous traders or malicious rumormongers? These are the convenient suspects.The reality is that, most of time, no one knows. As far as price behavior is concerned, the shorter the time frame, the more random the movement. A big move over a day or several days usually means next to nothing. This is the reason that I focus almost all of my attention on a stock's weekly chart. This mitigates much of the market's short-term noise.DDD's recent share price movement is entirely consistent with a stock that needs to rest after a run-up. No stock goes straight up on its way to its eventual price peak. On February 23, it broke out of a cup-with-a-handle base, clearing its $21.79 trigger on robust volume. This was a classic bullish breakout per Investors Business Daily (see reference at end of article). Its bull run peaked on August 30 reaching its initial high of $44.80, representing a healthy 106% gain.From a chartist's viewpoint, several characteristics of DDD's price behavior bear mentioning. First, the downward price movement began during the week of September 7. There were four consecutive down weeks on ever-increasing volume. Institutions and momentum traders were clearly exiting. This is typical. At the time of the first down day, DDD price was extended ~60% above its 10-week EMA. Research (IBD and others- see references at bottom) has shown that the maximum bull run price extension above this commonly used metric is ~50%. It was time for DDD's share price to take a breather. The downward movement began ~1 ½ months before Gray Wolf Research's article appeared and 2 months before mine was published.Another point to remember is that the market transitioned from ""confirmed uptrend"" to ""correction"" per IBD on October 10. Institutional money flow turned decidedly negative. Since 75% of stocks follow the market trend, most follow the indexes down. Very few can swim against the tide.Even considering the market's current weakness and the share price's well-earned rest, its bullish chart remains intact. Wednesday's last print of $41.41 is still 29% above the 10-week EMA. Its relative strength rating is 98, meaning that it is outperforming 98% of publicly traded shares.DDD's over-reaction to my article is telling. While the attention is flattering (I hardly consider myself a guru or market mover), any influence my article had on its share price movement is most certainly microscopic. The share price was over-extended, the market transitioned into a correction and the institutional money began its outflow two months before my article appeared. Case closed.DDD's paranoid behavior, epitomized by its November 19 tightly controlled non-interactive conference call and its heavy-handed attempts to get my article removed from SA, reveals a management team that feels threatened by its own information. All of my observations, perceptions and opinions have been gleaned from DDD's SEC documents, its website and its press releases. It is a self-inflicted conspiracy. I will be diplomatic and call the situation unusual.Under any other scenario, I would avoid a tit-for-tat dialogue. I regard it as sophomoric because it usually degrades into a circular argument without end. However, this set of circumstances is, indeed, special.I thought (silly me) that I would be given an opportunity to make a short statement and/or ask questions during the conference call. After all, was I not one of the two reasons the call was held? Despite pressing *1 until my finger ached, I was never afforded the opportunity. Does it not seem curious that only analysts were permitted to ask questions? I guess they put down their pompoms early enough to press *1 before anyone else. And how about the last analyst who, for some reason, is unknown? He did not even ask a question. He just parroted management's rhetoric. Methinks he might be getting a paycheck every two weeks from the finance department.So, considering management's aversion to speaking directly with me about the issues I raised in my article, I have no other reasonable alternative than to publish a follow on piece. I will readdress some of the issues I raised in my first article and respond to the information management presented in the November 19 conference call including the supplemental slides.The first issue is how DDD accounts for the revenue in its acquisitions. As you know, my opinion is that its method overstates its actual core business growth rate. Here is the information that Mr. Gregoire presented on Monday (slide #15) regarding its organic growth calculation methodology:Click to enlarge images.The top half shows how DDD's scheme works. It is very easy to see how acquired revenue transitions to organic one year after the acquisition date and how it affects its growth numbers. The bottom half is my contribution. The core business is actually growing at a constant 20%/year after backing out all of the acquisitions' revenue. This clearly shows the boosting effect of the acquired revenues. This is my point. This has been my point from the beginning.This does not mean, though, that DDD's scheme is wrong, underhanded or improper. It merely means that the true growth rate of the base business is overstated due to the inclusion of acquired revenues over time. This is how the mechanism works. There will be a time when this ""back out"" analysis will no longer be feasible. After another 2 - 4 years, the acquired businesses will have evolved too much to do it. However, today, it can.Why is this so important, then? If DDD's method is proper, what is the problem? There is no problem. The only reason that I believe it is important to identify the growth rate of its base business is to isolate the impact of its acquisitions. It is an interim step. Let us compare the impact of the different approaches to acquired revenue below:Since 2008, DDD's CAGR of its reported consolidated revenue is 26.4%. Backing out its disclosed acquired revenues yields a CAGR of 19.2% (annualized FY12). Backing out all of the acquired revenues per my method yields a CAGR of 16.2% (ZCorp/Vidar annualized).The 16.2% growth rate is greater than the 13.5% growth rate from the spreadsheet in my first article. This is because I assumed a growth rate in the acquired revenues in the first case and flat growth in this case. I believe that this is a fair and conservative assumption.Whether or not you use 16.2% or 19.2%, the conclusion is the same. Base business revenue is growing at a slower rate than consolidated revenue. Therefore, acquired revenue must be growing at a higher rate. Are the acquisitions themselves growing at a higher rate or is the higher rate a result of adding revenues per its acquired revenue methodology? As a group, there is no way to tell due to lack of disclosure. Out of the thirty transactions since 2009, only three are considered ""significant"" as far as disclosure is concerned. According to my calculations, revenues for two are declining (Provel, Quickparts) and one is flat (ZCorp/Vidar). According to management, ten acquisitions are immaterial to reported revenues so this leaves eighteen companies that could contribute a higher growth rate. Are revenues from this group growing at a higher rate than the base business? All eighteen are ""insignificant"" acquisitions yet they must be the source of all the growth. Does this make sense? I have to admit that I am unclear on this. More clarity from management would be helpful.This brings us to the private transactions issue. Seventeen acquisitions since 2009 are cash and stock deals. Of these, fifteen involve shares from undisclosed sources. Who provided the shares? No clarifying information can be found in the 10-K. To refresh our memory, here is the information from the 2011 10-K, page 43 (bold type mine):This clearly states that employee stock ownership schemes contributed to the financing activities of the company in 2010 and 2011. ""Cash flow from financing activities"" is the section of the 10-K where the company discloses the sources of capital that it used in its investment activities for the fiscal year, is it not? What was the role of the stock-based compensation proceeds and stock option exercise activity in DDD's investments in these two years?Mr. Gregoire stated in the conference call that the company fully discloses all issuances of acquisition-related stock and all option exercise activity. This information is in the Stockholder's Equity section on page F-6 in the 2011 10-K. I agree that the total amounts of the line items appear in the spreadsheet.Mr. Gregoire, however, does an effective job of side-stepping the question. What was the role of the $2.8M in stock-based compensation proceeds and the stock option exercise activity in FY2010 and FY2011? He offers no answer. The line items in the Equity section are generic. There is no detailed information pertaining to specific financing activities involving employee shares anywhere in the 10-K. He also declares that stock-based compensation and option proceeds are separate from acquisitions (slide 36). Normally, yes. This is not what the above information says, though. It clearly states that employees' stock and option exercising had roles in its financing activities. What was the nature of the roles? This needs explaining.Before I focus on the slides in the conference call, I want to address the over-riding issue that I have with DDD's SEC documents. The issue is obfuscation. It is systematic and pervasive in every 10-Q and 10-K I read. It has made my research effort laborious, time-consuming and frustrating. There is only one reason that a company does this. We all know what that reason is. I will now provide you with one exasperating example.DDD consummated the Digitalis/Renshape deal on 11/1/11. It paid ~$41M which was a generous 5.9 revenue multiple (41/7 = 5.9) based on the previous year's top line. Naturally, I wanted to know what the revenue figure was for the last two months of 2011. I found this statement on page 31:This is the only reference to Renshape's performance numbers in the entire 10-K. So what is the revenue number? It is impossible to tell is it not? An answer can be derived, though, using algebra. Here is the math:.52 x $70.6M = $36.7M$36.7M = .53x$69.2M = x$70.6M - 69.2M = $1.4MWhy does DDD not just disclose the revenue number? Why must the reader derive the answer? This kind of egregious obfuscation permeates DDD's SEC documents. It is everywhere.He Said. They Said. He Said.This brings us to the final section. As I stated earlier, I find this process rather juvenile. However, since some observers will perceive a non-response as an admission of guilt, I will respond to DDD's responses from the conference call.1.

Does this not tell you something?My perceptions, observations and opinions that I have expressed herein and in my first article remain intact. My points are clear, concise and supported by examples. My questions to management remain unanswered. My position stands tall.In closing, I have a proposal for DDD management. Let us schedule another conference call. This time, however, I will be the only person permitted to ask questions. All other participants will be in a ""listen only"" mode. This will be a superb opportunity for DDD to discredit me once and for all.But won't this be an unnecessary expense? Maybe. I propose an alternative. I will call Mr. Reichental directly in Rock Hill. He and his management team can put me on speaker as I ask them my questions. The only proviso I have is that I may publish an article detailing our discussion. The cost will be minimal.

1022161,24389,2012-11-20T19:45:26-05:00,,"By: Ahmed Ishtiaq3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) operates through subsidiaries in the United States, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. The Company provides 3D content-to-print solutions including 3D printers, print materials and on-demand custom parts services for professionals and consumers. It also provides creative content development and design productivity tools. Its customers include manufacturers of automotive, aerospace, computer, electronic, medical and consumer products in more than 80 countries. Currently, the company has the largest portfolio of 3D printers in additive manufacturing and a growing on-demand custom parts manufacturing business.Stock Profile:The stock has had an exceptional rise since the start of the year. Just at the beginning of 2012, 3D Systems' stock was trading around $15. However, during the year, the stock has gone up to around $42. Over the past week, the stock took a dip and lost about 17% of its value. However, the stock has recovered almost all of the value it lost and currently trades above $41. Release of the first-ever three dimensional (3D) printer for consumers in January this year was the catalyst for 3D systems.Financial Highlights:3D systems have shown exceptional revenue growth over the past three years. At the end of 2009, the company generated $113 million in sales, which went up to $230 million by the end of last year. In the trailing twelve months, 3D Systems has generated $322 million in revenues. Gross profit margin for the company has also demonstrated an impressive trend. Over the past five years, gross profit margin has gone up from 40% to 47%. In addition, the operating profit margin has increased substantially. Five years ago, the company faced operating losses of 3.28%. However, by the end of the previous year, the operating profit margin for the company had gone up to 15.15%. 3D systems generated $0.71 per share at the end of last year and $0.68 in the trailing twelve months. The company has a fairly strong balance sheet with long term-debt of $131 million.Recently, the company has been splashing the cash on acquisitions; as a result, the cash reserves are low for 3D systems. For the most recent quarter, the company reported revenues of $90.5 million, a 57% increase over the third quarter of 2011. In addition, the company further improved its margins through higher revenues from printers and materials. For the third quarter, gross profit grew 69% over the third quarter of 2011 and currently stands at 51.8%.Furthermore, cash generating capabilities of the company have improved incredibly over the past three years. 3D Systems generated $28 million in cash flows from operations during 2011. However, in the past twelve months, the company has generated $53 million in cash from operating activities. Cash spent on acquisitions has been the biggest component for the company in the trailing twelve months. 3D Systems spent $196 million in the last twelve months on acquisitions. The company used cash reserves along with the funds raised through $107 million worth of stock issue.Business Model:The company has a very strong business model, which will ensure strong growth in the years to come. It generates the biggest portion of its revenues from its services segment. 3D Systems is not dependent on printer sales. The company generates more revenues from materials than the sales of printers. Usually, customers end up spending more on materials than printers. As a result, each printer sold starts a revenue stream for the company, which adds significantly more than the printer to its revenues.3D Systems generates the most money from its services segment, which provides not only maintenance and warranty services, but on-demand parts printing. The company can follow giants like IBM (NYSE:IBM) and make services segment ""the most important"" part of the company.Competition:There are only two players in the 3D printing arena at the moment, and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) is the only competitor for 3D systems.Source: Morningstar.comCompanies operating in the 3D printing sector have high multiples due to the expected future growth in the sector. However, 3D Systems have better multiples than its direct competitor, Stratasys. In addition, the company has better margins. 3D systems has first mover advantage over Stratasys in the personal 3D printing market, and it can carve out a significant portion of the market share.Summary:3D printing is still in the growth stage, and the experts believe the growth will be around 16% for the next five years. Analysts believe that 3D Systems will follow the industry growth and get a lion's share of this market. The company has demonstrated remarkable growth in earnings and increased its current year revenue estimates over $345 million. The fall in the stock price was temporary, which has reversed in the last three days. I believe there are massive growth opportunities for the company. 3D Systems will continue its rise and prove to be an exceptional investment in the long term.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: EfsInvestment is a team of analysts.

1017521,38561,2012-11-19T09:10:24-05:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has been the target of two bear raid attacks recently. For those of you who do not know, a ""bear raid"" is a trader or group of traders' attempt to force down the price of a stock, for gain or to cover a short position. Bear raids are done by spreading negative rumors about the target company, putting pressure on the share price. I took the time and emailed Investor Relations at 3D Systems about these shadowy claims made by Douglas D. House and Gray Wolf Research. The President of 3D Systems has come out with an official statement and is calling for a conference call to put an end to this bear raid.Now that we have company denial of these malicious allegations, let us remind ourselves using real numbers why 3D Systems has recently been ranked #1 in the IBD 50 (Investors Business Daily), #1 in the StockTwits50, upgraded by Piper Jaffray to ""overweight"" with a target price of $55, and most importantly why this company deserves a place in your portfolio or IRA.Let us review some of the fundamentals.RevenueHere is a look at the revenue the past 4 years. We see a company that is emerging out of the most recent recession with money coming in the door, not out, but what about 2012? This has been a rough year for a lot of companies because of the European crisis, Presidential Election, and the looming Fiscal Cliff. Let us take a look and see how ""DDD"" has navigated through this year so far.This year, total revenue reported to date is around $252 Million. That is 9% greater than all of 2011, and we still have the 4th quarter to consider. In 2011, Q4 represented 30.3% of its total revenue for the year. This shows solid organic and acquisition based growth. So, where is the revenue coming from? Is the company globally diversified? What does the net income look like? Are 3D Systems' profit margins improving? I will show you the numbers, and let you decide.Here is a look at where all the revenue is coming from. DDD has three main streams: Selling Printers, Selling Materials (ink), and Services. The actual figures are below.The Quarter by Quarter growth is shown in the table above; the 3rd quarter reveals an interesting divergence. The Q3 printer sales are significantly higher than the previous quarter. This is the most meaningful sales figure of all; the other two classes are dependent on printer sales. Without selling more 3D printers, 3D Systems cannot truly grow.If there is one specific stream of revenue symbolic of the organic growth within a 3D printing company, it would be its ability to spread these printers across the world. How well is DDD doing that? See below.The chart above shows DDD's revenue from different parts of the world. The US market seems to be the largest contributor for 3D printing; however, the most interesting takeaway from this chart is the growth rate in Asia and Germany. These segments are joining the 3D printing revolution in a big way and I expect to see an even greater impact from them in the future.Profit Margins and Net IncomeNow that the revenue has been broken down and explained, time to see if 3D Systems management is managing their company correctly. Net Income and Profit Margins are the good gauges of management doing their job and rewarding shareholders' investments with increasing returns. See below:Here we have the recap of the last 4 years of Net Income. It seems evident that the company really turned itself around in 2010, not only increasing its margins by 1,289%, but also by increasing its Net Income by 1,800%. 3D printing is still just beginning to be recognized by the public and will surely have many years to come of strong growth. So, what about 2012? (See below)Here we are in 2012: Net Income is still on the rise, maybe not at the levels of 2010, but it is definitely growing at a strong pace. I for one am very pleased with Net Income growth of 36% and 62% in Q2 and Q3 respectively.AcquisitionsA business like 3D printing is exciting, but it is important to make sure that the company is competitive in terms of hardware as well as software. The model DDD has taken on is that of Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO). As of March 2011, Cisco has acquired 148 companies. Cisco's road to world dominance was not paved by massive R&D budgets, but by acquiring the greatest minds in the industry and having them work together. Instead of focusing a large sum of capital to organic R&D, DDD has chosen to invest in entrepreneurs and successful companies of the 3D printing industry all over the world.In Q1 of 2012, DDD completed the acquisitions of 2 companies: Z Corporation and Vidar Systems.In Q2 of 2012, DDD completed the acquisition of 3 companies in the 3D printing field: Fresh Fiber BV, My Robot Nation, and Paramount Industries.In Q3 of 2012, DDD completed the acquisition of 3 companies to further its growth internationally and increase its software and patent base. Viztu Technologies, The Innovative Modelmakers B.V., and INUS Technology, Inc. have been added to the 3D Systems.ConclusionIn today's world, where information is published so quickly and reactions in the market are so volatile, we must really take into consideration the credibility of authors, and perhaps before pushing that sell button, stop and do some studying first. If you do, you will come to the same realization as I did. 3D Systems is a market leader in a disruptive and ultimately very important technological advancement for mankind. Even though the overall market is in bad shape, I am sure this company will rise up to achieve its real potential. I am a strong believer in fundamentals guided by technical analysis, and in the end a company that is making money is better than one that is not, and should be valued and priced as such.Disclosure: I am long DDD.

964481,20568,2012-10-31T08:27:28-04:00,,"3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD) reported impressive third quarter results last week, including a  positive earnings surprise of 15.4% and a raised fiscal year 2012  guidance. This Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) 3D printers company has beaten the  Zacks Consensus Estimate in 3 out of the last 4 quarters with a positive  surprise of 34.4%, and has a  long-term projected growth rate of 17.6%.Impressive 3Q for 3DOn October 25, 3D Systems reported third quarter earnings per share that  jumped 82.6% year over year to 30 cents, primarily on the back of  better-than-expected revenue growth and strong margin expansion.Revenue surged 57.3% from the year-ago quarter to $90.5 million, driven  by a 79.1% surge in product sales and a 27.5% growth in services.The operating margin expanded 510 basis points (“bps”) in the reported  quarter, primarily due to a 160 bps contraction in operating expenses as  a percentage of revenue, as well as a higher gross margin base (up 350  bps).3D Systems ended the quarter with a cash balance of $184.0 million.AcquisitionsAcquisitions have been an integral part of 3D Systems’ growth story.  Most recently, it announced back-to-back acquisitions of the  Netherlands-based The Innovative Modelmakers B.V. and South Korea-based  INUS Technology Inc. (developer of Rapidform). In the recently-concluded  third quarter, the company acquired Viztu Technologies, Inc., a  developer of online platform Hypr3D.Outlook Revised Upward3D Systems raised its fiscal year outlook and now expects revenue  between $345.0 million and $365.0 million, versus the prior guidance of  $330.0 million to $360.0 million. Earnings are projected at $1.20 to  $1.30 per share, instead of $1.00 - $1.25.At the beginning of the fourth quarter, the company had a strong backlog of $9.3 million.Earnings Momentum Moves HigherThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2012 is at $1.08 per share, which is up  nearly 6% in the past 7 days. For 2013, the Zacks Consensus Estimate  has climbed 2.3% to $1.32 over the last 30 days, reflecting 29.0%  earnings growth.Reasonable ValuationCurrently, 3D Systems is trading at a significant premium to most of its  peers on a forward P/E basis. However, its strong earnings growth  expectation of 17.6% over the next five years compares favorably with  the peer group average of 9.3%, indicating room for further significant  expansion. Moreover, its PEG ratio of 2.3 is lower than the peer group  average of 2.7.Historically, share prices have shown positive correlation to earnings  growth. The uptrend in the 2012 earnings estimate should encourage  investors as the stock is likely to follow the trend.3D Systems Corp manufactures 3D printers, print materials and custom  parts to its customers. The company also develops creative content  development and design productivity tools. The company operates in North  America, Europe and the Asia-pacific region. In fiscal year 2011,  international operations contributed 49% of the total revenue.Read the full analyst report on DDD (e-mail registration required)."

Once in production, manufacturers can change product specifications literally on the fly. Retooling or setup costs? Forget 'em. Mass customization is truly at hand. The flexibility and nimbleness that this technology offers producers is truly profound. The Economist calls it ""transformative."" It represents a new paradigm in manufacturing.I agree with this assessment of 3D printing's potential. My bullish opinion has only gotten stronger since I wrote an article on the subject back in March, 2011. It is truly a game changer.The advantages are so great that rapid market adoption is as certain as higher taxes in Obama's second term. Wohlers Associates, a leading consulting firm in the industry, states that the annual growth rate is approaching 30%. Every article I read says the same thing. The 3D printing tsunami is going to overwhelm all alternative methods for low-to-medium production volumes. I suspect that printer makers will have to work overtime to keep up with demand.Anyone who has at least a cursory knowledge of 3D printing knows that Stratasys (SSYS) and 3D Systems (DDD) are leaders in the field. The latter firm's performance over the past several years has been extraordinary.Sales are growing at ~50%, earnings ~75%, common shares have skyrocketed from a low of $1.88 in March, 2009, to a high of $46.92 on November 9. Mutual fund ownership has increased from 162 to 238 over the last four quarters. Per Investors Business Daily, consensus FY12 earnings growth is projected to be 68% and FY13's 29%. On October 25, DDD announced record results and increased its FY12 guidance.In the IBD database, DDD sports a stellar EPS rating of 98, a composite rating of 99 (highest possible), an ""A"" timeliness rating, an ""A"" institutional sponsorship rating and a ""B"" accumulation/distribution rating (net buying). DDD's industry group is also a leader, sporting a 98 rating. Its group, Machinery - Materials Handling/Automation currently ranks 4th out of 197 groups. My heart is racing as I type this.You can imagine how dismayed I was when, on October 23, I read Gray Wolf Research's article asserting that DDD's extraordinary growth rate is not extraordinary at all. Wolf claims that management overstates its numbers by employing dodgy accounting vis-à-vis its numerous acquisitions. Sounds serious.This is Wolf Research's first contribution to SA. It literally dropped a bomb in the middle of a scrum of backslapping and high five's. Who do these guys think they are? They must have cantaloupe-size brass balls to publish a negative article just as the celebration reaches a fever pitch. Since I always pay close attention to negative articles, though, I decided to investigate.I reviewed DDD's most recent 10-Q. I noticed that the company purchased Z Corp and Vidar Corporation in January of this year. Z Corp, based in Burlington, MA, manufactures 3D printers that print in various colors. Vidar, based in Herndon, VA, manufactures analog-to-digital film scanners for the healthcare industry. They are entirely separate businesses. DDD, however, combines the two companies in its reporting. It does not disclose much and what little is there has to be massaged a bit to clarify a couple of scant revenue numbers. Why is this?The only reason I can surmise is that management is hiding something. Obfuscation is an irresistible siren song for me so I decided to look closely at what DDD is doing. What did I find?Gray Wolf Research is right.Acquisition Analysis3D Systems' serial acquisition behavior began in 2009. Its financial performance has ramped up in perfect lockstep with its ""grow-by-acquisition"" behavior. It is a hockey stick. Here are DDD's operating results for the most recent thirteen fiscal years:Now here are the growth rates:This spreadsheet tells the story is stark detail. DDD's average annual revenue grew only 3% in its pre-acquisition period (FY00 - FY08). Also notable is that COGS and operating expenses grew faster than revenues and gross profit hardly grew at all. If these trends continued, well...The ""stimulating"" effect of its acquisitions becomes apparent when the calculation period includes all the completed FY's (00 - 11). Now revenue growth averages 7% (almost in line with GP growth) and operating income growth expands to ~10%. Including FY12 (annualized) further improves the numbers.When we focus on the acquisition period, however, we see the true steepness of the hockey stick. Using FY08 as the base year (the acquisitions began FY09) and calculating the growth rates through FY11, average annual revenue jumps up  to ~18% and operating income to almost  99%. If we include FY12 (annualized) the numbers increase again. Revenue expands  to ~25%, GP to ~32% while operating income eases a bit to ~87%.I have heard of acquisition synergies  before, but this is truly extraordinary. Is the 3D printing market growing  exponentially? Bullish organic growth rarely explains a turnaround this  dramatic. DDD's acquisitions must be jet-fueled. Let's take a closer look. Here  is a summary of its acquisitions through Q3'12:When DDD buys a company, it immediately incorporates the acquisition's revenues into its own. This is how the CFO, Damon Gregoire, explained it in DDD's Q3 earnings call:What he is saying is that DDD excludes the acquired firm's revenues prior to the acquisition date. The acquired revenue ""grows"" from zero on the date it is bought. The Z Corp/Vidar acquisition exemplifies the impact of this scheme.DDD purchased both firms in early January of this year. It made this disclosure on p19 of its most recent 10-Q (bold type mine): Revenue for Z Corp and Vidar for the third quarter of 2012 was $13.3 million and, after taking into account the integration and severance costs, the operating loss for Z Corp and Vidar was $2.2 million. On p25, it discloses: For the first nine months of 2012, Z Corp and Vidar contributed $40.2 million of revenue. For the first nine months of 2011, Z Corp and Vidar had revenue of $40.8 million. The business is flat. Growth is zero. DDD, though, added $40.2M to its 2012 revenue number and counted it as ""growth"".This overstates DDD's true growth rate. Through Q3, it posted total revenues of $252.1M representing yoy growth of 57%. If the Z Corp/Vidar revenues are backed out, then the total revenues are $211.9M. This reduces the yoy growth rate to 32%. This single acquisition accounts for a whopping 25% of DDD's stated revenue growth (57 - 32). I am not declaring that DDD's reporting is inconsistent with GAAP. I am simply stating the obvious, that DDD is overstating its true growth rate.Clearly, we need to back out the acquisitions' numbers to ferret out DDD's actual organic growth rate. Sadly, this cannot be done based on the information in the 10-K's. DDD rarely discloses its acquisitions' revenues or much else of value in its annual reports. What minimal information it does disclose is obfuscatory. This is not an issue about GAAP & non-GAAP. It is about transparency and full disclosure. Here's what it stated about Renshape/Digitalis and Quickparts (2011 10-K, pF-19):Why does DDD not disclose the ""if"" revenue numbers? Why do I have to use arithmetic to find out? Doing my best to decipher the code, I think Quickparts rest-of-2011 revenue is $233,612 - 230,423 = $3,189. Its full year 2011 revenue is, therefore, $27.3. Revenue for 2010 would have been $45.3 (230.4 - 185.1). The business is declining.Revenue for Renshape/Digitalis, as you can see, was not disclosed at all in the 10-K. 2010's top line of $7M was gleaned from the Huntsman press release announcing the deal (DDD also disclosed it in its press release).The Provel disclosure is presented the same way as Quickparts. Per the 2011 10-K:Provel S.r.l., the only significant acquisition in 2010, has been recorded in the Services category of the Company's consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. Revenue for Provel for 2010 was $1,117 and operating income was $257. This is the ""acquired"" growth for the last three quarters of 2010.If Provel had been included in the Company's results of operations since January 1, 2009, the consolidated revenue for 2010 and 2009 would have been $163,965 and $119,005, respectively. Net income would have been $20,056 and $1,214 for 2010 and 2009.Again, deciphering the code, 2010's revenue should be $5.2M ((164 - 159.9) + 1.1) while 2009's revenue should be $6.2M (119 - 112.8). The business is declining.Of the 32 companies that it has bought since 2009 (through Q3'12), DDD only discloses revenue and operating results for three transactions (ZCorp/Vidar, Quickparts, Provel). The company refers to these as ""significant"" in terms of SEC disclosure rules. The rest are ""insignificant"". This means that they reside outside of SEC disclosure requirements.Attempting to consolidate all the acquisitions' revenues for purposes of determining how DDD's base business is performing is futile. There is no way. However, after carefully scrutinizing the past two 10-K's I finally found, in a single sentence in each document, the data I need to complete the analysis. On page 31 of the 2011 10-K, DDD discloses that $32.1M of on-demand parts revenue was acquired. The comparable sentence in the 2010 10-K (p28) discloses $10.3M. Although DDD never discloses revenues for its 2009 acquisitions (if the disclosure exists, I could not find it), I am still able to back out the rest of acquired revenues so a clear picture of DDD's base business growth can be seen.The revised numbers look like this:Seventeen of the 30 (57%) transactions are cash and stock deals. Here is how it describes the 3dStudio transaction (2011 10-K, pF-17) (bold type mine):All of the disclosures of the seventeen cash and stock deals contain the bold type sentence. What is the nature of the private transactions? I found these disclosures in the 2011 10-K (p43)(bold type mine):This implies that members of the executive team's personal stock holdings were part of the acquisition activity to the tune of $7.7M (2.8 + 4.9). This represents 97% of the stock paid in the ten stock-and-cash transactions in 2010 and 2011. Again, I am sure that the disclosure is consistent with GAAP, but it needs further explaining, especially 2010.There is more. Here are the acquired assets for the past three FY's:Intangibles in 2009 appear typical. In 2010 and 2011, though, the line item balloons. Clearly, these are valuable intangibles. Let us take a closer look at the components:Apparently, this spreadsheet does not necessarily reflect the acquired assets listed above since it is cumulative. Nevertheless, the first noteworthy item is the size of ""customer relationships"". $31.2M represents 58% of 2011's net intangibles ex goodwill. The goodwill acquired in 2011 was $49,297. This represents an extraordinary percentage of total intangibles. Goodwill is the amount of money above the book value of the acquired assets that the buyer must spend to close the deal. It goes right into the owner's pocket. Goodwill is merely a way to account for the money. ""Customer relationships"" is a nebulous catchall term not unlike goodwill. In essence, it is a plug because there is no way to quantitate the value of a ""relationship"". It is a judgment call.In my opinion, it looks like what DDD is really buying is customers.Market ForcesThe conclusions I present henceforward are purely my opinion based on a synthesis of publicly available information.The industrial 3D printing market is still, by and large, a rapid prototyping market, in my view. It is nearly saturated. The demand for large ticket printers has been declining for some years. In an effort to maintain its unit growth, DDD has had to expand into the small volume user universe. Here is a statement from its 2003 10-K (bold type mine):The next year, DDD began including a line item called ""Price/Mix"" in its disclosures on sales by product and sales by region (see income statement spreadsheet, last line). DDD's lawyers state that this is per an SEC mandate. I checked Stratasys' most recent 10-Q and did not see a comparable line item anywhere in the document. I do not see why this matters, though. Prior to 2004, the line item did not exist. That is what matters. It looks like a reconciliation-type entry that management uses to isolate ASP and product mix variances with its business plan. The amount vacillated between positive and negative for several years but then turned negative in 2009. One way to interpret this is that the market demand has permanently shifted to smaller, less expensive printers aided and abetted by intense competition between printer makers.DDD's growth strategy prior to 2010 was:*Improving our customers' bottom line*Developing significant product applications*Expanding our range of customer services*Accelerating new product development*Optimizing cash flow and supply chain*Creating a performance-based ethical culture*Developing people and opportunitiesThe first three bullets are clearly customer development-type initiatives intended to maximize the utilization and ROI per user. The fourth bullet is the only one that can be construed as aimed at market expansion.In 2010, its growth strategy changed to the following:*Build our global parts services*Accelerate 3D printer penetration*Grow healthcare solutions revenue*Build 3D consumer content products and services(3D authoring solutions was added in Q3, 2012)All the bullets now reinforce the company's focus on market expansion. In other words, find more customers who will at least pay for a printing service and establish mindshare in non-traditional areas (e.g., consumer, healthcare). There is not enough growth potential in its core markets so it has to venture out into new areas. This explains DDD's move into services.A telling example of the difficulty it faces in selling its higher-priced offerings is how the ""Price/mix"" line item has ballooned up to $84.5M through Q3, 2012 versus $3.5M in 2011. The increase is most certainly due to Z Corp. Here is how Mr. Reichental responded to a question about printer sales in its Q2 earnings call (bold type mine):Z Corp and Vidar were acquired in January. The next quarter, revenue increased 25% yoy. This does not make sense. Revenues for both companies through Q3'12 were $40.2M versus $40.8M for the previous period. Growth was flat. How did DDD do this? Did it ship a Z Corp printer to all non-Z Corp resellers for demonstration purposes like it did with the ProJet 3000 to Z Corp resellers? I do not see a disclosure on this issue. He then states that the ability to sell its products through the combined channel resulted in ""doubling the units altogether"". There is clearly some double talk in his response. How could DDD turn on the new business so quickly? How could the ""Price/mix"" line item balloon 24-fold soon after acquiring two companies with flat growth? It assumed only $2.4M in finished goods inventory from the two companies. How did the Price/mix figure skyrocket to $84.5M? This strains credulity. A large number of printers were apparently shipped somewhere. Who bought them?Cube: The Savior?Consistent with the fourth bullet of its growth strategy, the company launched Cube in May of this year. This printer, along with the Cubify website, is DDD's flagship offering in its initiative to develop a consumer/professional 3D printing market. This is a market development strategy. The profits are further downstream because the real money is not made until satisfied Cube users upgrade to a more sophisticated and expensive 3D printer. Until then, the objective is to get as many units in the field as possible and try not to lose too much money. This is why the company sells it for a price-leading $1,299.Cubify's homepage imagery clearly reflects a consumer orientation. Pictures of guitars, rings, toys and trinkets abound. I will be surprised if Cube is not in this year's Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog. DDD is positioning Cube as a toy. It is an expensive one, but a toy nonetheless.There is only one problem with this positioning strategy: the real customer is not the consumer. It is the entrepreneur. No consumer is going to upgrade to a professional-level printer. But won't consumers spend tons of money on ABS plastic cartridges? I doubt it. Once the initial enthusiasm wanes, many of the units will end up in the garage. Here is an example of the cost:Let's assume that a buyer purchases seven print cartridges with the Cube, enabling him to realize the maximum discount of $6 ($44/cartridge). The total pre-tax outlay is: $1,607. The maximum number of objects that can be printed per cartridge is ~15, so the total potential printable objects will be ~105. This is enough volume to keep the consumer busy for months. The fully burdened cost is ~$15/object. This is expensive for plastic rings and trinkets. After one year, the garage or attic will be Cube's domicile.Still not convinced? Let the market decide. If a product is well-positioned, timely and offers real value for its price, then its uptake should be robust. When Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook at Harvard, 80% of the student body signed up by the end of the first week. That's uptake. When Apple launches a new iPhone, customers line up the night before and the shelves are bare for the first 30 days. That's uptake. So how is Cube doing since its May launch? Here is what Mr. Reichental said in the Q2 earnings call:This is a superb example of executive spin. In one breath, he states that they are blowing it out. In the next breath, he says that the revenue will be immaterial for the rest of the year. Allow me to translate: ""we didn't expect to do diddly squat with Cube this year. Instead, we did the high end of diddly squat in units and triple diddly squat in consumables"". Cube may, indeed, be profitable at this snapshot in time. I do not argue this point. I am focused on uptake.Methinks the uptake is modest.Entrepreneurs, though, are keen to gain access to a quality 3D printer. I would wager that most or all of the buyers thus far are in this group. Cube, though, is not robust enough to satisfy them and thus not robust enough to serve as an effective entry product that leads to an eventual upgrade. In the forum section of Cubify, for example, users are already complaining about Cube's poor resolution. This is a clear message that users' needs are beyond what Cube delivers.I spoke with Cube customer service about this issue. The representative told me that the seams between the layers of plastic feel similar to joints of LEGO bricks. This is acceptable for rings and trinkets, but not for more sophisticated applications. The representative also told me that they make a point of telling prospective buyers that they need to have appropriate expectations about Cube's capabilities.Cube is going to disappoint. It does not offer enough to entice a large number of entrepreneurs to invest and eventually upgrade. The more realistic strategy, in my view, would be to offer a low cost way for entrepreneurs to obtain a ProJet 1500 (or comparable model). Equipment makers in the medical diagnostics field, for example, have offered rental programs for years. Users pay an inflated price for consumables that includes equipment amortization and service. A rental-type scheme would enable DDD to protect its proprietary materials stream and would allow a low volume user to spread the equipment cost over units produced. With rapid uptake, a business is born.EpilogueMy summary of the situation is this: the industrial market for 3D printers has matured for rapid prototyping and demand has declined. This has forced printer manufacturers to move downstream to lower materials usage and more price sensitive customers. This market is more diffuse so access is a problem. Additive manufacturing, while promising, has yet to gain traction. This is why DDD has expanded its reseller channel and moved into services. Adoption has been slow because of the high upfront cost of a 3D printer. Hence, Cube. 3D printing/additive manufacturing might be the ""next big thing"" so the stock market has reacted predictably by driving the market value of DDD to an all-time high. The market has over-reached. Take a look at the hype cycle graph below:DDD is at or near its peak coinciding with 3D printing being near the peak of the hype cycle. Now is the time to start asking the difficult questions. Now is the time to hedge your long position.The 3D hype cycle is reaching a crescendo. The red flags are numerous and substantial. Disclosures are confusing, inconsistent and vague. Black clouds are forming.I suggest that longs pay close attention to DDD's weekly chart. Today, investor sentiment remains strong, but this could change quickly. If you see the stock start to roll over, then the institutions are exiting. What is the downside risk? Who can say? All I know is that I have learned a lot about 3D Systems Corporation. It sure has been illuminating.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

914941,36201,2012-10-10T04:57:06-04:00,,"Despite posting strong revenue growth and higher gross profit margins, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has been beaten up lately along with its largest competitor Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS). Insider sales and increasing competition have trimmed this skyrocketing maker of 3D printers from its highs of $44.80 in late August, to lows of near $32 in late September. I still think 3D is a buy at its last closing price of $34.27, provided it addresses some issues regarding its competition when it reports again on October 25th.Revenue growth at 3D Systems is outpacing its nearest publicly traded competitor.What I find most interesting about the fledgling personal 3D printer industry is the early presence of opposing business models similar to Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android mobile platform versus Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS. MakerBot industries have a Thingiverse that is similar to the Google Play store. There is a community of individuals sharing their ""things"" for free. MakerBot also has free software that can be used in conjunction with its printers. The 3D Systems website Cubify charges $49 for its software. The Cubify website features arguably better quality designs, all for a price. I think there is room for both business models, but enduring arguments over which is better are inevitable.Despite strong revenue growth, 3D Systems is well off its 52-week high.Formlabs received a lot of attention when it used Kick-start to sell about $100,000 worth of its printers and received a great deal more money than anyone imagined possible. Formlabs is still too small to be a threat, but the industry and its analysts took notice. It appears that there is demand for professional grade printers in the $2,500 range.Formlabs' stereo-lithography technology boasting 3D printer called the Form 1 is a game changer within this already game changing industry. It delivers quality that previously cost tens of thousands, for $2,500. The latest 3D printer from 3D Systems, the Cube, is priced at $1,299, and while it is a fun toy, it doesn't deliver professional grade quality like the Form 1.When 3D Systems presents 3rd quarter earnings, I will be looking for a strategy to deal with the impending threat of professional quality stereo-lithography printers priced to compete with its popular fused deposition modeling toys.The Form 1 delivers much higher quality than most FDM printers at a very affordable priceWhat I want to see in the Q3 2012 report is some indication that 3D Systems' pay for everything model is gaining traction. Cube printers were just hitting the market when 3D last reported and early indications were very positive. The launch of Cubify.com was also very positive with orders exceeding the top range of its expectations. I want to see some positive numbers that confirm my suspicions that competition from cheaper personal 3D printers aren't seriously affecting growth of 3D's consumer division.Although I expect the consumer division to drive growth for the 3D Systems, it is not the company's only revenue stream. 3D Systems produces an array of professional printers and materials that are merging with its soon to be discontinued production grade line. Its health care materials division produces medical devices and other implements to be used in and around the human body. Although the production and healthcare divisions are less promising than 3D's consumer products and services, their revenues have been steadily increasing. I am going to be on the watch for continued growth in these divisions as well.The last quarterly report from 3D Systems showed strong revenue growth coupled with an encouraging expansion of profit margins. A 111% increase in printers sold is the sort of figure that warrants a forward P/E of 27.2. So the first thing that I will be looking for when 3D Systems posts third quarter results on Friday, October 26th will be a continuation of this growth. Specifically, I will be looking for revenue and profit margin figures that meet or beat those reported during the second quarter. Revenue and gross profit margin targets based on Q2 2012 results are as follows.These are not the only metrics that should be taken into account, but the 3D Systems earnings call is scheduled for 11:00 AM EDT on Friday the 26th. I expect share prices will be churning right up to the bell. Analyst earnings per share estimates range between $0.17 and $0.26, which is some relatively wide variance. Even if they hit the mean EPS estimate of $0.21, this stock is going to move.I will be submitting a deeper analysis of Q3 results after the call. Until then, I suggest staying focused on revenue growth, expanding profit margins, and the Cubify Store results. Should they manage to hit or exceed the above targets I think a long position is warranted.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

887371,25381,2012-09-25T10:30:31-04:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is having an interesting year. The company's share price started the year below $15, climbed up all the way to $45, and now it's been on a sharp decline to $35. While the company's growth story has been quite impressive, the company's P/E ratio of 61 seems to scare many investors off. Will 3D Systems find a bottom anytime soon? Is this a good entry point?First of all, let me make clear that this is a small cap with an aggressive growth story, and one shouldn't analyze the stock like a value stock. Value stocks usually have low P/E ratios (usually below 20) and slow growth rates (Usually less than 10-15% annually) and they tend to enjoy a relatively high dividend rate (at least 2.5%). As the planned retirement age gets closer, people tend to switch and progressively allocate more of their portfolio to the value stocks than the growth stocks because the growth stocks tend to be volatile.For those that don't know, 3D Systems produces printers that are able to reproduce 3-dimensional shapes of objects using material such as plastic. These printers are largely used by designers, architects and engineers. There is a rapidly growing market for 3D printers and more industries are figuring out ways to use these innovative tools. One main competitor of 3D Systems is Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS); however, there aren't many more competitors out there, which lets these two companies take advantage of a rapidly growing market.Recently, the company entered in Fortune's list of the 100 fastest growing companies. The company ranks number 5 in technology, number 6 in profit growth and number 12 in overall growth. This is very impressive for the company as it posted a growth rate of 242% in number of units sold in the last year. Unfortunately, there are only 2 analysts that provide earnings estimates for the company in the long run, which makes it difficult to determine how much growth the company is expected to post in the future. These analysts expect the company to earn between $1.25 and $1.33 next year. The analysts covering the company also have an average price target of $36 on the stock, which is very close to the stock's current price; however, many analysts assign a relatively low P/E to this company while ignoring its growth prospects. A company with a high growth rate should not have to worry about achieving a low P/E until the growth rate slows down significantly.Recently, the company announced that it will sell protective cases for the iPhone 5. These cases will have a double layer, and they will be produced with the company's own 3D printers. In fact, these cases are already available in many markets including websites carrying the product. In the future, the company may sell more products produced by its printers and increase its revenues when the revenue from the sale of printers starts getting flat.In the last 5 years, the company's average annual growth rate was 14.4% while its gross margin currently sits at 49%. The company's growth rate has been accelerating recently as its products become more visible. Until recently, most people didn't even know that 3D printers existed, and many people still don't understand the full usage of them. It is possible to use these printers to make cheap prototypes of products before producing the actual products in almost every industry. This process also saves companies a lot of money on shipping costs. A toy company that designs its products in the US and produces them in China could save a lot of time and money by simply printing a 3D version of the newest design rather than hand-producing and shipping the product from China.If one wants to initiate a long position in this company, now could be a good time. The company's share price has been falling for a couple weeks and there is no telling how much further it will fall. The stock's price should be pretty close to bottoming for the short term. I suggest investors to start out with a small position rather than a large position in this company due to the high volatility. If the share price plunges further, taking a small initial position will allow you to purchase more shares to bring your average down. Also, those who buy this company should hold onto their shares for at least 2-3 years to see good returns.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

964021,22148,2012-10-31T05:03:37-04:00,,"As mentioned prior, the 3D printing sector has appealing growth potential, but the valuations of the two main players have typically been at elevated levels. The stocks of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSYS) were expensive in spite of the fast growth rates until the September swoon. Now 3D Systems can add a short attack to the equation.The company is a leading provider of 3D content-to-print solutions including 3D printers, print materials and on-demand custom parts services for professionals and consumers alike.As written back on October 10th with the stock around $34, the sell-off provided a good entry point into the stock and the sector. A great Q3 earnings report helped counter the short theory and sent the stock surging to over $42 before the market closed for two days.Q3 Earnings HighlightsThe company reported the following highlights for Q3 2012:Gray Wolf Research - Short TheoryLast week, Gray Wolf Research published their article on Seeking Alpha, making claims that the company was misstating organic growth and stuffing the channel amongst other items. While the market reacted as if the report claimed fraud, the real meat of the story hit at unsustainable growth rather than improper accounting.The biggest claim of overstated organic growth actually comes down to how companies report the future revenue growth from an acquisition. As 3D Systems discussed on the conference call, the company accounts the growth from an acquisition as organic after 12 months if the product achieving that growth was produced while owned by 3D Systems.All companies report organic growth in a similar manner hence the key to monitoring the success of a company comes down to per share numbers. The commonly used earnings per share or even revenue per share or cash flow per share adequately factor in the fact that growth in absolute numbers aren't meaningful if it doesn't impact the relative per share numbers.The supposed inflated one-time sell-in to Z Corp resellers might actually be true and account for a partial reason that Q1 earnings smashed estimates. Unfortunately for the short thesis, the fact that earnings continue to increase sequentially suggests that any benefit has more than been offset by actual sales.The cash flow issue is far from relevant as it focuses on the past. The real issue will be whether the rapidly growing revenue base generates cash flow going forward. The company generated $44M from operating activities in the first nine months of this year.The most concerning issue is the ability to continue growing with Research & Development expenses remaining exceptionally low at around 6% of sales. The company might be generating short-term profits by limiting those expenses. 3D Systems is also buying research via these acquisitions that might allow it to keep those costs lower. It lets other companies develop the new concepts, while not having to fund losing ideas.In some form, the over $315M in goodwill and intangible assets on balance sheet are payments for successful R&D programs. These expenses weren't incurred by 3D Systems, but it paid other companies for the successful development projects.Analysts EstimatesAs mentioned in the Q3 earnings preview, a big concern with 3D Systems at the time was the unpredictable earnings reports. The company had a history of solidly beating or just meeting estimates.The Q2 numbers came in right at the expectations of $0.27 so the reported $0.32 for Q3 was surprising. Analysts had expected a sequentially flat quarter. Typically, hot momentum stocks continuously beat and raise estimates, but this company had not done that until recently in two out of the last three quarters.The key going forward after pushing beyond Q3 is that earnings for 2013 have started climbing higher, going from $1.33 60 days ago to $1.38 30 days ago to $1.52 currently. With the Rapidform deal adding up to $0.09 to those estimates, 2013 numbers could easily exceed $1.60 now. In fact, the high analyst already has an estimate of $1.87.Stock PriceThe stock currently trades at $42, approaching the all time highs. It now trades at 25x expected updated 2013 earnings of around $1.70. After the huge run by Stratasys and the delayed Objet merger, 3D Systems appears to be the better deal in the sector.6 Months Chart - 3D SystemsConclusionWith the strong Q3 earnings, 3D Systems remains a compelling buying opportunity around the current price. The stock valuation has become cheaper over the last few months as earnings expectations have expanded while the stock has been flat to down.While the short theory regarding R&D remains one worth watching, the other issues remain either baseless or industry norms in the technology sector. Major corporations such as Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Dell Inc. (NYSE:DELL) routinely make purchases that are eventually absorbed into organic growth numbers.The key remains whether the company is able to absorb the new businesses and foster them into growing business lines once part of 3D Systems. For now, the company has been a huge success and the only question remains valuation that for now is compelling.Disclosure: I am long CSCO.

916521,22148,2012-10-10T13:54:26-04:00,,"The 3D printing sector has appealing growth potential, but the valuations of the two main players got to very expensive levels. The stocks of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSYS) were expensive in spite of the fast growth rates.The company is a leading provider of 3D content-to-print solutions including 3D printers, print materials and on-demand custom parts services for professionals and consumers alike.Now after a decent selloff plus the announcement of a solidly accretive deal, 3D Systems has become a much more attractive stock. The stock actually is in a similar price range as the previous article in July that questioned the valuation. The difference now is that the company has grown for three more months and spent a nice portion of the secondary funds to reduce the dilution impact moving beyond Q3.Rapidform DealOn Tuesday, the company announced the acquisition of Rapidform, a leading global provider of proprietary 3D Scan-To-CAD software tools located in South Korea. The company provides leading 3D scan data processing software tools for reverse engineering and inspection. It has 35 patents with over 6,500 customers globally.The more exciting part of the deal is that the $35M purchase price will add $15M to the 2013 revenue base. On top of that, the deal will add $0.06 to $0.09 to earnings.Buying a private company for cash at just over 2x revenue is very attractive especially considering the market values the current revenue at 4x 2013 estimates.Other MergersBack in June, the company raised roughly $107M in order to finance future acquisitions such as the Rapidform deal. As of the end of Q2, the company had $159M in cash. Below is a list of the acquisitions announced since the end of Q2:On October 1st, the company acquired Tim The Innovative Modelmakers B.V. to expand on-demand parts services in Benelux and for European customers in general. No details were provided on the financials.On July 23rd, the company acquired Viztu Technologies to expand the phone capture and play simplicity of Cubify. Vitztu developed the Hypr3D, an online platform that allows anyone to turn pictures and videos into printable 3D creations. No details were provided on the financials.Another reason for becoming more bullish on this stock over Stratasys is the general belief that tuck in deals are easier to complete and more successful. Stratasys is still working to finalize the Objet merger announced back in April. See the article on the delays here. After finalizing that deal, the company will need to integrate two different cultures to make a cohesive team.Analysts EstimatesAs mentioned in the Q2 earnings preview, a big concern with 3D Systems at the time was the unpredictable earnings reports. The company had a history of solidly beating or just meeting estimates.The Q2 numbers came in right at the expectations of $0.27. This makes three out of the last four earnings reports at or below estimates. Typically hot momentum stocks continuously beat and raise estimates, but this company hasn't had a history of such results.Analysts expect Q3 numbers to be flat from Q2, partially due to the dilutive secondary completed at the end of June. The key going forward after pushing beyond Q3 is that earnings for 2013 have started climbing higher going from $1.33 90 days ago to $1.38 currently. Even better, the Rapidform deal just added up to another $0.09 to those estimates. Numbers could easily approach $1.50 now.The company reports Q3 on October 25th providing investors a couple of weeks to decide whether to buy before or after the earnings report.Stock PriceThe stock currently trades at $34, approaching the lows for the last month. It now only trades at 22x expected updated 2013 earnings. After a huge run by Stratasys this last year, 3D Systems appears to be the better deal in the sector.DDD Total Return Price data by YChartsConclusion3D Systems provides a compelling buying opportunity around the current price. The stock valuation has become cheaper over the last few months as earnings expectations have expanded while the stock has pulled back. The company though tends to have spotty results and the dilutive nature of the secondary probably held back any earnings gains in Q3.Now that the company has made several acquisitions to absorb the cash, the forward guidance is likely to be attractive. Anybody interested might be best served by purchasing a half position before the earnings report, leaving some cash for disruption in the earnings. The real key will be to scoop up shares for the growth acceleration next year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

854181,35121,2012-09-07T16:51:27-04:00,,"The hype surrounding 3D printing has taken over the web, being claimed the ""third industrial revolution"" yet indeed offering potential to change everyday life as we know it. Essentially, 3D printers convert data from a computer design program and create the desired object by ""printing"" layer upon layer using materials such as plastic and metal. The future of this technology seems limitless as it spreads like wildfire through the different industries it can reform; from the way we manufacture and trade globally, to advancements in healthcare and even the construction of housing.3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is one of two main players in the 3D printing industry, along with rival Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS). 3D Systems seems to be living up to the excitement of its industry as it has been experiencing substantial growth with revenues up 52% from a year ago and new product revenue up 60% in the same time frame. In 2012, the price of DDD has shot up 185%, or an 18-fold increase over the S&P (a 10% increase).The rapid buildup in the price of DDD has surpassed that of the company's growth as shares trade over 70 times (trailing) earnings, nearly 4 times larger than the sector average (P/E of 19.89). Using the Q2 guidance for the remainder of 2012, forward P/E ratio is estimated to be 43, a value that is still twice the sector average. A better indicator of a company's stock price to earnings growth would be the PEG ratio, which also takes into account the annual EPS growth of the company. Possessing a PEG ratio of 1.13, the price of DDD has grown faster than its earnings, a sign that the company may be overvalued due to high demand for its stock. These two basic metrics of valuation should be taken with a grain of salt however, as there is a lot more to a public company than the P/E and PEG ratio. An alternative argument can be made that even with all this recent growth in the 3D printing industry and triple digit returns in the price of DDD during 2012, the company anticipates further growth in a global market that is expected to reach $3 billion by 2018, fifteen times that of the 2012 figure.Gartners hype cycle (below) is a tool that has been developed by Gartner Technology Research to determine which new technologies are over enthused in their respective fields. At the peak of inflated expectations, where 3D printing is found, there is intense market pressure for the technology to be adapted. There is a sense of excitement for such immature technology, disillusion and even unrealistic expectations that the technology is paired with. This, however, does not mean that 3D printing is not going to amount to what is expected of it. It is merely a measure of overblown expectations at a given point in time.Put into context, media tablets such as Apple's  (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad or Samsung's Galaxy Tab peaked, according to the Gartner hype cycle, in 2010. Now, 2 years later, they are at the slope of enlightenment stage and have become mainstream devices with sale volume six times greater than that of 2010. The advancement of the technology and increased profit potential generate competition as tech giants Research in Motion (RIMM) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) entered the media tablet industry in 2011 with the Playbook and TouchPad, respectively. In July 2012, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) released the Nexus7, much later than competitors, in an attempt to steal a portion of the industry profits. Analysts predict that by 2016, the tablet industry will have 369 million units of sales worldwide, 20 times greater than the amount of units sold in 2010 when the technology just entered the market. The innovation of the media tablet caught up to the surrounding hype and in succession created a new multi-billion dollar industry that has changed the way we interact with technology for purposes of work and leisure.3D Systems expanded into the commercial 3D printing market in May 2012 through the release of its consumer 3D printer ""Cube"". The Cube is a home 3D printer that allows consumers to print ideas into real life objects using their ""Cubify"" software - all for a reasonable price of $1299. This was the first step 3D systems took into a new untapped market of home 3D printing that could create limitless opportunities for growth. Although the technology is just coming into its own, the emerging hype surrounding 3D printing should influence much innovation and demand for more competitors to enter the market. This could pose a threat for 3D systems, but in order for the 3D printing industry to take off it must first mature beyond a niche market and become a mainstream technology, which could take anywhere from 5-10 years according to the Gartner hype cycle.3D Systems is a very appealing long term prospect as the technology and potential of 3D printing cannot be denied. There will, undoubtedly, be ample competition entering the market once the 3D printing technology further advances, but with DDD you are owning a stock that is already an industry leader with proven clientele experience, a strong fundamental base and well protected products (holding 725 patents by end of 2011 with 257 pending patents that cover recently introduced printers). In addition, 3D Systems began expansion into the home 3D printing market by acquiring small companies relating to the industry like My Robot Nation and FreshFiber. And in June, the company issued $100 million in common stock, proceeds from which will be used for further acquisitions, showing that the company is committed to further growing its product lines while remaining a leader in the 3D printing industry.Keep an eye on DDD and be patient to enter long when some of the hype dust settles or when the company has shown enough growth results to warrant its stock price, or more correctly, its valuation. As discussed earlier, with its stock price being 70 times that of its earnings the past twelve months, the stock price has built in a 'hype premium'. Instead of paying for this premium, it would be wise to keep DDD on your watch list until a pullback indicates that the technology is catching up to the surrounding publicity or valuation can be better substantiated. Such hype can be associated with social media stocks that have been in recent headlines like Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and the infamous Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Investors of these stocks had unusually high expectations that affected the valuation process, and as a result are now experiencing the consequences of undeveloped hype. Like most new technologies, there will come a time when the product will live up to the expectations and patient investors will be rewarded.Disclosure: I am long DDD.

943201,37401,2012-10-23T17:02:33-04:00,,"A Forensic Accounting Report Detailing Why We Believe that 3D Systems Profitability Is Unsustainable and that Reported Organic Revenue Growth Is Overstated by an Estimated 100%With a stock price that has more than tripled over the last 2 years, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) has handsomely benefited from the plethora of positive media reports and bullish investor recommendations centered on the 3D printing industry. For instance, this month, Insider Monkey made the claim that DDD may be this decade's ""top dog"", ahead of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).While Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) and Protolabs (NYSE:PRLB) are often associated with the 3D printing industry, DDD is one of only two publicly traded 3D printer manufacturers of significant market capitalization along with Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS). DDD CEO Abe Reichental appears prominently in many positive media reports, advertising his company as the public markets vehicle to play the secular growth in 3D printing products and services.For instance, in an interview with the Financial Times in July 2012, Reichental states he expects 3D printing industry to grow bigger than the internet and expects industry sales to go from $500 million in 2012 to $35 billion in 10 years,[i] which implies a 53% revenue compound annual growth rate relative to 3D Systems inorganic sales CAGR of 7% over the previous decade. DDD has reported ~20% organic growth over the last 2 years that conforms to the narrative being told in the media.CEO Reichental and the DDD Board of Directors have used this narrative to raise $341.7 million in equity capital to spend on acquisitions and have sold $70 million in shares over the last 2 years. However, after conducting a detailed examination of DDD's financial results, we believe that this organic growth rate is highly overstated. Below we demonstrate the following five key points.1. Reported last twelve month organic revenue growth of 19.3% is overstated by an estimated ~100% since the Company is including a portion of its revenue growth from recently completed acquisitions as organic revenue growth. We believe last twelve month organic revenue growth is no more than 9.6%. DDD has acquired 24 companies between the fourth quarter of 2009 and the second quarter of 2012. Through our detailed methodology we arrive at estimates for the 24 acquisitions that were completed between the fourth quarter of 2009 and the second quarter of 2012. The methodology we employ primarily relies on DDD's own SEC filings and commentary from company officials.Multiple members of DDD's Board of Directors were in place years before the SEC's 2003 investigation into DDD's revenue recognition practices. Deloitte & Touche LLP resigned as auditor and the Charlotte regional office of BDO USA LLP took over the DDD account in 2003. BDO Charlotte only audits one other publicly traded company, the $25 million market capitalization company Hampshire Group, and we wonder whether BDO Charlotte is up to the task of auditing the complicated accounts of DDD, which acquired 24 companies for $252.6 million from 4Q09 to 2Q12. We question why DDD excludes its reported organic growth rate from the 2011 10-K (the only audited financial report), yet advertises its organic growth rate on both 2011 and 2012 earnings calls and in 10-Q filings.2. The results for the first half of 2012 are inflated by one-time sell-in to Z Corp resellers. This further overstates the repeatable organic growth rate, making us believe the business is really only growing 3% to 6% on a repeatable basis.Per the Z Corp and Vidar M&A call on 11/21/11, Reichental states that the $134 million acquisition ""effectively doubles the number of resellers and takes us to a combined channel of some 330 resellers worldwide with complementary portfolio that allows the combined channel to sell the combined portfolio."" Through our independent research interviewing participants in the Z Corp channel, we have learned that after the acquisition close date on 1/3/12, DDD held a meeting at its Rockhill, SC facility with a large group of Z Corp resellers. Our sources say that Reichental told the resellers at this meeting that DDD had just purchased Z Corp for $134 million. Z Corp independent resellers were told to buy both a Projet 1500 (sells for $10-15k) and a Project 3000 (sells for $60-90k) if they wanted to continue being a part of the reseller program. After this initial meeting in 1Q12, this message was further relayed to Z Corp resellers across the globe.Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen has apparently learned something similar through his channel checks as he writes in his 10/11/12 report:We believe that DDD profitability likely benefited from this reseller sell-in primarily in 1Q12 but that there may have also been some spill over into the 2Q12 quarter.Our large point of disagreement with Piper Jaffray's Troy Jensen above is that we believe that this is an unhealthy channel that will be subject to attrition. Furthermore, while DDD free cash flow generation typically benefits from a seasonal tailwind in the second half of each year, we believe that the 1H12 sales results are inflated by this reseller sell-in and are thus unsustainable. Even with this benefit, the Company only managed to produce 1H12 free cash flow of $19.8 million, or last twelve months free cash flow of $36.9 million relative to a $2.2 billion market capitalization, implying a 1.7% free cash flow yield.In the below table, we take the base last twelve months organic revenue rate from Point 1 above and adjust it for the one-time incremental revenue that DDD earned in 1H12 to derive a repeatable organic growth rate of 3% to 6%.3. DDD has not generated significant free cash flow over time, and we do not believe the Company's acquisition strategy over the last two years materially changes this business's prospects.Below we review DDD's Cash Flow from Operations and Cash Flow from Investing since 1991 (DDD has been a publicly traded 3D printing company for more than two decades).Over the twenty years from 1991 to 2009, DDD produced a cumulative $72 million of Cash Flow from Operations, negative $11 million CFFO less Capex, and negative $186 million of free cash flow. This hardly sounds like a fast growing, high margin business to us.Now let's take a look at DDD's transformation over the last ten quarters. While we see that DDD has produced $81 million of cumulative cash flow from operations, i.e. $8 million more than it had produced in its cumulative two decade history, we also see that cumulative free cash flow is nearly the same at negative $184 million from 1Q10 to 2Q12 versus negative $186 million from 1991 to 2009. What is missing from this equation is how DDD financed this spending spree: DDD raised $341.7 million of financing over the previous ten quarters, and share count increased from 45.8 million in 2009 to 59.7 million in 2Q12 once including the in the money convertible debt, or a total share count increase of 30% over ten quarters.While it goes without saying that DDD's cash flow would be considerably lower if one excluded the 24 acquisitions for $252.6 million that DDD completed over the previous ten quarters, let's assume for a moment that we could take DDD's current free cash flow from operations less capex per share at face value and compare that to GAAP EPS. We see that cumulative GAAP EPS over this 10 quarter period is $1.34, or only 6% lower than cumulative Cash Flow from Operations less Capex metric of $1.43.4. Over the last several years, DDD has significantly underinvested in R&D relative to core competitors SSYS and Objet and is losing significant market shareReichental views DDD's print technologies as a competitive advantage in the 3D printing space, stating in an article for Forbes that:Let's take a look at DDD's seven print technologies below. ""Principle print engines"" per the 2011 10-K include all of the following except for 3DP, which was acquired in the Z Corp acquisition:We believe that MJM technology will be DDD's primary sales driver on a forward basis and the stiff competition that DDD faces in this sub segment from the combined Stratysis-Objet entity (the two companies agreed to merge in 2012). We believe that the financial histories of DDD, SSYS, and Objet paint a compelling picture. Clearly Objet and SSYS have been gaining significant market share from DDD. Below for simplicity, we do not strip out inorganic growth for DDD in 2010 and 2011. What is more instructive is the divergence in the growth rates over the last decade, a period in which DDD revenue has been effectively flat excluding acquisitions and SSYS and Objet have gained significant share of the 3D printing industry:What is fascinating from the above chart is that even including DDD's massive inorganic growth in 2010 and 2011, the Company only grew at a 7.0% 11-year CAGR relative to SSYS, which completed very few acquisitions and grew at a 14.4% CAGR, over twice the rate of DDD. We only have 5 years of historical financials for Objet going back to 2007, and since then Objet grew at a 15.9% CAGR, nearly entirely organically, relative to DDD's 10.2% inorganic revenue CAGR since 2007.In the early 2000s, DDD was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy due to its negative cash flow generation. The 2003 10-K Risk Factors warned that:What we find so interesting is that while DDD was forced to cut R&D during this difficult period from 2001 to 2003, both R&D spending as a percent of sales and R&D per print engine technology have declined significantly from this bare bones period. R&D as a percent of sales and R&D per print engine for DDD were roughly flat from 2004-2006, but have declined precipitously over the last 5 years from 2007 to 2011, particularly in relation to its chief competitors, SSYS and Objet. In our view, this lack of R&D investment explains in large part why DDD has lost so much market share to SSYS and Objet over the last decade.5. We believe DDD is worth $7.00-11.00 per share, or 10-15x EPS based on our expectations for a 3% to 6% repeatable organic growth rateDDD claims an organic growth rate far above what it is actually generating based on our detailed assessment of DDD's acquired revenue. We believe that repeatable organic growth over the last twelve months has been 3% to 6% and see no reason to believe that organic growth will accelerate on a forward basis beyond this level given competitive pressure in DDD's core 3D printing business. 10-15x EPS is an appropriate valuation multiple for a business growing revenue organically at 3-6% on a forward basis, which implies a share price of $7.00 to $11.00, or 70% to 80% downside from the current share price based on 2012 Street GAAP EPS. This valuation is in line with DDD's historical stock price history prior to the introduction of the roll up acquisition strategy in 2010. We believe the GAAP metric is closer to an estimate of repeatable free cash flow that the market should capitalize, but even applying the Non-GAAP metric we arrive at a price target 54-69% below the current share price assuming a 10-15x EPS multiple.Disclosure: I am short DDD.

Ironically the earnings are only expected to slightly top last years numbers while revenue is expected to soar 53%. The revenue growth is partially helped by several key acquisitions over the year.Estimize consensus numbers are for the company to report $0.29 for Q2. This number is at the high end of analyst estimates which arguably haven't been very accurate on this stock. This community of informed investors and traders provides a unique view into earnings estimates.The results have been wildly unpredictable the last 4 quarters. Both Q112 and Q211 quarters beat estimates by a wide margin. Though Q311 missed numbers by two cents and Q411 was only inline. For this to be a great stock to latch onto, estimates need to both be more predictable and constantly moving higher.Stock PerformanceThe Q1 earnings report came out after the close on April 26th. The stock closed that day at $29.05 and has since rallied as high as $37. The stock closed Tuesday at $34.20 for a nearly 18% gain since that report.3 Month Chart - 3D Systems(Click to enlarge)Q2 Updates/MergersIn June, the company completed a 4,151,000 share secondary that raised roughly $107M. The proceeds from the offering will be used to finance future acquisitions of other entities and for working capital and general corporate purposes. See the article about it here.On May 24th, the company acquired Bespoke Innovations to expand reach into individualized medical devices. Bespoke develops proprietary, integrated scan, design and print technology that is designed to deliver custom fit prosthetics, orthotics and orthopedic devices that improve treatment and lifestyle outcomes. The deal is not expected to be material to its revenue in 2012.On May 22nd, the company introduced the ProJet 700 production #D printer. The printer provides for larger and faster part printing capacity.On May 7th, the company acquired FreshFiber to add leading 3D printed accessories brand. No details were provided on the financials.On April 17th, the company acquired Paramount Industries to boost its growing on-demand direct manufacturing services especially in the aerospace and medical device areas. No financial details were provided.CompetitionTop competitor Stratasys (SSYS) became more formidable last quarter with the purchase of Objet. Prior to this deal, the company was expecting roughly $188M in revenue for 2012 placing it at half the size of 3D Systems.When the transaction is completed in Q312, the combined company will be a formidable competitor to 3D Systems with a similar scope and size. The integration of two different cultures could be key to whether this new entity can compete successfully.Proto Labs (PRLB) provides a level of direct competition as the company produces CNC machined and injection molded plastic parts on immediate order. The company trades at 31x forward earnings so it isn't a huge value but fast growth is expected.Conclusion3D Systems provides a compelling buying opportunity around the current price of $34. The stock valuation at only 25x forward earnings is reasonable compared to the competition, but the biggest concern remains with the spotty results. Will this be the quarter that it disappoints again?Nothing special happened in Q2 other than the secondary that could impact estimates for Q3. The company is likely to exceed analyst estimates.The biggest concern might be that dilution squeezes estimates for the third quarter until the cash can be deployed on acquisitions. The long term remains bright for 3D printing, but the financial results aren't predictive enough to step in at these prices.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

660811,30151,2012-06-14T19:32:26-04:00,,"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) completed their secondary offering today, selling $100M in shares at $27. While this was well under the price before the announcement, I view the recent sell off as a buying opportunity and looking for a good entry point.The daily chart gives me some hints that any further weakness should end if DDD heads to $26 with $25 providing significant support. With a recent series of higher highs with lower RSI, I would expect this weakness to continue to that point, especially if the stock bounces down off the current test of the 50DMA from the underside.Printing…. In 3D!While 3D printing is still not a mainstream technology, the potential for commercial adoption is quite high. If marketed correctly, this could easily be a holiday must have once the price becomes reasonable. I wouldn't put it past Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introducing the iPrinter after acquiring 3D systems or Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and integrating the technology. Letting loose a bunch of Apple designers creating iKitchenTools or the like would be an interesting development that I see as possible within the next 3-5 years.With 3D systems already having a ""retail"" system priced at $1300, we could easily see a more marketable version in the $400 range in 2-3 years once Moore's law works its magic on product development cycles. While $1300 is likely too much to justify a holiday purchase, once we head sub $500, we are entering an easier market to move product on a large scale. Anyone buying DDD would be justified in having a long term investment window as the potential for the 3D printing industry is still largely untapped.What's the Trade Marmalade?If you believe that 3D printing has as much potential as many believe, dollar cost averaging in whenever the daily RSI on DDD drops below 45 sounds like a sound plan. If you had followed that plan you would have missed the lows but avoided buying at the highs. Just using the last 6 months as a guide, you would have been able to enter in at 22, 26 and now again at 28. If your holding period is measured in years, simply piling cash up and waiting for entry points on weakness should be a successful strategy.Anyone looking for a shorter duration trade should look for support at $25-$26 and sell once the RSI shows a bearish divergence with higher highs in price with lower RSI. While this is of course easier said than done, it should provide you with some technical backdrop to guide your trade.The great thing about this technology is now not only can you get Weird Al Yankovic in 3-D (throwback!), you can print in the third dimension as well. 4D printing (like 4G, only, you know, more time oriented) is still on the drawing board but may have been released at all points in time anyway, no first mover advantage there.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in DDD over the next 72 hours."
619851,22148,2012-05-27T12:55:23-04:00,,"The 3D Modeling/Rapid Prototyping (RP) technology sector promises to change the world. The RP technology allows for a design tool that greatly improves the product development cycle by allowing rapid creation of models for testing. Read this article for more information on the sector and leaders.Unfortunately the concept has limited commercial production capabilities and material challenges. Over time, these will naturally become less and less of a problem. For now though, several sectors such as aviation parts and medical devices can benefit greatly from the ability to RP. Not to mention, any wealthy person that wants to make their own iPhone case at home.The 3D Printing concept has been around for awhile, but it is just now becoming a mainstream reality with sub $10,000 commercial printers and sub $1,300 home printers.Below are the leading investment options in the public markets:3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is leading the 3D printing market, but unfortunately investors missed the golden opportunity to buy back at the end of December when the stock still traded around $15. It now fetches over $30.The company reported Q112 results that included 63% revenue growth and solid operating margins of 22%. Earnings only grew 47% to $0.25, but the company has been busy increasing research and development plus adding numerous acquisitions of printer developers and materials.With a forward PE of 23, the stock trades roughly in line with the expected growth rate. While not cheap, it isn't expensive and actually provides a solid earnings profile unlike most of the recent IPOs in the hot sectors of social media and cloud computing.The company recently introduced the Cube which provides the ability to bring 3D Printing to home at a cost of $1,299. While as affordable as Mac computers, the functionality will need to improve before many consumers rush out to buy it.Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) provides another option in 3D printing, but the stock has likewise more than doubled since the lows back in October of last year. The company recently released the Mojo 3D Printer which is the market's lowest-priced professional-grade complete 3D printing system priced at $9,900.This stock trades at a richer valuation than 3D Systems with a forward PE of over 30. The company also only reported 30% revenue growth for Q112 while analysts only forecast 15% long term growth.The recent announced merger with Objet is expected to launch Stratasys into a leadership position in the 3D Printing market. The combined company will rival the $1.5B market cap of 3D Systems along with the revenue size.Proto Labs (NYSE:PRLB) is an alternative investing option in 3D rapid prototyping and manufacturing short-runs of real parts. The company went public back in February, but the stock appears to have a similar pricey multiple as the 3D printing sector.The company reported 34% revenue growth and a solid 25.5% operating margin. At a forward PE of 29, the company trades in the range of its long term growth rate. With revenue expectations of around $127M for 2012, the company remains relatively small.For prototype and low to moderate volume tooling, the company provides a drastically reduced lead time and cost. It offers the ability to deliver real injection molded parts as quickly as the next business day.ConclusionThe investment world has clearly caught up with this sector as the stocks all trade around their growth rates. In a normal growth market, these stocks could even trade near double growth rates.In the current market environment and traditional weak summer period, investors might be wise to wait for better entry points. This sector offers a lot of long term growth potential, but the market isn't paying up for growth so no reason to rush out at these price levels.DDD has the largest following on Seeking Alpha and the fastest expected growth rate, making it possibly the best option to buy on dips, though with all the recent acquisitions and the additional option of Proto Labs, the sector remains up for grabs.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Please consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions."
674001,25359,2012-06-21T05:01:09-04:00,,"Personal 3-D printers are the next big technological revolution. They will drastically change our lives, second only to the effect of the personal computer. Throughout the course of this article, we will see why 3-D printing really is the next big technological leap; learn about 3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD), one of the major players in the field; and discuss why Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should buy into this burgeoning industry.What is 3-D Printing?Here are two videos that illustrate different types of 3-D printing:     
There are already a number of different marketplaces set up to connect designers with consumers. Designs for eyewear, shoes, jewelry, light fixtures, and sculptures are already being sold. Apple even sells 3-D printed iPhone covers. Also, a number of apps that assist in the creation and personalization of the products are already available.The 3-D printing industry has grown almost 9% a year over the last ten years and is expected to reach ""$3.1 billion worldwide by 2016 and $5.2 billion by 2020.""For further reading on the state of the industry, check out Terry Wohlers' Blog.The FutureI can't say how these processes will evolve or which of these technologies will gain preeminence. However, here is my prediction for the next five to ten years:For further reading about the future implications of 3-D printing, check out my previous article.A Takeover TargetOne of the most important players in the 3-D printing industry, and a company that Apple should buy, is 3D Systems Corp. According to Yahoo's Business Summary:3D Systems has a market capitalization of $1.5 billion. For the first quarter of 2012, on a non-GAAP year over year basis, revenues increased 63%, gross profit grew 67%, and earnings per share rose 47%.They expect full year 2012 revenue to be in the range of $330-360 million and non-GAAP EPS to be from $1.00 to $1.25 (see April 2012 Investor Presentation).3D Systems' balance sheet has taken a slight hit recently due to acquisitions, but these acquisitions will help them increase profitability and maintain dominance in the future.In regards to the recent secondary stock offering, it was fully covered and I believe it represents the normal actions of a growing company with its eyes on the future. It also increases the float, which makes it a more attractive investment for larger institutions, and provides 3D Systems with money for further research and development, acquisitions, etc. I took the opportunity to purchase shares and have no problem adding to my position on further general market weakness.The stock trades at a P/E of 44.93. Although the P/E is high and the stock price has doubled this year, I think the forward P/E of 23.14 represents value for a company with a bright future.Names You Should KnowTwo of 3D System's subsidiaries that Apple should be most interested in are Cubify and Z Corporation (both featured in the above videos).Cubify's Cube can be purchased for $1,299, uses Fusion Deposition Modeling and is designed primarily for personal/home use. They already have an online marketplace that allows artists to sell their designs to consumers who can replicate them (designs) at home.Z Corp.'s printers make use of Selective Laser Sintering. Unfortunately, these printers cost anywhere from $30,000 to $60,000. Also, as you can see from the above video, it is a bit messy and can take some work to get the object ready for use. However, I believe that over time, this technology will become cheaper and more streamlined.Why Apple Should Buy into 3-D PrintingApple Inc., the largest company in the world by market capitalization, has seemed to have the magic touch over the last few years. This is attributed to the tenacity and passion of Steve Jobs; his search for beauty and simple functionality has drastically changed our lives.People are wondering if Apple, led by CEO Tim Cook, has what it takes to continue the company as Jobs intended. Sure, they can lie back for the next couple of years and ride the momentum of Steve Jobs and the culture that he created; they can keep releasing projects that he worked with before his passing and still make a pile of money. However, if they want to stay true to who Steve Jobs was and the power of his memory, they should enter the world of 3-D printing.Three Reasons Why 3-D Printing is a Perfect Fit for AppleReason #1Jobs loved disruptive technologies and with the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, he changed the music, movie, telecommunications, and computer industries. 3-D printing may not be there yet, but this is the next, big disruptive technology.Reason #2Apple has a ton of cash on their balance sheet. They could purchase 3D Systems (market capitalization of $1.5 billion) with their spare pocket change. Then, spend the time and money introducing them to Apple's corporate culture, redesigning the software and hardware to fit Apple's goals and style.Reason #33-D printing and its future also fit right in with Apple's business model:RecommendationsApple's the clear leader in the consumer technology sector, but one false step and Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), or even Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) could be all over them. Don't believe me? Just look at Research in Motion Limited's (RIMM) carcass!3-D printing is the perfect next step for Apple. It fits in with the company's ethos, ecosystem and established business model. They have made their name by anticipating people's needs and desires; Apple should get started before one of their competitors beats them to it.My recommendation for investors is that you purchase shares of 3D Systems Corp.. Not only are they a sound investment in a growing field, but they are a great takeover target for Apple.Disclosure: I am long DDD."
286928,24088,2011-08-12T09:18:25-04:00,,"Although the larger economy has seemed to stagnate, the advancement of technology continues to progress exponentially. One of the biggest game changers in the tech sector is 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing. For those who have not heard of 3D printing, it is the process to take a digital photo and use its data to create a physical object. For more on the basics on how the technology works watch this video or read this Economist piece.Why is 3D printing such a large breakthrough? First, it is a game changer in manufacturing as it eliminates waste in the manufacturing process, as excess material can be stored in the printer in a way similar to ink in a conventional printer. Also it can drastically lower cost by eliminating the machinery and human labor involved in a traditional assembly line and may move manufacturing back to the developed world from emerging markets.It would also lower the barriers to entry for new entrepreneurs to enter their products into the market. In the longer term, wider spread use of 3D printing will allow people to literally download consumer goods into their home directly. When you can print out your couch that will also kill brick and mortar retail. Overall, 3D printing is a radical technology that has the power to launch to the next global industrial revolution.   So how can investors capitalize off of this trend? The best way to invest in 3D printing is through its leading company 3D systems. They specialize in selling 3D printers to factories and to lesser extent consumers. In addition to the printers, they also supply the materials, services, and software needed to successfully print in the third dimension. In fact the 61% gross margin is more profitable than the sales of the printers themselves that have a 39% margin.The current use in the market for 3D printers is to create engineering prototype models and certain types of jewelry. With the costs of 3D printers and printing rapidly decreasing (down 80% over the past five years) and improved technology the uses of 3D printing are expanding. The entry into larger scale manufacturing and in the longer selling personal 3D printers is the drivers for growth for 3D systems.  Especially for a company in its fledgling stages of growth, 3D Systems is in excellent financial shape. The company has a debt to equity ratio of only 0.03 and is reasonably profitable and efficient with a 17.85% profit margin and a 19.17% return on investment capital. Growth is currently high with a 1688.77% EPS growth rate this year and an conservatively estimated growth rate of 25% over the next five years. 3D Systems also provides value for its growth with a PEG ratio of 0.88.      Overall, 3D Systems is an excellent investment in the technology sector. Similar to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the 1980’s, its placement in a dynamic industry that will revolutionize manufacturing and its reasonably valued stock price make the 3D Systems a long term buy. However, due to its relatively low volume, price fluctuations may keep risk averse investors up at night. This recent pullback is an excellent buying opportunity once the market reaches some resemblance of stability.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in DDD over the next 72 hours."
483721,28351,2012-04-08T15:01:14-04:00,,"Have you ever wanted to make a model airplane or car but didn't want to have to assemble all the pieces? Have you ever cracked your phone case and wished you could make a quick replacement? Well thanks to 3D Systems (DDD) you can do that from home. It has a line of 3D scanners and 3D printers for home use or commercial production. In its latest annual report it notes possible uses could be in schools, by garage entrepreneurs, or even for automotive parts and prosthetics. In addition to providing the printers the company also provides the printing materials and maintenance service on its proprietary systems.3D Systems just launched the Cube, its first at home 3D printer. It also maintains a website where people can sell their designs to other people. The person could buy the design and print it right there in their own house. It recently acquired Z Corp for a print engine that is capable of printing in full color. It also recently acquired Vidar which gives it contacts into the healthcare industry. During 2011 it also acquired nearly a dozen other companies the each helped offer strategic growth.For 2011 nearly 50% of sales were international and no single customer was responsible for more than 10% of revenues. 29% of revenues came from printers and other products, 31% from materials, and the remaining 40% from services. It has a strong balance sheet with $179 million in cash and only $139 million in debt. Total annual profit margin for the year was 47.3%. As is typical with printers, the materials line has the highest margin at 64.8%. Expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly from 2010 by a percent to 32.3% for 2011. Raw materials increased 30% at the end of 2011 versus the same time in 2010. Work in progress increased 211% while finished goods decreased 3%. With its backlog growing, I think 3D Systems is stocking up materials in preparation for even more growth in 2012.As this is an emerging technology, anyone can invent a similar process and start a company. While 3D holds or has pending nearly 1,000 patents, it could still be overtaken by a better technology. Stratasys (SSYS) is a close competitor and based on its website, it focuses more towards the larger commercial versions of 3D printers. Those products will be more fruitful in terms of more material and more service sales which are the higher margin areas. Both of these companies are close in size and Stratasys has no debt on the books to $35 million in cash. They are currently in a race to be the first accepted company. I think 3D Systems is going well with the at home market, but at $1,299, it is a little pricey to be widely accepted. Right now the main customers are the tech innovators. I think it needs to make sure to keep battling with Stratsys in the commercial market to get its machines into factories and other commercial production centers.When both companies are so similar how do you choose which to buy? Well, I like 3D because it also offers its 3D scanners. These devices allow for quick and easy replication of items once scanned, instead of having to design them in a CAD program and then printing them. Both are investment possibilities, but I'm going with 3D because I think the price is better and the growth potential is higher. I think once enough people get the printers into their homes, the website with designs for sale will provide an additional source of revenue that Stratasys just doesn't have yet. One thing to watch during the call is that revenues from the printers themselves don't fall too much. I'm expecting a fall of a few percent because with more printers out there more materials and services will be bought and they carry the higher margins. Anything over a few percent means slower printer sales and could be an issue. I think we'll see first quarter revenues near $65 million and profit margins holding steady. I'm hoping to hear 2012 guidance near the $300 million mark. If that happens, we should see shares near $32/share by the end of 2012 with even bigger growth next year as the technology becomes more accepted.Disclosure: I am long DDD.Additional disclosure: I may increase my position within the next 72 hours."
720341,32861,2012-07-13T17:27:21-04:00,,"The next generation technological breakthrough is already here. 3D printing will change the way the world views creativity and designing products. The goal of Abe Reichental, the CEO of 3D Systems Corp (DDD), is to ""Democratize Creativity."" He believes that every person is capable of producing a great idea or design and he wants to provide people with the opportunity to do so. With the recent release of the Cube, 3D Systems has brought this notion of allowing everyone to be creative to life.How it WorksYou may have heard about 3D Systems' newest addition to its line of printers, The Cube. It was released this past March and has been a big hit so far. It is priced at $1,299 which is a bit pricey for the average consumer. Of course as with all technology, one can expect that price to be cut in half within the coming years as manufacturing and efficiency improve. The printer houses color cartridges that are priced at $50/cartridge, with discounts when you buy more than one. A cartridge will last you 13 mid-sized designs. Each design is created out of plastic material and the printer takes about 70 minutes to complete each design. This printer, in essence, allows designers to produce a scaled down version of their product, giving them the ability to look at and feel their products before wasting a ton of money on full sized models.Where it will be usedAs of right now the Cube is mainly intended for hobbyists and small business owners. In the future I would expect that the majority of households have a 3D printer as their main printer. Think back to when cell phones first came around. No one thought they needed one, however once everyone started using them they realized they couldn't live without them. I feel as if the same will happen with these printers. DDD has already tried to ""democratize creativity"" by creating a store similar to Apple's App store. The store is called Cubify, and allows users to upload their designs and sell their inventions to users with the 3D printers. You will need a CAD program to make a design, but you can buy the software cheap online. So for instance if you needed a model for a couch, you could log onto Cubify, purchase a design, and print it using your 3D printer which would allow you to see what the final product may look like. If you have an iPhone and you need a case, you can log into Cubify, pick a case design that you like, and print it (assuming you have a 3D printer). In this instance you could actually use that case for your iPhone. Another interesting fact is that people are now getting even more creative and instead of using plastic to print with, they are printing with edible materials such as chocolate!DDD's Outlook(Click to Enlarge)If you were to search for DDD articles over the past year you will find articles where the authors advise their readers to sell at $15 or $20 or $30. They don't think DDD has the capability to hit it big. Then of course everyone thought the same about Apple (AAPL) and boy I wish I wouldn't have listened. DDD's revenues increased 41% from 2009 to 2010 and 44% from 2010 to 2011. It is estimated that revenues will hit $347.62M by the end of 2012 (a 34% increase) and revenues in 2013 will be $415.55M according to Yahoo. Earnings are growing at a steady pace as DDD had earnings of $0.77 in 2011 and is expecting earnings of $1.14 in 2012 and $1.33 in 2013. DDD is outperforming both its industry and sector. A P/E ratio of 44.66 may seem high but you have to take into account that DDD is a growing company, and growth stocks usually have higher P/E ratios than value stocks. YTD it has returned 125.56% and I don't think it is done yet. DDD's next earnings date is July 26th. The key of this release will be how well has the Cube done it terms of sales. How much revenue has it brought in and do they expect continued growth in terms of market share and adopters? In the upcoming year investors will want to watch the company closely, keeping an eye out for any new product developments or even institutions buying in to 3D printing. An article released today describes how DDD just successfully integrated its new ProJet MP 3500 3D dental printer with 3Shape's Dental System. This combined technology offers a cost effective and efficient way for dentists to create models for their patients and is a small win for DDD.A long road aheadWhile I do believe this technology has the capability to succeed, I'm not so sure how soon we can expect it to do so. To suggest that the technology will be used by average consumers in just a few years would be premature. I think that a long trend of advancements and upgrades will lead to a slow adoption of the technology. A need for the average person to have 3D printing has not yet been identified. As the technology improves and is able to make larger items/models, you may see a more rapid pace of adoption of the technology.Summing it all upAs I have stated I do think this technology could be the next breakthrough. If 3D printing does take off, DDD will be in prime position to capture that market share. However as with every company offering new technology to the public, there is a high chance that they will fail. The odds are stacked against them, especially considering the slow market we are experiencing right now. What are your opinions? Do you think DDD will succeed or fail?Disclosure: I am long DDD."

It’s definitely a cliché, but this simple sentence encapsulates what a trader needs to internalize in order to survive in this business. A disciplined trader can be wrong 80% - 90% of the time and still make money. No trader is correct all the time so the idea is to exit a poor trade early with a small loss and to ride your winner(s) to big gains. One 5 or 10-bagger makes up for a lot of mistakes. The concept is simple to understand but very difficult to consistently execute.So what defines a winner? It depends on who you ask. High frequency traders would have a different definition than a “buy and hold” investor. Personally, I am a position trader so I will maintain a trade as long as the stock, its industry, sector and the market all continue to behave themselves. My holding period may be less than one day to a year or more.The Holy Grail for me is a situation where I identify a company on the cusp of a major economic revolution. This doesn’t happen very frequently so it’s a short list (at least since the 80’s): Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) / Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the PC revolution; Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) in the internet revolution; Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the consumer IT space and Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) in internet search (I’ll add Facebook when it debuts if its ROC is >= 17%). With the exception of Google, all of these companies were small caps for a period of time after their IPOs. No one forecasted them to be as big as they would eventually become. All, though, delivered fantastic multi-year bull runs as they rode their respective mass adoption waves. AAPL, in fact, isn’t finished yet in its current run.Major economic revolutions, as I define them here, are driven by products or services that totally upend the pervasive business models. The cost advantages that they deliver are so great that customers literally fall all over themselves to get on board. This is why all of these innovative companies are wildly profitable during their bull runs. They can literally dictate their market prices.Are there any of these technological revolutions emerging today? One can never know how large an emerging trend will eventually become, but I’m tracking 6 areas that I believe represent enormous growth potential for astute traders: Automated Retail, Internet Things, Robotics, Smart Systems, Synthetic Biology and 3D Printing. The last area is the one I address in this posting.Three dimensional printing has been in use for the past 10 – 12 years. The technology seems futuristic but it is performed in the same way you would send a digital file to your office printer. In this case, the ink is a material (e.g., high grade thermoplastics or carbon fiber composites) that is deposited in successive thin (20 – 30 microns) layers until a solid object is formed. The layers are defined by software that takes a series of digital slices through a computer-aided design (CAD).The material can be applied in several ways. For example, powder can be put into a tray and then solidified into a design with a squirt of a liquid binder or by sintering it with a laser or electron beam. Another approach is to deposit filaments of molten plastic.The initial use of the technology was for rapid prototyping. Historically, this process has been expensive, labor intensive and time consuming. 3D printing and CAD software have made a profound impact on this process. Design changes can be easily made into the CAD and a new prototype can be produced literally in a matter of hours. Product development teams can now test a wider variety of designs in a much shorter time frame and at a much lower cost. It’s easy to see why the technology has enjoyed robust adoption throughout much of the world.The exciting news is that there have been many product innovations in the 3D printers during the past 10 years or so. They are cheaper to purchase and operate, they are faster, they can produce a broader spectrum of products and they can apply a wider array of materials. The use of these systems has now evolved beyond rapid prototyping into actual production. It’s called “additive manufacturing”.The economics of this evolution are extremely attractive. We’ve all heard the buzzwords “mass customization”, but now it is truly a reality. 3D printing eliminates almost all of the risk in making changes to products. Retooling costs have dropped close to zero and material waste is virtually eliminated. Manufacturers can literally produce thousands of custom products at a time at lower costs than traditional batch run processes. This has the potential to transform the manufacturing process.Current examples of products being produced by additive manufacturing are: titanium aerospace parts, medical implants, jewelry, football shoes for individual feet, lampshades, dental crowns, racing car parts, solid-state batteries and customized mobile phones. Some companies have already achieved cost parity with 1000-unit (injection molding) production runs.The airline industry offers a superb example of how 3D printing can impact its cost structure. Even small airplanes contain several tons of expensive titanium parts. Historically, these are machined from solid billets of metal. The waste material can be as high as 90% and it is not reusable. A 3D printer uses titanium powder to make the part. Material costs are only 10% of what would typically be needed and any unused powder can be recycled. In addition, machined parts usually contain excess material that has no functional role but is necessary for the production process. With 3D printing, there is no such excess.Additive manufacturing has the potential to be truly transformative. Two companies that are well positioned to capitalize on this revolution are Stratasys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSYS) and 3D Systems Corp. (TDSC).Both companies offer an impressive lineup of printers for a variety of workplace environments. Stratasys looks like they are ahead of 3D Systems in the additive manufacturing space in light of their FORTUS production systems. These printers can produce large pieces at a production line speeds. 3D Systems lineup consists mainly of rapid prototyping systems. Two printers, the ProJet 5000 and ProJet 6000, look like they are the company’s first steps into true additive manufacturing.Let’s look at some of the numbers for both firms:Sources: Yahoo Finance, MSN Money, my own calculationsThe companies look fairly similar although TDSC is more efficient. Both have CF/NI ratios greater than the minimum of 1.2 (this is a metric I place a lot of value on). Healthy companies should always be generating at least 20% more cash than their reported income.Now let’s take a look at more metrics per Investors Business Daily (Investors.com).Stratasys and 3D Systems are 2 of 11 total companies in the Machinery – Materials Handling/Automation industry group. The industry is currently ranked #4 out of 197 groups (A+ rating) tracked by IBD.Looking at these numbers, we have all kinds of good news. Both stocks are leaders in a leading industry, their sales and revenues are growing robustly, analysts have recently revised forecasted EPS growth up and both stocks are near the top of the entire universe of US-listed equities for composite rating (combination of sales growth, revenue growth and profit margin) and relative strength (the highest possible rating is 99). What’s not to like?In short, both stocks are delivering robust fundamentals and the market is responding. An additional bonus is that both companies are in the early stage of what could be a long term bull run (note the 3-year EPS growth rates for both firms is -4%). Both stocks have a healthy tailwind behind them. This is an attractive situation indeed.I see only one negative. Both stocks are thinly traded. SSYS averages only 173,000/day and TDSC a mere 138,000. I rarely venture into a trade at these low levels because of the inability to build a meaningful position and the difficulty in exiting (not to mention the volatility risk). My position limit is no more than 3% of the average daily volume, so in this case, I would be constrained to no more than ~5200 shares of SSYS and ~4100 shares of TDSC. Even these positions would be risky if the situation deteriorated. On a large gap down, the volume could literally dry up to near zero for a good chunk of the trading day. You might as well bend over and grab your ankles if you try to exit. You’ll pay dearly.Is it a good time to buy if you want to enter into a modest position, say 100, 500 or 1000 shares? Unfortunately, the timing isn’t right to enter at present. Both stocks are well extended beyond valid buy points and they are well above their respective 50-day EMA’s (exponential moving average). In addition, the market is in a correction. You should only enter into a long position if the market is in a confirmed uptrend. I would wait until the market confirms AND for the price to revert to its 50-EMA before considering a move. This could take some time.The course of action that I recommend is to put both stocks on your watch list and research both companies and “additive manufacturing”. I’m quite sure that you’ll be encouraged by what you’ve learned.Additional sources: www.statasys.com; www.printin3d.com; “The Printed World”.

237121,20851,2010-11-16T12:29:21-05:00,,"3-D is becoming a hot consumer technology and has helped to resurrect movie theaters over the past year. Major 3-D pictures, from Twentieth Century Fox's 'Avatar' to DreamWorks Animation's 'How To Train Your Dragon', have helped draw people to the theatre - and even enticed them to pay for premium tickets.One public small cap company, 3D Systems (Nasdaq: TDSC), has worked for more than two decades behind the scenes to commercialize 3-D. Lately, 3-D Systems' stock has also become a hit with investors, and the company is poised for rapid growth for the next couple of years.The 24-year-old South Carolina company's shares have been one of the best performing in the technology sector this year and in October the stock has been the second-strongest performer in the Russell 2000, posting a gain of 64.5 percent since September.After the strong run up in shares the stock has taken a breather, falling back 13.2 percent after the company posted strong third-quarter results. It's time to determine if this drop in 3D Systems’ share price is the start of a downward trend, or if it could be a buying opportunity.Unquestionably, three-dimensional technology is hot. Consumers love the 3-D viewing experience, and theater owners and filmmakers love the premium ticket prices.For many manufacturers, the technology developed by 3D Systems is vital in getting their goods in front of the public eye. In addition to movies, 3-D modeling is used in everything from autos and airplanes to electronics and prosthetic limbs.In addition to serving the consumer and electronics industries 3D Systems sells equipment and software to the automobile, medical, education and defense markets. Its technology does everything from laser sintering, a process that builds up 3-D models layer by layer, to 3-D printing and film-transfer imaging, to plastic and composite model building. The company also supplies the CAD software and consumables needed to make everything work for its clients.All of these technologies help companies visualize how something will look in real life, not just on the computer screen. The technology not only helps bring movies to life, it also decreases the time it takes to bring cars and trucks to the showroom - and artificial limbs to patients.3-D Systems enjoys a diverse customer base with operations in the U.S. and six other countries in Europe and Asia. In 2009, the company estimated that 56 percent of its revenue came from outside of the U.S with sales coming from over 80 countries.The 3-D modeling and development business is highly fragmented, but 3D Systems' growth strategy aims to change that. The company has made key acquisitions since July, including Illinois-based Express Pattern, leading Italian rapid prototyper Provel, and French prototypers CEP and Protometal. All of these acquisitions are helping to spur growth.The company is also increasing its customer reach through a number of key alliances and distribution arrangements. Most recently, in October, the company agreed to distribute the software of German-based netfabb (spelled with a lowercase 'n').Despite 3D Systems’ stock performance this year the company has had to battle through some tough years. In 2005 the company was profitable, earning $0.48 per diluted share, and the stock traded as high as $25. Then the company encountered three losing years when it lost a total of $2.38 per share. Shares plummeted, and reached a low near $5 per share in February of 2009.The turnaround came later in 2009 when it earned $0.05 per diluted share thanks to cost-cutting measures. What's more, despite three acquisitions during the year the company increased its cash on hand. Now it has over $33 million in cash and hardly any debt.The company appears to be back on track.In the third quarter of 2010 revenue grew by 50 percent to $41.5 million year-over-year, net income grew 500 percent to $5.4 million from $900,000, and earnings per share increased 475 percent to $0.23 cents from $0.04 cents.One major positive change to 3D Systems' business model in 2009 was the introduction of its 3Dproparts service. Think of this service as the 3D manufacturing equivalent to FedEx Kinkos for flat printing.3D Systems is establishing a network of parts printing service locations where customers can find a one-stop shop for the company's services, without having to invest in the hardware/software setups on their own.The company has realized that not all potential customers want to invest in expensive equipment that might only see limited use. Now it's building a network of service centers to meet customers' rapid prototyping needs. This shift from a push sales strategy to a pull strategy (where customers are 'pulled' to the company's service centers) could become a major growth driver.Not many investors have discovered 3D Systems and shares are still thinly traded. Only around 80,000 shares are changing hands on any given day. But three analysts do cover the stock, and the consensus forecast is for earnings to continue to expand - by 1200 percent this year and by 46 percent next year. This earnings growth projection means the stock is trading with a fairly reasonable forward PE of 27-times 2011 earnings. However, the stocks PEG ratio is above 3, indicating that this stocks is trading at a sharp premium to its long term earnings growth.I'd suggest keeping an eye on 3D Systems and waiting for shares to pull back before buying. I love the growth story, and I think the company's move to bring customers to its service centers could work well in a recovering economy.But right now the rapid ascent in shares, coupled with the sharp pull-back, has me thinking this could be a volatile stock throughout the rest of the year. If you like the stock and want to get in on shares, use this volatility to your advantage and average into a position on big down days.***I've been adding to several positions in technology stocks that I like. Just like 3D Systems, many of these companies are sitting on loads of cash and are growing far faster than the broad economy. Plus shares of their stocks are in many cases still quite undervalued.Follow this link to our website and you'll have an opportunity to read a quick review of why small cap stocks, like the ones I'm buying today, offer the best returns for your money right now. The data are pretty convincing, and I think you'll be surprised when you learn that the biggest gains always come from small cap stocks.At the bottom of the page is a link to sign up for a free trial.

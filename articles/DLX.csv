        The positive news was that 2019 guidance was met.
        Negative news is that the growth segments of the company have resumed their decline.
        The terrible 2020 outlook makes the drop of the stock more than justified.","Publications of earnings are events that are known to cause volatility in stock prices. However, the drop of 12.5% that Deluxe Corporation (DLX) faced shortly after trading commenced on the day after it reporting earnings is quite uncommon.Deluxe stock. Source: Seeking Alpha.I have written about Deluxe before. The company is an important player in the market of checks, which is a declining business for obvious reasons. The company knew this too and has been on a multi-year M&A spree to acquire mostly marketing-related services businesses. In my first article on Deluxe, I concluded that this strategy wasn’t working and that ‘Marketing Solutions & Other Services’ posted organic revenue declines, which was obscured by acquisitions. After that, the company seemed to get onto the right track: it stopped in bleeding of Marketing Solutions in 2018, and it made no new acquisitions in 2019. The stock recovered too, gaining 30% from publication of my last article on DLX to the end of 2019.Q4 earnings were clearly a negative surprise, and that needs to be discussed. In this article, I will first explore what happened in Q4 that could have surprised investors, then I will look into some of the deeper issues regarding organic revenue growth and margins.In its 2019 Q3 report, the company issued the following updated outlook for 2019:The company achieved the following in fiscal 2019:Comparing the outlook to the results, I don’t think that the headline results have spooked investors. Clearly it was something else and the 2020 outlook is a prime suspect. There is much to be disappointed about indeed, especially regarding profitability. The 2020 outlook is compared to 2019 results in the table below.Source: author’s own calculations, company Q4 2019 results presentation.The company believes that it will shed 300bps of EBITDA margin in 2020, which is unwelcome news as 2019 was already a deterioration versus 2018. To make matters worse, the decline is accelerating. In 2019 the company saw adjusted EBITDA decline by just $28m versus the prior year, but it expects to lose another $58m in 2020. We should also take into account the way in which adjusted EBITDA is calculated. Actual EBITDA was negative in 2019. The company subtracted restructuring charges from EBITDA and its adjusted EBITDA is declining still.Source: Q4 earnings release.I for one have never been too keen to adjust financial statements for restructuring charges when it comes to companies that are in permanent restructuring mode, like Deluxe. The idea is always that a restructuring is a one-off and that it impacts profitability positively in the next year. In this context, the 2020 outlook is a genuine ‘complete and unmitigated’ disaster.The above discussion doesn’t even mention the EPS outlook, which is impacted more harshly than EBITDA in relative terms because interest expenses don’t usually move in tandem with EBITDA.The 2019 result and 2020 outlook show just how poorly the company has executed its M&A-driven strategic shift over the past years. It took the cash flow from a shrinking cash cow and wasted it on acquisitions that didn’t add a lot of value as I argued in my first article about DLX.However poor the revenue outlook may seem, it is still the bright spot in all of this. A plus of 0.5% looks very modest considering the fact that we are near peak levels of the business cycle. However, this includes the checks business. It takes somewhat more analysis to find out how the Marketing Solutions product category is doing relative to Checks. The future of the company depends on Marketing Solutions and other non-check products, therefore it is important to see how it has done. In the 4Q call (transcript), management stated that the organic sales decline was 2.3% for the company. Actual revenue growth was +0.5%. This tells us that the 2018 acquisitions propped-up the result by 2.8%.Reconciling the product revenue disclosure in the Q4 presentation with the first 9 months product disclosure in the last 10-Q, it is possible to calculate the 2019 product revenue for Checks, Marketing Solutions, and Forms. With the knowledge that the company tries to grow Marking Solutions with its acquisitions, we can easily calculate the organic revenue decline in the other segments.Source: author’s own calculations.The biggest disappointment was Marketing Solutions which resumed its decline after it finally looked to be stopped in 2018. The continuous revenue decline in checks is also hitting hard. For years, the volume decline in that segment has been compensated for by price increases but reality has hit hard for DLX’s cash cow. I bet that the accelerated decline of Checks also explains a good chunk of the margin pressure on the firm in 2018 and 2019.The table below shows where margin pressure hit the company in 2018 and 2019. Note that the Direct Checks segment contains mainly checks directly sold to consumers and this segment has underperformed check product revenue in other business segments. The majority of Checks revenue is made in the Small Business Services segment. Operating income adjusted for impairments and gains on sales. Source: author’s own calculations. Free cash flow (see table below) has fallen back to $220m. The worst part is that it excludes stock based compensation expense, which was almost $15m for the first three quarters of 2019. But let’s say that the $220m figure does reflect underlying FCF. That gives the company a trailing cash flow yield of 12%, which is high. However, the $60m forecasted hit to adjusted EBITDA in 2020 will most likely deliver a severe blow to that cash flow yield, even if restructuring expenses decline.Source: Deluxe Q4 2019 earnings presentation.Considering the figures above, it is chilling to think how they will look if it gets worse after 2020. And it will get worse. Checks, which in my estimation still deliver over half the company’s EBIT, have begun their secular revenue decline while profitability and growth at the other segments lags expectations.ConclusionThe company is facing a secular decline of its major cash cow and fails to add value with its string of acquisitions. Overall, the results and outlook have underperformed my modest expectations since the last summer. However, I do think that the valuation of $37.4, which I estimated at the time, is still in the ballpark. Based on this valuation, I don’t think that the stock is a good buy at $42.75."
4268400,75025,2019-06-05T09:37:17-04:00,"The revenue decline of checks has picked up in 2018.Deluxe has trouble keeping margins stable.The Marketing product group is still not growing organically.After the many headwinds, the stock’s valuation is fair as it captures most of what can go wrong.","Late last year, I wrote a slightly bearish article on Deluxe (DLX), and in the past six months, we have seen two quarterly earnings and a 25% decline in its stock price, so it is time to review.A large part of my thesis was that organic revenue development was lacking - especially at Marketing Services and Other Solutions, or MOS. At the time, the company seemed to manage to grow MOS organically based on its outlook. The sad truth is that this hasn't happened and that this segment remained stable in 2018 and resumed its organic decline in the first quarter.Source: author's own estimates of indexed organic revenue with base year 2012. 1Q 2019 is not annualized and may confuse the overall picture.Checks have also done poorly in 2018, and the trend continued in the first quarter of this year when checks lost 2.9% YoY (FX-adjusted). However, it was not only checks that did poorly, MOS also bled revenue. For example, in the FS segment, it was reported in the Q1 earnings call that the segment declined 2.7% organically, while only 160bps of that can be explained by Checks and Forms. Overall, I calculated the organic decline of MOS to be 1.9% YoY. This isn't the worst part of the story, however.The real disappointment to me is that operating margins have declined quite sharply. Management cited acquisitions as a reason. Again, taking the financial services segment as example, which saw the greatest revenue increase following acquisitions, we observe inorganic growth of 17.4m and an operating income decline of 7.7m in Q1. Of course, this cannot be fully explained by acquisitions. If we take the 300bps YoY OI margin decrease recorded by the Direct Checks segment as representative for the Checks within FS, there is still a $6m OI decline. This means that acquired businesses posted a negative operating income of about $6m. Even when we adjust for items the company likes to adjust for, that would still leave $1m negative OI of acquired business. I find it improbable that a company like Deluxe with its current valuation acquires loss-making businesses, meaning that at least a good chunk of the OI decline must be organic.I may be cherry-picking here within just one quarterly report, but it is nevertheless concerning how the operating margin of MOS is on the way down. That said, (impairment-adjusted) operating income in Q1 was down 28.5% YoY, and the overall picture for 2018 wasn't much better.Source: author's own calculations, adjusted for impairments.The company will transform its reporting segments at the end of this year to represent its future form. The new segments will be payments, cloud, promotional products, and checks. Most importantly, the company wants to expand in digital payments which they describe as 'a multibillion-dollar market growing at 10% to 15% annually'. This may be well true, but it is not easy to capture a profitable slice in this fiercely competitive market where very agile start-ups and well-funded banks are also trying to compete. On the other hand, Deluxe was founded as a payment company, and this story makes more sense than that of providing marketing services to small businesses and build websites for them. In addition, Treasury Management Solutions is the only division that has shown organic growth of any significance. I do like the proposed transformation of operating segments from client type to product type.Management has set a target of $300m net revenue growth in 2023. When reviewing their past organic revenue development, this feels very ambitious. But if they manage to replace even half the operating income lost by checks over that period organically, that will be enough to justify being bullish at the current valuation of the stock.When judging how realistic the financial goals of the company are, we must take into account its track record. For example, as late as Q2 2018, Deluxe expected an organic revenue decline of 0.6% for 2018, which we now know would turn out to be -1.7%. We saw something similar for Q1 2019. Likewise, in January 2018, the company provided a full year outlook that included 4-6% organic MOS revenue growth. For your convenience, I added a 2Q18 presentation slide by the company on the FY 2018 outlook for MOS with the actuals added on the side by myself.Source: company Q2 2018 earnings presentation, modified by authorIt looks like Data Driven Marketing Solutions has become a serious headache for the company. It is even affecting the organic growth of the whole product category. The only positive is that Treasury Management Solutions did hit its organic growth guidance. The point is that forecasting is hard, even for a company management with half the year already in the pocket. So, the $300m net new revenue should be taken with a grain of salt.Another interesting piece of information is the 2% organic growth reported for 2018. My calculations seem to be off by some 205bps, which is peculiar as I use company figures whereby I assume that all decline in Checks and Forms is organic. As it turns out, the difference is in the exited business, which I add to the firm organic decline because I couldn't find any significant cash flows from these 'exits'. Relabelling a line of business one has to shut down for economic reasons as 'an exit' is still an organic decline in my book, and this explains the difference.A clear strong point of the investment case is the strong (recurring) free cash flow generation, at a rate of approximately $300m before M&A, working capital and some other adjustments in 2018. The company's FCF outlook for 2019 is a bit lower at $250-265m. The market cap is $1.6bn, implying a forward FCF yield of about 16%. Needless to say, this looks very cheap.My estimate is that Checks generate $200m EBITDA, which should slowly decline towards zero. This decline was close to $20m in 2018. If this pattern continues, we are at $0 in about 10 years. If we let EBITDA be a proxy for Checks' share in FCF, this means around 45% of FCF comes from Checks. The baseline FCF would then be $140m, while the remaining $110m will decline in the coming years. I believe the company can stabilize and grow the remaining $140m, which would, together with the remaining ~550m ($110m*10/2) FCF from checks, be enough to justify the market cap of $1.6bn and net debt of $900m. I chose to apply an 8% discount rate and 1% perpetual growth rate to the non-checks activities (8% - 1% = 7%). Applying a discount rate of ~8% on the Checks' cash flow will result in a $100m lower valuation than not discounting at all, but I believe that a decline to zero in 10 years may be conservative already, given the strong performance over the past 10 years. All things considered, the valuation looks as follows:In millions of USD, except per share amounts. Source: author's own estimates as of Q1 2019.Increasing the growth rate to 2% will result in a value per share of $45. But with the track record of Deluxe, that would be highly speculative. To me, it looks like the stock is currently trading close to fair value.Clearly, the traditional Checks segment is in an accelerated decline, while a lot of businesses Deluxe acquired over the past years are also not showing organic growth. Operating margins are also not expanding. On the bright side, expectations are lower than they have been in a long time as the stock is trading near six-year lows, which makes me neutral on the stock at its current valuation."
4147635,76785,2018-02-16T12:18:31-05:00,"Market perception of Deluxe Corporation has been simple. Checks are a declining business, which means Deluxe Corporation suffers.If you run the math - which isn't necessarily clear as checks do not have their own segment - declines in the business have been very light.The acquisition binge strategy makes me pause more. Management has not been clear in providing organic growth rates of prior acquisitions, and includes projected future purchases in its 2018 guidance.9% free cash flow yield with this kind of balance sheet appears cheap, and is a function of a confused shareholder base. The company seems ripe for shareholder activism.","I often write about companies entwined in strategic structural decline. The need for navigating tough times occurs often for many companies; market forces inevitably shift. More often than not, management teams are not successful in the effort to diversify in my experience. It can be very difficult for businesses to turn on a dime and adapt to new fundamentals.Pitney Bowes (PBI) is an example that has done an absolutely terrible job of managing the decline in its postage meters and other mail business. That isn’t all too dissimilar from Deluxe Corporation’s (DLX) checks business at first glance, which is also heavily reliant on sales to small and medium businesses.I think most investors have the story wrong here. Much has been written on their pivot to new businesses as the checks business declines. As contribution from checks has dwindled to consolidated revenue, yet earnings per share have held up, the knee-jerk reaction most have is the pivot is a success. Unfortunately, I think this misses the mark and does not tell the real picture.Once you get down to the real numbers, my view is that management’s efforts to diversify have been weak, and that the real success has been managing the decline in its core business. That’s to be lauded by shareholders in its own right, but could lead to significant issues if the company begins losing market share at the rate of the rest of the industry and the transition pivot to new markets collapses.Formed over one hundred years ago, Deluxe Corporation was built on the foundation of physical checks. The company remains one of the largest providers of checks in the United States. There isn’t much of a moat in the process other than reputation and scale, but the business is something that the company has done well for many, many years now on a profitable basis. On the flip side, declines in checks written have been falling consistently, generally experiencing mid single-digit declines annually.This isn’t a new trend, as checks only accounted for one quarter of non-cash payment transactions in 2010; debit/credit card and ACH transactions have dominated the story for years now, with internet-based payments (PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Venmo) taking incremental share as well. Check volumes are down 32% since 2010, now representing just 17% of non-cash transactions according to the Federal Reserve (last data as of 2016 year-end). The company has been faced with pretty heavy structural decline, and the company reported that checks make up 42.2% of revenue at the end of Q3 2017 versus 55.8% in 2013.There are caveats that many investors, at least from my research, are missing. Take this research from Joshua Hudson, CFA, on Seeking Alpha early in 2017. While it hits on many key points I will as well, the focus on most research continues to zoom in on the Federal Reserve data that Deluxe Corporation includes within its SEC filings pointing to structural decline. That’s a mistake. To get there, Deluxe Corporation, while it does not break out checks into its own segment, does provide revenue contribution from checks segment-wide.The Form 10-K has not been filed for 2017 yet (set for February 24, 2017), given current run-rate and reported revenue for 2017, check contributions likely came in at $845mm ($1,966mm revenue at 43% overall revenue over the year). In 2013, the company reported $1,584mm in revenue with 55.8% revenue contribution from checks. That implies $884mm in contribution to the top line from checks, or less than a 5% nominal decline. That’s much less than the Federal Reserve data would imply. But there is even more interesting data to take away.The Direct Checks segment, which sells products and services direct to consumers, has seen revenue fall from $191mm in 2013 to my estimate of $141mm in 2017, much of the decline has likely occurred there. Given ~80% of revenue in Direct Checks has come from check sales versus other products and services allocated to the segment, we can attribute $40mm of the $50mm decline in that segment to checks. That’s the entirety of the decline and implies flat results in check sales to businesses and financial institutions. Given the overall check market has reported volume contraction in excess of 15% over the 2013-2017 time frame, that’s a world of difference and something many are missing. In fact, CEO Lee Schram alluded to this during the Q4 conference call, noting that Deluxe Corporation “saw continued stability” in the core check business.Don’t peg that strong performance on inorganic growth either. From 2014 to Q3 2017, Deluxe Corporation had spent $714mm on acquisitions in its diversification efforts. These have all been very small acquisitions, most of which relate to digital marketing, web hosting, or printed/promotional products. Only a handful would have any exposure to check-writing (e.g., the acquisition of Verify Valid, an electronic check provider, in 2015) and those acquisitions were immaterial.Unfortunately, if investors underestimated the strength of the legacy checks business in the recent year, that means they likely overestimated the success of the diversification efforts. I tend to take that view. Management’s approach to building its diversified product offerings into new outlets like small business marketing, web services, treasury management, and security and risk management look akin to throwing darts at a list of potential purchases.The company made 14 acquisitions in 2016. The acquisition of FMCG Direct was the largest ($184mm), and given the $271mm spent that year implies <$10mm purchase prices for the rest of the assets. This has been a historical trend throughout this revitalization, and I don’t think a $4,000mm enterprise gets improved off the back of this kind of capital allocation.This hodge-podge approach, alongside acquiring companies with no real tangible asset base, is what has built the company into having one of the more quirky balance sheets in the S&P 500 (top 5% as measured by goodwill and intangibles as a percent of total assets). It creates a litany of issues on deal integration. How well can management really integrate 30+ acquisitions over the past three years, most of which are small and have no real infrastructure, into one coherent group? Management's goals to grow cross-sell and scale these businesses seems like a monumental task.That, at least, is reflected in organic growth forecasts. The company expects earnings per share dilution in 2018, and organic revenue growth of just 1%, which accelerates to 3% in 2019 and 2020. I believe this guidance implies ~3% revenue declines in checks, as the coming year is supposed to be a stronger one in the shift to alternative payment methods. Still, that points to a lot of weakness beyond checks. After all, the company has stated it has 25% fewer major bank contracts in checks coming next year, and most have been locked in through 2020 at least.Within the acquisitions Deluxe Corporation has made, there has been weakness in fraud security and risk management (guided for 6% decline next year), the legacy forms business, as well as some poor results in data-driven marketing and small business marketing that likely carry over some weak results. I found guidance given on the Q4 call as a little infuriating, given it includes tuck-in acquisitions – no organic growth on a segment level basis was given, nor for existing new businesses.I find this frustrating when viewed through the lens of a potential shareholder. The propagation of checks sales throughout every current reporting segment does nothing to dispel investor confusion. How can I tell how the shift away from checks is going if the data is not provided granularly?With all this said, the company basically prints money currently. GAAP results are marred by acquisition-related amortization, which is expected to total $92mm in 2018. Guidance is for $370mm in operating cash flow at the midpoint, and with $55mm in capital expenditure guidance, free cash flow is set to be $315mm, more once you consider that 30-40% of spending next year appears to be growth-driven.Lenders certainly aren’t concerned, particularly as total outstanding debt slipped below $700mm at the end of last year. With EBITDA expectations of $500mm for 2018, leverage is 1.4x. Interest rates on the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility were incrementally above 2.5% last year, and management expects to exit next year paying roughly 3% given expected moves upward in LIBOR. That's dirt cheap.There is massive underlying value here, as that guidance implies a greater than 9% free cash flow yield versus today's market price. Such valuations are rare in this market, especially with this safe balance sheet. I don’t think that is the company’s fault, but blame falls squarely on management. Providing more granular data, primarily to confirm my numbers on the actual declines in checks and to give organic guidance on the acquisitions made so far, would do wonders in providing clarity."
4224810,75025,2018-11-27T12:31:17-05:00,Checks have performed remarkably well over the years.Revenue of Deluxe's growth center is declining organically.Operating margins of the growth areas are sub-par.,"A week ago, I wrote an article about the Magic Formula. And once again, Deluxe corp. (DLX) appeared on the Magic Formula list. In this article I will examine how their traditional business has held up, as will I evaluate the results of their M&A strategy. I was surprised by these results and have to conclude that over the past couple of years, Deluxe's legacy business has outperformed its acquired growth both on returns and revenue growth.Source: made by author using Bloomberg data. Their primary operation has always been printing and selling checks to businesses and individuals. They are one of the USA’s largest check providers. There are three segments in the company on which it reports: Small Business Services, Financial Services and Direct Checks (SBS, FS, DC, respectively). Within the segments, there are three product groups: Checks, Marketing Solutions and Forms.Source: Deluxe presentationFor the past 8 years, Deluxe has been growing at a rapid pace. This is despite the structural decline of their traditional checks business. This decline has been well-documented by the Federal Reserve with volume declines of 3% per year from 2012-2015, for example (page 3 of this doc.). The growth that is visible in the chart below largely comes from Marketing Solutions, which is the area in which Deluxe attempts to grow both organically and inorganically.Source: Deluxe presentationFrom 2013 to 2017, Deluxe spent almost $800m on acquisitions. That comes down to about $16 per share. From year-end 2012 to today Deluxe shares advanced by close to that amount.Before we dive into the M&A strategy, it is useful to understand a little bit about the performance of the checks business over the past years. Though it is in a decline, checks are obviously still a major contributor to the company’s revenue and cash flow.Hurdle number one to understanding this segment is that Deluxe doesn’t consistently report revenue and operating income by product type. From notes in the annual reports, I managed to compile the following.Figures in red are estimates. Source: author’s estimates and company 10-K filings. Overall, checks go down, but the decline is worst for DC, which sells directly to consumers. SBS, on the other hand, has grown it checks business over the years. From comments by management it has become clear that there has been pressure on check volumes, but Deluxe has been able to increase prices. The company is sparse with numbers, but they do disclose margin impact of acquisitions, for example this passage from the FS segment of the 2017 10-K:“The increase in revenue for 2017, as compared to 2016, was driven by growth in MOS revenue of approximately $106.0 million, primarily from incremental revenue from acquired businesses of approximately $117.0 million. The increase from acquisitions was partially offset by a decrease in Deluxe Rewards revenue of approximately $9.0 million driven primarily by pricing adjustments and the loss of Verizon Communications Inc. as a customer.”M&A added $117m in revenue, and got a meager $7m of operating income to show for it. Meanwhile, they lost $11m in marketing revenue in the FS segment alone. This may seem like a one-off but there is a clear pattern. Each year, the annual report tells us that in FS M&A decreased margin by multiple percentage points (averages 2.6% over past 3 years) and volume decline was another detractor, while cost reductions and price increases are mentioned as positive contributors to the margin of the segment.It seems that it pays to have size in a declining industry, judging by the robust margin profile.Source: author’s estimates. For checks within DC, I used the overall DC margin as checks consistently make up 85% of DC. From DC it also became clear that selling checks to small customers has robust margins over time (operating margin increased from 2012 to 2016 by 3%-pts). Within the SBS segment I chose to keep the margin development in-line with the segment, both increasing 3%-pts over the years 2012-2017. For FS, I used the segment margin for the checks margin in 2012, as checks were 80% of FS revenue. Over time, operating margin at FS declined roughly in tandem with the relative increase of Marketing Solutions within the segment. I cross checked my estimates with product gross margin developments, which Deluxe discloses separately from service gross margins. These gross margins remained stable over the years, save a decline in 2014. My belief is that the remaining margin strength comes from cost cutting. Given the results of my estimates above, and gross margins on products overall, I conclude that checks have performed quite well over time.Considering that M&A is an important source of growth going forward, it is important to examine the results they achieved in the past. Management has been sparse in providing information of the performance of these acquisitions and in this article I attempt to disentangle what it has done for the company. So we must ask ourselves: Do the acquisitions deliver lasting revenue growth? Did it achieve decent returns? Did it give investors the change they can believe in?The evidence would say not really.The company discloses organic revenue growth for the company (-1.1% for the past 5 years). The company also discloses how much revenue was added by acquisitions. Because the company doesn’t do acquisitions in Forms or Checks we can assume all inorganic growth falls on Marketing Solutions. I also don’t agree with management’s vision that exited businesses are inorganic, unless the exited business was sold at a good price, of course.I also cross checked with comments in the 10-K, e.g. in 2017 Marketing Solutions added $172m reported incremental revenue to FS and SBS combined, while combined marketing revenue for these segments increased by only ~$140m.The results table below shows a rather interesting pattern.Source: author’s own estimates of indexed organic revenue with base year 2012. Figures for 2018 use the outlook for 2018 issued by the company in October. It seems that Marketing Solutions hasn’t grown organically over the past six years. This is quite puzzling. We have seen years of macro economic tailwinds and Deluxe was in the luxurious position to cherry pick (acquire) the type of businesses that fit their company and will grow it in the future. I am surprised and appalled at their growth record. Maybe I missed acquisitions in checks and forms to adjust for, but I doubt it.Checks have performed remarkably well, given their secular decline. This is peculiar, but it makes sense because Deluxe has been able to raise the prices of their checks. So there is a volume decline, but a price expansion that also helps keeping margins afloat.As mentioned before, the company doesn’t disclose gross margins for checks, forms, or Marketing Solutions as a product category. They do disclose operating income margins for segments.Source: company 10-K filings. 2017 was adjusted for an asset impairment in SBS.From that, combined with management comments over the years, it is possible to distill an estimate of overall margins per category, like I did with checks earlier in this article.Source: author’s own estimates and calculations. For estimating margins in each product type I made an estimate of each product type’s operating margin within each segment. Adjusted for one-offs. To the company’s credit, they do seem to be able to grow margins in Marketing Solutions. However, looking at the overall picture, I see that they have only added roughly $85m to annual operating income in Marketing Solutions from 2012 to 2017. As a reminder, they spent $800m to get there while I cleaned 2017 for a major impairment in SBS and let the full credit fall on Marketing Solutions.Though margins help us to get a clear picture of how the acquisitions add value to the firm overall, returns on investments are much more important in the end. And to see if the M&A strategy of Deluxe was successful there, I looked at ROA of the company over time. As a first step, I compiled the assets by segment. The chart below shows the result.Assets are in USD millions. Source: company 10-K filings, compiled by author. The chart above is telling. Given that over 25% of total operating income is made in the FS segment, and this fraction hasn’t really changed over time, it is somewhat troublesome to see assets explode there. The chart below shows the actual ROA by business segment. Unsurprisingly, FS sees a massive decline and drags the company with it. This is a direct result from the acquisitions the company has done over the years.Source: author’s own calculations. Segment ROA = segment EBIT divided by segment assets. Note that the total excludes corporate assets. The Magic Formula attaches a lot of value to return invested capital. The underlying idea is that businesses can grow organically at a high return on their investment. The returns at Deluxe have been under pressure for years and it hasn’t been growing organically. More acquisitions, as the company plans to do, won’t help in this regard.Despite the resilient margins in checks, I doubt whether they will be able to continue to maintain their checks operating income of close to $200m. Direct Checks, a traditional profit centre has been facing increasing revenue pressure. Meanwhile, its new acquisitions have also failed to show organic revenue growth or add to operating margins.On the bright side, the company trades at an (impairment adjusted) trailing EV/EBIT of 8, which isn't too expensive. Cash flow looks better but is a bit more tricky, as it is debatable how to treat amortization in this regard.Overall, shareholders would be best served by a pause of M&A activity to get more cash flow and earnings visibility. It would also give management the opportunity focus on organic revenue development. If that happens, the stock is worth consideration. So far, it doesn’t seem like the company is willing to change its ways with the new CEO committed to the old strategy."

A lot of business opening activity depends on bank lending. The company's revenue is also threatened by Wall Street's credit markets, so there we have at least two unknowns which may at any time put DLX's business volume into decline.

4209134,83156,2018-10-01T09:30:30-04:00,"DLX is down more than 25% this year due to heightened fears about the secular decline in check printing.But the market has been aware of this risk for a long time, and DLX continues to offset these declines through acquisitions of higher-growth businesses, all while keeping ROIC constant.This is a good opportunity for patient investors with a longer-term focus.","Shares of Deluxe Corp. (DLX) have fallen more than 25% this year (compared to an increase of 8.7% for the S&P 500 (SPY)) as a result of larger-than-expected declines in the company’s core check printing segment. The secular decline in checks is a concern, no doubt, especially since revenues from check sales account for a large part of DLX’s business. But the market has been aware of this risk for a long time, and DLX continues to transform itself through an aggressive tuck-in acquisition strategy that is more than making up for the declines in its core business. We believe that the market has overreacted and that this could be a good entry point for patient investors with a longer-term focus.The threat to DLX’s legacy business caused by the secular decline in checks isn’t anything new for investors familiar with Deluxe Corp. In fact, the total number of checks written in the US has been in decline since the mid-1990s and declined 5% per year between 2012 and 2016. DLX’s check-related businesses have been weak for some time now, but you wouldn’t know it by looking at the stock’s performance over the past decade (Figure 1).Figure 1: 10-Year Stock Performance ChartSource: MorningstarBetween 2008 and 2017, DLX returned ~450% (including dividends), outperforming the S&P and the business services sector by a considerable amount. This is thanks to an aggressive tuck-in acquisition strategy that is gradually transforming the company from its legacy check-related businesses towards higher-growing marketing solutions and other services such as treasury management, data-driven solutions, and web services. Growth in these segments is more than offsetting the declines in checks, and what’s most impressive is that DLX has been able to accomplish this without destroying shareholder value. Quite the contrary, DLX’s ROIC has remained constant within the mid-to-high teen range (Figure 2) over the last decade (compared to an average cost of capital of ~6), and free cash flow has almost doubled (Figure 2).Figure 2: Historical ROIC, FCF/ShareSource: Madison Investment ResearchThe high-margin nature of these businesses (average EBITDA margin of ~24% over the past decade) means that DLX is able to implement its growth strategy without relying too heavily on external capital. DLX has kept its D/E ratio below 1 for the past five years and interest coverage above 10x for the past three, giving plenty of protection to the dividend (which currently yields 2.11%).The declines in DLX’s check businesses may have been larger than anticipated so far this year, but we think the market is overreacting. In Q2, direct checks revenue fell 9.8%. However, small business services revenues (which makes up the bulk of the business) grew 5%, which kept total revenues flat. Revenues from marketing solutions and other services, the key areas that DLX has targeted for growth, increased 7% in the quarter and now account for 41% of total revenues. Management plans to grow these segments to 60% of total revenues by 2020, so the declining revenues from checks will become less and less significant as these segments account for a larger and larger share of the profits.In this light, the market’s fears about the impact of a declining checks business seem overblown, and we think this is a good opportunity for patient investors with a longer-term focus. DLX now trades at a free cash flow yield of 10.3% and P/CF multiple of 8.2x, compared to an average P/CF of 10.5x over the last 5 years. This valuation assumes that DLX past growth rates will decelerate if not taper out completely as a result of the checks business, but the data just isn’t there to support this theory.Management is guiding for total revenue of $2.045-2.065B this year, of which $895-910M (44%) will come from marketing solutions and “other services”. These figures imply growth rates of 4.5% and 20%, respectively, and this mid-single digit rate of revenue growth is consistent with what the company has averaged over the past decade. It’s a similar story on the bottom line as well: management is expecting EPS in the $5.23-5.35 range (adjusted EPS of $5.68-5.80), which implies an increase of 12% over last year’s earnings.We believe that the current fears related to declines in check printing present an excellent opportunity for long-term investors. DLX has shown that it can outgrow the decline in checks and, more importantly, that it can do so profitably. DLX is firmly on track to meet its longer-term targets, and checks will become less and less of a factor as this process plays out."
4257142,104535,2019-04-26T12:40:38-04:00,"Originally focused on Checks and Forms, DLX is transitioning to becoming a provider of a DIY and concierge suite of digital marketing and web services.These services, besides being inherently valuable, also position DLX to benefit from the drop-shipping eCommerce revolution.DLX's checks business, although terminal, provides the cash and financial health to sustain its transition into becoming a platform for these higher growth and more valuable services.Its fundamental undervaluation may be hidden from screeners due to transient earnings headwinds from write-downs and other factors.","Now with the inversion of the yield curve, markets are becoming more sure of an impending recession, and as a consequence, there's a flight to value. Finding that extraordinary bargain may be hard these days, but there will always be some special-situation issues that are overlooked. One such bargain, in our humble opinion, is Deluxe Corporation (DLX). Once a provider of checks and forms, it is now repositioning as a provider of web and online marketing services targeted at small businesses and financial services. Although the repositioning was driven by an acquisition strategy of questionable success, write-downs on which have been a transient headwind for earnings, it nonetheless leaves Deluxe gaining more than 30% of their revenue from marketing solutions and web services alone. With their presence in these markets, I believe that they stand to benefit from the incoming sole proprietor and online business revolution, which given their valuation makes them a great GARP investment.As jobs are becoming disrupted and the US public, leveraged with student and car loans, seek to make money wherever they can in an increasingly gig-oriented economy, the value of risky, personal entrepreneurial initiatives has gone up. While before, small businesses and sole proprietorships selling niche products or services found it difficult to economise on customer acquisition, now with the possibility of small incremental expenditures on digital marketing ad campaigns supported by social media platforms like Facebook (FB), a business of any size can effectively generate leads in a manageable quantity.According to the various gurus in the digital marketing space, getting a positive spread between lifetime value (LTV) of a customer and customer acquisition costs (CAC) only really takes a reasonably crafted product and a good understanding of the people in your niche market. Indeed, the success in generating a positive ROI on advertising dollars has made running digital marketing businesses very profitable. Both small services, such as Poland-based WebUp, and larger services such as Deluxe's Marketing Suite and Alex Becker's Market Hero, have sprung up everywhere. This is an obvious consequence of the value that you still get as an advertiser by exposing your product on platforms where people spend an increasing amount of their time, with these platforms accruing huge demand-side benefits such as better profiling of convertible customers.A consequence of the ease of creating the LTV-CAC spread in niche markets has been the Shopify (SHOP) drop-shipping revolution, evident from Shopify's massive sales growth, whereby entrepreneurs will sell all sorts of niche products like wolf mugs and cat socks on Shopify eCommerce stores. Drop-shipping is the logistical principle whereby orders are taken before the supplies to produce the product are sourced, allowing for entrepreneurs to dip their toe in the market to gauge demand without having to commit a lot of capital.Digital marketing is a critical component of the drop-shipping revolution, partially because it's eliminated indivisibilities in ad expenditure and allows entrepreneurs running even the smallest of businesses to scale their business; however, they want to suit any market. Just as critically, digital marketing gives advertisers a lot of options to target profiles with a high degree of specificity through tailored campaigns. Incremental investment in these campaigns allows sellers to iterate their customer profile as they get more data on which customers are turning out to be the most impressionable. Digital marketing, together with drop-shipping, allows almost any entrepreneur to implement a very lean business model and the value in these low risk businesses could become a substantial stimulant of a small business revolution driven by ordinary, enterprising people.Making money on ad dollars isn't as simple as it sounds though. Defining and understanding the niche for your products can be difficult as well as choosing how to reach it effectively. This is the way Deluxe delivers value with its marketing suite through the provision of concierge or DIY digital marketing services that help you manage all your options. Its various services, like SEO, social media, and email marketing services as well as logo, landing page, and web-page design, can be tacked on to the basic service for additional subscription fees providing massive scope of advertising methods for clients. With the concierge service, you also have a campaign manager who can help you manage your options and run a campaign that is designed to market your product to your niche who will take initiative with choices regarding how to generate leads and where to hunt for them. Working with someone experienced in this area can be very helpful in keeping down CAC, especially when they are well versed in how to run ads with as high an impression threshold as possible, impressions being the metric by which social media platforms bill advertisers. With the various marketing avenues and other web services that Deluxe provides, it is positioned as a provider of a service that will become increasingly important as businesses, ranging from consulting to consumer goods businesses both small and large, continue to leverage increasingly valuable social media platforms to make digital marketing the epicentre of their sales-to-cash generation strategy.So I've tried to make the case that digital marketing companies are a valuable vendor to corporations of many sizes and types, but the question is why would an investor be interested in Deluxe Corporation, which is in the tricky process of moving from one very different business to another? Fundamentally, special situations like a repositioning can yield extraordinarily high returns due to the uncertainties, but in the case of Deluxe Corporation, certain characteristics of the business lend itself to a thesis that the repositioning is less risky than what the market may believe.Even though its check business is terminal, due to the fact that the use of checks is in structural decline, checks is still a highly cash generative business. Because of the cash contribution of the checks business, which still accounts for a plurality of revenue, DLX is able to achieve an outstanding overall cash conversion margin of 17.7% of sales. This cash generation has been important for maintaining the financial health of the business as well as financing the acquisitions involved in Deluxe's repositioning.The high degree of cash conversion also opens up DLX's debt capacity substantially, and this is evident in the high degree of bank trust placed in the business. In January, Deluxe's total facility commitment reached $1.15 billion, which is already half the book value of the business' total assets and the company's current market cap (10-K Outlook for 2019). Further evidence of the bank's confidence lies in the fact that a large part of the debt is variable rate, an indenture detail that the bank must have been comfortable saddling onto Deluxe (10-K Capital Resources). The availability of funds from operations and also from creditors is important as Deluxe continues to navigate after its pivot and attempt to solidify its position in the digital marketing segment.Additionally, the acquired data-management technologies that position Deluxe as vendors for the oncoming small business revolution are already being applied to financial services customers, one of Deluxe's biggest and oldest markets. Treasury management, security management and data driven marketing services provided to the financial clients are growing healthily, with the most recent earnings release showing a 9.8% increase in revenue from this segment. This segment is the largest and a growing source of cash that can continue to support Deluxe in its transition, as well as sustain its debt.As the small business digital marketing service picks up speed, creditors can expect that the possibility of financial stress from the debt load will be reduced even further. With the Deluxe Marketing Suite business model being highly oriented around subscription based services that lock in clients for at least a year of payments, as the marketing suite customer base grows, the cash generative power of the business will likewise grow with great efficiency.For the valuation, we'll be using an expectations-based DCF approach, whereby we will establish, based on market forecasts and past performance, what the expectations are for the company's future performance.We will assume that interest rates on the company debt will continue to be at 3.8%. We will also use an implied equity premium figure of 5.5%, as well as a Beta of 1.39 for the main CAPM inputs. We will assume the risk-free rate as the yield on 5-year US government bonds. The cash and accounting tax rate will be assumed the same at 21%, the TCJA corporate tax rate. We will assume that the market's collective model is incorporating the consensus forecasts of sales growth and operating profit (EBIT margin) for Deluxe. For the business' capital intensity, we are using the historical incremental investment rates in working capital and in fixed capital net of historical depreciation. Using their total non-operating assets as well as their contractual obligations net of the over-funded balance of pension plans, we get the following valuation.In order to justify the price, instead of the business' revenues growing at all, it would have to decline by 30%, followed by no revenue growth in perpetuity. Assuming that a growth appreciation period of only 1 year is reasonable at the forecast 2.3% sales growth rate, the business would already be trading at a 33% discount.Expectations for Deluxe seem unreasonably low. Given the current growth market of financial services and the potential onset of a small business revolution, a decline in revenue at all doesn't seem very likely, yet a substantial one of 30% seems to be priced in.Naturally, this supposed undervaluation could be an illusion of our model. DCF models are always rather sensitive, and the dynamics of their terminal value assumptions compound the sensitivity problem. Even though as substantial a discount as this one is usually not entirely a consequence of a faulty model or sensitive assumptions, it still could be.But it could also be that DLX is indeed an overlooked opportunity. Due to recent write-downs on acquisitions, there is contraction below the operating line, meaning that P/E based screeners are not likely to pick Deluxe up as a potential value opportunity. Additionally, it's classified by big data services like CapIQ as being part of the declining checks and forms industry. The fact that it's also a rather small company by market cap and revenues may also preclude it from being investigated by larger market actors. As such, Deluxe could very well be an untapped opportunity, still with substantial upside, waiting to be snatched up by the more nimble, individual investors who are able to stomach the risk of failed execution in the repositioning process with the onus of debt, as well as a continued trend of value destruction through acquisitions."
4098700,36431,2017-08-14T13:14:08-04:00,"Deluxe is one of the largest providers of checks in the U.S.It's continuing to diversify its business into things like marketing solutions.Its focus on small business could be a very profitable niche, especially if tax reform is coming down the road.","Deluxe Corporation (DLX) is a company that's now been around over 100 years, primarily as a provider of checks. While this might be a dying business, the company has also successfully expanded into other business lines such as eChecks, marketing, and even FinTech. I accidentally stumbled upon the business after ordering checks for my primary checking account and realizing that the checks themselves were being ordered through another company. That company was Deluxe, so I decided to take a closer look at it after confirming that it was publicly traded.Deluxe dominates the dying checks business. It's the leading direct-to-consumer check supplier, with roughly $5.5 million customers. Despite its still lucrative (adjusted) operating margins of roughly 34.9% (according to its most recent investor presentation), it's a business in decline that's slowly being eroded by debit and credit cards. According to the most recent data from a Federal Reserve study (as cited by Deluxe in its most recent 10-K), checks still accounted for roughly 13% of non-cash transactions, but debit, credit, and ACH transactions all exceeded the number of checks written in 2015.The company has also adapted into more modern fields, especially over the last five years. As the checks business has fallen from 58.8% of sales in 2012 to only 46.8% in fiscal 2016, Marketing Solutions and Other Services has grown to 33.4% - versus only 18.8% five years ago. MOS is also lucrative in that much of its revenue is recurring in nature.The company is primarily focusing on its Small Business segment, which now accounts for 65% of sales, but maintains lower adjusted operating margins of 17.9%. Sales of business checks and forms continues to decline, but Deluxe now provides marketing on demand solutions, web design, logo & hosting services, as well as payroll services. It also takes care of security and fraud, complementing its eCheck services. Its newer services, including marketing, now account for roughly 32% of the sales in this segment, while the more niche business centered around checks and forms still make up the bulk.Its Financial Services segment provides roughly 27% of overall sales, with checks accounting for over half of the segment's revenue, while marketing and other solutions make up most of the rest at roughly 43% of segment sales. The segment boasts 22.7% adjusted operating margins.The final segment is Direct Checks, which comprises only about 8% of overall revenue. It also maintains the most lucrative margins, however, as previously mentioned.I created the below model (and all other, unless otherwise noted) using data from the firm's most recent 10-K.Due to the subjective and fickle nature of estimating a true cost of equity, I also decided to run a range of various equity costs, as well as their individual impact on the firm's overall weighted average cost of capital, or WACC. This range can be seen below.The firm also has a restructuring charge embedded in its income statement for fiscal 2016. I decided to adjust the firm's ROIC, therefore, by excluding the charge.While it appears Deluxe earns illusive economic profits (ROIC exceeding its WACC) even with the highest of equity costs, this is really only the first step, because the company also utilizes off-balance sheet financing in the form of operating leases. Next, I'd like to add these leases into the capital structure, and visualize their impact on the firm's balance sheet and its ROIC.I began by discounting the off-balance sheet leases at the internal rate of return of its capital leases.Then I inserted them into the firm's overall capital structure to arrive at an adjusted debt-to-equity ratio.The capital base obviously expands when the operating leases are added, while also pushing the firm's debt-to-equity ratio up from 0.86x to 0.91x. We now have the denominator of the ROIC equation. To arrive at the numerator, aka net operating profit after tax, or NOPAT, we need to first adjust Deluxe's operating profit to account for the leases.Now we can take taxes into account to arrive at an estimate for its adjusted NOPAT, and divide it by the adjusted capital base.After accounting for the leases, its ROIC is knocked down a peg or two, but the restructuring charge hasn't been stripped out yet. Below is the final ROIC number, excluding the one-time charge.Stripping out the charge and accounting for off-balance sheet leases gives us an adjusted return on invested capital of a touch over 15%, which is still impressive, especially when compared to the adjusted WACC figures below that also account for the leases.Larger amounts of cheaper debt lowers not only its ROIC but also the overall cost of capital. I will conclude this section stating that the firm earns economic profits, probably due to its high margin business that dominates a niche industry, which, while might be in secular decline, has little competition. Who wants to enter the check printing business at this stage of the game and compete with Deluxe? I'd hazard a guess that very few companies (if any at all).The lingering question that remains is whether or not the firm can continue generating these excess profits going forward, by effectively managing the secular decline in checks while also simultaneously expanding its Marketing Solutions and Other Services, or MOS, business to offset losses in the dying checks business.Deluxe knows that it's probably wise to diversify its overall focus away from checks. Its MOS business has grown from just 16% of its Small Business Services revenue in 2009 to 32% of segment sales in fiscal 2016. It's guiding for 35% of segment sales in 2017. This is encouraging, but the risks remain in management's execution.MOS was only 5% of Financial Services segment revenue in 2009, but has grown to encompass 43% of it in 2016 and is expected to equal about 55% of the segment's sales in 2017. Deluxe has aggressively expanded its treasury management solutions business, as well as data driven marketing solutions within this segment, and plans to continue to integrate its acquisitions and grow this part of the segment going forward. MOS is expected to account for 5% more, or roughly 38%, of Deluxe's overall sales in fiscal 2017, with a goal of reaching 40% in fiscal 2018. Management continues to manage the declining checks business by growing these ones, which over time should make the decline in checks more tolerable.The firm also remains focused on small business, citing that roughly 50% of small businesses don't even have a website. Deluxe wants to illustrate to these businesses that brand awareness (and increased sales) can be driven by its digital marketing solutions, which includes web design, SEO, and email marketing. It's also utilizing its established relationships with the banking industry to grow its financial services data-driven marketing services, which the firm cites is a $7.2 billion market.The biggest risk I see here is in the execution, but as long as management is growing the MOS business, keeping costs in check, and holding onto double-digit returns on invested capital, I'm not too worried.Now I'd like to examine the firm's return on equity, with the below five-part DuPont analysis.While the drop in its ROE initially looks worrying, the DuPont explains some of the drop is simply attributed to the modest 25% drop in leverage. Asset turnover has taken a slight dive as well, with the rate of asset growth exceeding the rate of revenue growth. This might be attributable to acquisitions more so than weakening efficiency, however, as the balance sheet has been injected with more goodwill.Margins also appear to remain intact. Stripping out the restructuring charge, ROE looks more like this:There were also restructuring charges in the two previous years before as well. Looking at 2015, excluding charges, and using the same three-year average tax rate, puts net income at roughly $223,365 (in thousands) and ROE at about 37.23%. 2014's net income excluding restructuring charges came in at roughly $205,297.15 (in thousands), with ROE at about 41.75%. Adjusted net margins for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, were roughly 12.61%, 12.58%, and 12.64%.It appears underlying margins are relatively stagnant, which isn't surprising considering the company is slowly shifting away from the higher margin checks business and moving into growthier lines of business. This is a delicate balancing act for its overall margins, but so far there hasn't been any significant deterioration in them. The big drop in its ROE seems to be more from decreasing leverage, not weakening business fundamentals, therefore.Deluxe Corporation seems to be managing the secular decline in its check printing business relatively well. It continues to dominate a business that is in fact likely dying, but it also likely faces little competition because of this same fact. Management wants the checks business to be split with the MOS business at about 40% of sales each by 2018, with the forms, accessories and other businesses accounting for the rest. At some point, the checks business might stabilize, but as of now it continues to shrink. I think that because of the lack of competition, perhaps Deluxe can continue to be very profitable in this niche.At only about 12.86 times expected 2017 earnings and 12.23 times estimated average 2018 earnings, DLX shares look cheap superficially, but this isn't much cheaper than the five-year average of 13, and it's actually above the thirteen-year median of only about 11.27. Shares are likely trading around fair value based on those numbers, in my opinion.Despite the lower margins inherent in the company's current small business operations, this could also experience a potential tailwind going forward from any future tax reform. If tax reform is ever successfully pushed through, Deluxe would not only benefit almost immediately due to its relatively high tax rate, but in theory, it could also be a major benefactor because of its high concentration on America's small businesses - which also maintain some of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.Could this mean a higher multiple as well for the overall business? I'm not sure, but it would likely mean a boost to the bottom line, which is of course the 'E' in the PE ratio. One thing's for sure, though, Deluxe Corporation has evolved into more than just a simple check printing business.If you enjoyed this article and would like to receive further updates and articles in the future, please feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button at the top of the page by the author's name."

        Deluxe generates nearly 50% of revenue from the sale of checks but don't put a nail in the coffin just yet.
        Despite the secular decline in their primary business, Deluxe is growing revenue in other ways while still remaining profitable.","Deluxe (NYSE:DLX) is a $3.5 billion company that has grown revenue for seven consecutive years, maintained consistent operating income margins around 20%, and is increasingly returning capital to shareholders from cash flow. That kind of performance is enough to gain my attention as a potential investment.These results are in spite of the secular decline of their primary business of selling checks to individuals, small businesses, and financial institutions. Let's take a look at how they are doing it.Secular Decline of Check WritingThe company reports revenue from three segments: Small Business Services, Financial Services, and Direct Checks. Of those business segments, 40.1%, 59.7%, and 84.6% of their revenue came from checks in 2015.In their 2015 annual report, Deluxe references a 2013 report from the Federal Reserve which explains how check usage is being impacted by other forms of payment such as debit cards, credit cards, ACH, and online payments.A 9.2% annual decline from 2009 to 2012 in check usage would indicate a bleak outlook for a company generating the majority of their revenue from the sales of checks.Source: 2013 Federal Reserve Payments StudyThe secular decline in checks has not slowed Deluxe's revenue growth. Revenue has grown for seven consecutive years, going on eight, since recovering from the downturn in 2008 at about an average annual rate of 4.7%.DLX Revenue (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsIn addition to revenue growth, gross profit margins have been maintained at around 63-65%, operating margins near 20%, and net profit margins at 12%. The company consistently hits these margins year after year with very little variance. Analyzing a company with stable revenue growth and margins makes it much easier to estimate the present value of future cash flows.Source: Deluxe 2015 Annual ReportDeluxe is Adapting to a Changing MarketWhen a company's primary business enters secular decline they can either evolve or die. Deluxe is in the process of transitioning to ensure their 100+ year history continues for the foreseeable future. They are evolving in three ways.1) Pricing Increases and Efficiency GainsTotal orders have declined since 2011 but pricing increases have more than offset the lost orders as revenue per order increased from $25 to over $33. The company is also operating more efficiently with 4 fewer printing facilities to handle almost the same number of orders.As a percent of revenue, SG&A expenses have fallen from 45% in 2011 to 43.5% for the past 12 months. A 1.5% decrease might not seem like much but it equates to about $27.5 million in lower costs per year.Source: Deluxe 2015 Annual Report2) Evolving into a Service CompanyThe writing is on the wall for the future of checks; however, there are still transactions that require checks and thus there will continue to be demand for them. Just because a product is in secular decline does not mean it will not continue to be a profitable business. Landline phones, tobacco products, and cable TV are also in secular decline but remain very profitable businesses.The company recognizes this and as revenue from checks has declined their market solutions and other services segment has grown. Their marketing services segment includes a variety of services for small businesses such as logo design, printing services, website design, search engine marketing, and social media marketing.This may seem like an odd transition from the production of checks but from the very beginning their core customer focus has been on small businesses. They have a track record of profitably providing a needed service to their over 4.5 million small business customers and growing this part of their business. The majority of this growth is coming from acquisitions.Source: Deluxe 2015 Annual Report3) Acquisition SpendingThe company has been on a bit of a spending spree the past several years. We see the majority of the acquired intangible assets were accounted for as customer lists/relationships.Source: Deluxe 2015 Annual ReportIn 2016, we see the acquisitions continued almost monthly. The term ""selected assets"" makes me nervous. Do we really know what this money is being spent on and is it accretive to shareholders?Source: Deluxe 2016 3Q 10-QIn addition, these acquisitions and past acquisitions have lead to a substantial amount of goodwill on the balance sheet. As of 9/30/16, the company had a total of $989.6 million goodwill on a $1.94 billion balance sheet. That means about 51% of their balance sheet is being represented by a ""plug"" figure that accounts for the overpayment of the book value of assets acquired.That seemed quite high but just to be sure I checked to see where Deluxe ranks in terms of goodwill as a percent of total assets relative to other companies in the S&P 400 Index and the Russell 2000 Index.In the S&P 400, Deluxe has the 10th highest goodwill to total assets.Source: BloombergDeluxe has the 40th highest goodwill to assets in the Russell 2000.Source: BloombergAre Impairments on the Horizon?Since 2010, the company spent nearly $600 million on acquisitions. In that same time period, Deluxe returned $578.9 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Only time will tell if these investments turn out to be beneficial for shareholders over the long-term.The problem is management can't always correctly value a transaction which means they more than likely overpaid for some of them. Thus far, there have only been $37.5 million of impairments recorded since 2008.With half of the balance sheet in goodwill, at some point in the future there has to be more impairments. Goodwill stays on the balance sheet until it is impaired since it can not be amortized. If the customers on these ""customer lists/relationships"" decide to find another company to do business with, what is the value of the list? It probably rounds to zero.Goodwill is simply a plug figure and does not affect cash flows. It is run through the income statement and lowers earnings in that period. Impairments also reduce the total assets on the balance sheet as they are written off. Assuming impairment of half the goodwill, the balance sheet value falls to $1.45 billion. Rather than having a 31.8% debt to total asset ratio as they currently do, it would increase to 42.7% based on the lower asset value. Higher debt ratios increase financial leverage and lead to a more risky credit profile, thus increasing their cost of debt.In addition, the book value of equity would fall substantially. A write-off of half the goodwill would cause the book value of equity to decline from $17.49 per share to around $7.30 per share based on 9/30/16 numbers. While I am not suggesting that will happen in the near future, this is certainly a risk to consider.Is Deluxe a buy?Deluxe reported impressive revenue growth and operating results consistently over the past seven years despite the declining revenue from their primary business. The number of acquisitions they have completed to generate this growth is a concern due to the large balance of goodwill on the balance sheet.Analysts can choose to discount goodwill when evaluating the balance sheet or simply take it at face value. The one saving grace is that goodwill does not impact cash flows. Even if the entire goodwill were to be written off tomorrow, the cash coming into the company would not be affected. It is simply an accounting process of running the loss through the income statement. I'm not sure investors could overlook the impact on earnings though and the stock price would suffer.Impairments also reflect negatively on management if it turns out they made poor use of shareholders' capital by overpaying for acquisitions. This is especially true since more capital has been spent on acquisitions than has been returned to shareholders since 2010.Call me crazy but despite these concerns, I have not written off Deluxe as an investment. This seems like a company that could have been undervalued by the market due to the nature of the check business. The stock has rallied over 17% since the election in November so there may or may not be any value left.I intend to follow-up this article with a proper valuation of Deluxe and ultimately decide if the return potential outweighs the risks going forward.Make sure to follow me to be notified when the follow-up article is posted. I welcome all feedback on my articles in the comments section below."
4040609,102742,2017-01-30T09:33:25-05:00,Deluxe currently earns almost 50% of its revenue from direct checks.Management has laid out a plan to transition from a direct check producer to a marketing solutions provider.Marketing Solutions currently makes up 30% of the company’s revenue but the company expects this number to hit 40% by 2018.Check payments in the U.S. fell at an annual rate of 4.4 percent by number or 0.5 percent by value from 2012 to 2015.,"Deluxe Corporation (NYSE:DLX) began providing customers with payment solutions over 100 years ago. Today, it finds itself in a unique position as it attempts to pivot its business model and evolve to continue meeting customers' needs. Since its inception, Deluxe has built itself as the foremost provider of written checks. While that simple fact, combined with the growing shift towards paperless payment solutions, is enough to scare many investors away from the stock, the company is undergoing a transition that promises to not only keep them in business but usher in a new era of growth.Deluxe breaks its revenue into four main segments; Checks, Marketing Solutions and other services, Forms, and Accessories and other products. Recently, the company has started to shift its focus away from checks and towards its small business solutions segment. With the future of written checks looking bleak, the company has used a rapid succession of acquisitions to position itself as a presence in the small business world. Marketing Solutions currently makes up 30% of the company's revenue but the company expects this number to hit 40% by 2018.Deluxe Revenue by Business SegmentChecksAlthough the company has started to shift away from checks, it remains one of the largest providers of checks in the United States with the segment still accounting for almost half of its revenue. This segment is the largest area of concern for the company as the most recent Federal Reserve study released in December calls into question the future of written checks in the payment industry. It shows that check payments in the U.S. fell at an annual rate of 4.4 percent by number or 0.5 percent by value from 2012 to 2015. It is also stated that the Federal Reserve believes that the number of written checks had peaked sometime in the mid-1990s. The only possible bright side from this report was that the decline in checks over the measured period was slightly lower than in previous years as the Federal Reserve placed the annual rate of decline at 8.8% per year between 2009 and 2012.In the company's annual report, Deluxe addressed the growing problem in its key business segment stating that although the rate and extent to which alternative payments will replace checks cannot be predicted with certainty, it expects that ""the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, direct deposits, wire transfers and internet-based bill paying services, as well as automated teller machines, which make cash a more readily available alternative.""The Federal Reserve Payments Study 2016With it becoming increasingly clear that the company's main source of revenue was unsustainable going forward, the company was faced with a choice; either adapt and find a new way to meet customers' needs or slowly disappear just like the use of written checks. So management developed a strategy to keep the 100-year old company relevant in the new world. First, the company plans to continue producing checks for as long as it can, using this revenue to finance growth in other aspects of the business. Second, the company began to slowly pivot its core business towards the Marketing Solutions and other services segment, which it believes represents its most significant revenue growth opportunity.The move away from checks overall was seen in the company's most recent 10-K filing in which management commented,Marketing Solutions and Other ServicesIn its Marketing Solutions segment, Deluxe aims to partner with small business and financial institutions to provide them with the products, services, and advice they need to grow. This can take the form of logo design, web services, search engine marketing, and much more. Overall, it hopes to help guide small businesses grow larger and expand its overall customer base. Currently, the company has 4.5 million active small business customers and 5,517 financial institution clients. To help grow this segment of the company, Deluxe has recently undergone multiple acquisitions purchasing leading business brands including Bags & Bows®, NEBS®, McBee®, PartnerUp®, LogoMojo®, Hostopia®, MerchEngines, Safeguard®, Orange Soda and more.Deluxe continued to add to this growing segment on January 6, 2017, when it announced its plans to acquire First Manhattan Consulting group (FMCG Direct) a marketing services company that specializes in marketing analytics and insights. Based in New York City, FMCG provides clients with financial expertise and proprietary research and Deluxe hopes that it can synthesize these strengths with its growing Marketing Services segment. Deluxe made the acquisition for $200 million dollars and is expecting the deal to return approximately $80-85 million in the next year of operation.When asked about the deal Lee Schram, chief executive officer of Deluxe Corporation said,Bob Tetenbaum, the president and co-founder of FMCG Direct, later added,FormsDeluxe is a leading provider of printed forms to small businesses, including deposit tickets, billing forms, work orders, job proposals, purchase orders, invoices and personnel forms. This segment has held steady at around 13% of the company's revenue and with the demand for forms not changing as dramatically as checks, management expects it to remain around that number for the foreseeable future.Accessories and Other ProductsThis segment of Deluxe's business provides small business owners with the customized documents needed to manage their operations. This includes envelopes, office supplies, stamps, and labels, checks and stamps. Similar to the Forms segment, Deluxe sees this segment holding steady at where it is as it now makes up around 9% of the company's revenue.AcquisitionsThe story of Deluxe is simple. It is a giant in a dying industry and it is attempting to transition into a new one. A by-product of this push has been a wave of acquisition spending, which has significantly inflated its balance sheet. Since 2013, the amount of money put towards acquisitions has more than tripled, as the chart below taken from the company's 10-K shows.Deluxe has long said that one of its main goals is to strengthen its portfolio of products and services not only through organic development but also through acquisitions. In recent years, the company has acquired numerous new businesses that it hopes will expand the marketing solutions it offers its customers. This has continued in 2016 with its acquisition of First Manhattan Consulting. Before that, the company acquired Datamyx LLC, a software-as-a-service platform and analytic-driven marketing solutions provider, Range and FMC Resource providers both prominent market service providers, Tech Assets, Inc. a website company that utilizes control panel technology, VerifyValid LLC, an electronic check company, in 2015. In 2014, the company acquired parts of Gift Box Corporation of America, a supplier of packaging solutions.Management has used these strategic acquisitions to help the company navigate the transition from a direct check company to a marketing solutions provider. In the company's 10-K, management touched on its future expectations saying,Management then went on to say,Overall the message is clear from Deluxe. It is hoping to use a spree of acquisitions to move the company from being a giant in the fading written checks industry into a growth company in marketing solutions provider segment. With the acquisitions of Datamyx, Range, FMC Resource providers, and Gift Box Corporation of America growing the range of options Deluxe can offer its customers and more familiar purchases like VerifyValid helping it update the direct check segment and help it continue to generate the revenue necessary to finance the transition period into market solutions, Deluxe appears strongly focused on the future and its plan for growth.Goodwill and ImpairmentWith Deluxe rattling off a long string of acquisitions in the past years, it is not surprising that the company's balance sheet has grown significantly over the time period. A drawback of the aggressive growth strategy can be seen below in the company's 2015 balance sheet.The amount of goodwill that the company records on its balance sheet has increased dramatically in the past few years. As of 9/30/16, the company had a total of $989.6 million goodwill on a $1.84 billion balance sheet. Making up around 52% of the company's total assets, this line item represents the amount the company paid in excess of the acquired company's book value. Because of this, many analysts have started to worry that impairments to this number are on the horizon. Over the past years, the number reported on the balance sheet as goodwill has risen sharply and the company has reported $37.5 million in impairments since 2008. If more impairments are on the way, the company may prove to be volatile in the future. Nonetheless, management believes that the long-term strategy of acquiring target assets and growing its overall presence is worth the short-term hit to the appeal of its balance sheet.Consumer ConfidenceA bright side for the company going forward is the uptick in the small confidence index. On January 10th, the latest issue of the National Federation of Individual Business ""Small Business Economic Trends"" was released. It showed that the small business confidence index came in at 105.8, up from 98.4 the previous month. This mark is the highest the index has measured since 2004. Below is an excerpt from the 2017 report.With the majority of Deluxe's growth aiming to come from the marketing solutions that it offers to small businesses, this report is a good sign for the company's future. With small businesses feeling more optimistic, they will be more likely to take on the extra expenditures that Deluxe offers in order to grow their businesses. In 2015, Deluxe's management stated that the company had been negatively hit by the negative outlook that small businesses held and that it believed this would be a continued detriment to the company's revenue growth in 2016. However, with this sentiment starting to turn positive the company may be able to capitalize on the ""better-than-expected"" economic climate with ""better-than-expected"" growth.SummaryFor the past 100 years, Deluxe has prided itself on being the premiere provider of written checks. However, a few years ago, Deluxe found itself at the peak of a dying industry. Rather than waiting for the company to slowly fade away with the usage of written checks, management developed a plan to begin transitioning the company from its spot as a direct check provider into a new industry of marketing solutions. The transition is still a work in process but with the sharp increase in acquisitions over the past few years, it has become clear that the company is going all in on its new plan. With the company growing into a strong partner for small business everywhere and the sentiment within the economy turning positive, management believes Deluxe is positioned to outperform in the years to come."
3981936,68695,2016-06-14T12:07:48-04:00,"Moody’s is overstating Deluxe Corporation’s credit risk with their cross-over Ba1 credit rating.We rate the company two notches higher as a lower medium investment grade credit, given their strong cash flows and robust ROA’ profile.Meanwhile, credit markets are understating credit risk relative to our Intrinsic CDS of 321bps and Intrinsic YTW of 4.446%.","Moody's is overstating the credit risk of Deluxe Corporation (NYSE:DLX) with its Ba1 rating. Our fundamental analysis highlights a safer credit profile for DLX, whose strong cash flows cover all operating obligations going forward. Moreover, their healthy liquidity profile would allow them to service all obligations including debt maturities through 2022. We therefore rate DLX two notches higher at an IG4 credit rating, or a Baa2 equivalent using Moody's ratings scale. (To register for free access to our corporate credit ratings, please click here.)Meanwhile, CDS markets are grossly understating credit risk with a CDS of 47bps relative to an Intrinsic CDS of 321bps, while cash bond markets are understating credit risk with a cash bond YTW of 3.476% relative to an Intrinsic YTW of 4.446%. This is justified by their negative net working capital levels and limited asset backing, which drive a nonexistent recovery rate on unsecured debt.Cash Flow ProfileWe produced a Credit Cash Flow Prime chart for Deluxe Corporation, as we do for every company we evaluate. The chart provides a far more comprehensive view of credit fundamentals than traditional ratio-based analyses. It shows the cash flow generation and cash obligations related to the credit of the firm, adjusted for non-cash financial statement reporting distortions from GAAP. The blue line indicates the gross cash earnings (Valens' scrubbed cash flow number) expected to be generated based on consensus analyst estimates and Valens Research's own in-house research team. The blue dots above that line include the cash available at that time while the blue triangles indicate that same amount plus any existing, available lines of credit.The colored, stacked bars show the cash obligations of the firm in each year forecast. The most difficult obligations to avoid are at the bottom of each stack, such as interest expense. The obligations with more flexibility to defer year to year, such as pension contributions and maintenance capital expenditures, are at the top of the stacked bars. All of the calculations are adjusted for non-cash distortions that are inherent in GAAP accounting, including the highly problematic and often misused statement of cash flows.If the company generates and has cash levels that are above their obligations, the risk of default is extremely low. Even if the cash generated yearly is close to the levels of the stacked bars, a company generally has the flexibility to defer payments of various kinds. For example, they can allow assets to age a little longer, or they can cut certain maintenance costs such as maintenance capex. While decisions such as those can create other business concerns, the issue in credit risk is simply this: Does the company have enough cash to service their credit obligations?DLX's cash flows would consistently exceed operating obligations going forward. Moreover, their expected 2019 cash build would allow them to cover all obligations through 2022. However, their negative net working capital and poor asset backing relative to debt levels drive a nonexistent recovery rate on unsecured debt. That said, even with the firm's nonexistent recovery rate, their robust ROA' profile and strong cash flows should facilitate access to credit markets to refinance if needed.Management IncentivesLike most people, senior executives and board members do what they are paid to do. This is why DLX's Form DEF 14A is key to understanding this company's fundamentals, something that credit agencies seem to be missing. Our Incentives Dictate Behavior™ analysis focuses on DLX's senior executive compensation and governance. This analysis is meant to help investors understand corporate governance, how aligned a management team may be with shareholder interests, and the potential consequences of a management compensation framework to the business.DLX management's short-term compensation is based on adjusted revenue, adjusted operating income, and enterprise factors, while their long-term incentive compensation is driven by marketing solutions and other services revenue combined with adjusted operating margin and TSR.This compensation structure focuses management on improving margins and growth over time. However, it does not punish management for overspending on capex and acquisitions or taking on excess leverage, which could reduce cash flows available for handling debt obligationsManagement RepresentationsWe provide analyses of companies' statements on earnings calls, termed Earnings Call Forensics. This analysis is meant to help assess a management team's confidence in their conference calls when discussing certain areas of the business such as operations, stability, strategies, their ability to manage business risks, and especially, their liquidity and solvency.In the case of DLX, the analysis of their Q1 2016 earnings call highlights mixed markers from management. Management is confident about their revenue growth in Q1 2016 and about their diversified revenue stream. However, they appear concerned about the sustainability of their marketing solutions and other services revenue growth, and may lack confidence in their ability to meet their financial services revenue guidance. Furthermore, they appear concerned about their ability to find value add acquisitions in both financial services and small business services.ConclusionUltimately, a company's credit risk (or lack thereof) is driven by cash available against cash obligations. DLX's credit risk is being overstated by Moody's given DLX's strong cash profile, and robust ROA'. However, based on the firm's nonexistent recovery rate, CDS markets are grossly understating credit risk while cash bond markets are understating credit risk. As a result, while ratings are expected to improve, credit market spreads are expected to widen.Our Chief Investment Strategist, Joel Litman, chairs the Valens Equities and Credit Research Committees, which are responsible for this article along with the lead analyst, Rafael Formoso.

Most of their clients are small businesses, and they served over 4.6 million customers in 2014.They have been in business for nearly 100 years, and to celebrate their 100th anniversary they will ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange on November 23rd.Their main business is printing checks, and they are one of the two largest check printers in the United States. However, check use is in secular decline and they are in the process of diversifying their business away from check printing.Still, checks are an important part of their business, accounting for over 50% of revenue in 2014.Besides check services they offer web hosting, SEO optimization, logo design, and promotion product printing such as brochures, postcards, greeting cards, and business cards. They also administer reward and loyalty programs, offer financial companies fraud protection services, financial receivable products, billing, personnel and work order forms, and electronic check services.Financial PerformanceDeluxe had a strong 15Q2, despite currency headwinds and a sluggish economic climate for the small businesses services segment.The company noted that small business optimism indexes deteriorated over the quarter, falling to the lowest level in a year. The number of small businesses planning capital expenditures over the next three to six months fell to 23%.Despite economic headwinds, the small business services segment grew revenues 5.5% versus last year's levels. Revenues were $282 million for the quarter, and were negatively impacted by 0.9% due to currency headwinds.Total revenue for the quarter was $435.9 million, slightly beating expectations. This is up 7.5% relative to 14Q2.The financial services segment, which mostly provides fraud protection services to financial institutions, was the strongest segment. Revenue grew 19.1% to $112.7 million.However, it is important to note that revenue growth was not organic, but stemmed from the recent Wausau acquisition. Organic growth was negative 1% without the Wausau accretion.In October 2014, Deluxe acquired Wausau Financial Systems, a receivables management company for banks. Their clients include nine of the top ten financial institutional and 50 fortune 500 companies. Cross selling those large clients is a major opportunity for Deluxe.Deluxe did not mention the price paid for Wausau in their 14Q4 press release, but cash spent on investing activities was $95.6 million for the quarter. If that was the price they paid it was a little more than 1x forward sales. They expect Wausau to produce about $75 million in sales in 2015.Gross margins expanded by 0.2%, relative to 14Q2, to 64.2%. The increase was due to price increases.However, operating margins declined by 0.6%. This was caused by a $16.6 million increase in SG&A expenses, mostly thanks to the Wausau acquisition, which is a lower margin business.Deluxe will have to rely on cost control and cross selling before the Wausau acquisition meaningfully adds to EPS. The acquisition added only a penny to EPS.One nice thing about Deluxe's business is that it is not capital intensive. Cash produced by operations was $280.4 million for 2014, but capital spending was just $41.1 million, or 14.7% of cash produced. Capital spending is far less than their depreciation and amortization expense of $76 million.The 14% ratio of cash generation to capital expenditures has been a relatively stable ratio over time, as shown in the chart below, taken from the 2015 10-k.Substantial cash generation with little capital expenditures safely covers dividend payments, which amounted to $57.6 million, or $1.15 per share, in 2014. About one year ago, Deluxe raised the dividend from $0.25 to $0.30 per quarter.This was the first dividend raise since 2004 (the cut they dividend in 2006). They paid a $0.25 dividend for 31 consecutive quarters. The lack of growth would annoy many income investors, but at least there is stability.Since the dividend lacks growth, some may wonder if they also return cash through share buy-backs.Deluxe does have a modest share buyback program, but its primary purpose is to offset dilution from share-based compensation, not to return cash to shareholders. The share count has modestly decreased from 50.83 million shares in 2011 to 49.96 million shares today.Looking Forward And ValuationDespite the sluggish small business environment and a secular decline in the use of checks, Deluxe is fairly optimistic about their future.They note in 15Q2 conference call that besides legal and regulatory restrictions, increasing sales is a ""small business owner's number one pain point"".The marketing solutions segment offers many services that are designed to boost sales. They offer postcard and brochure services, email marketing campaigns, retail packaging design, website design, SEO optimization, and reward and loyalty programs.They expect the marketing solutions segment to grow to $530 million for the year, up from $427 million in 2014. The main drivers will be organic growth in the low double digits, and growth from the Wausau acquisition.Since check use is in secular decline they are depending on the marketing solutions as they transition away from a check company. In 2011, checks accounted for 63.9% of revenue. Today, it accounts for 52%.Marketing solutions was just 13.4% of revenue in 2011. Today it is 25.5%. If marketing solutions meets expectations for 2015, it would account for 30% of revenue. The company expects it to account for 40% of revenue by 2018. By that time they expect checks to fall to 40% of revenue.Look for web hosting (part of marketing solutions) to perform well going forward. It posted double-digit growth during the last quarter. They now have approximately 863,000 web hosting customers.The revenue outlook for the full year is $1.76 to $1.78 billion, a 5.7% increase over 2014. They expect earnings per share in the $4.50 to $4.60 range, a 15% increase over 2014 levels.This translates into a forward P/E of 13.43, well below market averages. However, the stock trades above its five-year average for both trailing and forward P/E. It seems that consistent performance has convinced the market that deluxe deserves an expanding multiple, or it simply expanded along with the market.Still, this multiple is hardly demanding, and Deluxe is successfully transitioning its business away from check production, I would say the current price is a fair entry point. Investors worried about overvaluation should be eased by the company's long history of outperforming analyst estimates.(Charts courtesy of Thomson Reuters)"
3718046,67855,2015-11-29T03:02:56-05:00,"Deluxe Corporation has traditionally been a check manufacturer.Checks' share of revenue is getting smaller, but the dollar amount is relatively constant.The company has been successful in nurturing the growth of marketing solutions.","Deluxe Corporation (NYSE: DLX) is one of the oldest providers of payment solutions in the world. The company can trace its roots all the way back to its inception in 1915, almost a century ago. Its bread and butter is check manufacturing. Despite the rise of paperless payment solutions during the past decade, the company is not going out of business. It has in fact grown consistently over the past couple of years.The stock has been under pressure lately, falling from a high of $69 in April to as low as $55 before rebounding to $59 today. Is there any reason for investors to be scared?As mentioned earlier, the company's main revenue generator is check manufacturing. Checks account for around for half of the total revenue. The other half is split between marketing solutions, forms, and stationary accessories. Although overall revenue is growing, check products are accounting for less and less of the overall business. In 2010, checks accounted for 63.9% of total revenue. In 2014, this number dropped to 52%, then declined further to 49.1% in Q3. While the shrinkage looks alarming, its impact is very limited. The shrinking share of total revenue was mostly the result of growth in other product lines or services. To illustrate, the dollar amount of revenue derived from checks was $896 million in 2010 and $871 million 2014. This decline translates to an annual decline of less than 1%. There is no doubt that checks will eventually be replaced, but the process is extremely slow, so I believe that the company can continue to count on checks as a major source of revenue for the foreseeable future.What about the company's other service offerings? Let's look at marketing solutions first. Surprisingly, the company was able to expand marketing solutions incredibly well. Revenue derived from marketing solutions have grown from 13.4% in 2010 to more than 30.1% in Q3. Marketing solutions have been the biggest contributor to the company's recent growth. As for forms and accessories, they both continue to enjoy the stability that checks manufacturing has. However, they are shrinking as well, after all, they are all physical products that relate to paper usage.TakeawayI see a lot of similarities between Deluxe Corporation and Iron Mountain (NYSE: IRM). The difference is that Deluxe has been successful in establishing growth oriented revenue streams (e.g. marketing solutions), whereas Iron Mountain has been struggling with growth (as evident by the stagnating revenue). I would have been skeptical of marketing solutions' success if you asked me in 2010 if Deluxe Corporation could grow marketing solutions so quickly, since they were not the company's core competency. After five years, however, I believe it is evident that the company has transformed itself from mostly a check making company to a more diversified business service company and there is no reason to think that the company is a dinosaur that cannot change."

The company provides personalized printed items, promotional products, web hosting, fraud prevention and marketing services, and financial institution customer-retention programs to businesses in the US. With the macro environment expected to remain positive over the long term, Deluxe is expected to continue delivering strong gains ahead.In this article, I will evaluate Deluxe's financial strength by reviewing its performance in the latest quarter. Later, I will discuss factors to support to my quantified upside of the company.Fourth QuarterDeluxe reported its latest quarterly result last week. The company achieved revenue growth of 7% as the top-line figure surged to $449 million. The year-over-year increase came primarily due to growth in financial-services revenue of 22%, while small-business services revenue hike of 6% also provided a tailwind to the company. In addition, marketing solutions and other services revenues soared by 30% owing to greater customer demand of promotional material.In sum, Deluxe's top line remained healthy from multiple dimensions during the quarter. The company gained from positive macro environment, which in turn allowed Deluxe to charge higher prices for infrastructure and support services required by organizations.Gross margin, however, decreased by 50 bps to 63.1% due to an unfavourable product mix and higher material and delivery rates. SGA expenses also soared by 10 bps to 42.8% as a percentage of sales. The growth in SGA would've come lower had the benefits from cost-reduction initiatives in all the segments not been offset by acquisitions and performance-based compensation in the financial-services business.Still, the cost increment wasn't significant to affect earnings materially, as Deluxe reported a profit of $1.16 per share. The figure not only beat the analysts' estimate of $1.10 by a wide margin, but also came 29% above the profit reported in 2013. Looking forward, the trend is expected to sustain owing to the reasons discussed below.Market ExpansionThe global office services and supplies market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 3.6% over the next two years. Within the market, US will continue to hold a market share of approximately 35%. The region will experience a boom primarily because the economy is expected to grow at its fastest pace in a decade. The calculated GDP growth of 3.1% would be the first occurrence of above 3% growth since 2005, and will bring with itself more hiring and businesses expansion.While the macro environment will provide a tailwind to every large player in the industry, Deluxe is taking additional steps to ensure it stands out as a winner: the company recently acquired Wausau Financial Systems, a market leader in receivables management for commercial banks and major corporations. WAUSAU has established partnerships with an impressive list of clients, including nine of the top 10 financial institutions and more than 50 Fortune 500 companies. The acquisition is a profitable and growing business with strong cash flows coming from a high percentage of long-term contracts that generate recurring revenue. Together with a growing market, WAUSAU is expected to add $12 million to Deluxe's top line in 2015.In addition, Deluxe also plans to continue implementing cost-cutting initiatives this year. The efforts have already saved the company $550 million since 2006. In 2015, Deluxe will focus on improving the mix of its paper catalogue and online search-engine marketing. As a result, the company will be able to reduce its direct and indirect expenditure through consolidation of manufacturing platforms and spoilage cutback. The initiatives, once completed, are expected to add $50 million net of investments to Deluxe's bottom line.Bottom LineMarket growth, WAUSAU acquisition, and cost-control initiatives have led the analysts to believe that Deluxe's earnings will grow by 5.5% to $4.43 per share by the end of 2015. The estimate has further led 4 brokers to value Deluxe's stock at $67.5, which reveals that the company is undervalued by 6%. With decent capital gains and a dividend yield of 1.8% on offer, Deluxe earns a buy rating."

What I am going to do is to present a stodgy stock that's still at a reasonable valuation, in a market where stodgier stocks are no longer cheap because of Bernanke's monetary orgy.Stodgy stock galoreWhy am I going to present a stodgy stock instead of something sexy? Because seemingly with Bernanke's printing stodgy is the new sexy. Consider for instance the charts of a couple of stodgy stocks like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (Source: Stockcharts.com).See what I mean? And what did these stocks have in common? Well, they were rather stable businesses providing a decent dividend yield and trading at a decent valuation. Indeed, even after this run JNJ still yields 3% and Microsoft still yields 2.7%. But they're not so cheap any more. JNJ trades at an EV/EBITDA of 10.8 times and a forward 2013 Price/Earnings of 16 times, and MSFT trades at an EV/EBITDA of 7.6 times and a forward 2013 Price/Earnings of 12.4 times.All this to say that if you can find other reasonably valued stodgy stocks that are stable businesses at reasonable valuations, they might make for decent additions to your portfolio. This instead of having to go with these over-owned better-known stodgy stocks that are crowding the large-cap screens.Enter DeluxeDeluxe (NYSE:DLX) is rather unremarkable. It provides a hodge-podge of services used by other corporations, divided into three segments:These include tens of different products and services, from forms, checks, work orders to logos, marketing, SEO (search engine optimization), web design, etc. Truly a hodge-podge of services like I said. In this hodge-podge of services, however, checks make up the largest share of revenues, at 59%, and are rather stagnated as we can see in a Deluxe presentation:This, on the other hand, hides a segment - marketing solutions and other services - where growth is pretty acceptable. This segment represented 19% of 2012 revenues:Still, overall and as I had said, Deluxe is a stodgy company due to its largest business - checks - being stagnated or even decreasing. This means that overall its financials are evolving slowly, as we can see below from its presentation:Nonetheless, these are still pretty strong financials which have been allowing for debt reduction.And in the whole, for a stodgy stock, it ends up being valued at multiples that are as attractive, or even more attractive, than other alternatives. It trades at an EV/EBITDA of 6.2 times and a forward 2013 Price/Earnings of 9.7 times while still showing slow growth and carrying a dividend yield of 2.83%.Over the longer term, Deluxe also expects the EBITDA margin on its faster growing business services to approach the overall levels for the entire company (right now checks are at an operating margin in the 30% area, whereas business services are in the 10s). This should allow for overall EBITDA margins to stagnate or expand slightly from today's 24.8%. Again this reinforces the ""stodgy"" character of this equity:ConclusionWhile deluxe is not a barn burner, it can represent a decent stodgy stock in a wider dividend income portfolio. It might also represent an alternative to rotate out of other stodgy stocks which might have gotten temporarily ahead of themselves.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company helps small businesses and financial institutions operate more efficiently and market more effectively.Deluxe's ability to create economic value and subsequently return value to its shareholders is impressive.Let's take a look at Deluxe's performance and derive a fair value estimate for shares.,"By Paul TaitDeluxe (NYSE:DLX) helps small businesses and financial institutions run more efficiently and market more effectively. The bulk of its revenue - approximately 55% - comes from producing checks, but it also operates various small business services, which include website hosting and development, search engine optimization, logo design, and financial technology solutions.The company is expecting another solid year in 2015, which marks its 100th anniversary. After performing well in the first quarter, the firm expects the year to mark its sixth consecutive year of profitable revenue growth and the seventh of cash flow from operations expansion.Deluxe has a tremendous ability to create economic value. The company has one of the highest rated Economic Castles in our coverage universe, a measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders by taking a forward-looking approach at the magnitude of its ROIC less WACC spread.The firm also has great potential to return cash to its shareholders. Deluxe receives a Dividend Cushion ratio of 3.1, or dividend safety rating of EXCELLENT; its dividend growth potential receives the same rating. The future of the firm's dividend appears to be bright. Its yield is currently 1.88%.Let's take an in-depth look at Deluxe's investment considerations and derive its intrinsic value.Deluxe's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Deluxe earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 138.1% during the past three years.• Deluxe is one of the top check producers in North America. It also provides small business solutions, including web services and search-engine marketing. 'Checks' account for ~55% of revenue (expected to be ~40% by 2018). The company boasts a nice dividend.• Deluxe has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 14.9% in coming years. Total debt to EBITDA was 1.3 last year, while debt to book capitalization stood at 46.1%. The company continues to reduce its net debt position.• Deluxe has three business divisions. 'Small Business Services' accounts for two thirds of revenue and generates an adjusted operating margin of ~18%. 'Financial Services' accounts for ~20% and generates an adjusted operating margin of ~25%. 'Direct Checks' account for the balance and is the firm's highest margin business at a ~32% operating margin.• The firm's vision is to become the best at helping small businesses and financial institutions grow. The firm is focused on key customer segments and growing check share while maintaining high retention rates. Cost reductions and simplification are other key goals.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Deluxe's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 138.1%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.8%.As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. The magnitude of Deluxe's Economic Castle is outstanding!Cash Flow AnalysisFree cash flow at Deluxe has been terrific in recent years. Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Deluxe's free cash flow margin has averaged about 14.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Deluxe, cash flow from operations increased about 15% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 17% over the same time period.In the first quarter of 2015, cash flow from operations was ~$77.7 million, and capital expenditures were ~$9.5 million, resulting in free cash flow of $68.2 million. For the full year, management expects cash from operations to be in the range of $295-$305 million, and capital expenditures to be approximately $40 million, resulting in free cash flow in the range of $255-$265 million.Valuation AnalysisThis is the meat and potatoes of our analysis. Let's walk through our valuation process and derive our fair value estimate of Deluxe.Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Deluxe's shares are worth between $53-$85 each. Deluxe's current stock price is ~$64 per share, in the low half of our fair value range. We feel there is more upside potential than downside risk based on our fair value estimate.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $69 per share represents a price to earnings (P/E) ratio of about 17.4 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 9.1 times last year's EBITDA.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 3.7% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 5.7%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 22%, which is above Deluxe's trailing 3-year average.Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 1.9% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Deluxe, we use a 9.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisEach fair value estimate we provide comes with a margin of safety within which we feel the firm is fairly valued. Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $69 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Deluxe. We think the firm is attractive below $53 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $85 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Deluxe's fair value at this point in time to be about $69 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Deluxe's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $89 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $69 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Wrapping Things UpAs a small business, we like the idea of Deluxe providing small business services, helping small businesses grow and improve efficiency. The firm has one of the best Economic Castles in our coverage universe and outstanding dividend prospects. We rate both its dividend safety and dividend growth potential as EXCELLENT.Deluxe is one of the top providers of checks in North America, but its revenue from 'checks' is expected to decline. This should not come as a surprise, as consumers continue to move away from checks. Adaptation will be necessary, and higher margin segments such as 'Financial Services' provide growth opportunities. Deluxe currently registers a 4 on the Valuentum Buying Index.PerformanceIn the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of the Valuentum Buying Index, our stock selection methodology, has stacked up per underlying score as it relates to firms in the Best Ideas portfolio.

2523505,68695,2014-09-26T12:11:26-04:00,Moody's high-yield Ba2 rating of DLX overstates credit risk by not recognizing fundamentals.DLX's CDS of 288bps should tighten to the Valens Credit Intrinsic CDS (iCDS) of 209bps.Cash flows from operations will strongly build DLX's cash reserves from 2015 through 2018.DLX's revolver offers liquidity for refinancing near-term maturities.,"Moody's high-yield Ba2 credit rating for Deluxe Corporation (NYSE:DLX) overstates the company's fundamental credit risk. Much of its fundamental credit risk is tied to 2014 debt maturities amounting to $253.4m. Given the liquidity available through its revolver and its ability to access the credit markets to refinance its debt, the probability of default is less than what the credit agencies perceive. These drive a crossover Valens Credit rating of XO (Baa3). (To register for free access to our corporate credit ratings, please click here.)The credit markets are also overstating DLX's risk with a credit default swap (CDS) of 288bps and 2019 cash bond YTW of 4.130%. In contrast, the Valens Credit iCDS is only 209bps and our iCDS intrinsic YTW is 3.670%. Valens fully expects CDS to tighten as Deluxe's true credit profile is better understood.Cash Flow ProfileSource: Valens Credit Analysis, Capital IQ, Company Financial StatementsValens Credit produced a Credit Cash Flow Prime chart for DLX, as it does for every company it evaluates. The chart shows the cash flow generation and cash obligations related to the credit of the firm, adjusted for non-cash financial statement reporting distortions from GAAP. The blue line shows the gross cash earnings expected to be generated based on consensus analyst estimates and Valens Credit's in-house research team. The blue dots above that line include the cash available when cash on the books and existing, available credit lines are used.The colored, stacked bars show the cash obligations of the firm for each year's forecast. The most difficult obligations to avoid are at the bottom of each stack, such as interest expense. The obligations with more flexibility to defer year-to-year, such as pension contributions and maintenance capex, are at the top of the stacked bars. All of the calculations are adjusted for non-cash distortions that are inherent in GAAP accounting, including the highly problematic and often misused statement of cash flows.It's no surprise that if the company generates and has cash levels that are above its obligations, the risk of default is low. Even if the cash generated each year is close to the top of the stacked bars, the company has the flexibility to defer payments of various kinds. For example, it can allow assets to age a little longer or cut certain maintenance costs, such as R&D. While decisions such as those can create other business concerns, the issue in credit risk is ""Can the company pay its credit obligations?"" A chart like DLX's indicates a strong cash profile (cash from ongoing operations, cash on hand and revolver availability) relative to its overall obligations.DLX has three material debt maturities for the next seven years: $253.4m in 2014, $200m in 2019, and $189.6m in 2020. Out of the three debt maturities, only the 2014 debt maturity will exceed both cash from operations and cash on hand, leaving DLX with a shortfall of $32m. However, DLX has $350m cash available from its revolver that it could use to pay off its debt or at least cover the shortfall. (To review Valens' recent article on the macroeconomic environment, please click here.)Over the past 10 years, DLX has sustained an above cost-of-capital ROA, which improves its ability to have its debt refinanced to a longer maturity. However, DLX will have accumulated sufficient cash reserves to service the later obligations without pulling liquidity from the revolver. As a result, the debt maturities in 2019 and 2020 will not be material in comparison to the current-year debt maturity.Management IncentivesLike most people, senior executives and board members do what they are paid to do. That's why DLX's Form DEF 14A is key to understanding this company's fundamentals, something which credit agencies and the credit markets appear to be missing. Valens' Incentives Dictate Behavior™ analysis focuses on DLX's senior executive compensation and governance. This analysis is meant to help investors understand corporate governance and how aligned a management team may be with shareholder interests. It also highlights the potential consequences of a management compensation framework to the business.From an executive compensation perspective, DLX's short-term performance metrics are adjusted revenue, adjusted operating income, and enterprise factors. Its long-term performance metrics are Marketing Solutions and Other Services (NYSEARCA:MSOS) revenue combined with adjusted operating margins and TSR. This compensation framework should drive management to focus on margin improvement and growth over time. However, it does not focus management on improving DLX's asset utilization or leverage.Management RepresentationsAs a component of our evaluation of a company, Valens provides analyses of its management's statements on earnings calls. Not surprisingly, we call this Management Representation Benchmarking™. This analysis is meant to help assess a management team's confidence in the statements they make about topics such as operations, stability, strategies, their ability to manage business risks, and most especially, their liquidity and solvency.In the case of DLX, the analysis of its Q2 2014 earnings call highlighted some concerns. Management was confident in sustaining profitability and growth in Destination Rewards in the coming quarters. However, management seems to be concerned with their liquidity position, the economy, and the success of its e-Checks and SwitchAgent product offerings. Despite concerns over its liquidity position, these issues will not likely impact its ability to service its debt obligation. (More about Valens' innovative research tools is available here.)ConclusionA company's credit risk or lack thereof is driven by cash available against cash obligations. In 2014, it has an undrawn revolver to cover its cash requirements. After that, it will build cash reserves which should cover its next debt headwall in 2019. DLX's credit risk is being overstated by credit markets and the big ratings agencies, as key points are being missed. There is thus likely to be ratings improvements at some point when the agencies realize DLX's real credit profile. Tightening of the credit market spreads will likely follow, given the overstated risk of DLX's credit profile.Valens Credit Ratings are those made by the Valens Credit organization, determined by a ratings committee in a systematic process, and not the opinion of any single person.Our Chief Investment Strategist, Joel Litman, chairs the Valens Credit ratings committee.

If not those comparative clues, what else will tell, convincingly?Our path is to look at how folks who have the resources to round up all the available info that ought to matter on each stock, and find what they think, according to how they protect the market risks they see in the bets they make. Since those folks don't have much impact themselves on stock prices, their valuable ideas need to come from what they think those players in the game who have the money muscle to move market prices are likely to do. Talking with them dozens of times a day, year after year, helps them know, and keep up to date.Then we look to see how right they have been over the past 5 years, daily, about what their today's outlook for coming prices produced. Since their self-protection behavior has not changed, except by degree of intensity - and that is what we are interested in - this provides useful guidance as to investment preferences between alternatives. Useful, because the alternatives are measured in exactly the same way.One of the dimensions of how well these forecasters (the market-makers [MMs] who help big-money fund managers adjust their portfolio holdings) is what the ODDS are that a buy at today's level of forecast has previously turned out to be profitable in the coming 3 months.Today's subject of discussion is Delux Corp. (NYSE:DLX), the nation's leader in providing blank check forms for business, personal, and bank monetary transaction purposes. Unlike some corporations that were decimated by technological progress [Kodak (NYSE:KODK), for example], DLX learned how to use the systems providing electronic funds transfers [EFTs] first to be able to sell its checks better, and then how to apply what it learned about on-line marketing to assist small businesses in broadening their own markets. Further, they applied their new intellectual property developments into helping old customers learn to live better in a new environment requiring controls over fraud, security and risk management.This company established in 1911 has quite successfully learned how to adapt to new demanding environments and increase its value in the process. But recognition of that evolution tends to come in spurts, accompanied by market price oscillations in its stock.Not serious oscillations, as pictured here, but ones that provide periodic opportunities far greater than their underlying trend growth.Figure 1(used with permission)In June of 2013 DLX stock sagged down -20% from a recent March high of $42+ to a low of $34-. In March the MMs found their clients' trading desks were treating DLX as an issue that had as much downside as upside, and was not then competitive as a candidate for new investments. But by June the attitudes changed markedly, and fund managers were looking at DLX as a stock that had nowhere to go but up - by as much as +17% or more.Which it did before the end of July. A nice +19% profit in 21 days - for an annual gain rate of over 700%. But at that point, once again the stock fell out of favor among institutional investors and in mid-August at $43 appeared to have little more upside. Dipping below $40 in early September the institutional fund enthusiasm reappeared with upside targets of over +15%.That rise was accomplished in mid-October with a +16% gain in 26 market days, this time at an annual rate of more than +300%.Following the same procedure another similar opportunity begins only in Early June of 2014 at a price of $54.46. Our standard holding period patience limit of 3 months cuts this off at $60.22, short of our intended target of $62. The +10½ % gain in 63 market days provides an annual rate of +50%.These three instances were clearly signaled in each case by hedging actions of the MMs which implied forecasts with over ten times as much upside as downside. Their sequence of 1.19x1.16x1.105 gains compounded into a 52 ½ % profit, achieved in 110 market days, leaving the capital free the remaining 142 days of a market year to seek other opportunities elsewhere, perhaps at a similar pace, at least doubling the gains into a triple-digit total.So why the interest now?Here is the most recent 6 months of daily forecasts indicated by MM hedging actions. What is past is past, we can only act on what is now. What is being presented puts DLX among our 20 most favorably situated wealth-building investment candidates today.Figure 2It offers an +11% upside price change target, previously achieved in 24 out of 26 similar forecast opportunities (a 92% win odds record) which, net of the 2 losses, averaged gains of +12.4% in typical holding periods of 37 market days.There are no guarantees that the past will be repeated. But the odds for success are quite good, the number of prior opportunities are more than trivial, and the past gains are larger than what is presently being suggested.Still, there are those two instances of loss. If all 24 winners were ""bottom price ticks"" with no subsequent price drawdowns, and the -2.6% average of worst-case drawdowns was loaded into the other two of the 26, they could have each lost -34%. That would be a worst-possible case with a pretty tiny likelihood of it happening.Or, if that is possible to expect, then there is a 92% likelihood of an 11% gain coming with none of a 35-day holding period seeing a market price below cost (risk-free) producing at an annual rate of +113%.ConclusionIt seems more likely that there is an outcome waiting in the future somewhere in between those extremes. One passive investment alternative is to simply buy SPY, hold it for 37 days and accept a likely gain of +6%. With only 8 chances out of 10 of that happening, and 2 out of ten, something worse - a loss likely of -4% or more. No risk-free lunch in this game.Well kid, how lucky do ya feel?

In this article, we'll go through a Magic Formula example that covers a lot of the bases: Deluxe Corporation (NYSE:DLX).Before we begin, it's important to set a context for analyzing the debt. Is this a heavily cyclical company that suffers huge swings in revenue and profitability over short periods of time, or does it have fairly stable sales and profit margins? What is the near and medium term prospects for earnings growth? These are both important points - cyclicals and declining businesses obviously are riskier if they have worrisome debt burdens.Deluxe's main business is printing and selling checks. This is a fairly stable business - even in poor economic times, folks still have mortgages and utility bills that they often pay with checks. A look at the financial statements confirm this: Deluxe's revenue has never experienced more than a single-digit percentage change in any of the past 5 years, and profit margins have been relatively predictable. However, checks as a payment method are also declining as online bill pay and debit cards become more popular, with check volume declining 4% annually this decade. The financials also confirm this: Deluxe's annual revenue growth since 2004 is minus 2% per year, and operating profits down 9% annually, with operating margin declining from 22% in 2004 to just under 16% today. So, while Deluxe is a fairly stable business, it's also a declining one and will continue to be.Let's start by getting an idea of Deluxe's cash resources, as this is what's needed to service, and eventually pay off, the debt. The company has about $18 million in cash on the balance sheet. Trailing 12-month free cash flow (cash from operations - depreciation) is about $177 million. However, about $51 million of this is paid back to investors via Deluxe's hefty 6.3% dividend yield. So, if we're interested in the nice yield being maintained, this should be subtracted out of free cash flow. So, total available cash resources are about $144 million over the next year.Total ""short-term"" cash resources = $144 million.Now we move on to short-term debt liabilities. There is $75 million classified as ""short-term debt"" on the balance sheet, and digging into the notes we see this is a line of credit the company uses for short-term cash flow purposes (it is not revolving and thus does not cost much in interest). In addition to this, there is about $500k in capital leases due this year, so total debt to be cleared this year will be about $76 million.Total ""short-term"" debt coming due = $76 million.So far, so good, so let's move onto long-term debt. The balance sheet lumps everything together into a total $743 million of long-term debt obligations. Again, we need to dig into the ""Notes"" section to get the breakdown. If a large portion of this ""long-term"" debt is due next year, for example, we might want to consider lumping it into the ""short-term"" section. However, Deluxe's earliest maturation is about $280 million in 2012, with the rest due in 2014 and 2015, so we'll leave it alone for now.However, this long-term debt (all bonds, by the way) carries interest on it. The ""Notes"" section shows that about $200 million of it carries a 7.4% rate, while the rest carries a low 5.1% rate. This interest adds up to about $49 million a year (from the income statement). We need to add that into our total short-term debt burden.Total interest on debt to be paid this year = $49 million.Add up all the debt-based payments to be made in the next 12 months and we get $125 million. We then compare this against the roughly $144 million in cash resources over the next 12 months. That's tight - the cash-to-debt ratio is about 115%. The absolute minimum MagicDiligence likes to see is 150%, and that's with a very stable business. Deluxe is experiencing declining sales and profit margins, meaning we can't be confident of the cash resource number - it may very well go down. In that case, the first action will be to cut the dividend, and the dividend is one of the few attractive qualities of an investment in Deluxe.So, you can see why MagicDiligence holds a negative opinion on Deluxe as a Magic Formula investment - management is cutting things a little too tight given the uncertainty in future earnings levels.This is a useful exercise to go through when debt levels look a little high when examining financial statements. Of course, a company with no debt doesn't require an exercise like this, nor does one with little debt relative to cash on the balance sheet and free cash flows. In any case, a process like this is often employed when MagicDiligence looks for Top Buy picks on the Magic Formula screen.Disclosure: Steve owns no position in any stocks discussed in this article.See: Five Things You Need to Know When Analyzing Corporate Debt"
116104,21523,2009-01-23T03:55:25-05:00,,"Deluxe Corporation (NYSE:DLX) is a provider of customized printed products to small businesses, banks, and consumers. The company is organized into three business units, distinguished mainly by the target customer. The Small Businesses Services unit, accounting for about 58% of sales, targets (you guessed it) small businesses by providing business checks, forms, marketing fliers, stationary, business cards, and so forth. Brands here include Deluxe, Safeguard, McBee, and RapidForms. Financial Services (29%) targets large banks and other financial concerns, providing checks, gift cards, and fraud protection services, and Direct Checks (13%) targets consumers with similar products. Deluxe is one of the largest printed product providers in the U.S. and Canada (it's only two geographies), servicing over six million small businesses and 7,000 financial institutions. Check products account for nearly 65% of sales, other printed items about 25%, and services filling out the remainder.Deluxe fails all of the main investment tests - growth, competitive moat, and financial strength - and as such, I recommend that Magic Formula investors look elsewhere. Printed checks are in secular decline. In 2007, checks accounted for just 35% of all non-cash payments, well down from 45% in 2004, according to the Federal Reserve. Check volume has been declining about 4% annually this decade as an increasing number of consumers and businesses elect to pay their bills with credit/debit cards, and through online transactions. This leaves only cost cutting, market share gains, and acquisitions as growth avenues for Deluxe. Management has been trying to execute on all three, cutting SG&A spending and closing a number of acquisitions to try to establish an Internet presence. However, revenue has declined at an annualized 4% since 2005, and there is little to suggest this trend will reverse itself.Printed products are hardly a wide moat business, either. In check printing, Deluxe faces competition from large players like Harland-Clarke, as well as smaller printers both local and Internet-based, not to mention software programs that can print checks. Checks are losing the battle against new, electronic payment methods like credit/debit cards and online bill pay. Small business forms and stationary are likewise highly competitive. The corner office can elect to use the local print shop for its needs, or head to Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS), OfficeMax (NYSE:OMX), or Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP). Deluxe does hold several three-four year contracts with large financial institutions, but with the turmoil in that industry, the company faces the risk of these customers being bought up by non-customers, or disappearing altogether. Otherwise, there are no switching costs, regulatory barriers, or unique assets, and scale does not really provide a major advantage. In addition, printing is a business with low barriers to entry, meaning new competitors pop up all the time. Clearly, durable competitive advantages are not in force here.Deluxe also has seen declining profitability and less than stellar financial health, completing the bleak investment picture. Gross margin has declined from 66% in 2003 to about 61% currently. Operating margin is even more pronounced, falling from nearly 26% to just above 15% in that same period. Deluxe earns about 26% less in operating earnings today than it did five years ago. Worse, financial health is pretty weak, a big no-no in a declining industry. Nearly $900 million in debt - nearly 30% higher than the company’s market capitalization, dwarf the paltry $18 million in cash on the balance sheet! Interest coverage ratio is tight at just four times. If revenue and profitability continue to decline, Deluxe could have trouble meeting the first $300 million maturity in 2012. In any case, with today's credit market it's a bad time to rely on debt to finance operations.The positives here are few and far between. The dividend is pretty meaty at 8.5%, and looks safe; as payout is just 27% of free cash flow, (dividend cuts usually happen at 60% or higher). As management has focused on cost cutting and divesting non-strategic businesses, MFI return on capital has risen to a solid figure above 70%. Free cash generation continues to be pretty strong at over 12% of sales.But even these positives have contingencies. The dividend may be high, but it was cut over 40% in 2006 and is not sustainable for a long period of time given the declining industry and high debt load. Most perplexing to me is management's stated strategy of using cash to pursue growth acquisitions. Deluxe's business is print products, and it is extremely unlikely to be successful in the highly competitive and nascent Internet business services space. Management should be doing what Earthlink (NASDAQ:ELNK) and USA Mobility (USMO) are doing in similarly declining industries; run a lean business, pay out all free cash flow to shareholders, and run off the company's assets. I find little to like about Deluxe. Look elsewhere for your next Magic Formula stock pick.Disclosure: Steve owns no position in any stocks discussed in this article."
88251,21492,2008-07-31T08:02:10-04:00,,"Small business community site PartnerUp was acquired Wednesday by Deluxe (NYSE:DLX). Deluxe is best known for its check printing service. Deluxe also recently acquired Hostopia last month. Financial terms of the acquisition were not released.PartnerUp provides a posting board where entrepreneurs can find business partners and other skilled professionals that are needed to build an idea from the ground up. There are networking tools and a resource directory for finding help with other business services.PartnerUp is what SCORE should have been. SCORE is a non-profit group of retired execs who help new entrepreneurs with business plans, coaching, law and tax issues, etc. It's a great service but when I attempted to get help from the group several years ago, the ability to understand what an online business was was non-existent.There was also no real online community for entrepreneurs to discuss issues and get help from the community. I still believe that SCORE could become more relevant again today if they leveraged the online community."

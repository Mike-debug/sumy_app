Descartes is continuing an active acquisitions strategy, so much so that it has a dedicated acquisitions listing page showing its history of transactions.I can’t fault the company’s approach, certainly not by the rising share price, as a recent one-year chart shows below:(Source: Seeking Alpha)The stock continues to rise, even when the company misses on earnings and revenue, so management must be doing the right things.Certainly from an acquisition standpoint, the deals Descartes has been making are well within its core focus.While it did not acquire MacroPoint cheaply, the potential synergies as it builds out its Global Logistics Network initiative are potentially compelling, as customers demand the latest technology to optimize their operations as they work to grow revenues and cut costs in a highly competitive transportation market.I view the deal as a definite positive for the medium-term for Descartes.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, insider activity, and IPOs.

The company system is led by Product Manager Rafael Zimberoff.Below is a brief demo video about ShipRush Web:(Source: ShipRush)Online merchants use ShipRush to handles what happens when a sales is made until the point of delivery.It integrates with over 60 shopping carts, payment systems, and CRM/accounting systems and features dozens of integrations allowing merchants to see shipping rates and terms side by side to pick the most relevant one for their shipments.Merchants can then automatically print shipping labels to begin the parcel delivery process.Acquisition Terms and RationaleDescartes has paid $14 million in upfront cash from cash on hand. There is a maximum earn-out possible of $3 million, ‘based on ShipRush achieving revenue-based targets in each of the first two years post-acquisition.’As of January 31, 2017, Descartes had $38.1 million in cash, total liabilities of $70 million and CFFO of $72.6 million for FYE January 31, 2017, so appears to have the necessary resources to absorb the acquisition without strain.With its acquisition of ShipRush, Descartes is acquiring an advanced shipping options system that integrates with dozens of supply chain platforms providing post-sale logistics for marketplace merchants and the SMB market.Descartes is beefing up its marketplace offering for SMBs as more merchants transition to online-oriented operations.As Edward Ryan, Descartes CEO stated about the deal rationale,Descartes has been a very active acquirer of logistics technology companies in recent years, with thirteen acquisitions since January 2014, as detailed on its dedicated acquisitions listing page.I previously wrote about Descartes acquiring Datamyne in December 2016 in my article, Descartes Systems Group Acquires Datamyne For Global Trade Data.In that article, I highlighted Descartes’ ambition to build out its ‘Global Logistics Network as a one-stop solution for logistics needs’ of its customers.The ShipRush transaction is a continuation of that initiative by acquiring the technology to more quickly move in the space, rather than taking the time to build it from scratch.This is a classic ‘build vs. buy’ approach, and Descartes appears to be paying a reasonable sum to gain access and integration with numerous major players in online marketplaces while providing an on-ramp for SMB merchants.I view the deal as a medium-term positive for Descartes as it sticks to its core focus while accelerating its execution.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

        Datamyne is the leading global trade data database firm in the industry.
        Descartes is continuing to execute its strategy of acquiring supply chain software firms in major regions and Datamyne's large database of trade activity.
        Descartes is positioning itself for growth by building out its Global Logistics Network as a one-stop solution for logistics needs.","Quick TakeCanadian logistics software provider Descartes Systems Group (NASDAQ:DSGX) recently announced it has acquired trade data content company Datamyne for $52.7 million in an all cash transaction.Datamyne is considered the leading trade data database and counts nearly 3,000 customers worldwide.Descartes is executing an acquisition strategy that adds to its global software and systems footprint as well as now integrating trade data into its Global Logistics Network.The deal for Datamyne is a smart move, and I'm positive on the outlook for Descartes' continued impressive stock performance.Target CompanyMiami, Florida-based Datamyne was founded in 1992 to provide businesses with import-export trade data covering the Americas, Asia, Africa and the European Union, to assist them in streamlining their business operations.The company tracks a variety of data, including:Primary industry coverage includes the Global Transport Sector, Chemical Industry, Energy Industry and Food and Beverage Industry.Below is a brief explainer video:(Source: Datamyne YouTube)Direct and potential competitors of Datamyne include:Datamyne received $750,000 in disclosed financing in 2010, likely from majority shareholder Nassau Point Investors, and an undisclosed amount of debt investment in December 2015 from Praesidian Capital and Kemper Corp.In 2015, Datamyne acquired Zepol Corporation for an undisclosed amount, which was also a provider of US import and export data for competitive intelligence, market research, sourcing, trade compliance and lead generation.Acquisition Terms, Rationale and CommentaryDatamyne was acquired in an all-cash deal for $52.7 million.The company is considered the top trade data resource in the logistics industry, so no doubt commanded a premium for that position.Descartes has been on an acquisition binge throughout 2016, acquiring the following additional companies:In advance of these acquisitions, in March 2016 Descartes amended its $77 million credit facility to now consist of $150 million in revolving operating credit.As of October 31, 2016, and prior to the acquisition of Datamyne, Descartes had $77.9 million in cash and a credit facility usage of $3.3 million.The company did not say to what degree it tapped the credit facility to fund the $52.7 million purchase price of Datamyne, but it is likely to have utilized the facility for a material amount of the transaction.Descartes acquired Datamyne to provide added value to its Global Logistics Network, which it claims is the ""world's largest, collaborative multimodal logistics community.""With the new combination, customers of Descartes software system will now have a large amount of trade and logistics data at their fingertips, without having to leave the system to search for the data.""Datamyne broadens our trade data content footprint beyond customs and regulatory data and into the logistics trade data,"" said Descartes CEO Edward Ryan in a company statement.Descartes also gains almost 3,000 Datamyne customers.So, with these four acquisitions, it appears Descartes' strategy is to add supply chain software capabilities in the major global regions of Asia, US and EMEA along with worldwide trade data from Datamyne.The company's stock has had a neutral short-term reaction to the announced deal. DSGX' stock performance over the past five years has been impressive, as the chart below indicates.(Source: Seeking Alpha)With its 2016 acquisition strategy in full execution mode, Descartes is poised to build on its historically impressive stock performance to reach new highs with a dramatically improved offering spanning the major trading regions of the world.I write about IPOs, follow-ons, secondaries, and M&A.

3591066,94176,2015-10-21T18:26:04-04:00,Descartes Systems Group is well positioned to benefit from the increasing complexity of commerce regulation and the increasingly demanding global consumer.Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow metrics alleviate concerns about a lofty P/E ratio.Management combines for almost three decades in the industry and has a history of pulling off successful accretive acquisitions.,"In the age of e-commerce consumers are demanding that businesses cater to their every desire instantly. In order to accomplish this visibility throughout the supply chain is essential and logistics takes on an ever more important role in satisfying customers. To compete in the modern marketplace a business must be able to showcase and sell their products through many different channels and provide real-time tracking alerts for demanding purchasers. This produces enormous challenges for businesses that need a channel-agnostic real-time view of inventory and consumer behavior. Shipping and competing internationally factors in even more complications as every government involved imposes various restrictions, taxes and tariffs that are changing constantly. Documents and information must change hands between shippers and carriers seamlessly. Descartes Systems offers a variety of cloud-based solutions designed for businesses to meet these challenges with technology developed for the 21st century business climate.Descartes Systems Group (NASDAQ:DSGX) offers a variety of products aimed at helping shippers, freight-forwarders and carriers deal with each other and with governments in an efficient and dependable manner. For a multi-national business that's building and selling products in dozens of countries separated by thousands of miles, this type of help can be invaluable. The Descartes sales pitch is appealing because the company can step in and provide solutions at practically every point in the supply chain. Descartes can help plan optimal routes for maximum fleet efficiency, manage a company's customs and compliance efforts, and help minimize freight spend while meeting service requirements. Furthermore, the proprietary Descartes Global Logistics Network is the standard for inter-enterprise document and data exchange. Over 220,000 connected parties in over 160 countries can easily share a wide array of standard commercial documents to facilitate hassle free business. As large businesses expand internationally and deal with a demanding global consumer they will need to invest in their supply chain and delivery operations Descartes stands to benefit handsomely from this growth in spending.When the Descartes management team talks about the future of the company, one of the catalysts they say drives the business is the changing global compliance landscape. Currently every developed country requires significant disclosures for cargo being imported into their territory. Descartes feels that in the future a similar level of disclosure will be required for cargo leaving each developed country. Descartes CEO Edward Ryan said of export filings, ""it changes the whole dynamic in this trade regulation security filing business."" Descartes is currently making sure that customers understand the proposed regulations and that their systems can help customers fulfill their obligations, but a few years from now this could worsen compliance burdens and thus increase the value of Descartes' platform substantially.Operational LeverageDescartes Systems Group exhibits some wonderful attributes that are very rare for a small-cap company competing in the ultra competitive enterprise software market. Namely Descartes is not sacrificing profitability for the sake of grabbing market share. In fact Descartes is succeeding in quickly growing earnings with analysts predicting $0.28/share in fiscal 2016 and $0.37/share in fiscal 2017. This is only part of what makes the financial picture so appealing. In their September 2015 investor presentation Descartes breaks down the growth rate of several important financial metrics and the results are impressive. Descartes management is laser focused on growing adjusted EBITDA by 15% per year. Over the past nine years they have far exceeded this goal growing adjusted EBITDA at an astounding average of 26% per year. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue increased from 28% in 2010 to 30% in 2015 all the way up to 32% in the first half of fiscal 2016. The company continues to generate unbelievable amounts of cash from its business operations. In the first two quarters of 2016 Descartes generated 24.6M in operating cash flow. The ability of Descartes to consistently convert EBITDA to cash at around 85% is vital because it funds one of Descartes' main growth strategies - acquisitions.Inorganic GrowthWise investors are often cautious of companies that are dedicated to frequent acquisitions. This skepticism is caused by a long history of corporate acquisitions that were comprised of phantom benefits and very real integration challenges and debt loads. Investors should throw skepticism to the wind and embrace Descartes' acquisition habit for several reasons. The first is the experience and reputation of Descartes' management team. The CEO and COO have been at Descartes for 28 years and since June 2012 have acquired and integrated 13 different businesses into Descartes. Since June 4th, 2012, the company's stock price has improved from 8.02/share to 17.29/share. Clearly the executive team knows how to evaluate, price and integrate acquisitions.Descartes acquisitions are less risky than most corporate deals because of the way they are financed. Namely, Descartes tends to pay cash for the companies they acquire. This is a safe way to execute deals because there is no pressure to generate cash for payments to demanding creditors. Furthermore, it shows a measure of conviction on the management's part to do deals this way. If a management team is going to doll out eight figures to buy a company, they better be sure it is going to generate a return. Descartes' track record of creating shareholder value by acquiring businesses and integrating them into the company successfully speaks for itself.Valuation and MomentumAs is often the case with growth stocks the questions about Descartes mainly surround valuation and momentum. Is Descartes actually worth 75 times its earnings? Can a stock that traded at 6.05 in October 2010 continue its meteoric rise past the current 17.29 price? The answer in this case is yes due to the company's superb balance sheet and impressive cash generation. In the last quarterly report Descartes listed 71.5M of cash and accounts receivable with no significant obligations. In 2015 the company generated 49.5M in operating cash flow. Descartes thus generated $.65/share of operating cash flow which yields a price to cash flow of 26.86. This is a fair price to pay for a company that has an innovative and appealing product offering and is led by a management team that has proven it knows how to succeed in the complicated global logistics market.ConclusionDescartes Systems Group is a buy at the 10/20/2015 closing price of $17.29/share. The company is a compelling purchase because an increasing number of multinational corporations require logistics planning in a world where regulation is growing increasingly complex. Descartes seems expensive on a basic price to earnings basis but is actually reasonably priced when cash flow is taken into account. Descartes has a proven history of making wise acquisitions and avoiding the integration challenges and crushing debt loads that often accompany corporate takeovers. Descartes Systems Group common stock is an effective and appealing way to profit from the transforming complex international business climate."
1494092,22786,2013-06-11T11:21:52-04:00,,"Software-as-a-service (SaaS) is a buzz word that has yet to lose its appeal in the technology world. According to Gartner Group, SaaS sales reached $10 billion in 2010. The market is estimated to be more than double by 2015, and is projected to reach $21.3 billion. Customer relationship management makes up the largest market for SaaS. It is little wonder that investors are focused mainly on Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce.com forecasts revenue of $931 million to $936 million, or $0.11 - $0.12 per share in the current quarter. Due to Salesforce.com already being fairly valued, this article is interested in another small capitalization company operating in the same space: Descartes Systems (NASDAQ:DSGX).The purpose of this analysis is to explain why an ignored software company, Descartes Systems, provides an asymmetrical risk/reward opportunity for investors seeking a position in the SaaS space. The company provides management for logistics service providers. The company offers solutions for route planning, route execution, mobile applications and telematics and compliance.The last time Descartes gained interest from investors was in the year 2000. At the height of the dotcom craze, Descartes once traded at $90.50. Since then, Descartes Systems grew its network to over 10,000 customers and more than 146,000 connected parties, where more than 4.5 billion messages are processed annually. There are more than 800 employees around the world to support the largest logistics global messaging network.Descartes helps customers deliver services at a lower cost by adding users to its logistics network. As the network grows, prices drop for the same services over time.Source: Descartes Systems GroupDescartes Systems traded recently at around $11. Shares doubled in the last 5 years. In the last 6 months, Descartes is up 30%.DSGX data by YChartsDescartes could provide a disproportionately positive return for investors. The analysis will be given under the following:1) Company OverviewDescartes is a logistics management company that provides software solutions to streamline delivery operations. The company provides solutions in 3 markets: Global Trade Compliance (""GTC""), Supply Chain Execution (""SCE"") and Mobile Resource Management (""MRM"") Solutions. In GTC, the market is slow but profits are high. GTC solutions are made for government, ocean regulatory services, cargo security filings and declaration and fiscal compliance. In MRM, the market dynamic is that of high growth, but profits are elusive. The MRM solutions are route planning and execution, mobile applications, telematics and driver compliance for customers like Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Kraft and AmeriGas (NYSE:APU). The SCE dynamic is that of little to no growth but stable profits. SCE solutions include transportation management, logistics flow control and B2B integration-as-a-service.Descartes has a business model that scales toward a lower cost as enterprises join the logistics network. Service prices decline as the network grows in complexity. This increases the revenue per unit for Descartes.2) Valuation - Financial AnalysisDescartes grew its revenue by $34 million in the first quarter of this year to $34 million. Gross margin was 69%, compared to 65% last year. The company earned $2.8 million, up 8% from last year, or $0.04 per diluted share. Adjusted for acquisition-related charges, EBITDA per share was $0.16. For fiscal 2013, Descartes earned close to $0.60 per share (on an adjusted EBIDA), which was 17% ahead of plan.Source: DescartesThe company has an annual growth rate target of between 10%-15%. Over the last seven years, Descartes had a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 20%. The company has a goal of growing earnings to above $0.60 per share by fiscal 2015. If growth continues at 20% annually, then Descartes could earn $0.86 per share (non-GAAP) in 2015.3) Cash FlowDescartes generated $9.6 million in cash from operations in the 1st quarter of the year, nearly double the $4.4 million generated last year.Source: Descartes Press ReleaseThe company held $64.6 million in cash and cash equivalents as at April 30, 2013, with $27 million of the amount due mostly from proceeds from the debt facility and positive cash flow in the last quarter.4) Business MoatDescartes has a moat in its business that strengthens with more logistics activities and new business integrated in operations. When a technology becomes commoditized, profit margins will shrink and sales growth will slow. Descartes recognizes the risks of a commoditized technology, and operates with the highest moat when shipments exceed 500,000, the fleet is over 2000, and transactions are over $1 billion.Source: Descartes Corporate Presentation (May 2013)As Descartes moves its logistics technology platform to the community cloud, the network will have more global players. The accessibility of the network will be facilitated by an open, federated network. Descartes is achieving this by adhering to the Open Standard Collaborative Interfaces (SCIs).5) Recent Acquisition and Other Key EventsDescartes acquired KSD Software, a Scandinavian company that specializes in electronic customs filing in Europe. The acquisition adds 1,300 customers to Descartes' logistical network at an acquisition cost of $13 million. KSD generated revenue of $10 million annually.Descartes signed an agreement with Netsuite (NYSE:N) to collaborate Netsuite's SuiteCloud with Descartes' Logistics Technology Platform.The company announces a customer win once a month on average. The most recent announcement was that WAXIE Sanitary Supply chose Descartes to improve the efficiency of its delivery operations.ConclusionDescartes is positioned to grow profits at a faster rate, and scales effectively with the growth of its logistic network. The company forecasts low double digit growth in the range of between 10-15% but beat that baseline by a wide margin. Investors should expect this trend to continue. EBITDA margins also rose steadily since 2011 and gross profit margins were consistent over the last few years. Free cash flow is also rising sharply.DSGX data by YChartsThis suggests that Descartes is attracting new players to its global network without hurting its balance sheet. The company has the financial health to support even higher partner growth without a taking on a heavy debt burden. As this story unfolds, shares in Descartes will continue their ascent, and investors with a long position in the company will be rewarded.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Despite challenging worldwide markets and currency fluctuations, which were reflected in top-line sales performance, the Company had a record quarter for EBITDA, reporting $4.5 million and a 29% EBITDA margin on Q4 sales, up from 24% reported for Q4 FY2008. Cashflow and net income from operations was also higher than expected. Descartes is demonstrating impressive leverage from its SaaS business model.Cash and cash equivalent balances increased to $57.6 million for FY2009. The Company generated $18.7 million in cash from operations for the year, while also reporting $16.7 million in EBITDA. The TTM EV / EBITDA multiple for Descartes calculates to 5.4x based on Tuesday's closing share price. If the company sustains its EBITDA growth trajectory of 21% for FY2010, the FYE EV / EBITDA multiple would be implied at 4.5x.With its recent acquisitions, along with the potential impact on performance of the new ""10+2"" regulations in the U.S, EBITDA margins could range between 25% and 30% for the next 4 quarters, possibly increasing EBITDA trajectories.Based on comments by management, Descartes Systems could have had a better month in February than most others in the supply chain. In these current brutal market conditions, this datapoint should be seen as a lead indicator for continued performance for Q1 and for the remainder of FY2010.Investors should expect Management to continue to be acquisitive. Yesterday morning's announced C$8.5 million acquisition of Scancode is an example of the type of tuck under acquisitions that could be expected in the future. These type of acquisitions increase the customer base, while extending the capabilities of Descartes solutions within the supply chain ecosystem. The Company continues to move towards a more comprehensive end-to-end compliance and monitoring network for shippers.Although the stock jumped yesterday morning, shares are trading near 52 week lows. By most indications, earnings should continue to grow during the recession and DSG should be considered among the top performing small-cap technology companies listed on the TSX and NasdaqGS.Disclosure: I do not own shares of DSG."

However, there is one important common denominator, but before that is discussed, let’s take a look at what Descartes does to make money. Descartes OverviewBelow is an overview from Descartes’ most recent Descartes annual report:  Below is an excerpt from Descartes’ most recent annual report outlining Descartes’ sources of revenue: Basically, Descartes is providing transparency, automation, efficiency, and regulatory assistance throughout the supply chain of its customers.  The Network EffectLet’s get back to what Descartes, LinkedIn, and Facebook have in common. It is the network affect, although, the dynamics causing the network affect vary across these three. Descartes achieves this, because the more customers it signs up, the more it makes sense for other customers to sign up. Furthermore, once they do, customers generally stay with a software provider like this for a long time, especially if it ties them further into its supply chain partners. The stronger the network effect becomes, the bigger the moat. LinkedIn and Facebook have tremendous network affects. It is difficult to imagine anyone catching up to them at this point.  As such, they command tremendous valuations, although they are probably overvalued. However, with a forward P/E of 13, Descartes seems like a good deal if you believe they also are achieving a strong network effect, albeit a far less sexy.  The NumbersDescartes is growing and I think the growth is going to accelerate. Below are financial statement screenshots from the latest annual report:   Income Statement -      Balance Sheet -    Note: I could not fit the whole cash flow statement in a screenshot, but you can find it here.   As you can see, revenues are climbing steadily for Descartes. Balance sheet looks healthy as well. The only thing I don’t like is that the shares outstanding are growing. However, the gross margins are above 65% and the company is plowing a lot of money into growth. Descartes is growing organically and through acquisitions. According to management, its goal is to be a “Federated Network” that acts as a hub so that all its customers can communicate with each other. The way I look at it, Descartes is in a great position for growth: 1.) Descartes is signing up large clients and helping them streamline their logistics efforts. This gives Descartes a great opportunity to cross sell to other companies in the supply chain of its current customers. I would imagine this would make the sale easier, further achieving transparency across the supply chain. 2.) The world is only going to become more connected, and solutions like Descartes are going to be needed to avoid duplicative work by members in the supply chain. 3.) Advances in computer technology will only enable Descartes to provide more service and automate key areas of the supply chain in order to save money.4.) Transportation, particularly global transportation, is becoming more regulated and onerous, which makes solutions like Descartes very appealing for companies overburdened with paper work. This is a key selling point for Descartes. How often is regulation your friend? 5.) Descartes revenue model allows companies to pay for a license or per transaction, which means customers have flexibility as well as scalability. 6.) Descartes is growing globally and has revenue from all over the world.  7.) Once a customer signs up for software like this, they generally stay on board for a long time making revenue nice and predictable.  In conclusion, assuming you agree with me regarding Descartes network effect advantage, one has to ask why Descartes is priced at 13 times forward earnings while LinkedIn and Facebook are priced into the stratosphere. This question is particularly relevant when considering that LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter do not exactly have their revenue models nailed down like Descartes. In my opinion, I think Descartes is a small company in an unsexy industry and is just flying under the radar. In a couple of years, I imagine Descartes being much larger or bought out for a nice premium by another company. I have been watching Descartes for quite some time, and am planning to buy shares at some point. Marketwatch shows analysts with an average rating of BUY and a price target of $9.25. I agree. I think this is one people should get on board with, particularly after the most recent quarter of sales growth. Per the press release, in Q1FY12, Descartes had revenues of $27.1 million, up 27% from $21.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 (Q1FY11). Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in DSGX over the next 72 hours."
119154,22513,2009-02-08T04:58:59-05:00,,"Thursday, Descartes Systems Group (NASDAQ:DSGX) announced that it has acquired privately held Oceanwide Inc. for $10.4 million in cash. Oceanwide provides compliance Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) to customs brokers and sports a 90% recurring revenue stream. The acquisition extends DSG's logistics ecosystem to include customs brokers, and probably adds annualized EBITDA of between $1.2 million to $1.5 million, and initial sales of between $5.0 and $6.0 million. This is without synergies - which are likely.With close to $60 million in the bank, and an annualized cashflow of between $14 million and $16 million (depending on how bad the recession is), this could be considered a quintessential DSG tuck-under that meets the following criteria:In my opinion, Descartes Systems Group is one of only a very few public Canadian small cap technology Companies that understands the leverage that can be gained from cashflow and a strong balance sheet during this recession. Descartes shareholders should be applauding.Disclosure: I do not own shares in the Companies mentioned in this post, nor do I receive compensation from these companies in any way."

Yet, the company's recent success has been driven by inorganic means.Fortunately, management has been successful in integrating the company's many acquisitions. Management should be able to continue to inorganically grow revenue.However, a recent acquisition should help spur organic growth. The acquisition will help strengthen the relationship with a large client.The client has a very large customer base in which Descartes can sell their solutions.Management's growth strategy has been very successful and should continue to deliver rapid growth. The company's strong growth should result in the continued outperformance of their stock.","Descartes Systems Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:DSGX) is a provider of global logistics solutions. Descartes' solutions help organizations manage and comply with international and country specific trade regulations. Over the last several years, the company has grown double digits annually. From fiscal 2010-2014, revenue grew at a CAGR of 19.7%. In fiscal 2015, the company's growth rate has slowed but has remained in the double digits. In the first half, revenue grew 15.7% and 11.8% in Q2. Descartes' rapid revenue growth has resulted in their stock increasing 369.0% from January 2009 to November 2014. Can the company continue to rapidly grow, which would result in the stock continuing to outperform?Descartes' growth strategy involves both organic and inorganic growth. Yet, the majority of the company's recent growth has been inorganic. Over the last several years, management has acquired a significant number of companies. These acquisitions have driven service revenue higher which accounts for over 90% of total revenue. Management hasn't just acquired companies but has been successful in integrating them. Management success can be demonstrated by the company's improved operating margin. Descartes expects to continue to make many more acquisitions. Fortunately, management has a proven track record of success which should continue. Although not as important as inorganic revenue, organic revenue should continue to be a significant part of total revenue growth. Especially since a recent acquisition (Customs Info) has a strong partnership with SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL). Descartes already has a close relationship with SAP but doesn't have a close relationship with Oracle. The Customs Info acquisition will help spur organic growth through cross-selling into Oracle's large customer base.Ultimately, Descartes' growth has been driven by acquisitions which should continue due to the company's strong cash position. Additionally, organic growth should remain strong due to the Customs Info acquisition. Descartes' continued strong financial performance should greatly benefit investors.Responsible Inorganic GrowthOn the Q2 fiscal 2015 conference call, CEO Edward Ryan discussed the company's growth strategy: ""We grow through a combination of organic and inorganic activities and we continue to be inquisitive. We calibrate our business with a high degree of recurring revenue and a focus on decreasing one time license sales particularly as we look to integrate new acquisitions."" Management has done a good job of transitioning away from one time licensing revenue. In fiscal 2014, service revenue accounted for 91% of total revenue. Service revenue has one major advantage over licensing revenue. Service revenue is less volatile quarter-to-quarter which makes revenue more predictable. As revenue becomes more predictable, the stock should become less susceptible to dramatic swings which reduces the risk to investors. Yet, the company's service revenue growth is being driven by inorganic means.Over the last several years, management has been aggressively acquiring companies. Since 2013, Descartes has acquired 8 companies. These acquisitions are responsible for the majority of service revenue growth. In the fiscal 2014 annual report, management writes about fiscal 2014 service revenue growth: ""The increase in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of services revenues from the fiscal 2013 acquisitions of Infodis B.V...Integrated Export Systems, Ltd...and Exentra Transport Solutions Limited...as well as services revenues from the fiscal 2014 acquisitions of KSD, Compudata, and Impatex."" The use of acquisitions to drive revenue growth can be risky. With an acquisition, management could easily overpay or have troubling integrating the company. Fortunately, management has been successful in integrating and acquiring companies who have and will continue to increase revenue.From fiscal 2010-2014, Descartes' operating income margin has increased. Operating income margin increased 1.0 percentage point and reached 9.7% in fiscal 2014. Increasing operating margin while integrating several acquisitions is a testament to management's ability to successfully integrate companies. In fiscal 2015, management has continued to demonstrate their ability to integrate. In the first half, operating margin increased 3.1 percentage points y/y and reached 20.4%. Although growing by acquisitions can be risky, management has a proven track record of making quality acquisitions and successfully integrating them. This has helped reduce the risk to investors. Additionally, management should be able to continue to inorganically grow revenue. Especially since the company has a strong balance sheet. From January-July 2014, cash and cash equivalents have increased 125.5% and reach $141 million. Due to the company's strong cash position and growth strategy, acquisitions will continue to be a vital part of revenue growth. Yet, the company has and should continue to experience strong organic growth.Organic Growth Should ContinueTotal revenue grew 34.4% (2011), 14.9% (2012), 11.3% (2013), and 19.2% (2014). Over this time period, Raymond James Financial, Inc. estimates Descartes' organic growth ranged from 0%-10%. Organic revenue hasn't been the largest contributor to total revenue growth but is still an important part of the company's revenue growth. With the company's recent acquisition, organic growth should continue to be a significant part of total revenue growth. In 2014, management acquired Customs Info. Customs Info provides companies with country specific trade data. The trade data helps companies better manage international shipping. In Q2 fiscal 2015, Customs Info has already contributed 4.2 percentage points to total revenue growth. Yet, the acquisition's real value will be in expanding Descartes' relationship with a joint partner. Customs Info generated the majority of their revenue through two channel partners. On the Q2 fiscal 2015 conference call, Edward Ryan discussed the importance of SAP and Oracle: ""We bought Customs Info, these guys had really strong relationships. A lot of their sales come through those two channels."" Descartes already has a strong relationship with SAP but their relationship with Oracle isn't as strong.However, Customs Info has a strong relationship with Oracle. This should help Descartes continue to experience strong organic growth. On the Q2 fiscal 2015 conference call, Edward Ryan discussed Oracle: ""With Oracle, we were probably just getting started here at Descartes and with Customs Info who had a very strong relationship with them it probably helped us to get their attention...Customs Info sells trade and content data to Oracle customers and when we got to talk in Oracle we started talking about all the other things they could do on our network and I think that's really going to help us in the coming years to expand our relationships."" The Customs Info acquisition should help Descartes more easily reach the very large Oracle customer base. Oracle has over 400,000 customers which includes 100 of the Fortune 100.Obviously, every Oracle customer isn't going to need a global logistic solution. Yet, Descartes expanded relationship should help drive future organic growth through cross-selling. Additionally, the company should benefit from the efforts of Oracle's own sales team. On the Q2 fiscal 2015 conference call, Edward Ryan discussed the potential impact of Oracle: ""We think if we can start working with them together we can go and get Oracle sales guys talking about that with the customers. We think we can go faster in the future and that's exciting to us..."" Descartes' relationship with Oracle and SAP should continue to strengthen. The stronger relationship with SAP and especially Oracle will help drive organic growth. Ultimately, management should be able to continue to inorganically and organically grow revenue. The company's continued strong growth should result in the continued outperformance of the stock.A Solid Growth StrategyManagement wants to grow revenue through organic and inorganic means. Over the last several years, management has acquired several companies. These acquisitions have been a significant contributor to revenue growth. Although growing through acquisitions can be risky, management has been successfully in integrating companies. Management's ability to integrate can be demonstrated by the company's improving operating margin. From fiscal 2010-2014, operating margin improved 1 percentage point and reached 9.7% in fiscal 2014. Management has and should continue to drive revenue growth through acquisitions. Especially since, the company has a strong cash position. Yet, organic revenue should also be a significant part of revenue growth.Management's recent acquisition of Customs Info should help drive organic growth. Customs Info has a strong relationship with SAP and Oracle. Customs Info's relationship with these two companies will help Descartes cross-selling efforts. This is especially true with Oracle which Descartes doesn't have a close relationship with. The acquisition will help Descartes more easily sell into Oracle's large customer base. Descartes' strong financial performance has been driven by inorganic and organic means. Due to the company's past success and recent acquisition, Descartes should continue to grow rapidly. The company's continued strong growth should result in the continued outperformance of the stock."
176425,22513,2009-12-03T13:05:05-05:00,,"On Tuesday, Descartes Systems (NASDAQ:DSGX) reported Q3 2010 earnings with revenue up 11% to $18.9 million from $17.0 million reported for previous year Q3, and 2% higher than revenue reported for Q2 2010. Revenue was essentially in-line with consensus forecasts which were $18.5 million for the quarter.Adjusted Net Income, which is essentially EBITDA with a couple of non-cash items tossed in such as stock-based compensation, and contingent acquisition costs, was reported as $5.2 million up 13% y/y and flat q/q , which is in-line with analysts expectations.It should be of interest to investors that gross margin continues to strengthen over time. For Q3 2010, gross margin was reported at 69% versus 67% reported for previous year. As the company continues to move towards being a logistics data platform, investors should see gross margin continue to grow over time (notwithstanding the impact of future acquisitions). This is a sign of earnings leverage. The company generated $3.2 million in operating cash flow during the quarter.Management base-line outlook for the Q4 2010 is already ahead of analyst forecasts, and the company has been successful in signing up new clients in all regions. In addition, investors should expect more clients signing up to Descartes ""10+2"" electronic filing service during Q4, as enforcement begins in calendar year 2010. As a result, there is a chance of surprise upside in revenue growth during Q4 2010, along with earnings potential.Descartes Systems is not a well understood stock. However, Management has plans to be a global technology platform for logistics data. As regulatory complexity increases over time, most shippers will be forced to move towards electronic records and data transfer in order to compete. Descartes Systems plans to be the only sheriff in town for companies that manage logistics and need documentation.With nearly $100 million in cash and short-term investments, and a history of accretive acquisitions, investors should see Descartes begin a global roll-up of the various pieces required to become an end-to-end data and messaging platform for logistics information globally. One day Descartes could be to logistics what Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is to sales.Smart institutional investors are long on this stock because of its steady near-term earnings growth, and its future explosive potential. With the base-line ""calibration"" going into Q4 already ahead of analyst expectations, investors may see some upward adjustments by analysts in Q4 and FY 2011 forecasts. Some analysts may increase targets as well.Disclosure: I do not own shares of DGS or CRM"

In addition, DSGX provides logistics services for fleets, which has experienced increasing demand due to higher fuel and declining shipments.Third Quarter was better than expected.The Company was slightly below expectations in top line sales, reporting $7.1 million versus my expectation of $7.3 million due to shipping headwinds. However EBITDA was higher than expected at $4.4 million versus my expectation of $4.1 million. I believe that this is due to greater demand for higher margin services during the quarter.Cashflow was reported at $5.9 million, substantially higher than our forecast of $4.9. This better than expected result was due partly to Days Sales Outstanding [DSO] declining from 53 days to 47 days versus our expectation that DSO would increase to 60 days due to the economic stress of its client base. Reported earnings were 64% higher than my forecast at $2.3 million versus $1.4 million. Part of this difference can be explained by lower than forecasted tax expenses. EPS was $0.04 and a penny higher than my expectations of $0.03 EPS. This company is growing at a solid rate while many others are faltering.Outlook Is Positive For Three Reasons.1. Regulations will increase and make shipping more complex - With the announcement of the 10+2 regulation (aimed at improving product safety) in the U.S., DSGX is well positioned to help its clients comply at minimal relative expense, while the US government continues to keep the supply chain lubricated. By 2011, European Union regulatory harmonization will boost demand again.2. Worldwide Recession - Shippers will need to become more efficient to survive. Only 5% of all documentation is automated. More automation should be expected, and DSGX is in a great position to benefit - especially in North America.3. Volatility and Uncertainty - These two conditions benefit DSGX the most because shippers will need to contend with increasingly complex orders and contracts that may be amended by the second. This should benefit DSGX in the near-term as the only way to deal with this is through automated messaging.A Stock for the TimesDescartes Systems Group provides a boring but essential service to the Supply Chain. As conditions deteriorate and volatility increases, while more regulations get enacted, Descartes Systems becomes more essential to Supply Chain.The Company has no debt and $53.5 million in cash.A Potential Consolidator Descartes is in a great position to use its balance sheet to accelerate its capture of more regulations worldwide for automation. Its acquisition of Dexx in Europe is an early foray. I expect more to come. I also believe that the company can extend its messaging concept to other transactions in the value chain. Finally, DSGX could leverage its balance sheet to evolve into an outsources fleet management system.Disclosure: I do not own shares of Descartes Systems, nor do I receive any compensation from the Company, Management, or the Board."

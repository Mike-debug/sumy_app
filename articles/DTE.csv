4384764,24257,2020-11-04T05:16:37-05:00,"DTE Energy is a reasonably safe utility play, which should prove appealing to money seeking a home in today's uncertain world.The company has a history of outperforming the broader utilities sector.DTE is highly committed to expanding its footprint in renewables, which could attract some ESG money and help it continue its outperformance.The company was able to maintain its historic growth straight through the pandemic and economic lockdowns and even recently boosted its dividend.DTE has one of the more conservative financial structures in the industry, but its lack of a positive free cash flow creates risks.","On Tuesday, October 27, 2020, Detroit-based electric utility DTE Energy (DTE) announced its third quarter 2020 earnings results. Utilities are a fairly popular way for retirees and other conservative investors to generate income. This is largely due to the fact that they are generally relatively stable utilities that tend to boast reasonably high dividend yields. DTE Energy is certainly no exception to this and the company boasts some significant growth prospects in the renewables space, which I pointed out in my last article on the company. DTE Energy is one of the stronger companies in the utilities sector, which is clearly reflected in these results. DTE beat the earnings expectations of its analysts, which led to a near-term surge in the stock price, but the stock price has since fallen back down to earth. This may have created a buying opportunity but further investigation is in order.As mentioned in the introduction, DTE Energy is based in Detroit, although the company's operations extend well beyond that city. The company operates primarily as an electric utility serving approximately 2.2 million customers in Southeast Michigan, but it also has a natural gas utility arm that serves 1.3 million people throughout the state. This is not the midstream arm that the company announced that it will be selling, so it is important not to confuse the two. Thus, we can see that the company electric utility business is significantly larger and the company's management appears to consider it somewhat more important to DTE's future.The utility business is generally considered to be a reasonably stable one. This is because utilities provide a service that most people consider to be necessities. As such, during times when money gets tight (such as during a recession), people will generally prioritize paying the utility bill over more discretionary things in order to ensure that their services are not turned off. This feature has enabled utility companies like DTE Energy to ride through the pandemic better than many other firms due to the simple fact that people want to maintain services to their homes while they are stuck in them. We can certainly see this in DTE's performance year-to-date. In fact, in the most recent quarter, DTE Energy delivered fairly substantial growth compared to the prior-year quarter:Source: DTE EnergyThis is the continuation of a historic trend of earnings growth. As we can see here, the company has managed to grow its earnings per share at a 7.3% compound annual growth rate since 2008:Source: DTE EnergyThis clearly shows the company's ability to prosper through essentially any economic conditions. The time period reflected above includes one of the worst recessions in American history, an energy price collapse (although this generally did not affect utilities very much), and it should manage to continue the trend this year, an economic shutdown and a pandemic. As we can see from looking at the company's third-quarter results, it is on track to continue to deliver growth this year.DTE Energy has done more than just deliver earnings growth over time, though. In fact, the company has consistently delivered a higher total return than most other companies in its industry. This is true over just about any time period that we want to look at:Source: DTE EnergyNaturally, it is always important to keep in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future results. The fact that the company has a fairly long history of outperformance is a testament to the quality of its management and corporate culture. These are certainly reasons to believe that the company will be able to maintain this outperformance over an extended period going forward.As I discussed in my previous article on DTE Energy (linked in the introduction), DTE Energy is quite committed to the development of renewable energy. This is part of the company's commitment to reduce its carbon emissions by 80% by 2040 and achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In order to accomplish these, DTE Energy will need to change the portfolio mix of its power plants. As is the case with many utilities, DTE Energy generated a sizable percentage of its electricity from coal up until recently. In fact, back in 2005, approximately 77% of the company's electricity was produced by coal. DTE Energy has been gradually retiring these plants and replacing them with natural gas and renewable-powered ones. By 2030, DTE Energy expects that only about 30% of its electricity will be coming from coal while natural gas and renewables will account for more than half of generation capacity:Source: DTE EnergyThis matches up with a trend that we have been seeing globally. As I pointed out in various previous articles (such as this one), governments around the world have been using various methods to encourage utility companies to switch away from coal and towards natural gas and renewables for energy since both of these produce lower carbon emissions than coal does, which helps to assuage climate change fears. In addition, natural gas has been incredibly cheap in the United States for many years now, so this conversion may also help the company save money.As might be expected, the process of changing the company's energy generation profile will cost a great deal of money. DTE Energy plans to invest a total of $12 billion over the 2020-2024 period into its electrical grid, $3 billion of which is earmarked for cleaner generation:Source: DTE EnergyThis will not be enough for the company to completely update its infrastructure to meet the ambitious goals above. It is important, though, to note the time frames. DTE Energy has only announced its capital spending plans until 2024, but the company expects that it will take until 2050 to become fully carbon neutral. Thus, we can be certain that the company will incur even more capital expenditures as we head into the second half of this decade and beyond. The important thing for investors then will be monitoring the company's finances to ensure that it is not overspending, which is a problem that utilities sometimes have.Although DTE Energy only plans to invest $3 billion into cleaner generation over the next few years, the company expects to have a fairly substantial renewable portfolio when all is said and done. As might be expected, the company is opting to focus on wind and solar power as these are much less location-specific than something like hydroelectric power. DTE Energy currently has fifteen wind farms and 31 solar plants either operational or under development. All of these facilities combined would produce a total of 725 megawatts:Source: DTE EnergyThis output is enough to power about 500,000 average American homes. We can clearly see then that the company still has quite a bit of work to do if it wants to be able to provide all of its 2.2 million customers with renewable electricity. However, this is clearly a very good start and gives us reason to believe that DTE Energy will indeed be able to achieve its net zero carbon ambitions by 2050.One thing that has been occurring in the market this year is that many energy companies that are focused on renewables have seen their share prices surge while traditional energy names have stagnated. While this may be partly due to a belief that traditional sources of energy have no future, which is highly unlikely, it could also be driven by a rising popularity in environment, social, and governance investing. This is a style of investing in which the investor's money is directed at companies believed to be making a difference in the world. In the energy space, this corresponds to those firms promoting the development of renewable sources of power. As DTE is so actively involved in this, it is reasonable to assume that it will be one of the utilities attracting money from investors practicing this, much as NextEra Energy (NEE) has been. Therefore, this may be a reason to expect that the stock will continue to outperform its sector.As I have pointed out in a few past articles, one of the problems that many utilities have is a copious amount of debt. There are some people and even analysts out there that do not really see a problem with a high debt load in today's low interest rate environment. Indeed, there are reasons to believe that a utility can sustain a higher debt load than many other companies by virtue of their generally stable cash flows. Admittedly though, bankruptcies are certainly not unheard of in this sector, so a high debt load can certainly be a concern.Fortunately, DTE Energy is somewhat more conservative than some other utilities when it comes to debt. We can easily see this by looking at the way the company finances itself. Perhaps curiously, DTE Energy does not include a preliminary balance sheet in its earnings press release. Fortunately, the company has published its latest 10-Q with the SEC that does include this information. As of September 30, 2020, DTE Energy had $945 million in cash and equivalents, $1.455 billion in short-term and current debt, and $18.219 billion in long-term debt. This gives the company a total net debt of $18.729 billion compared to $12.488 billion in shareholders' equity. Here is how that compares to some of the company's peers:As we can clearly see, DTE is certainly not overleveraged by the standards of its industry. This conservative approach could be an argument that the company is somewhat less risky than many of its peers so investors have less of a need to worry about a bankruptcy or similar event. On the flipside of course, some investors may argue that this low debt load may be hurting the company's ability to maximize its return on equity. When we consider the fact that DTE Energy has historically outperformed its peers, though, this may not be a real problem. A risk-averse investor looking for income likely cares more about the conservative risk profile anyway.One thing that investors in utilities tend to like is that these companies tend to pay out a reasonably high dividend yield. This does make sense as utilities tend to be slow growth entities that enjoy stable cash flows, so they deliver a higher proportion of their total return in the form of dividends. DTE Energy is no exception to this as the company currently boasts a 3.52% yield, which is quite a bit more than the 1.74% being paid out by the S&P 500. In fact, DTE Energy even has a long history of consistently growing its dividend:Source: DTE EnergyThe company continued this streak in the third quarter with a 7% dividend hike to $1.085 per share quarterly. As is always the case, though, we want to make sure that the company can actually afford the dividend that it pays out. The usual way to do that is by looking at the company's free cash flow. The free cash flow is the money left over from its ordinary operations after the company pays all of its bills and makes all necessary capital expenditures. Therefore, this is the money that is available to do things such as pay off debt, buy back stock, or pay a dividend. In the first nine months of 2020, DTE Energy had a negative free cash flow of -$107 million. Thus, the company does not appear to be generating enough money to pay any dividend, let alone the newly increased one that it just announced. With that said, it is producing enough money if we look solely at earnings per share, but that figure is affected by numerous accounting entries that do not actually represent cash being produced or consumed by the business, so it is a much less accurate determinant of a company's ability to afford its dividend.In conclusion, DTE Energy remains more committed to a carbon-free future than most utilities and that may attract a certain sort of investor. We have already seen many renewable companies outperform traditional energy companies this year, and given DTE's historical outperformance, it could very easily continue this streak. The company appears to be quite conservatively financed compared to its sector peers too, so it may be a somewhat safer play than some other utilities. Unfortunately, while it does boast a reasonably strong and growing dividend, the company is failing to actually generate the cash to cover it. This may not be sustainable over an extended period, so it is something that investors should keep an eye on. Overall, though, DTE Energy is a fairly attractive utility."
4361079,103321,2020-07-27T14:17:36-04:00,DTE Energy has a plan to invest $19 billion of capital in the next five years to grow its business in Michigan.The company should be able to offset the impact of COVID-19 through its cost-saving initiatives.DTE Energy has an investment-grade balance sheet with ample liquidity to support its capital projects.The company pays a growing 3.5%-yielding dividend and trades at a discount to its historical average.,"DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) had a challenging Q1 2020 primarily due to unfavorable weather. The outbreak of COVID-19 will impact its Q2 2020 earnings, but its lean actions will help offset the impact and maintain its 2020 EPS guidance. DTE Energy plans to invest $19 billion of capital projects to grow its EPS by about 5%-7% annually through 2024. This will also result in EPS and dividend growth. The company currently pays a growing 3.5%-yielding dividend. It is also trading at a discount to its historical average and to its peers. This is a good stock to consider for investors seeking both dividend growth and capital appreciation.Data by YChartsDTE Energy delivered a poor Q1 2020 due to warmer-than-normal weather. As can be seen from the table below, its two main segments, DTE Electric and DTE Gas, saw significant declines in operating earnings of $53 million and $30 million, respectively. Hence, its operating EPS declined by $0.39 per share to $1.66 per share in Q1 2020.Source: June 2020 Investor PresentationDTE's 5-year, $19 billion capital projects will support its EPS growthDTE Energy has an ambitious $19 billion of capital projects to grow its business in the next 5 years (between 2020 and 2024). As can be seen, these projects include a combination of electric distribution, generation, and gas infrastructures. About 80% of these investments will be focused on its utilities. Management expects that these investments will help grow its EPS by about 5%-7% annually through 2024.Source: June 2020 Investor PresentationImpact of the outbreak of COVID-19 is manageableThe outbreak of COVID-19 has caused some interruption to DTE Energy's sales. Similar to other utilities, the company is experiencing lower gas and electricity demand during the lockdown (primarily due to lower consumption in industrial and commercial segments but offset by higher consumption in residential segment). Assuming that there will not be further lockdowns, management is projecting that its commercial and industrial sales will be down by about 6%-9% and 18%-22%, respectively, in 2020. This represents a combined loss of $70-$100 million in operating earnings. On the other hand, residential sales will grow by about 3%- 4% annually, and this will result in a growth of about $40-$50 million in operating earnings. Therefore, growth in residential sales is still not enough to cover the decline in its commercial and industrial sales. Fortunately, management has initiated lean actions across all business lines. These actions include delay hiring, reduce in travel expense, fast forward automation and work from home projects, reduce contractor and consultant spend, etc. These actions should help mitigate the impact caused by the outbreak of COVID-19. At this moment, management is still maintaining its annual EPS guidance of $6.47-$6.75 per share.A solid balance sheet to support its growth projectsDTE Energy has maintained its investment grade balance sheet with credit ratings of BBB (S&P), Baa2 (Moody's), and BBB+ (Fitch). The company has a healthy funds from operations to debt ratio of 18%. The company has available liquidity of about $3.2 billion by the end of April 2020. The company has also taken advantage of the current low rate environment and issued $1.7 billion of long-term debts. Therefore, DTE Energy has enough capital to fund its capital projects in the near term. Looking forward to the next few years, the company plans to fund its 5-year capital programs through a combination of funds generated from operations, debts, and equity issuances.Source: June 2020 Investor PresentationDTE Energy is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 17.36x. This is below its 5-year average of 18.40x. Its forward P/E ratio of 17.36x is also below WEC Energy's (WEC) 25.08x, Ameren's (AEE) 23.08x, and Entergy's (ETR) 18.52x. Therefore, DTE Energy appears to be trading at a discount right now.Data by YChartsA growing 3.5%-yielding dividendDTE Energy currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.012 per share. This is equivalent to a dividend yield of about 3.5%. The company has consistently raised its dividend in the past and has increased its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 6.1% since 2009. The company expects to increase its dividend by about 7% annually in 2020 and 2021.Data by YChartsDTE Energy faces several risks:(1) DTE Energy faces regulatory risk as over 70% of its revenue comes from regulated utilities in Michigan. Unfavorable regulatory environment could result in lower allowed return on equity.(3) Adverse weather conditions will impact the demand for natural gas and electricity.(4) Multiple waves of the pandemic may result in lower-than-expected energy consumption in Michigan, especially if another lockdown is introduced.DTE Energy should be able to continue to grow its earnings with its capital investments in Michigan in the next 5 years. The company appears to be trading at a discount right now and is a good candidate to consider for investors seeking capital appreciation and dividend income."

We started this model portfolio to celebrate hitting 10,000 followers.You can check out the details of the portfolio. You’ll see that we have 3 utility picks, one of which I believe is particularly undervalued. This isn’t surprising as it has usually traded at a discount to some of its peers, yet at the current price, it now totally warrants a purchase.The stock I’m talking about is DTE Energy Company (DTE).Source: Open DomainBuying high quality utilities at a discount is always a good idea. When DTE yields more than 3%, it is a good investment. When it yields more than 4%, it is an outright bargain.The current price of $97.35 gives the stock a yield of 4.16%. Our MAD scores give DTE a Dividend Strength score of 60 and a Stock Strength score of 75.I believe that dividend investors should invest in DTE Energy Company at current prices.Source: mad-dividends.comUtilities, by nature have extremely robust business models. A handful of them are wonderfully managed. These are the stocks which we try to buy, and we attempt to do so when the valuations are attractive.By presenting DTE’s dividend profile and prospects for market beating performance, I hope to convince you that the stock would make a great addition to your portfolio.Dividend strength is a concept which aims to nudge investors into picking the dividend stocks which will serve them right. We believe there are two main aspects which make a dividend investment the right one: dividend safety and dividend potential. The former is well understood by most investors, but the latter is sometimes forgotten. For you to meet your dividend goals, you must invest in dividend stocks with a certain combination of dividend yield and dividend growth potential. You can read more about this in our evergreen article (“Dividend Investing For Individuals Like You & Me”). So we strive to find stocks who a) have a safe & sound dividend, & b) have good dividend potential.DTE Energy Company has an earnings payout ratio of 67%. This makes DTE's payout ratio better than 31% of dividend stocks.DTE pays 25% of its operating cashflow as a dividend, which is better than 54% of dividend stocks.DTE has negative free cashflow, although for utilities, it is a metric which we overlook most of the time as we don’t believe it is relevant to the sector. Because of the guaranteed revenues, it is quite acceptable for utes to use leverage to finance their CAPEX programs, since there will be a spread between the interest rate and the set rate of return to be expected on their projects. As such we consider that looking at operating cashflow payout and earnings payout makes more sense.Source: mad-dividends.comAnd DTE has had a very stable payout ratio, maintaining for the most part the dividend at between 57% and 71% of earnings, and between 20% and 29% of operating cashflow. This creates a strong, stable buffer ensuring the safety of the dividend.DTE has an interest coverage ratio of 3x which is better than 43% of stocks, and slightly above the sector median. Largely sufficient for a dividend stock. The dividend has grown every year since 2010 at a consistent rate, proving management’s commitment to increasing payments consistently.Source: DTE Energy May Investor PresentationDTE is committed to its dividend, its stable business model ensures stable earnings and dividends for years to come. I’m not at all concerned about the safety of DTE’s dividendDTE Energy Company has a dividend yield of 4.16% which is higher than 60% of dividend stocks.Source: mad-dividends.comWhile these dividend yields aren’t unheard of for DTE, they are definitely among the highest investors have seen in a while. During the past decade, DTE has had a median yield of 3.5%. During 75% of the trading days during the 10 years, DTE’s yield was below what it is currently. Three quarters of the time, DTE’s dividend yield is lower, that is extremely enticing.The dividend grew 7% during the last 12 months which is in line with the company's 5 year average dividend growth of 7%.Source: mad-dividends.comManagement has announced that they expect 2021 growth to also be of 7%. Moving forward I find it very unlikely that anything could cause the stock’s dividend to raise by less or more than 6-7% per annum. This sort of dividend growth is good for a stock which yield between 3 and 3.5%. For a stock that yields over 4%, it is fantastic.When DTE Energy yields above 4%, the return you get on such a stable name is remarkable.DTE has a dividend strength score of 60 / 100. Like many utilities, the operational and financial leverage somewhat pulls down on the dividend strength score, without compensating for the sector’s resilience, something we might address in future iterations of the scoring process. I believe DTE is extremely attractive at current prices from a dividend investing perspective.But what of the stock’s ability to generate market beating returns? When I last wrote on DTE in November, it was trading at $125. It has now dropped 20%, by far underperforming the S&P 500. But many electricity utilities have fallen. I had warned that at $100, WEC Energy (WEC), along with most utilities were starting to look expensive. I hadn’t however, expected this sort of correction in the current market.How has this turn of events impacted DTE’s value and momentum? How in combination with quality, does this impact the company’s Stock Strength score?According to these values, DTE is more undervalued than 72% of stocks, which is very encouraging. As you can see, DTE is trading at modest multiples of earnings, sales and cashflows.Source: mad-dividends.comAs you can see, DTE is currently trading below its historical average PE. With utilities, you can do very well by purchasing them when valuations come down. This has been the case here for DTE.Value Score: 72 / 100DTE Energy Company trades at $97.35 and is down -27.36% these last 3 months, -21.39% these last 6 months & -22.54% these last 12 months.Source: mad-dividends.comThis subpar performance isn’t fantastic yet there are many stocks which have done worse. In fact, when you compare DTE to over 4,000 US stocks, you find that it somehow has better momentum than 44% of stocks, which tells a lot about the current market.This relative strength shows there has been a decrease of interest in utilities, and a rerating of stocks like DTE amid the current pandemic. Nonetheless, we’re confident that utilities remain high quality all weather stocks. In fact DTE still forecasts EPS to grow by 7% this year.Momentum score: 44 / 100DTE has a gearing ratio of 2.7, which is better than 33% of stocks. The company’s liabilities have increased by 21% over the course of the last 12 months. The company’s operating cashflow can cover 9.4% of liabilities.Each dollar of assets generates $0.3 in revenue, which is better than 33% of stocks, along with a return on equity of 9.37%. It depreciates 42.9% of it’s capital expenditure each year, which is better than 14% of stocks. DTE has a Total Accruals to Assets ratio of -18.9%, which is better than 87% of companies. This makes DTE’s quality better than 44% of stocks. Utilities often get sanctioned in our quality scoring process because of their leverage and because large capital expenditures can often increase their liabilities rapidly. Nonetheless, DTE’s asset turnover and return on equity are superior to the sector, as is its cashflow generation relative to its liability base.I don’t think DTE’s quality raises any red flags.Quality Score: 44 / 100When combining the different factors of the stocks profile, we get a stock strength score of 75 / 100 which is encouraging. The stock’s relatively high quality and only slightly worse than median momentum and quality make it a top 25% stock. This says a lot about the state of the market, in which combinations of just about decent values in 2 factors combined to a superior value in one factor, are enough to set the stock apart.With a dividend strength score of 60 & a stock strength of 75, DTE Energy Company is a great choice for dividend investors.In fact, I’m so confident that investing in DTE is a good pick at a 4% yield, that I will likely increase the stock’s position in the All Weather Dividends Portfolio at the end of the month.If you liked this article, then click on the orange “follow” button at the top of the page to be notified the next time we write an analysis of a dividend paying stock."
4334071,24257,2020-03-25T08:09:04-04:00,"DTE Energy has been one of the most proactive utilities at reducing its carbon emissions, which could endear it to the ESG crowd.The company intends to have 25% of its electrical generation come from renewables by 2023.This focus on renewables could cause the stock to outperform its peers going forward due to the current ESG investment craze.The company is very well-financed and can easily ride out any recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The company's dividend yield beats its sector as a whole, which is an added bonus.","One of the effects of the widespread market decline is that even companies that are unlikely to be affected by a viral pandemic or by a resulting recession have been severely beaten down. An excellent example of this is several companies in the utilities sector. These companies are generally stable throughout the entire economic cycle as they generally face very limited competition and most people prioritize paying the electric, gas, and water bills above other things when times are tight. It seems even more likely that people will make these payments while they are stuck at home as they would not want to be stuck in a house with these services turned off. One potential investment to take advantage of the market's recent sell-off of these stocks is Detroit-based electric and gas utility DTE Energy (DTE), which we will discuss in this article.DTE Energy is an electrical utility serving approximately 2.2 million customers in Southeastern Michigan and a natural gas utility serving 1.3 million customers in Michigan. The company also has operations in several other states providing similar services.Source: DTE EnergyIn addition to generating electricity by traditional methods, DTE Energy is a leader in the generation of renewable energy. It does this primarily through biomass, which is admittedly a method that we do not hear about very often but which has very real potential. In short, the company partners with landfill operators and dairy farmers to capture landfill and agricultural waste gasses, primarily methane, that it then uses to generate electricity. This therefore addresses one of the major concerns that environmentalists have expressed about the production of dairy and other bovine-based products.DTE Energy is also somewhat unique among utilities because approximately 25% of the company's revenues come from non-utility operations. These operations include natural gas storage and pipelines, power and industrial projects, and energy trading. As is the case with the company's utility businesses, these are businesses that are fairly recession-resistant and will not be impacted much by the emergency measures that have been taken to slow the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus.The company has enjoyed considerable success at rewarding investors through growth. Over the past decade, the company has managed to grow its earnings per share at a 7.3% compound annual growth rate:Source: DTE EnergyThis is a remarkably high growth rate for a utility, which are generally slow-growing entities as they tend to be dependent on population growth in their home areas. This growth rate has obviously greatly outperformed the broader utilities sector (XLU). The company does not intend to rest on its laurels, however. Over the next four years, it plans to invest a remarkable $19 billion into growth projects, 80% of which will be directed at its utilities segment:Source: DTE EnergyWe can see that some of this money will be directed at renewable energy projects such as renewable natural gas. The company also intends to invest in further efforts to reduce its carbon emissions. This company has been remarkably proactive about reducing its carbon emissions and has already set a target of reducing its carbon footprint by 80% by 2040. When we consider the growing popularity of ESG investing among investors, especially young investors, this may result in DTE Energy's stock having more buying pressure than other utility companies, which would lead it to outperform its sector average. Of the $12 billion that DTE Energy intends to invest into its electrical production and transmission grid over the next four years, a full $3 billion will be devoted to reducing its carbon emissions. We can see this here:Source: DTE EnergyIn addition to reducing the carbon emissions from its power plants, DTE Energy plans to increase the percentage of its electricity that comes from renewable sources of power. In 2005, it had no electrical generation coming from renewable sources but it plans to have fully 25-30% coming from renewable sources by 2030:Source: DTE EnergyThis should make the utility even more appealing to those investors that are interested in such things and have been behind the recent surge of capital into various ESG funds. As already mentioned, this buying pressure could lead the stock to outperform its peers going forward.The company's various grid upgrades and other growth projects are expected to result in 9.5% compound annual growth in operating earnings by 2024, as shown here:Source: DTE EnergyWhen we consider DTE Energy's history of beating its own earnings guidance, we have some reason to believe that it will actually be able to accomplish this projected earnings growth. This is once again very high growth for a utility, which should also help the stock outperform its peers going forward.DTE Energy is a very financially strong company as evidenced by its credit ratings. The company's debt boasts investment-grade credit ratings, as shown here:Source: DTE EnergyThis is something that should be appealing to investors in the current environment. The reason for this is that there is currently a great deal of fear surrounding risky assets, which is one reason why the price of pretty much everything except for Treasuries and the U.S. dollar has fallen considerably over the past month as market participants fear that the COVID-19 pandemic will push the global economy into a recession or worse. There is also a certain amount of concern surrounding the ability of financially weak or heavily-indebted companies to refinance their debt as it comes due in the current risk-averse world. It is less likely that a financially strong utility company will have such trouble so it is certainly nice to see that DTE Energy boasts a strong balance sheet given the current environment.We can see further evidence of the company's financial strength by looking at its balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019, the company had no short-term debt and $15.935 billion in long-term debt. This compares to $11.836 billion in equity, which gives the company a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.35. This is not particularly high for a utility company given their stable cash flows throughout the entire economic cycle. This serves to increase our confidence that the company will have no difficulty weathering and prospering through the current economic climate.As is the case with most utilities, DTE Energy pays out a dividend to its investors. This is nice because we do not know how long the coronavirus pandemic will take to resolve nor whether or not it will ultimately cause the economy to plunge into a recession. By paying a dividend to investors, the company is essentially paying you to ride out the current conditions, which can make the current market volatility less stressful and easier on the psyche to ride out. In addition, a little extra income never hurt anyone, especially retirees. The company currently pays out an annual dividend of $4.05 per share, which gives the stock a 4.68% yield at the current price. This is quite a bit more than the 4.35% yield paid out by the utilities sector as a whole. The fact that the yield is better than the sector average is just an added bonus for income-focused investors.In conclusion, DTE Energy was sold off pretty heavily in the current market panic despite the fact that as a utility it is likely to be somewhat insulated from problems in the economy. This is due to the fact that people typically prioritize paying their utility bills over other things during times when money is tight. When we consider that the government is basically forcing everyone to stay at home, they are even more likely to prioritize putting utility payments ahead of other things. The company is also very well-positioned to deliver forward growth and its growing exposure to renewables could appeal to the ESG crowd, resulting in stock outperformance relative to its peers going forward. The company is also quite strong financially and offers an appealing dividend so you get paid to ride out the current economic problems. Overall then, DTE Energy might be worth considering as a potential investment."
4312154,38631,2019-12-12T13:07:55-05:00,"In the current environment of low interest rates, most investors are struggling to identify stocks with attractive yields and reasonable valuation levels.DTE Energy is a rare utility stock, as it combines an attractive yield with strong growth prospects.DTE Energy is offering a 3.2% dividend yield and is likely to grow its dividend by about 7% per year for at least the next five years.","Due to the cuts of interest rates by the Fed and the all-time high level of the S&P, it has become quite challenging for investors to identify stocks with attractive yields and reasonable valuation levels. Many investors have resorted to utilities in order to lock in decent yields, but utilities have enjoyed a relentless rally, which has rendered them fully valued or overvalued. DTE Energy (DTE) is superior to most utilities and provides an interesting investment option for investors, as the company is growing much faster than the vast majority of its peers.DTE Energy is different from the other utilities, as it has non-utility activities apart from its utility divisions. The company generates 70%-75% of its operating income from its utility segments, namely the electric and gas divisions, and 25%-30% of its operating income from its non-utility segments, namely gas storage & pipelines, power & industrial projects and energy trading. The non-utility segments help the company grow much faster than its peers.DTE Energy has a decade-long record of exceeding its original guidance and outperforming its peers by a wide margin. During the last decade, the stock has tripled whereas the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) has advanced only 113%. This extent of outperformance is striking in the slow-growth utility sector.Moreover, DTE Energy is remarkably proactive in reducing its carbon emissions. Its management has set goals to reduce carbon emissions by 50%, 80% and 100% by 2030, 2040 and 2050, respectively. Furthermore, the company recently doubled its planned investment in renewable energy for the next three years from 1,000 MW to 2,000 MW. This strategy is prudent, as it is becoming increasingly costly to purchase rights for carbon emissions. In addition, this environmental-friendly strategy helps the company maintain good relationships with regulatory authorities and thus enjoy decent rate hikes in its regulated business.Despite its impressive performance over the last decade, DTE Energy does not rest on its laurels. The company continues to invest heavily in its utility infrastructure while it also takes advantage of investing opportunities in its non-utility segments. DTE Energy plans to invest $19 billion in growth projects over the next five years. As this amount is 79% of the current market cap of the stock, it is evident that the company is investing heavily in its growth projects.Part of future growth will be driven by the recent acquisition of a gathering and pipeline system in Louisiana’s Haynesville for $2.65 billion. After a flat production period, Haynesville has grown its shale oil production by 28% per year in the last two years thanks to technological advances. It has thus become the second-fastest growing shale oil basin in the country, behind the Permian Basin. Haynesville is expected to grow its production by 8.4% per year on average over the next four years. It will thus be a meaningful growth driver for DTE Energy.As mentioned above, DTE Energy has outperformed the vast majority of its peers over the last decade. During this period, the company has grown its operating earnings per share at an 8.1% average annual rate, which is the second-highest in its peer group.Source: Investor PresentationMoreover, the company expects to grow its earnings per share by 5-7% per year on average over the next five years. This is certainly an attractive growth rate, particularly given the current phase of the economic cycle, after a whole decade without a recession. It is also worth noting that most utilities are growing at much slower rates due to their lackluster growth projects and the high interest expense they have to pay due to their excessive debt loads. DTE Energy has a healthy balance sheet, with an investment-grade rating, as its interest expense consumes only 37% of its operating income.DTE Energy is currently offering a 3.2% dividend yield. While this yield is not exciting, it is higher than the 3.0% average dividend yield of the utility sector right now. Even better, DTE Energy has a payout ratio of 65%, which is markedly low for a utility stock and provides a great margin of safety for the dividend.Moreover, thanks to its promising growth prospects, DTE Energy expects to grow its dividend by 7% per year for at least another two years. As the company has maintained a payout ratio around 60% over the last decade and expects to grow its earnings per share by 5%-7% per year over the next five years, investors can reasonably expect the company to continue raising its dividend by about 7% per year over the next five years.Overall, DTE Energy is offering a decent dividend yield, with a wide margin of safety, and the company is likely to keep raising its dividend much faster than the vast majority of the other utilities.Due to suppressed interest rates, many investors have rushed to buy utility stocks in order to secure decent yields for their income portfolios. However, these stocks are trading at markedly rich valuation levels and hence they will have significant downside risk whenever interest rates rise. Income-oriented investors should consider purchasing DTE Energy, which is growing much faster than its peers and thus offers a rare combination; an attractive yield and promising growth prospects."
4301992,103213,2019-11-03T15:57:09-05:00,"Six months ago, I said DTE was my favorite stock. WEC was second favorite.WEC has wildly outperformed DTE since then.Nothing fundamental has changed with the prospects of DTE as a dividend investment.As a result, it is one of the few utilities that still offers a good combination of dividend strength and value.","Written by Sam KovacsIn a recent article on WEC Energy (WEC), I mentioned wanting to trim my position to realize some value. Looking back at utilities I analyzed in April, it didn’t take long to conclude that my previous favorite was the best candidate for reinvesting the proceeds: DTE Energy (DTE).Source: Open DomainAs some of you might remember, six months ago Robert and I analyzed 10 utility stocks and each suggested our two favorites. My two picks were WEC Energy & DTE Energy. While both have beaten the market (when including dividends) since the articles were published, the latter has been uninspiring relative to the rest of the sector. DTE Energy is up only 1.92% while WEC is up 18%.Back in April, WEC & DTE were the only stocks which offered a combination of dividend yield and dividend growth potential that seemed enticing. Many utes were already looking quite overvalued. Many of those utilities have continued their meteoric rise and are now at prices I couldn’t even consider. For instance MGE Energy (MGEE), which was yielding 2% and has been growing the dividend at 5% per annum now yields only 1.85%.If you care about money at all, and truly are a dividend investor, owning assets which yield so little and barely grow the dividend shouldn’t be an option. This doesn’t mean that they can’t go up a lot more, as has been the case for many utilities.Water utilities are by far the most overvalued. In August I wrote a piece titled “What To Do When An Entire Sector Becomes Overvalued”. The article demonstrated why I didn’t believe there were any assets in the water utility industry offering attractive dividend profiles.While the tide has started to turn for a couple of the stocks I warned against – California Water (CWT) is down 2% since my article, Artesian (ARTNA) is flat since my article – others such as York Water (YORW) have increased by double digits.Overall, utilities have continued to lead the way. I expressed this clearly in my October article “Opportunities and threats in today’s market”. The median utility stock has better momentum than 72% of US stocks according to our Momentum Score.But not DTE. In fact, as we will see later, DTE’s three-month price momentum is worse than that of the median US stock. Investors reacted negatively to the latest earnings report when the company missed on earnings. The announcement of equity issuance through the next three years didn’t help.Nonetheless, an objective look at DTE doesn’t suggest that the stock is in any trouble. If anything, it is one of the few utilities with an attractive combination of dividend yield and dividend growth potential.DTE Energy has a dividend yield of 3.20% and it trades around $126.59. Based on my M.A.D Assessment DTE has a Dividend Strength score of 74 and a Stock Strength score of 60.This article will present and discuss the factors which show why I believe that dividend investors should invest in DTE Energy. In fact, if you’re looking for a utility with a good combination of dividend safety, dividend yield and dividend growth potential, DTE might be one of your only choices.Source: mad-dividends.comMany of you have become familiar with our approach. We first look at the company’s dividend profile: Is the stock a good pick for a dividend investor at current prices? We then look at the fundamental factors that could influence capital gains: Is the stock likely to do better than the market in upcoming quarters? While many dividend investors overlook this second part, it is important to avoid overpaying for stocks, and suffering subsequent capital losses.What exactly makes a stock a “good pick for dividend investors”? We believe there are two primary aspects to a good dividend stock: dividend safety and dividend potential. What good is there in owning a dividend stock if the dividend gets cut? Your income goals will be way off base, the stock price will likely tank and you’ll have to deal with your poor decision. On the other hand if the dividend doesn’t have the potential to contribute significantly to your total returns, what good does it do to focus on it? Here we’ll be looking for a good combination of dividend yield and dividend growth potential.DTE Energy has an earnings payout ratio of 64%. This is a more attractive payout ratio than 28% of dividend stocks.DTE pays 28% of its operating cash flow as a dividend, putting it ahead of 49% of dividend stocks.As is customary with utes, DTE spends more in CAPEX than it generates in operating cash flow. This is due to the capital-intensive nature of the business. Therefore, looking at metrics like free cash flow makes little sense. You’re better off thinking in the following way about utilities: Operating cash flow goes towards paying dividends and interest; CAPEX is financed by debt or equity issuances.Source: mad-dividends.comNonetheless, despite the decline in EPS last quarter, DTE’s dividend coverage remains very good. Operating cash flow can cover the dividend three times.DTE can also cover its interest three times, which is better than 40% of stocks. This level of coverage is in line with the sector median.DTE has been paying cash dividends for 100 years, which have now been increasing for the past 10 straight years.I believe DTE’s dividend to be very, very safe.DTE Energy's dividend yield of 3.20% is better than 66% of dividend stocks. While the stock has slightly appreciated in price since I last covered it, the dividend yield has actually increased by 20 basis points. Source: mad-dividends.comWhy? A recent announcement of a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend, from 95 cents to $1.01 per share ($1.0125 up from $0.9455 if we’re being picky).This is in line with the company’s five-year dividend CAGR of 7%. Source: mad-dividends.comIs dividend growth threatened as we move forward? No, not at all. First, the dilution of the announced equity issuances shouldn’t impact EPS growth. While investors should expect $2 billion to $2.5 billion to be issued between now and 2022 (about 10% of market cap), – $500 million of which will be incurred in 2019 – management has adjusted operating EPS guidance for 2019 and 2020 upwards.Source: Earnings PresentationInvestors should remain confident that DTE will likely continue to increase its dividend to the tune of 6% to 8% per year for upcoming years.This level of growth is satisfying for a stock yielding just above 3%. At these yields, I look for mid-single-digit dividend growth potential. DTE fits the bill.The combination of the data presented above gives DTE a dividend strength score of 74 / 100. The dividend safety is unchallenged, and the combination of dividend yield and dividend growth is a rare, refreshing breath of fresh air among many overvalued utilities. DTE is still very much a utility stock that dividend investors can consider for their portfolio.But what about potential for capital appreciation? In April I announced that I believe utilities will continue to do well until the end of this bull market. So far they have, but many have become overvalued as a consequence. Investors moving to utilities at the current stage, or increasing their exposure to utilities, should be very careful to not put their capital at risk by investing in overvalued stocks.Nobody should be willing to pay any price for a stock. Curiously, though, with the ever-increasing popularity of ETFs, more and more investors have become indifferent to the process of price discovery. “Just buy the whole index,” they say. While this definitely isn’t a bad strategy during bull markets, I expect a day of reckoning to come in the next recession. Value should always matter.However, the data also suggests that we should avoid buying stocks with bad fundamentals and/or bad momentum.I use our proprietary MAD Scores to assess these factors, and conclude on the likeliness of a stock to do better than the market in upcoming quarters.These values would suggest that DTE is more undervalued than 79% of stocks, which makes it look quite cheap relative to its sector. The median utility stock trades at 25x earnings and 11.7x cash flow.Source: mad-dividends.comThe chart above suggests that DTE is trading below its five-year average PE. A reversal to its average multiple would imply 20% upside.Relative to its sales, earnings and cash, and to its sector, DTE doesn’t look expensive. In fact it looks quite cheap. It also yields more than the average stock in the sector. The only blemish is the negative buyback yield. However as I mentioned above, the issuance is to complete an acquisition, which should be accretive to EPS. I wouldn’t be too concerned.Value Score: 79 / 100DTE Energy's price has decreased by -1.85% these last three months, but is still up 2.40% these last six months & 11.41% these last 12 months. The stock now trades at $126.59.Source: mad-dividends.comThis gives DTE better momentum than 59% of stocks. Its six- and 12-month performance still place it in the second quintile of stocks, but its three-month performance makes it slightly worse than that of the median US stock.Source: mad-dividends.comIn December of last year, the stock price crossed both its 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages, before recovering. Throughout the year, the 20-day and 50-day SMAs have served as resistance.During the past week, the stock has once again pushed below both SMAs. In the very short term there could be some more downward pressure. The stock might bounce off the $125 level, or it could go down to $120. I don’t see any rationale for it breaking lower than those levels, barring any unexpected bad news.Momentum score: 59 / 100DTE's debt/equity ratio of 2.6 is better than 32% of stocks. DTE Energy's liabilities have increased by 10% this last year. Operating cashflow can cover 9.2% of DTE's liabilities.These ratios would suggest that DTE Energy has better financial strength than 45% of stocks. This is an equivalent financial strength score as the median utility stock, and should be considered satisfactory.Financial Strength Score: 45/100DTE Energy’s Total Accruals to Assets ratio of -13.1% puts it ahead of 66% of stocks. 42.7% of DTE's capital expenditure is depreciated each year, which is better than 15% of stocks. Each dollar of DTE's assets generates $0.3 of revenue, putting it ahead of 38% of stocks. Based on these findings, DTE has higher earnings quality than 37% of stocks. These numbers are all above the sector median. Utilities are penalized in our financial strength and earnings quality scores because of their capital intensive nature. It is therefore more rational for us to compare them with sector medians, while keeping this inherent difference in business model in mind.Earnings Quality Score: 37 / 100When combining the different factors of the stocks profile, we get a stock strength score of 60 / 100 which is quite satisfying. The stock’s financial strength and earnings quality are in line with the industry median, yet the stock’s value is significantly higher. The overall momentum remains better than that of the broad market, but this has turned in the last two weeks. As such the stock could decline to as much as $120 in the short term, which isn’t enough to deter me from advising investors to buy.With a dividend strength score of 74 and a stock strength of 60, DTE Energy is still a great choice for dividend investors. You’ll be hard pressed to see me advise a buy in any utility stock, but DTE has lagged the sector and as a result its valuation remains reasonable at current prices.I will be trimming my WEC position by about one-fifth and relocating those funds to DTE. If you are compelled to do the same, have purchased WEC at multiple times and hold your WEC shares in a taxable account, you might want to consider indicating to your broker to use a LIFO sale (assuming the last shares bought were at the higher price).If you enjoyed this analysis, then I strongly encourage you to click on the orange “follow” button at the top of the article to receive free notifications the next time I publish articles on interesting dividend stocks."
4300073,73075,2019-10-29T16:18:18-04:00,"DTE reported weaker than expected earnings, and the stock tanked. Shares are down more than -7.5%.Despite the miss, DTE raises guidance as it positions for a strong 2020.A play in mid-stream energy infrastructure is driving shareholder value. And core business is good too.The stock pays a healthy 3.2% dividend, and the outlook is good, it will be increased again next year.DTE is a buy for dividend growth investors.","DTE Energy Company (NYSE:DTE) just reported 3rd quarter results, and the bottom line was not good. The company fell far short of consensus for GAAP and operating earnings, and shares tanked. Shares of DTE are now down about -7.5% from the recent peak and offering up a nice entry point for dividend growth investors.The EPS miss was not nice to see. Don't get me wrong, but it isn't that bad once you dig a little deeper. First and foremost, the analysts had set a high bar for the company after years of upgrades. DTE has been executing a long-term plan to drive growth across its diversified platform, and management has been delivering results, so it is understandable the sell-side guys got ahead of themselves.The consensus price target has been on the rise for years. The consensus rating has been rising sharply since early summer. DTE is targeting 5-7% annual EPS growth through 2023 and is well on the way to delivering that goal despite this quarter's miss.From the earnings call transcript,Note that Mr. Oleksiak, DTE CFO, says exceed original guidance. Strength across business segments, discounting the impact of one-off and non-recurring charges, is expected to remain strong in the current quarter and next year.DTE also announced the first look at 2020 guidance. The company is expecting growth to be at the high end of their long-term target, and that is on top of the strength seen this year.From the earnings call slides,DTE announced plans to raise money via public equity offering shortly after the conference call. The news helped send shares to new lows on fears of diluted shareholder value, but that's only increasing the value opportunity today. Along with cheaper share prices, proceeds from the public offering are going to be used to fund additional expansion into the midstream energy infrastructure arena.From the press release,This move is noteworthy for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the fact midstream will be DTE's biggest EPS growth driver in 2020. Gas Storage & Pipelines is expected to produce 33% to 35% growth next year, including the recent addition of the Haynesville facilities. That equals $75 million if results come in at the high end of the range. The core DTE Electric business is only expected to grow EPS by $61 million.From the earnings call slides,Another reason is the timeliness of the push toward mid-stream. Brookfield's Public Securities Group just highlighted the attractiveness of midstream energy infrastructure a week or so ago at their quarterly Real Assets Update. Brookfield's management team sees value, high yield, and dividend sustainability in a market poised for a rebound. Based on my own initial assessment of the midstream investment universe, I concur. Demand for midstream services is only going to increase over the coming years, and that is going to fuel revenue, earnings, and dividend growth.DTE's attractiveness is twofold. Along with its long-term growth plans, the company pays a nice, healthy dividend. At today's share prices, the yield is right at 3.25% and well above the broad market average. If the EPS miss or need to raise additional capital worries you, let me tell you this. The dividend was just increased because of its sustainability, and there is still plenty of room for future increases.The payout ratio is running at roughly 65%. This is a bit high among the utility companies but by no means the highest nor prohibitively high. At this level, we can safely expect the company to continue hiking its payments at the 6.8% clip it has been for the last ten years.The factors that make DTE an attractive dividend growth stock haven't changed despite the whiff on 3Q earnings. If anything, the whiff and subsequent sell-off are offering a great buying opportunity for dividend-growth investors. Despite the whiff, DTE has upgraded its guidance outlook for this year and next and making moves into midstream that will drive profits long into the future. Those profits are fueling a healthy dividend and a cycle of dividend increases that will in turn drive capital gains for investors."
3986297,24961,2016-07-06T10:04:41-04:00,"Michigan electric and natural gas utility DTE Energy's share price appreciated strongly in Q2 despite a Q1 earnings report that missed on both lines.Last year's adverse weather conditions have been replaced by a forecast for temperatures that will result in strong energy demand this summer and possibly winter as well.The company's management is also moving forward with plans to make its energy mix increasingly dependent on natural gas sourced from the Utica Shale and transported via pipeline.The company's shares are priced as if strong earnings growth is in the near future, however, even though an expectation of normal growth requires optimistic assumptions.","Michigan electric and natural gas utility DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) reported underwhelming Q1 earnings back in April. While investors responded by sending the company's share price sharply lower, it has subsequently rebounded by nearly 17% (see figure), steadily setting new all-time highs on the way. This has been a frustrating experience for investors such as myself who would like to purchase the company's shares but are wary of doing so for a premium. The strong rebound has occurred against the backdrop of especially hot weather in DTE Energy's service area and the company's own recent decision to shut down the majority of its coal-fired generators within seven years. This article re-evaluates DTE Energy as a potential long investment opportunity given these new circumstances.DTE data by YChartsQ1 earnings reportDTE Energy reported Q1 revenue of $2.6 billion. This result was 14% lower than its Q1 2015 counterpart and missed the consensus analyst estimate by $410 million. Both the decline and miss were attributable to the presence of winter weather that was substantially warmer than normal due to last year's strong El Nino weather event, which resulted in abnormally warm temperatures across the northern half of the country. The company's service area recorded 12% fewer heating degree days in Q1 than normal and 23% fewer than in Q1 2015, when Michigan experienced one of its coldest winters in many years.While the company's electric and natural gas segments both reported lower demand due to the warm weather, the latter's revenue result was further hurt by a 16% rate cut that was implemented during the quarter. The company has been steadily reducing its natural gas rates in recent years to reflect falling natural gas prices, and these were lower in Q1 2016 than in Q1 2015 (see figure). Cheap natural gas has spurred demand, however, and the company's overall revenue decline was partially offset by higher volumes at its natural gas storage and pipeline segment.Michigan Natural Gas Citygate Price data by YChartsThe continued decline of natural gas prices in Q1 did cause DTE Energy's cost of revenue to decline to $1.3 billion from $1.4 billion YoY. Coal prices have followed those of natural gas lower in recent years and the two commodities are the electric segment's primary fuel sources. The reduced demand for natural gas resulting from the warm winter also contributed to the cost of revenue decline, however, and the company's gross profit fell by 23% YoY to $1.2 billion as this failed to offset the lower revenue number. The company's operating income also fell sharply to $381 million despite a sizeable reduction to its operating expenses, especially O&M.DTE Energy's GAAP net income came in at $247 million, down by 10% YoY. Of its operating segments, DTE Gas reported the largest net income decline of 21.6% YoY, followed by a decline to its consolidated non-utility segments of 21.5% over the same period. DTE Electric fared best because of a rate increase, although its net income still fell by 6.6% YoY. The consolidated GAAP result included a large mark-to-market impact to the Energy Trading segment and a plant closure in the Power & Industrial segment. Excluding these two impacts resulted in an adjusted net income of $273 million, down by only 7% YoY. This resulted in an adjusted EPS result of $1.52 that only missed the consensus by $0.03 despite falling from $1.65 in Q1 2015. (The most recent GAAP diluted EPS result was lower at $1.37.)DTE Energy's free cash flow fell by 7.3% YoY to $317 million. This was due in part to higher capex in the most recent quarter, although the company's operating cash flow fell by 0.8% over the same period due to the lower net income result. The company's dividend payout ratio in FY 2015 was on the low end at 53%, however, and management opted to maintain its earlier 5.4% increase to the quarterly dividend by keeping the payment at $0.73/share, resulting in a Q1 payout ratio of only 55% despite the lower-than-expected net income result. This is down from around 65% in previous years, making it likely that the current rate of dividend growth is safe despite the Q1 result.OutlookManagement reaffirmed during the earnings call its earlier adjusted EPS guidance for FY 2016 of $4.80-$5.05. The midpoint of $4.93 would represent YoY growth of only 2.3%, well below the company's 5-6% earnings growth target. In fact, DTE Energy will need to achieve the very top of the guidance range if it is to even come close to the bottom of the target range. It should be noted, however, that the YoY comparison is held back by the Energy Trading segment's sizeable contribution to FY 2015 earnings, whereas management is guiding towards a segment contribution of zero in FY 2016. Excluding this segment, the midpoint of management's guidance would represent earnings growth of 4%, closer to the target range. And, as mentioned earlier, the current dividend payout ratio means that dividend growth can continue to outpace earnings growth in the short term.While DTE Energy's guidance is disappointing at first glance, the fact that the company's management reaffirmed it less than a month ago suggests that it is setting the stage for an actual result that is at the top of this range. Last year's historically-strong El Nino weather event has finally ended and given rise to its counterpart, La Nina. Unlike El Nino events, La Nina events are associated with hot and dry summers in Michigan followed by cold winters in the region. Of the nine La Nina events on record, Michigan experienced warmer-than-normal summer temperatures during eight of them and average temperatures during the ninth.Michigan recorded twice as many cooling degree days in June 2016 than in June 2015 and 60% more in the most recent Q2 compared to Q2 2015, lending support for the expectation of high electricity demand in DTE Energy's service area in Q2 and especially Q3. Q3 in particular is normally a major contributor to the company's annual earnings, so robust performance by its electric and natural gas segments (the former due to demand for electricity from air conditioners and the latter due to demand for fuel from natural gas generation units) in that quarter would have an outsized impact on its FY 2016 results.The weather isn't the only development of recent months that the company's investors should be interested in. DTE Energy is continuing to increase its future exposure to natural gas by making moves that have the potential to contribute to its future earnings growth, so long as the commodity remains inexpensive in the U.S. First, management announced during the Q1 earnings call that its NEXUS natural gas pipeline, which will connect the Utica Shale with the company's Michigan service area (as well as many natural gas generation units along the pipeline's path), is expected to be in service by the end of 2017. Demand for the pipeline continued to increase in Q1 as its total interconnect agreements rose by 25% to 1.75 Bcf/day. These agreements are especially important given the recent collapse of other pipeline projects in the wake of regulatory opposition that in turn resulted in part from a perceived lack of demand.The NEXUS pipeline is important to DTE Energy for two reasons. First, by providing the company's service area with expanded access to natural gas reserves that are capable of being extracted at low cost, it would reduce any price premium paid by the company's electric and natural gas segments. This lack of a premium would be passed to the company's customers via lower rates. Utility customers have historically responded to reduced rates by increasing their energy consumption, however, supporting the utility's rate case arguments to regulators for increased reliability and distribution infrastructure spending. DTE Energy expects to spend between $7 billion and $11 billion over the next decade on capex related to reliability and distribution investments alone. In the shorter-term it expects its FY 2016 capex to increase by 10% YoY to $2.6 billion. While this spending will in turn necessitate higher rates, the presence of lower energy prices would offset the net effect on customer's utility bills, thereby encouraging continued consumption.The second reason that the NEXUS pipeline is important is because DTE Energy is in the process of replacing its aging coal-fired generation units with more modern capacity that utilizes other energy sources, especially natural gas. Last month the company announced that it will retire eight coal-fired units by 2023. This move, which follows an earlier decision to retire three other coal-fired units, means that the company will have retired the majority of its coal-fired units (it has 17 total) within the next seven years. While DTE Energy has publicized its investments in solar PV capacity, the state's suboptimal level of solar insolation makes it very likely that the majority of this retired capacity will be replaced with natural gas-fired units. By providing these new units with access to inexpensive fuel, the pipeline will enable DTE Energy to also maintain the conditions necessary for electricity demand growth in its service area.The company's recent announcement regarding its coal-fired units indicates that DTE Energy's management is moving forward with plans to comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Power Plan (CPP) despite a hold imposed earlier this year on the plan's implementation by the U.S. Supreme Court. This is notable because many utilities in other states have actively resisted the CPP on the grounds that it will impose excessive costs on their customers in the form of higher rates necessary to finance the construction of cleaner capacity. While DTE Energy is no different in this regard and, unlike many of its peers in other parts of the country, has relatively poor access to cost-competitive renewables, its access to inexpensive natural gas enhances its ability to comply with the CPP without risking the demand reductions that could result from imposing higher rates on customers.ValuationThe consensus analyst estimates for DTE Energy's adjusted diluted EPS results in FY 2016 and FY 2017 have remained steady over the last 90 days at $4.95 and $5.26, respectively. This isn't surprising given management's decision to reaffirm its guidance for the current year. The company's share price has appreciated strongly over the same period, however, and, based on a share price at the time of writing of $99.28, the company's shares are now trading at forward valuations of 20.1x and 18.9x, respectively. While its trailing ratio is skewed by the most recent EPS result, which was weak compared to Q1 2015's result, the forward ratios are now slightly above the multi-year highs set in early 2015 (see figure). Investors have responded to recent market turmoil by fleeing to safety in the form of bonds and utilities stocks, and the result of this move is apparent in the current valuation of DTE Energy's shares.DTE PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsConclusionDTE Energy's shares have continued to appreciate in value as FY 2016 has progressed. This movement has occurred against the backdrop of an expectation of a hot summer due to La Nina and continued low energy costs in its service area. The company's earnings are not expected to grow at a faster pace than in recent years, however, suggesting that the recent increase in the value of the company's shares has more to do with global market volatility than it does the company's own outlook. While its long-term outlook continues to improve thanks to management's forward-looking approach to the needs for a cleaner energy mix and increased natural gas accessibility, any investors buying DTE Energy's shares today are giving up the semblance of margin of safety in exchange for a forward yield of under 3%. I continue to like DTE Energy as a potential long investment but must discourage investors from purchasing its shares at their current very high valuations, which are not justified by its current outlook."
4082270,102605,2017-06-19T07:33:24-04:00,DTE Energy is a fundamentally sound company with a steady cash stream from its utility operation.Management has promised to reduce emission by closing coal-fired plants and focusing on renewable energy.Two potential catalysts for the company are its landfill gas plants and the Nexus Pipeline.The main challenge lies in the approval of the Nexus Pipeline proejct.,"DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) is a diversified energy company that engages in both utility and non-utility operations. Its utility operation consists of DTE Electricity and DTE Gas, which provides services to customers throughout Michigan. The non-utility operation consists of three segments: Gas Storage and Pipelines, Power and Industrial Projects, and Energy Trading. Lately, DTE Energy has been transitioning into cleaner energy by expanding its renewable natural gas business and proposing a plan to retire all of its coal-fired plants by 2040. Considering that DTE Energy is somewhat of a mature utility company, I believe that this transition can be a key source of growth. The utility business, which accounts for 75% of business, provides a steady stream of cash and makes DTE Energy a low-risk investment. At the same time, the company's venture into renewable energy provides significant upside potential.Source: DTE EnergyFundamental ReviewFundamentally, DTE looks like a solid company. It has a P/E ratio of 19.12 and a P/S ratio of 1.76, which are comparatively lower than the ratios of its major competitors. Although its PEG ratio currently sits at 4.17, it's still lower than the S&P 500 utilities sector ratio. When thinking about the nature of the utility business, it's not surprising to see a relatively low growth rate for the overall sector. For utility companies, unless they are able to break into existing markets through extremely competitive prices, growth is hard to come by. The main source of net income is through cost cutting measures. This brings me to the recent effort of DTE to expand its renewable energy business.Source: StockChartsTwo Potential CatalystsTwo things about DTE stand out to me: 1) its recent acquisition of two landfill gas plants and 2) the company's stake in the Nexus Pipeline project. Landfill gas can be used to generate electric power and allows DTE to reduce the amount of natural gas it must buy from suppliers. It can also be refined into renewable natural gas, which is chemically identical to pipeline quality natural gas and uses the same infrastructure as fossil natural gas.Another key factor is the potential income from the RIN system. Under the Renewal Fuel Standard, US refiners and blenders of fossil fuels are required to add biofuel to their mix in order to reduce greenhouse gas emission. As explained by Richard Evans in his article:Since 2007, the EPA has continued to increase the total amount of biofuel that's required to be added. As a result, RIN prices have been increasing. Just this month, ethanol RIN prices reached $0.80; a 167% increase since February. For refiners and blenders, this has continued to have a negative impact on the company's net income (for those of you who want to learn more about the effects of RIN on oil companies, please check out Richard Evans' article, as well as Carl Icahn's letter to regulators about the negative impact of RIN). However, for renewable natural gas facilities, like the ones acquired by DTE, an increase in RIN prices can contribute to their top line net income growth.Currently, the biggest potential for DTE Energy is its joint venture with Spectra Energy (now a part of Enbridge (NYSE:ENB)) on the Nexus Pipeline project. DTE Energy has a 50% stake in the project and when completed, the Nexus Pipeline will deliver up to 1.5 billion cf/d from eastern Ohio to existing pipeline system interconnects in southeastern Michigan. Nexus currently has long term commitments of about 806 million cf/d from 7 shippers for a 15-year contract, with DTE Energy taking 150 million cf/d.Source: Nexus Gas TransmissionThe Nexus EffectThe Gas Storage and Pipeline segment of the non-utility operation has increased consistently in the past 3 years and accounted for 13.71% of DTE Energy's overall net income in 2016. I expect a significant increase in revenue from long-term contracts with shippers once the Nexus Pipeline starts operating. I also expect a decrease in cost for the utility operation, including both the gas and electric segments.Hurdle for Nexus PipelineBefore the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had a chance to vote on the approval of the Nexus Pipeline project, Commissioner Norman Bay stepped down from his position, leading to the total number of members falling below the minimum requirement to vote on such matters. As a result, the Nexus Pipeline project hasn't been able to proceed since February. There is a small risk of the project falling through, but management reiterated that it still expects the project to be completed by this year. A bright spot on the issue is that several other pipelines were approved (representing over 5 billion cf/d of capacity in total) before the committee was left without a quorum. This leads me to conclude that it was simply an issue with time constraint for the FERC and nothing specific about the project itself.Closing ThoughtsDTE Energy is a solid company with several projects that have the potential to contribute significantly to both top and bottom line growth. Although the Nexus Pipeline hasn't been approved yet, considering that other pipeline projects were approved before the FERC lost quorum, it seems unlikely that the project will run into any trouble. As I was writing this article, the stock came close to reaching its all-time high price of $111.24. If management does a good job of managing the extra capacity from the Nexus Pipeline and continues its successful transition to renewable energy, I expect the stock price to continue climbing."
4029435,97936,2016-12-09T09:40:49-05:00,"DTE Energy Co. has a new baby.The new baby bond has better yield metrics than DTQ.A pair trade cannot be currently executed, but circumstances could change.","DTE Energy Co. (NYSE: DTE) has given birth to a new child. Those of you who read my articles regularly would probably get the reference. For those who don't, I will clarify. I usually refer to instruments issued by the same company as children or siblings. As for the issuing entity I usually call it a mother or a parent. Now that you are familiar with the lingo, I want to share something I have noticed about DTE's newborn and its relationship with one of its siblings.The new issue is a Series F baby bond with a nominal yield of 6.00% due in 2076 and will be trading on the NYSE under the ticker DTY. In this article, I want to tell you more about the DTY and compare and contrast it to another baby bond issued by DTE, namely the 5.25% Series C subordinate debentures due in 2062 (NYSE: DTQ).In the table below you can find more information about the two securities.Source: Author's spreadsheetAs you can see both issues have an investment grade rating of BBB- and rank pari passu in DTE's capital structure. So we can safely assume that both DTQ and DTY bear the same credit risk. Also, both baby bonds have an embedded call option, but since neither of the instruments is trading above par, I see the likelihood of the call options being exercised as low at this moment in time. That is particularly true for DTQ as the issue carries a nominal yield of 5.25%, while the fresh new financing for DTE came at a cost of debt of 6.00%. Why would DTE then call DTQ when it can't refinance it at a lower rate? That wouldn't make economic sense.So, if the call options are less likely to be exercised, then the yield to call is definitely not the right metric to focus on when one wants to compare the two securities. What about YTM? Well, if you just want to compare DTQ and DTY's YTMs in absolute terms, then DTY is certainly the better security. But you should avoid doing such a direct comparison of YTMs when the instruments that you are analyzing have differing maturities. In such cases I prefer to use the z-spread as an improvement over the YTM measure, because the former takes the yield curve into consideration and thus puts both securities on an equal footing. So, what is the z-spread for each of the baby bonds? For DTY it is 2.76% and for DTQ it is 1.93%. Again, it seems that DTY compensates you better than its sibling.If you are not planning to hold to maturity, however, all this information probably barely concerns you. You are probably much more interested in the current yield of both securities. Again, a quick comparison between DTY and DTQ on current yield basis, reveals that DTY is still the better of the two securities with a current yield of 6.09% against DTQ's 5.44%.How to trade itWell, there are several ways you can act on the relative mispricing. First, if you have DTQ, consider switching to DTY because the latter just seems to be the better security at these price levels. Second, if you are a long-only investor and you are trying to find investment grade securities with a decent yield, then steer away from DTQ and think about DTY. A yield north of 6% is not bad for a BBB- rated security. And finally, if you are a trader, such as myself, you can engage in a pair trade whereby shorting DTQ and buying DTY. Theoretically it sounds great, but unfortunately, DTQ cannot be borrowed for selling purposes at the moment. Hopefully, this will change soon as I am also looking for a way to take advantage of the current opportunity. In absolute terms, the potential of the trade is quite significant, so I am constantly monitoring the situation here.ConclusionOn occasion, when new issues come into play short-term relative mispricings could occur. In this article, I brought to your attention one such mispricing in the baby bonds of DTE Energy Co. All yield metrics seem to indicate that buying the new issue DTY is a better decision than buying its brother DTQ. So far it is not possible to have a proper pair trade between the two due to the unborrowable 5.25% debentures. But if I were you, I would put both baby bonds at the top of my monitoring list in case the circumstances change."

        The company has a $20 billion capital projects in the next five years to grow its business in Michigan.
        DTE Energy has an investment grade balance sheet that should help support its growth projects.
        The company pays a growing 2.9%-yielding dividend, but its shares are fairly valued.","DTE Energy (DTE) delivered an unimpressive quarter with significant decline in its operating earnings from a year ago. Looking forward, the company should be able to continue to grow its revenue thanks to its $20 billion capital projects in Michigan. The company has a solid balance sheet to support this growth. However, its largest market Michigan’s population growth rate may continue to lag the national average. This means growth will likely be modest in Michigan. The company pays a growing 2.9%-yielding dividend. However, its shares are fairly valued. We think investors may want to wait for a pullback before initiating a position.Data by YChartsDTE Energy reported unimpressive Q2 2019 earnings with declining operating earnings of 26%. Its operating earnings of $183 million was $64 millions lower than last year’s $247 million. Fortunately, the decline was mostly due to unfavorable weather conditions, which are not likely to repeat every quarter.Source: Q2 2019 PresentationSignificant infrastructure opportunities in MichiganDTE Energy will have significant growth opportunities in Michigan as the company expects to increase its capital spending to $20 billion in the next 5 years (2019 ~ 2023). This would be 43% higher than the investment of $14 billion between 2014 and 2018. These projects include investments in its distribution infrastructure, maintenance in its aging infrastructure and expansion of its gas pipelines. These projects should help drive its revenue and earnings and support its dividend growth in the next five years.Source: June 2019 Investor PresentationConstruction and acquisition of infrastructure in Gas, Storage, and Pipeline segment should continue to fuel growthIn the past quarter, DTE Energy acquired an additional 30% interest in the Link-SGG pipeline (see map below: Link Lateral & Gathering). As a result, the company increased its ownership from 55% to 85%. In addition, the company is also acquiring Generation Pipeline. This pipeline will provide natural gas supply to industrial customers in Ohio. The deal is expected to close in H2 2019. The company also completed it Millennium Pipeline expansion. This expansion should significantly expand its transport capacity. We like the location of DTE Energy's infrastructure assets as the company’s network of pipelines that is near the Marcellus and Utica regions will allow it to pursue incremental projects and grow its pipeline business in the next few years.Source: June 2019 Investor PresentationAn investment grade balance sheetDTE Energy has an investment grade balance sheet with credit ratings of BBB (S&P), Baa1 (Moody’s), and BBB+ (Fitch). The company has a healthy interest coverage ratio of 4.99x (based on trailing 12-month EBITDA to interest expense ratio). Its long-term debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.08x is also healthy. DTE Energy’s strong balance sheet should help support its capital projects in the next few years.Source: June 2019 Investor PresentationMichigan’s population growth rate significantly lag the national averageOne concern we have about DTE Energy is the demographic trend. In Michigan, DTE Energy’s major market, population growth rate has been quite low in the past decade. The state’s 0.2% population growth rate in 2018 significantly lagged the national average of 0.6%. Michigan has been through periods of population decline from 2004 to 2011 and its population has not yet recovered from the peak of 10.1 million in 2004. It is likely that the low population growth rate will continue. This is not a good news for DTE Energy’s utilities sector as a low population growth rate also means lower electricity and natural gas consumption. If the population declines, its revenue might even decline as well.Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Detroit Free PressDTE Energy is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 20.35x. This is about 1 multiple higher than the 19.43x average of its peers. DTE Energy’s P/E ratio of 20.35x is about 2 multiples higher than its 5-year average of 18.22x. Given its slightly higher valuation to its peers and to its historical average, we think its shares are fairly valued.Data by YChartsA growing 2.9%-yielding dividendDTE Energy currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.945 per share. This is equivalent to a dividend yield of about 2.9%. The company has consistently raised its dividend every year in the past 10 years. As can be seen from the chart below, its dividend yield of 2.9% is towards the low end of its 10-year yield range.Data by YChartsDTE Energy faces several risks:(1) DTE Energy faces regulatory risk as about 70% of its revenue comes from regulated utilities in Michigan. Unfavorable regulatory environment could result in lower allowed return on equity.(2) Since coal and natural gas power plants represent 73% of DTE Energy’s total power capacity (coal: 66%, natural gas: 7%), the price of coal and natural gas will impact its expenses. A significant increase in these two commodities (especially coal) will result in much lower EBITDA.(3) Weather will impact the demand of natural gas and electricity.(4) Rising construction costs may result in higher costs for its pipeline projects.We think DTE Energy can continue to grow its business with its capital investments in Michigan. Although the company should continue to grow its dividend in the next few years, its shares are fairly valued. We think a higher margin of safety is desired. Therefore, it makes sense to wait for a pullback."
4035707,102327,2017-01-10T14:39:28-05:00,"Michigan is actually a economically growing area, and DTE is positioned to benefit.DTE is growing its earnings and dividends as a good dividend growth investor partner should.DTE is more than 5% below the PV of a conservative estimate of its future dividends.","DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) is a company that engages in utility operations with segments that include electric, gas, and non-utility operations. With a record of growing earnings and dividends and projections to grow both into the future the current market price of around $98 is sufficiently below my estimate of its value to represent a good opportunity.Is DTE a good investment partner?When I first started looking at DTE, it raised some concerns that its operations were centered in Michigan. I don't know about anyone else, but when I think of a vibrant growing economy, Michigan isn't a state that comes to mind. So when I went to its website to find out information about DTE, the first thing I looked for in this presentation was information about its market. Below I have included the slides that address the issues of my checklist, but before investing I recommend reading the whole presentation.This first slide helps dispel my incorrect perception that Michigan isn't a growing economy. From the data shown here, it clearly is growing and doing quite well. Adding new jobs, particularly new manufacturing jobs is also very helpful in growing DTE's customer base.This second slide shows that DTE's market is more than just Michigan. It includes complimentary businesses generating mostly regulated revenues. This helps ensure that DTE isn't entirely dependent on how Michigan is doing yet also ensures that it has revenues that are profitable as well.Between these two slides, I am convinced that DTE has a growing market in which to operate. As such, it passes the first item on my checklist.This next slide addresses my checklist item about growing profits. It shows growth since 2011 and includes projections for the future. As an added plus, it shows that the company revised its original projection upwards for this year. Because earnings growth is needed to support the dividend growth I am looking for, it's also nice that this slide includes information on dividends as well. I like that DTE grows its dividends just a little slower than it grows earnings as this gives them the ability to continue to grow the dividend even if the economy weakens and earnings growth slows.This slide presents portions of DTE's growth plan. I like the acknowledgement that growing the company provides value for investors, that the dividend is a part of that value, and that they spend their money where they think the best growth options are located. Continuing their pattern of ignoring my checklist when making slides for their presentations, this slide also nicely includes the credit rating for DTE.The slide above comes from this presentation. It shows that management has targets for debt that measure DTE's ability to support its debt and that it is currently meeting those targets. Coupled with the slide that shows DTE having an investment grade credit rating, and with this link that shows the baby bonds and preferred share issues that DTE has active (all of which are rated investment grade), it looks to me like DTE is managing its debt in a responsible and sustainable way.Looking at the CCC List, I can see that DTE has increased its dividend for the last 8 years. While I'd like a longer streak Michigan, particularly the auto industry, was hard hit during the Great Recession and DTE didn't cut its dividend during that time. Coupled with the solid earnings growth in both the past and projected for the future I see DTE as well positioned to grow the dividend into the future.DTE passed each of the items on my checklist: growing market, growing earnings, good credit and growing dividends. Based on that, I see it as a good investment partner. Now all that is needed to buy it is that it be selling at a good price.What's a good price?To figure out a good price (a price that is a good value, I am not making a prediction of where the price will go), I do a DDM calculation using my Excel® based DDM calculator (pictured above, you can see the web-based calculator I based it on here and read a discussion on how the formulas were developed here). For DTE I plugged in the current dividend of $3.30. For the Dividend Growth Rate, based on management predicting an EPS growth rate of 5%-6% and DTE's past history of raising the dividend at a rate 1% lower than EPS, I use 4.5%. With the current market price of DTE being just below $98, that value makes DTE a buy.Can options help?The options available for the February expiration date seem lightly traded at this point but several do look attractive. With such slow trading volume only use limit orders.Since my target price is about $107, I don't want to sell below that price, so only the $110 strike looks attractive at this time. I think writing a call with a bid of $0.80 would be a reasonable way to play this.On the put side, the $95 put looks pretty good. With a limit order you should be able to get close to $1.50 of premium (before commissions). Even if you don't get the stock, that's a reasonable yield for just over a month. You could also write a $100 strike put trading a greater likelihood of getting the shares for a lower discount.ConclusionDTE is a good solid company; despite being in what I originally thought would be a poor market. That initial impression just shows how important it is to look at actual data rather than just guessing. At the current market price it is a good value, even if it's not quite as good a value as I thought in this article. I was pretty conservative in determining what the next 5 years would bring in dividend increases, but if the more aggressive predictions come to pass, then DTE is just that much better a buy.Note: I hope you all got something out of this article.

According to my M.A.D. assessment for DTE, the stock has a Dividend Strength Score of 95 and a Stock Strength score of 59.This article will present and discuss the factors which show why I believe that dividend investors should invest in DTE Energy.Source: mad-dividends.comDTE Energy Co. operates in the utilities sector. The company mainly involves in the business of power generation. It also provides natural gas distribution services.This article will be divided into two parts: dividend strength and stock strength.You might ask what the difference is between dividend strength and stock strength. A high dividend strength score indicates that the company has a good combination of dividend safety, dividend yield and dividend growth potential. Stocks which rank high in stock strength are likely to produce good returns for capital gain investors. Dividend investors can achieve the best results by picking stocks with a good combination of dividend strength and stock strength.For a stock's dividend to be qualified as strong it needs to a) be safe and very likely to be maintained and b) have the potential to grow many times in upcoming years.Both are equally important, and both will be analyzed within this article.To evaluate the dividend safety I will look at payout and coverage ratios. The company's dividend potential is measured by looking at the current dividend yield, the dividend's historical growth as well as the changes in the revenues and net income over the recent years.58% of DTE Energy's earnings are paid out as dividends. This is a more attractive payout ratio than 32% of dividend stocks.Operating cashflow payout also gives a good idea of a company's ability to pay its dividend, and gives a more complete picture than simply looking at the earnings payout. DTE pays 26% of its operating cashflow as a dividend, putting it ahead of 48% of dividend stocks.DTE Energy has negative free cashflow. Like most utilities the business requires lots of capital expenditure, which pushes the company to increase leverage.DTE Energy's payout ratio is satisfying according to these 3 metrics.Operating cashflow can cover the dividend 4x, making any variations in cash unlikely to impact the dividend.Source: mad-dividends.comAnalyzing interest and debt coverage ratios along payout ratios gives us an idea of the payout ratio's stability. If a lot of the company's earnings go towards paying interest, the financial leverage makes the company's bottom line more affected by variations in revenue.DTE can pay its interest 16 times, which is better than 86% of stocks. This level of coverage can be considered satisfying. This level of coverage is extremely encouraging for a utility stock.The company can cover all of its current debt once. DTE Energy has a better debt service coverage ratio than 23% of stocks.Looking at payout and coverage ratios together would suggest that DTE's dividend is safe. The company can make its interest payments with ease, and while earnings can only cover the total current debt once, operating cashflow can cover it twice. The payout ratios are low enough that the dividend isn't threatened.I then move on to analyzing the company's dividend potential (i.e. its ability to pay us a good dividend which grows at a satisfying rate).Source: mad-dividends.comDTE Energy's dividend yield of 3.02% is better than 66% of dividend stocks. This last year, the dividend grew 8% which is slightly higher than their 5 year CAGR of 7%.Source: mad-dividends.comOver the previous 3 years DTE Energy has seen its revenues grow at an 11% CAGR and net income by a 17% CAGR. It is important for a company to continue growing revenues and net income in order to continue paying and importantly for a dividend investor growing its dividends.Source: mad-dividends.comIf the company can continue to grow its revenue and net income at the current rate, DTE's dividend has great potential for growth. 7% growth and 3% yield is usually a good balance. While we'd expect more growth from a stock yielding less than 3% and would get really excited if the stock yielded more than 4%, the combination of both is still very good.The data presented above gives DTE a dividend strength score of 95/100.Revenues and net income have been growing at a very satisfying rate, outpacing growth in the dividend, ensuring it is sheltered for the foreseeable future. As far as the dividend is concerned, DTE is a super high quality stock.When picking on dividend stocks, investors must focus on more factors than dividends alone. To pick the most attractive dividend investments at any given point in time, we must also focus on other factors.These fundamentals are what determine a company's stock strength score: value, momentum, financial strength and earnings quality.To assess a company's stock strength score I look into the fundamentals underlying these factors separately.It has been proven time and time again, that undervalued stocks outperform overvalued stocks. To assess value, I look at a company's P/E, P/S, P/CFO and Shareholder Yield. The combination of these ratios give a stock a value score out of 100.Here are DTE's value ratios.These values would suggest that DTE is more undervalued than 79% of stocks, which is satisfying. The top 25% of most undervalued stocks tend to outperform the rest.Value Score: 79/100I also draw PE lines over a stock chart, very much like Peter Lynch would do while running the Magellan fund. By doing so, investors get an idea of the company's PE range, and therefore serves as an indicator of potential downside and upside.Source: mad-dividends.comThe chart above suggests that DTE is trading below its 5 year average PE. However, for the better part of the past 5 years, DTE has traded around 18-22x earnings. This indicates that DTE is trading at a reasonable price on top of being undervalued in comparison with the total market.Most dividend investors disregard momentum and are happy buying on the way down.I believe this to be an investing mistake which can have dire consequences. Buying losing stocks is never a good idea, even if your main motivation is to receive a dividend.DTE Energy's price has increased 6.76% these last 3 months, 11.84% these last 6 months and 19.27% these last 12 months and now currently sits at $125.71.Source: mad-dividends.comDTE has better momentum than 72% of stocks, which I find to be satisfying. The better the momentum, the more likely a stock is of continuing to outperform. DTE has beaten the SandP 500 over the past 12 months - as have many utilities - and I expect the sector to give good returns in upcoming quarters. As such DTE's chances of price appreciation remain skewed in the stock's favor.Momentum score: 72/100Stocks with good financial strength will have reasonable levels of debt, low liability growth - or even decreasing liabilities - and will produce high levels of cashflows in relation to their liabilities.Financially strong stocks have historically performed a lot better than companies with weak financials. It goes without saying that investors should be extra careful with stocks who dramatically increase their financial leverage.DTE's Debt/Equity ratio of 2.5 is better than 32% of stocks. DTE's liabilities have increased by 8% this last year. Operating cashflow can cover 10.0% of DTE's liabilities.These ratios would suggest that DTE Energy has better financial strength than 37% of stocks.Utility stocks always have lower financial strength than the median stock in the market because of the businesses inherent weaknesses: very capital intensive, need for leverage and tendency to contract more debt.However, for a utility, DTE's debt load is reasonable, and liability growth is maintained below revenue growth.Financial Strength Score: 37/100Earnings manipulation has fooled many investors in the past. It is so easy to legally manipulate earnings to make them look better, that shady executives are often tempted to do so.This can be picked up quite easily however. Stocks with high earnings quality will have low levels of accruals and will depreciate their capital expenses quickly. Their assets will also generate large amounts of revenue.DTE Energy's Total Accruals to Assets ratio of -13.6% puts it ahead of 65% of stocks.43.6% of DTE's capital expenditure is depreciated each year, which is better than 13% of stocks.Each dollar of DTE's assets generates $0.4 of revenue, putting it ahead of 37% of stocks.Based on these findings, DTE has higher earnings quality than 32% of stocks.DTE's negative accruals are appreciated. The company's assets generate twice as much revenue as other well-known utilities [like Dominon (D), Southern Company (SO), Duke (DUK)], which is fantastic for a utility, despite being below the market median.Like most utilities however, depreciation is low when compared to capital expenditure.This makes earnings quality decent in comparison with other utilities, but still low in comparison with the total market.Earnings Quality Score: 32/100When combining the different factors of the stocks profile, we get a stock strength score of 59/100 which is satisfying for a utility stock. The good value and momentum make up for the company's weaker financial strength and earnings quality.With a dividend strength score of 95 and a stock strength of 59, DTE Energy is a great choice for dividend investors.Investors should remember that companies with lower financial strength and earnings quality need to be fantastic in the other areas. This is the case with DTE, which presents a decent combination of dividend yield and growth, great dividend coverage, is undervalued in comparison to the market and will likely continue to appreciate in upcoming quarters.Enjoyed this article?Make sure you hit the follow button and tick ""get email notifications"" to be alerted when we publish a new article.Drop a comment if you want to start a discussion about DTE.Note: My father Robert and I publish analysis of dividend stocks through this joint account.

3630966,24961,2015-11-03T07:15:00-05:00,"Michigan electric and natural gas utility DTE Energy reported Q3 earnings that beat on EPS despite missing on revenue due to hot temperatures and low fuel prices.The company's long-term outlook, which was already strong, continued to improve as national policy and low natural gas prices increased the value of its NEXUS pipeline project.Its short-term outlook has diminished, however, as the presence of a strong El Nino will likely result in a warm winter and a cool, early summer in its service area.The company's shares are no longer so undervalued as to merit investment given this short-term outlook, although investors should consider selling near-the-money calls due to its weak short-term outlook.","Michigan electric and natural gas utility DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) reported Q3 earnings last week that beat solidly on EPS despite missing on revenue. In a bullish article on the company written back in June, I noted that its operating outlook was not nearly as negative as investor sentiment was at the time, concluding that:In the subsequent four months, the share price increased by 12%, although it has settled a bit over the last two trading days. While I continue to like the company's long-term operating environment, the development of a strong El Nino that is now expected to last well into Q2 2016 can be expected to impact its short-term earnings. This article re-evaluates DTE Energy as a potential long investment in light of these changing conditions.Q3 Earnings ReportDTE Energy reported Q3 revenue of $2.6 billion (see table), virtually unchanged from the previous year, and missing the consensus analyst estimate by $80 million. The miss came despite the presence of a hot quarter in the company's service area, with 48% more cooling degree days occurring compared to the previous year, albeit only 4% more than the long-term average. This gain was partially offset by the presence of self-imposed reduced rates resulting from the lower energy prices during the quarter on a YoY basis. Its electric sales volume to industrial customers also declined by 2% YoY, resulting in a total volume reduction of 1% over the same period. The service area's warm weather persisted into the end of the quarter as well, resulting in a 53% YoY reduction to heating degree days, albeit from a much smaller base compared to cooling degree days.DTE Energy Financials (non-adjusted)Source: Morningstar (2015)The aforementioned presence of much lower energy prices during the quarter was reflected in reduced operating expense, which declined by 1% YoY. Operating income came in at $440 million, or an increase of 84% compared to the previous year, due to the presence of flat revenues and lower costs. Net income came in at $264 million, up 70% compared to the previous year, resulting in a diluted EPS result of $1.47 compared to $0.88 YoY. The EPS result included a beneficial $0.07 mark-to-market impact that, if ignored, resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS result of $1.40 that beat the analyst consensus by $0.15. EBITDA came in at $678 million, up from $578 million in the previous year. The company's quarterly dividend was 6% higher YoY, reflecting its strong performance over the TTM period.DTE Energy's Q3 earnings strength was reflected across almost all of its segments. DTE Electric reported a diluted EPS of $1.19, up from $0.76 YoY. The Gas Storage and Pipelines segment came in second at $0.15, up from $0.11 YoY, on strong demand for its pipeline and gathering services resulting from the presence of very low natural gas prices compared to the previous year. DTE Gas reported an EPS of -$0.06 that represented a gain over the previous year of $0.03 despite the presence of fewer heating degree days in the most recent quarter. Only the Power and Industrial Projects segment reported lower earnings, which declined from $0.21 to $0.17 YoY - a move that the company attributed to lower steel earnings.Finally, DTE Energy announced that it had increased its 33% stake in its NEXUS natural gas pipeline joint venture with Spectra Energy (NYSE:SE) to 50%. Progress on the pipeline has continued over the last four months, and while the company's increased stake caused its expected cost contribution to rise to $1 billion, the pipeline is expected to be in service by Q4 2017. Contracting was recently completed for the pipe itself, and the FERC filing is expected to be done in the current quarter.OutlookDTE Energy's management felt confident after the Q3 earnings release to reaffirm its FY 2015 guidance range of $4.65-4.91 and increase the midpoint of the guidance to $4.78. While this result would represent a sequential decline from the company's bumper FY 2014 earnings, it would still be one of its strongest on record. Furthermore, the company also released its first FY 2016 guidance with an EPS range of $4.80-5.05 - a move that it based on continued economic growth and falling unemployment in its service area. Existing investors will be pleased to know that management is also targeting dividend growth equal to EPS growth, suggesting a 3% increase in FY 2016 based on the midpoint of the guidance.While DTE Energy's long-term outlook is very optimistic, I believe the company will struggle to achieve the midpoint of its FY 2016 EPS range. The reason for this is the development of one of the strongest El Ninos in the last half of a century over the last several months. These weather events are commonly associated with warmer-than-normal winter weather in the northern half of the U.S., including Michigan, and cooler-than-normal weather in the southern half. Historical records show that El Nino events are associated with substantially above-average temperatures in Michigan between October and May, in which case DTE Energy's service area can expect to experience fewer heating degree days than normal in Q4 2015 and Q1 and Q2 2016. Furthermore, late Q2 will probably be both colder and wetter than normal, raising the prospects of a reduced number of cooling degree days during early summer. DTE Energy's guidance already assumes that Q4 2015's earnings will be lower on a YoY basis just due to the presence of abnormally cold weather in Q4 2014. That said, El Nino threatens to derail the company's FY 2016 guidance by causing its H1 2016 earnings to come in below expectations.DTE Energy's operating outlook improves after FY 2016, however, due to a combination of recent regulatory and market developments. Its Gas Storage and Pipelines segment is becoming an important contributor to earnings, and this is likely to continue so long as natural gas prices remain low relative to historical prices. The company's JV NEXUS pipeline was already expected to provide a large boost to the segment's contribution. Low natural gas prices will increase its expectations, however, by driving demand for natural gas as power plant fuel at the expense of coal. The recently announced acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas (NYSE:PNY) by Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) exemplified the larger trend by U.S. utilities to convert coal-fired plants to cheaper natural gas.Looking beyond just the current natural gas pricing environment, however, NEXUS is poised to benefit from two recent developments. The first is continued economic growth in Michigan, including Detroit. While the state and the city both suffered mightily in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, with the latter being hit especially hard by the abandonment of high-margin SUVs and other fuel-inefficient vehicles by cost-conscious drivers, the persistent presence of low petroleum prices over the last three quarters has caused the U.S. automobile industry to stage a strong comeback. Michigan's economy has rebounded as well, with the Chicago Fed recently proclaiming it the fastest-growing economy in the Midwest. Falling unemployment and continued economic growth will cause natural gas demand in DTE Energy's service area to also increase, with NEXUS ultimately making further such increases possible.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's recently released Clean Power Plan will increase demand for natural gas pipelines in Michigan and the upper Midwest. The Clean Power Plan requires each state to reduce its carbon intensity (units of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity generated) over the next decade. Michigan must achieve a 24% reduction to its carbon intensity by 2024 and a 39% reduction by 2030. Importantly, its final carbon intensity target is very close to the carbon intensity of a gas-fired power plant, meaning that the state's utilities can contribute by switching from coal to natural gas. This is already being done across the U.S. due to return of cheap natural gas, and the Clean Power Plan is expected to simply deliver a legal impetus to a market trend that already exists. This will serve to further increase demand for the type of service that the NEXUS pipeline will provide upon its completion.ValuationThe consensus analyst estimates for DTE Energy's diluted EPS results in FY 2015 have risen slightly over the last 90 days, while those for FY 2016 have remained stable. The FY 2015 consensus estimate has increased from $4.74 to $4.79, in line with management's midpoint guidance, while the FY 2016 estimate has stayed flat at $4.96, slightly above the midpoint guidance. Based on a price of $82 at the time of writing, the shares are trading at a trailing P/E ratio of 16.1x on a non-adjusted basis and forward P/E ratios of 17.1x and 16.5x, respectively. All three of these ratios are higher than in June, but still low relative to their respective 3-year ranges. That said, I do expect that the company will struggle to achieve the FY 2016 consensus estimate if El Nino has a similar impact on Michigan's winter temperatures to those that it has had in the past, in which case the shares are not clearly undervalued at this time.ConclusionDTE Energy reported solid Q3 earnings earlier this week as hot temperatures in the second half of the summer and low energy prices contributed to a large YoY earnings gain. Management was upbeat in the company's Q3 earnings report and subsequent earnings call, outlining the rebounding nature of its service area's economy, continued opportunities for additional future capex, and progress on its NEXUS pipeline JV. I further believe that the persistence of low energy prices and low natural gas prices in particular as well as the release of the Clean Power Plan will provide additional support for the new pipeline when it comes on-line.That is still two years away, however, and DTE Energy must first face the prospect of two consecutive warmer-than-normal winter quarters followed by a cooler-than-normal summer quarter as a strong El Nino makes its presence felt. Given the increase to the company's share price that has occurred over the last four months and the prospect of multiple bearish quarters, I do not recommend buying DTE shares at this time. Existing shareholders who bought back in June and don't want to incur the tax implications of a short-term sale, however, should consider selling near-the-money call options at this point to take advantage of the fact that the company's near-term outlook is not as positive as its longer-term outlook. DTE Energy remains an attractive investment opportunity due to economic recovery in its service and its own strategic moves to benefit from rising natural gas demand, but it is not one that provides a sufficient margin of safety for me to recommend it as a ""buy"" at this time."
3940416,24961,2016-03-01T12:23:11-05:00,"Michigan electric and natural gas utility DTE Energy reported Q4 earnings that were hurt by warm weather and weakening industrial demand, although the EPS result slightly beat the consensus estimate.The company is continuing to position itself to profit from low natural gas prices by increasing its exposure to cheap shale gas fields via new and expanded pipelines.Its short-term outlook continues to be limited by warm weather in Q1 to date, while its biggest projects aren't expected to come online until 2017 and 2018.While the company remains an attractive investment, potential investors are encouraged to wait until its shares offer a margin of safety given a lack of upside catalyst in 2016.","Michigan electric and natural gas utility DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) reported Q4 earnings a few weeks ago that beat slightly on EPS despite missing on revenue by a sizeable amount. The report was released amid substantial volatility in the company's shares, the price of which recently approached a decade high before giving up some of the gains in the aftermath of the earnings release (see figure). In an early November article, I discussed the exposure of the company's operations to rebounding economic activity in its service area, increased natural gas consumption, and expected weak short-term demand, concluding that:While the company's share price is only 2.8% higher than it was at the time of that article's publication, its operating environment has shifted over the subsequent four months as energy prices have continued to fall, federal regulation has been called into question, and weakness among steelmakers has negatively impacted its earnings. This article re-evaluates DTE Energy as a potential long investment opportunity in light of these changing circumstances.DTE data by YChartsQ4 earnings reportDTE Energy reported Q4 revenue of $2.5 billion, down by 19.2% from the same quarter of the previous year and missing the consensus estimate by $680 million. The revenue decline was attributable to a combination of warm temperatures during the quarter, as last year's large El Nino event made its presence felt, and the continued decline of energy prices across the U.S. The company's utility segment generated revenue of $1.5 billion, down from $1.7 billion YoY, as warm weather caused it to report 26% fewer heating degree days on a YoY basis and 23% fewer than the long-term average. Natural gas prices also fell during the quarter (see figure), negatively impacting revenues from the company's natural gas utility operations.DTE Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsLower natural gas and coal prices also caused DTE Energy's fuel costs to decline during the quarter, from $1.6 billion in the same quarter of 2014 to $1.3 billion in the most recent quarter. The company's O&M costs increased by 14% over the same period. While management didn't state the reason for this increase in the Q4 earnings call, utilities often report similar increases during periods of unusually warm autumn and winter weather as work crews conduct maintenance that would normally wait until the spring thaw. Operating income fell sharply from $542 million YoY to $134 million despite the lower revenue cost, however, due to the higher O&M expense and a $97 million asset loss compared to a $2 million asset gain in the same quarter of 2014. The asset loss was due to one of the company's coke plants being shut down after it lost all of its steelmaker customers, a reflection of the challenging environment facing the region's heavy industry.DTE Energy reported Q4 net income of $80 million, down from $299 million YoY, resulting in diluted EPS of $0.45 versus $1.68 over the same period. The poor result was primarily attributable to the aforementioned coke plant closure, however. The company reported adjusted diluted EPS of $1.01 for the most recent quarter compared to $1.17 YoY, beating the analyst consensus estimate by $0.02. DTE Electric reported an adjusted EPS of $0.56 versus $0.72 YoY, with the decline being due to decreased demand from consumers in part because of the warm weather and in part because of slowing industrial activity in the company's service area. DTE Gas reported an increase from $0.17 to $0.22 over the same period, however, with customer growth offsetting temperature-induced demand weakness. Likewise, the Gas Storage & Pipelines segment reported an increase from $0.13 to $0.16 YoY. Finally, the Power Projects and Energy Trading segments both reported declines, although they came in positive on an adjusted basis (the coke plant was reported within the Power Projects segment).The company's FY 2015 adjusted EPS came in 4.8% higher than the previous year's, rising to $4.82. This result was notably higher than the analyst consensus estimate for the year of $4.74 that had been made the previous August. DTE Energy's management has a history of issuing low guidance numbers that, when adopted by analysts, often result in better-than-expected full-year results, and 2015 was no exception. The company raised its quarterly dividend during the year by a further 5.8% to $0.73/share, resulting in a forward yield of 3.4% at the time of the increase. Finally, DTE Energy also recorded an important milestone at the end of the year when it brought its renewables mix above the 10% of total capacity threshold, a requirement for the year under Michigan's renewable portfolio standard. Management stated during the Q4 earnings call that it anticipates being able to exceed its future required thresholds through the end of 2029.OutlookDTE Energy's management reaffirmed its previous diluted EPS guidance range for FY 2016 of $4.80 to $5.05. The midpoint of $4.93 would represent annual earnings growth of only 2.3%, well below management's target of 4-6%. Here it should be noted that the company's management has a lengthy history of releasing conservative guidance numbers: by management's own admission, the company's end year results have been at or above the top of the guidance range for the last eight consecutive years. The FY 2016 guidance midpoint is fully 7.2% higher than the company's FY 2015 guidance midpoint of $4.60, for example. While the FY 2016 guidance estimate appears at first glance to signify slowing growth, the reality is that it is actually intentionally pessimistic.The company's decision to invest heavily in pipeline infrastructure connecting Ohio and Pennsylvania's gas plays to its own transmission system continues to look attractive. Natural gas prices have admittedly fallen to the point at which E&P volatility could begin to threaten the volume of natural gas necessary for the pipelines to recognize their full earnings potential. Low natural gas prices have also spurred widespread shifts in consumption trends, however, the biggest of which has been the abandonment of coal-fired electric capacity in favor of natural gas-fired capacity. Natural gas replaced coal as the country's primary electricity feedstock in 2012 as fracking caused the former's price to plummet. Coal resumed its reign until 2014 as natural gas prices began to rebound, however (see figure).US Electricity Net Generation From Natural Gas in the Electric Power Sector data by YChartsThe situation has changed drastically since then, however, with the U.S. electric power sector generating more electricity from coal than natural gas for the first time in the modern era. While this switch has been primarily due to the existence of low natural gas prices, the federal government has provided a nudge to the electric power sector in the form of the proposed Clean Power Plan [CPP]. The CPP received a setback earlier in the year when the Supreme Court ruled that it could not be implemented until a multi-state lawsuit against it had been completed, almost certainly delaying its arrival until June 2017 at the very earliest.The Court's ruling is unlikely to have a meaningful impact on DTE Energy, however, since the company owns a substantial amount of old coal-fired capacity that is due for retirement. The company has already begun to shut some of this capacity down rather than perform necessary maintenance and repairs, judging the costs of switching to new gas-fired capacity in the era of cheap natural gas to be lower than postponing the coal-fired capacity's retirement any longer. Gas-fired capacity can meet all but the latest of CPP thresholds, meaning that its construction in the current price environment is both financially feasible and neutral from a regulatory perspective until the late 2020s. At that point, the CPP could begin to affect the company's capex plans by requiring renewables to be adopted alongside the new gas-fired capacity, but this is well beyond all but the most long-term investment horizons.Even then, DTE Energy is continuing to invest in new renewable capacity so as to ensure its continued compliance with Michigan's renewable portfolio standard. It recently announced that it was adding 50 MW of new wind capacity and the same amount of new solar PV capacity in the near future, for example. In the longer term, the company intends to continue reducing its old coal-fired units in favor of natural gas (capacity could double by 2030) and renewables (capacity could triple by 2030), with the exact mix of the two being determined by the state of the CPP and any modifications to Michigan's renewable portfolio standard. It is possible that the latter could result from a wide-ranging energy legislation package that is currently making its way through Michigan's legislature. One possibility is that the legislation will increase the state's renewables threshold while at the same time providing DTE Energy with a win by eliminating its Retail Open Access provision, which allows Michigan ratepayers to purchase up to 10% of an electric utility's retail sales from alternative generators.Meanwhile, DTE Energy is continuing to invest in its Gas Storage and Pipelines segment. The company completed the FERC filing for its proposed NEXUS natural gas pipeline at the end of December. It has also signed interconnect agreements for 1.4 Bcf of capacity, allowing it to generate revenue from pipeline activities in addition to reducing its customer's rates (and increasing demand) by connecting its own infrastructure to the Utica and Marcellus shales. NEXUS is now expected to be operational by the end of 2017. The company also recently completed a FERC pre-approval filing for a 200 Mcf expansion to its Millennium pipeline, with a targeted operational date of 2018. While today's extremely low natural gas prices raise the prospect of low pipeline volumes as E&P firms shut down, the targeted dates for operations at both projects to commence make it unlikely that such a situation would affect the company's earnings from them.The weather is continuing to be a drag on natural gas and electricity demand in DTE Energy's service area in 2016 to date, however. While January's heating degree days were only 10% below the normal number, February's result through the first half of the month was roughly 25% below normal. Every additional warm week increases the likelihood that the company's conservative guidance estimate becomes probable instead, given the first quarter's historical contribution to annual earnings. Continued warm temperatures will also make it less likely that weak industrial demand will be offset by robust residential and commercial demand despite recent customer growth in the latter categories.ValuationThe consensus analyst earnings estimates for DTE Energy's diluted EPS in FY 2016 and FY 2017 have remained mostly flat over the last 90 days since the warm winter temperatures were largely expected. The FY 2016 estimate has declined slightly from $4.96 to $4.95 while the FY 2017 estimate has also fallen by a penny, from $5.28 to $5.27. The company's share price has underperformed the broader utilities sector over the last two months, however, allowing its respective P/E ratios to remain at roughly the same levels as in early November (see figure) and within their long-term ranges. The company's shares are not clearly overvalued at this time as a result, unlikely those of many of its peers.DTE PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsConclusionDTE Energy reported Q4 earnings that beat slightly on EPS despite a substantial miss on revenue as global energy prices continued to fall. Warm temperatures during the quarter resulted in lower earnings for its regulated electric segment, although this was partially offset by strong demand for its gas storage and pipelines segment. Investors responded by keeping the company's shares from becoming clearly overvalued at the time of writing. That said, temperatures continue to remain high in the company's service area in Q1 to date and, while a pessimistic earnings guidance midpoint number from management will be difficult not to beat, the weather also limits the upside to the company's shares in the coming months. While the company's long-term earnings outlook is strong given continued low natural gas prices and its pipeline investments, I encourage potential investors to wait to initiate long positions until a margin of safety is available in the form of a share price that is under 14x its forward FY 2017 earnings, or $74 at the time of writing."
4246754,40101,2019-03-06T14:29:23-05:00,"DTE Energy reported 2018 full-year results on February 7th and affirmed its 2019 guidance. Its story in words and pictures seemed to be one worthy of investment.
        However, there's a ""gotcha"" in the 2019 guidance numbers. It's often difficult to determine if a ""gotcha"" outweighs the positives.
        As well, trading near its 52-week high, DTE does appear overvalued. Further, its dividend metrics are not as compelling as most income or DGI investors prefer.","Words can tell a story. Numbers can tell a story. And, it's said a picture is worth a thousand words. When the three don't align, it's probably wise to adopt some semblance of caution.A Seeking Alpha loyal asked me if I had an opinion on DTE Energy (DTE) or Ameren Corporation (AEE). My investment club has positions in Otter Tail (OTTR), Duke Energy (DUK) and Xcel Energy (XEL). It wouldn't hurt for us to add another in the utility sector from a diversification standpoint.I'll admit I start every analysis with a healthy dose of skepticism. I look for the anomalies. The inevitable question I face when I've found one is whether it's big enough to outweigh the positives.So, here we are again – trying to assign weight to a “gotcha”.DTE Energy is a diversified utility, similar to Otter Tail in that 70% to 75% of its operating earnings are generated from regulated utility business. DTE Energy operates both an electric and gas utility in the state of Michigan. It is the largest electric utility in Michigan servicing 2.2 million customers. It also serves 1.3 million gas customers.Headquartered in Detroit, the motor capital, it's natural to assume DTE Energy serves large industrial customers. And, to its credit, the utility has actually lowered its average industrial customer rate by 16% over the last five years. The accomplishment is partially credited to the utility business keeping its operating and maintenance expenses flat for the past ten years.Additionally, the utility businesses are targeting a delivery of 50% clean energy by 2030. Its renewable energy capacity should double by 2024. By 2050, it intends to reduce carbon emissions by 80% when compared to 2005 levels.SourceIn February, 2017, DTE Energy introduced MIGreenPower, a voluntary renewable energy program that matches usage to wind and solar sources. In January, 2019, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved a DTE Energy offering, inclusive of a tariff, designed for corporate and industrial customers. Ford Motor Company (F) was immediately interested. It will procure 500,000 megawatt hours of wind energy through MIGreenPower. It intends to be 100% sourced by locally-supplied renewable energy by 2021. Just two weeks later, General Motors (GM) also signed onto MIGreenPower. It will procure 300,000 megawatt hours of wind energy to power its Detroit-based operations and its global technical center in Warren.For the next five years, from 2019 to 2023, DTE Energy intends to invest $11.3 billion in its electric utility and $2.5 billion in its gas utility.The remaining 25% to 30% of its operating earnings are derived from several complimentary businesses. DTE Energy operates a gas storage and pipeline business, a P&I (Power and Industrial) projects business and an energy trading business.The gas storage and pipeline business (NYSEARCA:GSP) gathers, transports and stores natural gas Its six pipelines include 2,000 miles of gathering lines and pipe. Its storage capacity totals 91 billion cubic feet of natural gas. In February, DTE Energy announced its joint venture, NEXUS Gas Transmission system, would purchase Generation Pipeline. The 23-mile pipeline, located in northwest Ohio, provides natural gas to industrial customers.SourceFrom 2013 through 2018, DTE Energy invested approximately $3.5 billion in capital to build the business. It resulted in an additional $160 million of operating earnings annually. Through 2023, it intends to invest another $4 billion to $5 billion. DTE Energy estimates the investment should result in an additional $110 million in operating earnings annually.The P&I segment handles projects focused on industrial energy, renewable energy and reduced emissions fuel (REF). At the EEI Financial Conference in November 2018, DTE Energy noted the strength of its projects pipeline.To its credit, the projects segment has constructed and placed in service ten REF facilities, seven at third-party sites. These facilities are designed to reduce emissions in coal-fired plants. It is accomplished by blending a proprietary additive with coal. But, looking ahead, many utilities intend to retire coal-fired plants. As the operating earnings eventually begin to decline from REF leases and memberships, DTE Energy expects the operating earnings from new projects to offset it.Through 2023, it estimates approximately $15 million of operating earnings will be originated in the segment each year. DTE Energy's renewable gas (NYSE:RNG) recovery projects are ramping up. It acquired 4 projects in the past two years and the project pipeline shows robust opportunity for further growth. After 15 years of RNG experience, the P&I segment operates 23 sites in 9 states. These sites recover methane from landfills and agricultural businesses and upgrade it to a quality that meets natural gas pipeline standards. The upgraded RNG can then be used to generate electricity, in industrial and manufacturing operations, or even as vehicle fuel.Through 2023, DTE Energy expects to invest $1 billion to $1.4 billion in the P&I projects business.On February 7th, 2019, DTE Energy reported full-year results for 2018. Operating revenue was $14.2 billion, a 12.7% increase over 2017 results. Operating revenue from the Electric segment was $5.3 billion, from the Gas segment was $1.4 billion, from the Energy Trading segment was $5.5 billion, from the P&I segment was $2.2 billion and from the GSP segment was $485 million for a total of $14.9 billion. Of this, $771 million was reclassified or eliminated.However, DTE focuses on operating earnings rather than operating revenue.Operating earnings for the year totaled $1.14 billion, a 14% improvement over 2017 results. In the Electric segment, operating earnings improved 8.4% to $669 million. In the Gas segment, operating earnings grew 6.7% to $159 million. In the Energy trading segment operating earnings doubled to $40 million. The GSP segment generated a 46% increase to $233 million while the P&I segment increased 31.5% to $163 million.Operating earnings per share in 2018 were $6.30. Operating EPS in the Electric and Gas segments both increased just over 7% to $3.69 and $0.89 respectively. The Energy Trading segment's operating EPS more than doubled to $0.23. Operating EPS in the GSP segment improved 45% to $1.29 while operating EPS in the P&I segment improved 29% to $0.89. Adjustments for corporate operations decreased operating EPS by $0.69.This marked the tenth consecutive year DTE Energy has exceeded its original guidance.SourceAs well, the year's total cash flow was $500 million more than originally planned. The dividends to be paid in 2019 will be 7% more than 2018 at a rate of $0.945 per share quarterly.Alongside 2018 results, DTE Energy affirmed its 2019 guidance. Capital planned for investments from 2019 to 2023 now totals $20 billion. Through 2020, the company intends to grow its dividend by 7%. Its longer-term target, through 2023, is to increase operating EPS by 5% to 7% per year.SourceTherein lies the “gotcha” - in the 2019 guidance. The words are encouraging – growth in renewables, growth in projects, growth in earnings, growth in dividend distribution. The graphs show arrows pointing upward. But, the numbers don't align.In the chart shown above, DTE Energy depicts a 6.4% growth target from 2018 to 2019 for operating EPS, from $5.78 to $6.15. However, it should be remembered operating EPS in 2018 totaled $6.30. Rather, the $5.78 number is the midpoint of DTE Energy's original guidance for 2018.SourceIn its defense, DTE Energy does depict the misalignment.SourceStill, it's atypical to measure growth based on original guidance rather than actual results. At the midpoint of $6.15, 2019 operating earnings per share would decrease compared to 2018. It's hard to imagine the company would continue to report 2019 results compared to 2018 guidance.Then again, from a reported earnings perspective, DTE Energy's 2018 result of $6.17 per share was less than the 2017 performance of $6.32 per share. Tax reform did account for $0.48 in 2017 which does alter the comparison appreciably.When all is considered, it comes down to just how much this “gotcha” should matter. After all, DTE Energy is apparently conservative since it has exceeded its original guidance for ten years. Actual operating EPS in 2018 improved 9% compared to original guidance. If DTE Energy were to repeat that performance in 2019, operating EPS would improve to $6.70, which would represent a 6.4% improvement over 2018 results.DTE Energy is trading within 1% of the 52-week high of $123.84 set on February 25th. On analysts' average estimate of $6.24 for 2019, the forward P/E ratio is over 19. Obviously, the market isn't as disillusioned with DTE Energy's guidance comparison. However, for value or GARP (growth at a reasonable price) investors, DTE Energy would not be a viable candidate.Yet, many utilities attract income and DGI investors. And, for those investors, the company may not meet minimum requirements. At an annual dividend of $3.78 per share, the yield is barely over 3%. Also, the company's dividend growth track record is just nine years.Excluding the “gotcha”, DTE Energy certainly seems to have a story worthy of investment. When I compare it to my investment club's current utility sector investments, it would warrant consideration. Its dividend yield is greater than both Otter Tail and Xcel Energy. Its dividend growth rate for the past five years outpaces all three, Otter Tail, Xcel Energy and Duke Energy. Its dividend growth track record is longer than Otter Tail's.Based on dividend criteria, some may consider putting Otter Tail on the chopping block. However, my investment club recouped our original investment in Otter Tail years ago. Thus, our yield on cost is staggering. To consider replacing it would be impractical.Xcel Energy should probably be the next to consider for replacement. In addition to the dividend criteria, Xcel's P/E ratio of 21 is greater than that of DTE Energy. But, Xcel Energy's rate base growth forecast warrants its higher multiple. As well, we've owned our Xcel shares less than a year. As long-term holders, we typically commit to giving an investment at least three years and Xcel is already outperforming our total return expectations.When considering DTE Energy as a fourth investment in the utility sector for our portfolio, I'm still not inclined to recommend it to the club. First, it's simply too expensive now. On one hand, the club does tend to favor companies that under-promise and over-deliver. But, on the other, we are also drawn to management teams that simply tell it like it is. It's my opinion DTE Energy missed an opportunity to be more upfront and forthright in detailing the decline from 2018 actual operating EPS results to the midpoint of 2019 guidance. As a result, the ""gotcha"" tipped the scales. Source"
3283005,24961,2015-06-26T08:04:21-04:00,"Electric and natural gas utility DTE Energy's share price has fallen in recent months despite strong earnings and management guidance.Environmental regulations are requiring the company to incur large expenses as it moves away from coal-fired capacity but it has the cash flow and liquidity to handle these.Furthermore, the economy in its service area is rebounding as Michigan's unemployment rate has plummeted to the national average from its 2010 highs.Finally, the company is also investing in new capacity and is expanding its non-regulated operations so as to ensure sustained earnings and dividend growth over the next several years.Macroeconomic pressures have pushed the company's share price close to the level at which they would be clearly undervalued and I would consider buying.","The share price of electric and natural gas utility DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) has fallen by roughly 20% since the end of January (see figure) as the company has been hit by bearish sentiment on a number of fronts, including an expected rate increase from the Federal Reserve, weather during the first quarter that was warmer than during the same quarter of the previous year, and a combination of state and federal environmental regulations that have placed pressure on utilities to replace coal with natural gas and renewables. At the same time, however, the price decline has coincided with two consecutive quarterly earnings beats, low energy prices, and signs of a rebounding economy in the company's service area. This article evaluates DTE Energy as a potential investment opportunity in light of this operating environment.DTE data by YChartsDTE Energy at a glanceDTE Energy generates and distributes multiple types of energy from various pathways in the state of Michigan. The company was formed by the 2001 merger of the electric utility Detroit Edison Co. and the natural gas utility Michigan Consolidated Co. The two utilities now comprise DTE Energy's two largest subsidiaries and operating segments under the names DTE Energy Electric Co. (""DTE Electric"") and DTE Gas Co. (""DTE Gas""). DTE Electric serves southeast Michigan, including Detroit and the surrounding area, generating electricity that it transmits to approximately 2.1 million customers. The subsidiary owns and operates 11,084 MW of generating capacity. Of this, approximately 70% is coal-fired, 10% is gas-fired or renewable (primarily hydroelectric with a smaller amount of biomass-fired capacity), and 20% is nuclear, the latter comprising 30% of Michigan's total nuclear capacity. The heavy reliance of DTE Electric on coal-fired capacity has become a burden in recent years as inexpensive natural gas has made that fuel a more attractive option than coal and regulations at the state and federal levels have discouraged coal's combustion. The company is investing heavily to replace much of its existing coal capacity with natural gas (in part via the acquisition of new gas-fired facilities) and renewables (such as the conversion of existing coal-fired facilities to biomass). The company expects coal's total share of generating capacity to fall from 70% to 30% by 2030, offset by an increase to the share of gas and renewables from 10% to 50%.DTE Gas distributes natural gas to 1.2 million customers across Michigan, including the Detroit and Upper Peninsula areas. The subsidiary owns and operates 278 storage wells equal to 34% of Michigan's underground capacity. It primarily serves the northern Michigan and Upper Peninsula areas and also owns the small Citizens Gas Fuel natural gas utility. While DTE Electric and DTE Gas are responsible for the vast majority of DTE Energy's consolidated earnings (84% in Q1, split roughly evenly between the two subsidiaries), the company also owns smaller non-utility segments, including a gas storage and pipelines segment and a power & industrial projects segment, which provide most of the rest of the consolidated earnings. Finally, the company also operates an energy trading segment, although its contribution to earnings is generally minimal.Higher energy prices caused DTE Energy's revenue to soar by 40% from 2012 to $12.3 billion in FY 2014 (see table). Although this was partially offset by similar increases to input and operating costs, its operating income and net income reached post-recession highs last year. While continuous profitability is to be expected from regulated utilities, with regulators commonly setting rates high enough to allow the utilities to achieve returns of equity of around 10%, DTE Energy's earnings growth has caused its share price to achieve performance not common among utilities, more than tripling between 2009 and 2015.DTE Energy Financials (non-adjusted)Source: Morningstar (2015)One reason for DTE Energy's impressive performance has been its ability to maintain a solid balance sheet in the type of volatile operating conditions that have been present since 2010. The company has maintained a current ratio of around 1.2 over the last five years, regularly ending the fiscal year with roughly $50 million in cash reserves (see table), even as its total assets have increased by $1.5 billion more than its total liabilities. While the company maintains a large amount of long-term debt ($8.3 billion at the end of FY 2014), this is not uncommon for regulated utilities and the firm's interest expenses have actually declined even as its total debt load has increased. Overall, DTE Energy has been a strong performer in a sector that has done well for itself on average in recent years.DTE Energy Balance Sheet (restated)Source: Morningstar (2015)Q1 earnings reportDTE Energy reported its Q1 earnings in late April, beating on the top line and missing on the bottom line. Revenue came in at $3.0 billion, down 24% from $3.9 billion the previous year and missing the analyst consensus by $550 million. The decline was mostly attributable to the presence of much lower energy prices in the most recent year compared to Q1 2014, which caused the company to reduce the prices charged to its customers. DTE Gas reduced its natural gas prices by 17% compared to the previous year while DTE Electric reduced its own rates by 6%. The 24% YoY decline was also due in part to the fact that Q1 2014 was Michigan's coldest in 60 years, driving sales volumes at DTE Gas. Q1 2015 was still cold (the third coldest in the last 60 years), but warmer than the previous year.DTE Energy's consolidated operating income fell to $461 million from $560 million the previous year, driven by reduced natural gas demand and the presence of lower prices. Cost of revenue fell 35% YoY, however, mostly offsetting these factors. Furthermore, operating expenses fell by 7% YoY as O&M fell substantially. This latter decline enabled the company to report net income of $273 million compared to $326 million the previous year, or diluted EPS of $1.53 versus $1.84 the previous year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.65 compared to $1.69 YoY due to an adjustment of $0.18 attributed to the Energy Trading segment, which beat the analyst consensus by $0.12. The relatively warm weather in Q1 had a pronounced impact on the company's earnings: while DTE Electric's EPS was virtually unchanged YoY, that of DTE Gas was $0.11 lower compared to the previous year. Finally, EBITDA came in at $715 million compared to $875 million the previous year. In all, then, it was a strong quarter for the company, with the negative annual comparison being the result of 2014's historically cold Q1 rather than underperformance at the company itself in Q1 2015.DTE Energy's balance sheet also remained in good shape at the end of Q1. Operating cash flow for the quarter rose from $532 million the previous year and $541 million the previous quarter to $747 million, allowing the company to repay $117 million in debt and making $240 million worth of acquisitions, all while maintaining its $0.69 quarterly dividend (3.7% yield at the time of writing). The company no longer has any short-term debt on its books, and it ended the quarter with $99 million in cash compared to $98 million at the end of Q1 2014.OutlookDTE Energy's Q1 results were in-line with its expectations, and its management expects to achieve an adjusted EPS range for FY 2015 of $4.48-$4.72. While not as strong as its FY 2014 EPS, which was boosted by a very impressive weather-induced Q1 result, even the bottom of the range would place FY 2015 as the 2nd-strongest quarter since FY 2009. Investors have a number of reasons to be optimistic regarding the company's short-term outlook, not least of which is Michigan's rebound from the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession, both of which had a disproportionately painful impact on the state. Michigan's unemployment rate, which as recently as 2010 was several percentage points higher than the U.S. unemployment rate, has made up ground recently and is now the same as the national average (see figure). While some of the decline in the state's rate has been to emigration, the state's economy has finally begun to rebound following Detroit's bankruptcy. Michigan is not expected to become a major economic growth story in coming years, let alone return to its days as an industrial powerhouse, but the economic recovery will benefit DTE Energy by driving residential demand for electricity and natural gas at the very least, as well as industrial demand under a more optimistic scenario.Michigan Unemployment Rate data by YChartsThe fall in electricity rates and natural gas prices that has occurred since August 2014 has also driven demand for both, and this boost could grow still further if natural gas prices remain lower or fall further still. The citygate price of natural gas in Michigan is currently 14% lower than at the same time a year ago (see figure), while residential and industrial consumption of natural gas are both up strongly over the same period. Environmental regulations restricting the use of coal for generating electricity will prevent the company from taking full advantage of this demand since a large percentage of its capital expenditures are aimed at replacing coal capacity rather than acquiring net increases to existing capacity, but it still intends to invest $450 million just in new capacity for DTE Electric in FY 2015. This will be financed by a combination of operating cash flows, the issuance of $850 million in equity by the end of FY 2017, and $1.9 billion in available liquidity that recently had its maturity extended to April 2020. DTE Electric continues to access debt at low interest rates, with management stating during the Q1 earnings call that its most recent 30-year bond issuance achieved the company's lowest interest rate since the Eisenhower administration. DTE Energy is positioned to successfully invest $11.5 billion in capital expenditures through 2019, $7.5 billion of which will go toward acquiring new capacity and replacing coal with natural gas and renewables.Michigan Natural Gas Citygate Price data by YChartsFinally, DTE Energy is also positioning itself to take advantage of America's recent status as a major producer of hydrocarbons by transporting energy from inland reserves to its customers in Michigan. The company has formed a partnership with Spectra Energy to build a 250-mile pipeline connecting the Marcellus and Utica shales with a pipeline hub in Michigan that in turn connects Ohio, Chicago, and Ontario. DTE Energy is contributing $700 million to the NEXUS pipeline, which is expected to be in service by Q4 2017. With 1.5 Bcf/day capacity, the pipeline will be an important addition to the region's existing pipeline infrastructure when completed. There are still many hurdles to overcome, with regulators recently taking issue with the pipeline's proposed route, but construction isn't expected to begin for at least another year, at which point it will take only a year to complete.ValuationNot surprisingly, given management's recent guidance, analyst estimates for DTE Energy's diluted EPS in FY 2015 and FY 2016 have increased only very slightly over the last 90 days. The FY 2015 consensus has increased from $4.62 to $4.64 while the FY 2016 estimate has increased from $4.91 to $4.92. Based on the company's share price at the time of writing of $74.34, its shares are trading at a trailing P/E ratio of 16.3x and forward ratios of 16.0 and 15.1, respectively. All of these ratios are in the bottom half of their 3-year historical ranges (see figure), although the forward ratios would need to fall below 14x before the company could be considered to be clearly undervalued. DTE PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsConclusionDTE Energy's share price has fallen substantially even though it has had a good year to date. Its shares certainly appear to be more attractive based on forward valuations than they were at the beginning of the year, a result that can be largely attributed to the prevalence of bearish sentiment toward dividend stocks in anticipation of one or more interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve later in the year. With a 3.7% yield, an improved operating environment, and plans to increase regulated capacity while expanding its non-regulated operations, DTE Energy is an attractive long investment candidate. I think that interest rate expectations could push the company's shares lower in the coming months, but I would consider purchasing its shares in the event that they fall below $69 (or 14x the FY 2016 consensus EPS) in the near future."
1398591,41381,2013-05-03T08:50:15-04:00,,"On Wednesday May 1, DTE Energy Co. (NYSE:DTE) announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.035 /share to bring its upcoming dividend payout to $0.665/share. It should be noted that this increase represents a 5.64% rise from its prior dividend of $0.63/share, which was paid on March 14. In the wake of DTE Energy's dividend increase I wanted to examine several of the catalysts behind my decision to consider a long-term position in this particular high-yielding energy play.According to DTE Energy's chairman, president and CEO, ""The decision to increase our dividend reflects DTE Energy's confidence in our growth strategy and in our continued commitment to increase shareholder value. We also understand that dividends, as well as earnings growth, are some of the key components in providing a competitive return to shareholders.""If DTE can stick to its strategy of returning equity to shareholders, there's a very good chance the company's dividend growth of roughly 5% per year could be maintained over the course of at least the next several years.Overview: Based in Detroit, Michigan, and together with its subsidiaries, DTE operates as an energy company engaged in the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity to approximately 2.1 million residential, commercial, and industrial customers in southeastern Michigan. (Yahoo! Finance) On Wednesday, shares of DTE, which currently possess a market cap of $12.54 billion, a P/E ratio of 18.62, a forward P/E ratio of 16.96, and a yield of 3.42% ($2.48), settled at $72.44/share.Earnings Performance: On Friday, April 26, DTE Energy Company reported the results of what I believe to be a very strong first quarter. The company's Q1 EPS of $1.34/share beat Street estimates by $0.26/share, and its revenue of $2.51 billion beat Street estimates by an impressive $0.20 billion. From a comparative standpoint, the company's operating earnings of $1.34 per diluted share in Q1 2013 outperformed its operating earnings during Q1 2012 of $0.91 per diluted share, by a margin of 47.25% or $0.43 per diluted share.According to DTE Energy's executive vice president and chief financial officer, David E. Meador, ""We will continue to focus on maintaining solid earnings and cash flow combined with a strong balance sheet, while ensuring that our underlying priority is to provide our customers with clean, safe and reliable energy at an affordable price.""One of the more important catalysts investors should pay close attention to is the price of Natural Gas as any significant price change in the commodity would directly affect earnings to both the upside and downside.Dividend Behavior: Since June 17, 2010, DTE has increased its quarterly dividend a total of three times by an average of $0.03375 each time. From an income perspective, the company's forward yield of 3.59% coupled with its payout ratio and its continued annual increases could equate into a very viable income option for long-term investors in search of a very conservative dividend.DTE Dividend data by YChartsConclusion: When it comes to those who may be looking to establish a position in DTE Energy, I'd continue keep a watchful eye on not only the company's dividend behavior over the next 12 months, but any key developments that may help enhance the company's earnings growth over the next 12-24 months.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in DTE over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
298521,24135,2011-10-10T04:47:43-04:00,,"DTE Energy Company (NYSE:DTE) is a diversified energy company primarily focused on delivering gas and electricity to the greater Detroit area. DTE is 100% owner of The Detroit Edison Company and Michigan Consolidated Gas Company. Both companies are regulated utilities. DTE also has a variety of other businesses ranging from Energy Trading to Pipelines to Power & Industrial Projects. These ancillary businesses accounted for over 25% of DTE's revenue in Q2 2011.Source: SEC filings  DTE had about $8.6 billion in revenue with $639 million in net income in 2010. DTE has a market capitalization of $8.5 billion and an enterprise value of $16.4 billion, suggesting significant leverage. DTE has a strong track record of paying dividends. For 2010, its payout ratio to net income was 56% and its payout to operating cash flow was just 20%. Even adjusting for capital expenditures related to utility and non-utility plants, property and equipment, the dividend payout ratio was still 50%. This shows that there is still an ability to drive growth in the dividend without growth in the underlying financials. It should be noted that the dividend is paid in the quarter after it is declared.DTE's estimated forward dividend yield is 4.8% based upon a closing price of $49.91 and the author's projected annual dividend of $2.40. The following table shows the estimated forward quarterly dividends as well as the recent historical quarterly dividends.Source: Author estimates, Yahoo!FinanceWhat the above table does not clearly show is that from 1993 to 2006, DTE paid a consistent $0.515 quarterly dividend year after year. DTE then increased the dividend to $0.53 which has now seen two additional increases. The following graph shows the historical trailing twelve month yield and spread compared to the 10-year Treasury bond.Created from data from Yahoo!FinanceThis graph shows that the trailing dividend yield is around the historical average. The next graph shows the normalized performance of the stock price, the dividend, and the trailing dividend yield.Created from data from Yahoo!FinanceThe above chart shows the impact of relatively flat dividends. The yield will then vary inversely from the stock price, creating a mirror effect. The one caution it points to is that the stock has climbed a little faster than the dividend. This suggests that investors are rewarding DTE. The second key aspect is that while DTE has two core regulated businesses, it also has several non-regulated businesses to help drive earnings growth. So even if one has concerns about the local Detroit economy (read U.S. auto industry), there are other avenues of growth for DTE. For example, in comparison to Q2 2008, the Gas Storage, Energy Trading, and Power & Industrial projects all saw increased net income. The ability of DTE to grow these business will be substantial help to growing the dividend for the entire company.Dividend Discount Model suggests fair to slight undervaluation The first step to using the dividend discount model is to calculate an equity hurdle rate with the Capital Asset Pricing Model. DTE has a beta of 0.6 and with the risk free rate at a very low 2.1% this gives the discount rate to be a 6.3%. As noted above, the forward dividend is approximately $2.40. Applying a long term growth rate of 1% gives an estimated price of $56.09 for DTE. This is approximately a 12% premium to the current price of $49.91. However, as with any dividend discount model, the result is highly sensitive to growth rate and equity hurdle rate assumptions.Source: Author calculations  On a standalone basis, DTE looks like a reasonable opportunity worth additional analysis; however, it would also be important to consider other utility investments as well. How does DTE compare to them? The second key issue is that one would have to get a much better understanding of the non-utility businesses, since they are a key part of driving DTE's overall growth.

Performance focus more on top-line than bottom-line: same period year-on-year change of revenue of 9.82% vs. change in earnings of -21.21%.Gross margins now 23.74% from 29.37% compared to the same period last year, EBITDA margins now 20.42% from 25.81%.Earnings decline from operating margin decreases as well as from unusual items.","By Veibha SubramaniamThe table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income (See complete table at the end of this report):Revenue Growth Versus Earnings GrowthCompanies sometimes focus on growing their top-line (Sales or Revenues) more than their bottom-line i.e. Earnings or Net Income. Investors should look at revenue growth to understand a company's ability to grow its market share, and earnings growth to look at the company's ability to generate returns. Comparing revenue growth to earnings growth helps understand a couple of items: (1) A company's focus on gaining market share vs. generating profits and (2) How additive or dilutive the revenue performance has been to earnings. DTE's year-on-year change in top line compared to the same period last year of 9.82% is better than its change in earnings which was -21.21% - suggesting perhaps that the company's focus is on the top-line at the expense of bottom-line earnings. However, this change in top line is better than average among the declared results thus far in its peer group - pointing to some likely market share gains and helps to look past the weaker earnings performance this period. Also, for comparison purposes, revenues changed by 0.27% and earnings by 25.81% compared to the immediate last quarter.Earnings Growth AnalysisThe company's year-on-year decline in earnings has been influenced by the following factors: (1) Decline in gross margins from 29.37% to 23.74% and (2) issues with cost controls. As a result, operating margins (EBITDA margins) went from 25.81% to 20.42% in this period. For comparison, gross margins were 20.25% and EBITDA margins 16.89% in the immediate last quarter.Unusual ItemsThe company's decline in earnings has been influenced by the following factors: (1) Decline in EBIT margins from 12.74% to 9.13% and (2) unusual items that decreased pretax margins from 11.68% to 6.86%EPS Growth Versus Earnings GrowthDTE's year-on-year change in Earnings per Share (EPS) of -22.12% is less than its change in earnings of -21.21%. This lower EPS growth suggests a likely larger dilution in the company's shares this period. However, on the positive side, this change in earnings is better than average among the declared results thus far in its peer group, suggesting that the company is gaining more ground in generating profits in this group.Supporting DataThe table below shows the preliminary results along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and other relevant metrics:Company ProfileDTE Energy Co. is a diversified energy company, which is primarily engaged in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales, distribution and storage services throughout Michigan through its subsidiaries.

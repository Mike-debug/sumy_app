4382753,103480,2020-10-29T16:01:40-04:00,"Shares of eBay pulled back ~5% in after-hours trading after the company reported third-quarter results.After the pandemic drove fervent buying activity, the company's GMV growth decelerated in Q3.The company also only barely grew active buyers on its platform and missed Wall Street's numbers on net-new adds.eBay is a stagnant business with little in the way of meaningful growth drivers.","eBay (EBAY) is one ""legacy"" technology company that has recently undergone a decent bit of change. The online auction site, once one of the most celebrated technology companies in Silicon Valley, has sold both its StubHub and Classifieds (the first is already off the books; the second is slated to close in the first quarter of 2021) and decided to focus on its core Marketplace unit.That decision has largely paid off this year, as the Marketplace business got one of the biggest injections of user activity this year amid the global pandemic. E-commerce businesses of all flavors, from arts-and-crafts site Etsy (ETSY) to online furniture vendor Wayfair (W) and of course Amazon (AMZN) all benefited from the closure of brick-and-mortar competitors as well as the increased amount of time we've spent at home browsing the internet. eBay was not spared from that tailwind, either.But now as the pandemic matures (though we have no end in sight to the current situation, especially as countries worldwide begin to re-impose lockdown restrictions), investors are asking a critical question: just how sustainable is eBay's coronavirus-driven growth?After reporting third-quarter results that still included some lifts driven by the pandemic, but not to the same degree as in Q2, shares of eBay pulled back ~5% in after-hours trading:Data by YChartsThere are plausible arguments for both the bull and bear camps for eBay, I'll admit. On the bullish side: even after a ~45% rally in the year-to-date (certainly outperforming the S&P 500's flat performance over the same timeframe), shares of eBay are still sitting at a very modest 14.9x P/E ratio versus Wall Street's consensus FY21 EPS of $3.58, per Yahoo Finance. It's very difficult to find any technology company, let alone a company in the very hot e-commerce sector, that is trading at such a low multiple of true earnings (and in fact, so few internet stocks even have positive net income to begin with).But to me, eBay's value angle is marred by several key risks:In other words, eBay's cheap valuation is a reflection that investors are largely betting eBay's best days are behind it, and that its future revenue/earnings potential lacks any clear drivers to take eBay's scale meaningfully higher. For eBay to avoid a contraction would alone be an accomplishment.In my view, eBay remains a stock to be watched on the sidelines. Only if shares dip to extreme value levels (a ~10x P/E ratio, or $36) should investors rush in to buy eBay again.Let's now review eBay's third-quarter results in greater detail. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. eBay Q3 resultsSource: eBay Q3 earnings release On the whole, eBay's headline results beat Wall Street's expectations - ever so slightly. The company's revenue grew 25% y/y to $2.61 billion, slightly edging out over Wall Street's consensus mark of $2.57 billion (+23% y/y).GMV, or gross merchandise value, is one of the most important metrics that investors watch for in eBay, and the biggest driver of revenue growth. Trends on this front were rather mixed. On the upside, eBay is still enjoying tailwinds from the coronavirus, and its growth rates are still exceeding what they were pre-pandemic (which was flat).Figure 2. eBay GMV trendsSource: eBay Q3 earnings deckIn Q3, as can be seen in the chart above, eBay's total GMV grew 21% y/y. While still leagues above eBay's usual growth trajectory, it does represent eight points of deceleration versus 29% y/y growth in Q2. GMV in the U.S. slowed down two points, but an even bigger driver was a twelve-point deceleration in eBay's international segment, which contributes more than 60% to eBay's overall revenue.To me, there are several risks that we can read into from these trends:Likewise, eBay disappointed on its count of active buyers. In Q2, eBay gained 8 million net-new buyers as seen in the chart below:Figure 3. eBay active buyersSource: eBay Q3 earnings deckHowever, by the time we got to Q3, eBay added only 1 million net-new buyers relative to Q2 - basically back to eBay's pre-pandemic trend. Wall Street, meanwhile, had hoped for 185.4 million in active buyers, or 2.4 million above what eBay actually managed to do.Another portion of eBay's revenue growth in Q3 is also suspect: the fact that take rates bumped up to 9.4%, representing a 40bps increase sequentially versus Q2 and 60bps y/y. Take rates, of course, can vary within a quarter for a number of reasons, including and especially revenue mix. But this is another artificial/non-sustainable tailwind that helped eBay's revenue beat consensus in Q2: eBay, which is already in hot water among sellers for its fees, doesn't have much room to drive revenue growth by increasing its fees.For comparison - on eBay, the standard ""final value fee"" that sellers pay upon sale is 10%. It's higher in some categories (12% for books, music, and DVDs), and lower for some higher-priced items (2% for commercial equipment; 3.5% for musical instruments). Amazon, by contrast, has a wider band of fees ranging generally from 8-15%, while Etsy charges a market-low 5%. All this said, eBay's room to push fees higher is probably very limited if it wants to keep its seller base.Looking ahead to Q4, eBay has guided to revenue growth in a range of 18-21% y/y, which would imply up to seven points of deceleration versus this quarter. GMV growth, which tracks closely alongside revenue growth, can be implied to decelerate by roughly the same magnitude.All of these factors are indicators, in my view, that eBay is on the path of ""resetting to normal"" after enjoying the peak benefits of the coronavirus in Q2.When investing in technology stocks, investors hardly need to be reminded that we have to think about the future moreso than the present. At present, eBay's revenue and GMV growth are healthy, and producing strong earnings - but looking ahead even to the medium-term future (1-2 years), I don't see any viable catalysts that would help eBay retain its market share versus faster-growing e-commerce rivals, let alone grow and differentiate itself in this crowded market. With pandemic tailwinds slowing, eBay's dim prospects are being put back into the spotlight. Until this stock drops to bargain-basement lows, it's not worth investing in."

(NASDAQ:EBAY) (Long): The Partnership has taken some profits in EBAY, although our position remains sizeable at 10% of capital. A substantial portion of the investment thesis has played out, namely that activist-owner Elliot Management would instigate the sale of both StubHub and EBAY's portfolio of classified businesses. The sale of StubHub was completed in early 2020 for net cash proceeds of ~$3.1 billion, and in the third quarter, the company announced it had entered into an agreement to sell the classifieds portfolio to Adevinta (OTCPK:ADEVF) [ADE] for $2.0 billion of net cash and ~$6.7 billion worth of shares. The market responded positively to ADE's acquisition and today the share-based consideration is worth ~$9.0 billion.With a key component of the thesis realized, why not completely exit the position? The answer is what remains - the core EBAY marketplace - continues to trade at a modest price relative to its cash generating capacity. At the shares' current price of $53, EBAY's market capitalization is $37.5 billion. This includes $5.8 billion of cash and investments, implying a value net of cash of $31.7 billion. The company should generate an additional $1.25 billion of free cash flow in the second half of the year, receive $2.0 billion in net cash proceeds from ADE, and shares in ADE worth another $9.0 billion at current prices. Backing out these additional items results in a clean market cap of $19.5 million for EBAY's core marketplace.By 2022, EBAY's managed payments initiative should more or less offset the cash flow the company will lose as a result of the sale of the classifieds portfolio. Steady state free cash flow should remain in the realm of $2.0 billion. To this end, I believe we are paying an effective 10x P/FCF multiple for the core marketplace business. Say what you want about EBAY, but this is hardly a demanding valuation for a capital-light (a positive in an inflationary world) e-commerce operator (a positive in a pandemic-stricken world).Editor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4372836,56142,2020-09-06T17:12:55-04:00,"Many investors are unaware of the tremendous value and PEG growth proposition offered by eBay shares in early September.Leading profit margins and returns on capital for the online retail industry are available at a steep discount to peers around $52 a share.The combination of a major asset shuffle, share buybacks, and improving sales because of COVID-19 are worth serious consideration for your portfolio.Technical buying trends remain strong, as the stock quote takes a breather in late summer.","I have talked about eBay (EBAY) in a bullish manner since the stock broke out of its multi-year base pattern in early May. My initial article effort and argument for ownership is linked here. The company has undertaken a major business reorganization, with some financial engineering sprinkled into the mix since 2019. Specifically, a new CEO, selling parts of the business, and large share buybacks have been the recipe for success in the stock quote, doubling in price from its March low.I have traded in and out of eBay three times for a profit the last four months, and opened another starter position in the $51 per share area on Friday. I am not optimistic on the overall U.S. stock market’s near-term future going into the hotly contested November election. Plus, I am also expecting another ramp higher in coronavirus case spread into the fall, as schools reopen and cold weather keeps everyone indoors. However, eBay’s value proposition is just too good to ignore. Could the price fall another 10-20% in a market crash scenario? Sure, but I think it is so cheap today, the stock will start to sharply outperform the S&P 500 and Nasdaq online retail competitors from this point forward.Image Source: Company BlogToday the company’s website is one of the top retail marketplaces for both used and new items. EBay is capturing 81% of gross sales volume (and its cut for listing fees) through the regular online marketing and transaction flow of “new” items with larger retail partners, individual users and small businesses. The company reported 182 million unique buyers during Q2 ended in June, a sizable +5% increase over Q1 and nearly +6% rise over Q2 2019. Without doubt, the coronavirus push to buy/sell goods from home has benefited eBay’s business model.Image Source: Company WebsiteYears of stagnation in both revenues and profits had pulled the rug under investor optimism, until 2020. This year, the combination of dramatic cost cutting, asset sales, stock repurchases and an uptick in revenues at the core ebay.com Marketplace segment from the coronavirus pandemic situation is causing a rethink of eBay’s long-term business worth on Wall Street.Believe it or not, eBay’s bullish foundation for ownership is still not resonating with investors. Its stock price gain has been muted vs. peers. But as time passes, and earnings/sales continue to surprise on the upside, a long period of outperformance against the S&P 500 index looks to be at hand. Below you can review the lagging performance in the stock vs. peers and competitors in the online retail space. The list includes Amazon (AMZN), Wayfair (W), Etsy (ETSY) and Best Buy (BBY). I am including Best Buy to compare the group to a hybrid online/physical store business model, where roughly 50% of 2020 sales have occurred online during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the other half initiated at brick-and-mortar store locations.Despite a sharp reversal in business fortunes during 2020, eBay’s stock advance has lagged this group of competitors and peers by a rather wide margin over 1-3 years. This article will take a quick look at the company’s underlying improvement in already industry-leading returns and margins, and describe why the equity may be one of the few ""bargains"" available to investors during this summer’s push to all-time record overvaluations in the U.S. stock market.As part of a diversified long/short portfolio design, eBay is a Strong Buy from my perch. Here is a quick explanation why.In February eBay completed the previously announced sale of its StubHub business to an affiliate of viagogo for $4 billion. It used proceeds to buy back stock and repay debt. The company just announced in July its divestiture of the classified ad business to Norway's Adevinta (OTCPK:ADEVF) for $9.2B in cash and stock. The new Adevinta business will be the largest online classifieds company globally. EBay will receive $2.5B in cash and approximately 540M Adevinta shares, representing 44% ownership of the new company and a 33% voting stake. The company will be the biggest shareholder of Adevinta, and can still participate in the upside from its former division. Plus, eBay can find liquidity to either pay down debt or fund future Marketplace growth by selling shares of Adevinta over time.While many investors were hoping for an all-cash deal for the Classifieds segment, some disappointment in the transaction terms may have been the catalyst for a late summer stock price sell-off. Nevertheless, the division’s sale price is higher than expected several months ago, and a sizable cash chunk is part of the deal. After this final major divestiture, eBay will be left with its original operating business. Activist hedge fund investors have been forecasting a renewed focus on the eBay platform would produce organic growth at improved margins, and an even higher Wall Street valuation of the remaining business. We will soon see if sharply better operating margins and returns into 2021 grab the attention of Wall Streeters.Graphs of eBay’s leading profit margin and cash flow returns in the quickly expanding online retail demographic are something of an eye-opener. The truly good news is 2021’s operating returns will be even better than 2019-20, and total sales are growing again from the coronavirus stay-at-home consumer push. You can review the 5-year graph of cash flow to sales below. Ebay’s current data point of 31.5% on a trailing basis is turning higher with the asset reorganization and should retake the top spot in 2021 out of its peer group.Net profit margin is hands down the best of the online retail group at 47% the past year from extraordinary gains during the asset sell-off phase. It’s long-term 10-year average of ongoing operational profit margin around 25% is both sustainable, diversified in origination from consumers and businesses all over the world, and may even rise some as online retail demand pushes to new plateaus going forward.As a result of the restructuring, reported accounting assets are falling at the same time as profits and sales are on the upswing at the remaining Marketplace platform. Below you can review eBay’s best-in-class return on assets in 2020, likely to improve yet again during 2021.Net income per employee runs circles around other online retailers. Below you can contrast the company’s $130,000 profit generation per worker during 2019-20, with Amazon’s reported $16,000, and Best Buy’s productivity a little over $12,000 per head.The June quarter’s results came in much better than anticipated by Wall Street, and the company smartly raised guidance for the rest of 2020. If the COVID-19 shift in consumer buying online remains at elevated levels as the new normal, eBay is in an enviable position for its owners. And, this recession is causing more people to look for deals on their money and ways to liquidate assets to raise cash. If government stimulus payments disappear into 2021, many consumers and businesses will live off the sale of existing assets to pay bills and remain solvent. All told, eBay may be entering a win-win position for stakeholders the next several years.Below are highlights from the company’s Q2 investor presentation.Image Source: Company Q2 PresentationFinally, Wall Street analyst estimates are calling for a DOUBLE in EPS during a recessionary period between 2019 and early 2023! The number of businesses expected to see similar stellar growth in income per share is very small, and the number of those enterprises publicly-traded is an even smaller group. Overall, eBay’s intermediate-term business growth curve is a top 10% proposition in the S&P 500 index.Considering eBay’s industry leading returns/margins, and the resumption of above-trend growth vs. the economy and its recent past, the stock is simply priced too low for reality. Given the huge run in prices and valuations in other big tech names from the coronavirus panic low in March as your sort group (think FAANNG stocks), eBay is a unique bargain in early September.The easiest way to view the worth of a business is through an earnings yield chart. You can stack up the money a single owner could put in his/her pocket each year, as a function of the current market quote for ownership. Below is a graph of the peer group’s earnings yield using their projected 12-month forward earnings estimates.An investor at $52 a share could pocket 7.59% this year, and likely much more in 2-3 years, per annum. This number again runs circles around the online-only retail industry. The rest of the industry is sitting at 2% per annum or lower! Only Best Buy comes close, but it holds less value, lower margins and higher execution risk if coronavirus spread reappears during the autumn/winter months. If you are searching for an extremely cheap valuation in the U.S. blue-chip universe, eBay may be a terrific fit for your portfolio.The S&P 500 earnings yield on a trailing basis is closer 3.5% presently, and on a 1-year forward basis still under 4%. Then compare 7.59% annually with alternative investment, corporate bond yields under 5% and risk-free Treasury yields under 2%! Using the earnings yield data point alone, I can argue eBay is worth serious consideration for your investment capital. Based on earnings yield, Wall Street is saying eBay’s long-term worth is HALF of the average S&P 500 business yield for investors. That’s complete nonsense – eBay is absolutely worth MORE than the typical U.S. business with revenues, earnings and cash flow per share rising sharply during this recession.On price to trailing free cash flow, a favorite yardstick on Wall Street, eBay is an even bigger bargain today vs. its peer sector. The 13.8x ratio is far, far away from the online-only retail crowd in the 38-72x range, after the amazing technology-centered stock market run of 2020.Price to sales is also below the industry average, mind you with competitors generating dramatically lower margins on sales. Under normal trading circumstances, businesses with super-high profit margins and returns on invested capital are typically valued at well ABOVE-NORMAL ratios of sales.In addition, the company started paying a regular dividend in 2020. This move is a unique show of confidence in the company’s long-term free cash generation prospects, as no other online retail firm has felt comfortable returning cash to shareholders. In fact, the opposite is true. Many online retailers continue to issue shares to grow scale, and “hopes” of future profitability.Finally, Wall Street’s rule of thumb is to buy companies when Price to Earnings Growth [PEG] scores are under 1.0. Unfortunately, Wayfair still isn’t profitable as an operating business, so it fails this calculation. And, Amazon is so darn expensive after rising straight up in price for years, little upside remains in the stock. Despite slightly higher projected growth rates in income vs. eBay the next three years, America's main online retail competitor has already discounted a bright future that may or may not happen as expected. Best Buy has a low upfront valuation, but such matches up with slower expected expansion in operating earnings. In the end, only eBay and Etsy have ultra-low PEG valuations, pictured below. Both enterprises are expected to undergo a substantial bump to earnings for various reasons in 2020-21, restructuring gains being one reason for eBay. Nevertheless, the idea eBay is priced at a low level vs. income growth is accurate. Below is a comparison of trailing P/Es to forward 12-24 month growth rates in estimated EPS by YCharts.Yes, huge share buybacks are part of the reason for eBay’s strong performance the last 12 months. Having this wind at your back as an existing shareholder is definitely preferable to a company constantly issuing shares to keep the lights on. Overall, using nine different momentum and technical signposts for trading health, eBay scores quite well in my computer sort system. Today’s technical checkup reveals a top 25% position in the S&P 500 for shorter-term health. For reference, in the middle of its early summer advance, it reached a top 5% score.EBay’s primary technical positives are pictured below. The Accumulation/Distribution Line [ADL], Negative Volume Index [NVI] and On Balance Volume [OBV] indicators continue to zig-zag higher in a very desirable pattern move. The purple circle marks the breakout to multi-year price highs, and the timing of my first bullish article on the stock.ADL measures intraday buying trends, marked with the green arrow. When the stock closes each day nearer the high trade vs. the low of the session, the line is rising. NVI looks only at falling volume days vs. the previous session, marked with the red arrow. EBay’s NVI has been quite strong the last 12 months, an indication of material buying interest on slower news days. Lastly, OBV failed to confirm the March swoon in price as having long-term significance, holding above the April 2019 low value (likewise with the NVI). The overly-powerful OBV uptrend since the pandemic fear-trade bottom is also noteworthy, marked with the blue arrow.EBay holds exceptional upfront value for new investment. A well-placed business model during the pandemic, industry-leading operating margins and returns, and the resumption of above-average business growth each argue for investor research attention. The upside story in the stock is basically a function of investors realizing the mispriced nature of the stock vs. ultra-bullish underlying business trends.To illustrate the lack of investor/advisor focus on eBay’s successful transition into a more profitable, more robust growth story, take a look at Seeking Alpha’s comparison of slow-to-thaw author ratings and Wall Street analyst views of the business below. The eBay of 2021 is a far more productive animal than existed in 2018. While the SA Quant rating is super-constructive based on momentum trading, earnings revisions, and fundamental research data, “people” making the buy and sell decisions have not yet fully appreciated the eBay turn in operations. My read of the situation is plenty of buy capital could move into the stock soon and provide a foundation for future price advances into 2021-22.Starboard Value sold the majority of its position last quarter. This fund was one of the main instigators of the restructuring effort, an activist investor by trade. (In January 2019, Elliott Management pushed for the restructuring today almost completed, and still holds a considerable stake of $500 million invested.) Exactly why Starboard managers would liquidate most of their shares in the $50s, with the stock about to double in price again, is above my pay grade. I think the fund will regret this decision as the coronavirus pandemic has permanently changed consumer purchasing behavior in favor of the online retail model. With eBay’s leading used goods, collectible resale, and hard-to-find item retail position, the outlook for the brand’s earnings stream is uniquely strong, if the U.S. economy finds it difficult to recover in coming years.In my mind at least, eBay should be valued at a similar if not higher, premium growth multiple vs. competitors on sales, cash flow and profits. Given today’s large discount on various financial metrics, enormous upside is inherent in the $52 share price. If the company continues to report solid earnings and sales growth beats, turbo-charged buying enthusiasm should propel the equity price significantly higher. Revenues per share grew +44% in Q2 vs. the previous year’s results and diluted EPS jumped +120%, as the restructuring hit its full stride. In comparison, results for the S&P 500 on sales and income DECLINED in the June quarter during peak pandemic economic shutdowns.I believe a reasonable target of $75-100 a share in 18-24 months is in the cards, even given a prolonged global recession through 2021-22. Revenues are rising smartly and the appeal of its online retail selling proposition is hard to ignore during the rise of smartphone commerce (mobile gadget buy orders represented 65% of sales in Q2) and appearance of entrenched ship-to-home, consumer demand trends. My plan is to continue purchasing shares if the price slides under $50 in another general U.S. stock market wave of selling.In a relative sense to the overall stock market's gyrations this year, eBay's buy point today may be just as bullish as the March panic lows. I don't think prices around (or under) $50 will persist very long. This investment idea checks off most every box for the correct risk/reward timing of a buy. Growth at a Reasonable Price [GARP] calculations, PEG ideas, relative valuations, leading margins and technologies, low upfront cost vs. earnings/cash flows, positive technical momentum, a contrarian slant (unloved security), and rising demographic trends all point to a nice stock quote increase sooner or later.The biggest risk to the purchase is a macro economic event or stock market crash that lowers the pricing of all U.S. equities. While the odds of such an event are quite high the next six months, I believe eBay is in a special position to survive a double-dip recession or market scare, then bounce back quickly.P.S. The Adevinta stake is already worth $3 billion more than when the Classifieds deal was announced seven weeks ago, approaching $10 billion in worth vs. eBay's entire market capitalization around $36 billion at $52 a share. After this deal is completed, eBay's falling stock price in August-September may look like an even greater steal for investors, in retrospect.Thanks for reading.

4360006,25120,2020-07-22T16:24:35-04:00,"eBay is selling its Classified business, a deal long anticipated and welcomed by the market.The price tag looks a bit soft, and while the remaining ownership structure does not make the situation ""cleaner,"" the deal looks very reasonable.Investors react with a small sell-off yet this follows shares having more than doubled since the COVID-19 lows, with a lot of momentum baked into the share price.","eBay (EBAY) has seen a rare correction in its share price these days after a much rumored and anticipated sale of the so-called ''Classifieds Group'' has finally taken place, as investors might have hoped for a higher price tag, or a ""simpler"" sale. The deal seems fair yet investors act with some caution as the overall valuation has gotten quite a boost following COVID-19, with investors perhaps extrapolating current momentum a bit too much, at least too much for me.eBay has reached a deal with Adevinta ASA (OTCPK:ADEVF), a Norwegian company, to sell its Classifieds business in a deal valued at $9.2 billion. The price tag sounds somewhat in line with expectations, after activist investor Elliott placed a value of $8-12 billion on the activities.While the price came in just below the midpoint of that, investors might be somewhat disappointed with the deal structure. eBay will only receive $2.5 billion in cash and will furthermore be granted 540 million shares of Adevinta, giving it a 44% equity stake in that business. That $6.7 billion equity stake is actually interesting as shares of Adevinta rallied 27% on the back of the news. This rally alone added about $1.8 billion to the valuation, bringing the total deal value to $11 billion at this point in time.Perhaps not well known to many yet, Adevinta is a classified specialist with operations across 15 countries and across 35 products/websites. After combining the operations, the combined company expects to realize $150-$185 million in annual synergies within three years from now.My last thesis on eBay dates back late November of last year after it sold StubHub in a $4 billion cash deal. That deal was driven by the pressure initiated by activist investor Elliot Management which tried to unlock value in eBay after it had been a big laggard for quite a while. As revenues of that business came in at just $1.1 billion in 2018, which was combined with very modest growth, the valuation looked quite full.Following that deal, I pegged a net cash position at $800 million. While that assumed no tax event as a result of the deal, the conclusion that eBay would have a flattish net cash position seemed about fair.Shares traded around $35 in November with 837 million shares translating into a $29 billion equity valuation, or about the same valuation on an enterprise basis following the deal. With the company guiding for full-year sales around $10.75 billion and earnings around $2.75 per share, it was easy to conclude that valuations were very reasonable at around 3 times sales and around 13 times earnings, non-compelling multiples even if operations report flattish results. Of course, earnings were a bit lower if we adjust for stock-based compensation expenses, as I pegged realistic earnings around $2.20 per share, for a 16 times realistic multiple.That stance might have been a little cautious. The company had a flat net cash position and traded around 16 times earnings; all comforting factors, certainly with activist investors onboard. The negative was of course the fact that the company was not really growing, although more good news would arrive as Elliott was pushing for the sale of the Classifieds business with a midpoint valuation around $10 billion. That is quite substantial, equal to $11-12 per share, representing about a third of the valuation at the time.While I saw potential, I noted that a neutral to slightly bullish stance would be warranted, as the risk-reward was not great enough to jump onboard.Since November, shares were trading around the $35 mark for quite some time, essentially until early to mid-March. Shares fell to $26 during the COVID-19 crisis but have ever since enjoyed the play-at-home rally. Shares nearly hit the $60 mark in mid-July, now selling off $2 to $56 and change on the back of the announcement of the sale of the Classifieds business.No exciting news has been announced in the meantime, until very recently. Early 2020, the company reported 2019 results in line with expectations, closed on the sale of StubHub and provided the market with an update that the Classifieds business would be sold by mid-year (all ahead of COVID-19) as the company fortunately managed to pull this off.The first-quarter results (as released in April) showed little of an impact of COVID-19 with revenues down 2% on a reported basis and up a percent adjusted for currencies. The company maintained the guidance for the year, with sales seen around $9.66 billion and non-GAAP earnings seen at a midpoint of $3.05 per share as the company rapidly built up a net debt load around $3.2 billion. This came after eBay spent $4.0 billion on buybacks in the first quarter when it acquired 98 million shares at essentially an average around $41 per share. This has shrunk the share base to 757 million shares, a significant reduction from the year before.Trading at $57 at the moment, these shares are valued at $43.1 billion with an enterprise value above $46 billion, which includes now the $9.2 billion sale of Classifieds. As mentioned above, shares fell about 3-4% upon the deal announcement, translating into $1.5 billion in value going up into smoke, and that is despite the fact that the Classifieds business is essentially valued at $11 billion following the move in the acquirer's shares.The reason for the multiple inflation is that shares have more than doubled from the COVID-19 lows and are up around 60% from the pre-COVID-19 levels as the business is thriving in this environment. Early June, the company provided an update for the second quarter. The company now sees volume growth around 23-26% for the second quarter, perhaps as consumers across the globe find time to clean up the house and sell stuff, while others have used the situation to buy lots of stuff. While volumes are up sharply, revenues are only seen up around 14% or about $340 million in actual sales growth. The great thing is the leverage on the bottom line with earnings per share expected to see a boost of $0.27 per share, equal to about $200 million in actual dollar terms. This suggests that nearly every dollar of additional revenue is flowing through to the bottom line on a pre-tax basis.Of course, it can very much be questioned how sustainable this boom to the earnings is as I think investors might have a bit too much optimism baked into the share price as of late. Therefore, the negative reaction to the sale of the Classifieds business should be seen in that light. In the absence of COVID-19, multiples would have expanded from about 15-16 times to levels in the low-twenties, assuming that the current earnings momentum might not be extrapolated into the future. As activist investors have pressured the company to make the ""easy"" moves already, and the remaining core business is not really thriving either, I would be quite cautious here."
4375158,104171,2020-09-18T13:26:31-04:00,"eBay is a founder of the online marketplace space.The company has divested StubHub and Classifieds segments.This leaves just the Marketplace segment, which has seen solid results over the past years.At this valuation, I am interested in the company.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is recognized as one of the founding innovative businesses of the modern day internet landscape. The online marketplace that eBay created back in 1995 has continued to offer buyers and sellers a reliable platform to do transactions on. Since then, eBay has expanded by purchasing StubHub and expanding the Classifieds segment. This leaves the company with just the Marketplace segment, which has seen solid results and is a high-margin segment. At the current valuation, I may add eBay to my portfolio.eBay, as many large companies do, is always reviewing the assets they own. In November 2019, the company decided to sell StubHub for $4.05 billion in cash to viagogo. Then in July 2020, eBay announced the sale of the Classifieds segment for $2.5 billion in cash and 540 million shares of buyer Adevinta. Thus the company's leftover consists of just the Marketplace segment. Marketplace is really the core business that eBay has made its namesake on. Therefore the purpose of this article is to take a look into eBay's Marketplace segment to see what can be expected in the future financials.The Marketplace platform is focused on finding the best choice for buyers to attract and retain seller/brands. This segment makes money from the fees collected on closed sales as well as marketing. eBay is always exploring and creating new tools/features that provide a better buyer/seller experience. It has done so through tools that help buyers time purchases for the best pricing and through enhancing data and analytics for sellers. There is a reason that Marketplace has survived for 25 years.FY 2019 FinancialsIn 2019, eBay as a total posted revenue of $10.8 billion, $8.638 billion of which was from the Marketplace segment. Marketplace saw transaction revenue at $7.578 billion (+2%) and marketing revenue at $1.06 billion (-13%). This is about flat compared to 2018. Gross merchandise volume (GMV), the amount of closed transaction whether consummated or not, for 2019 was 85.510 billion, down 5%. The take rate, the percent of action taken on offers, was 8.86% for the year, which was up 61 basis points. This is how the core business looks like without StubHub and Classifieds. Operating income for Marketplace was $2.814 billion, a margin of 32.58%.Q1 & Q2 2020Q1 & Q2 2020 saw eBay post some great results. During the first quarter, the sale for StubHub was completed, therefore leaving just the Marketplace and Classifieds operations for the last month. Marketplace saw net transaction revenue at $1.9 billion (+1%) and marketing revenue at $230 million (-17%), totaling to $2.13 billion for the quarter. This was a decrease in total revenue for the segment of 1.48%. The GMV for Q1 was down 1.1% to 21.259 billion and the take rate was 8.93%, up 19 basis points. Operating income for Marketplace was $761 million for a margin of 35.73%.Q2 was a really great quarter due to increased e-commerce as a result of the pandemic. Marketplace net transaction revenue was $2.447 billion (+30%) and marketing revenue was $221 million (-18%). This totaled to revenue of $2.668 billion, which was up 23.69%. GMV grew by 26% in the quarter to 27.135 billion, while the take rate increased 24 basis points to 9.02%. Operating income for the quarter was $1.067 billion for a margin of 40%.For the total six months, revenue for the whole Marketplace segment was $4.798 billion, an increase of 11.09%. This was on the back of 15% growth in net transaction revenue and a decline of 17% in marketing revenue. The six-month GMV was 48.394 billion, up 12% helped by strong e-commerce demand. The take rate was 8.98%, an increase of 22 basis points. This resulted in operating income of $1.828 billion for a margin of 38.1%.TrendsSource: SEC 10-KsThe above charts show the important, long-term metrics for eBay Marketplace. What can be seen is that net transaction revenue has increased every year. The CAGR for the past five years for net transaction revenue is 4.42%. Looking to the second chart shows that GMV has been somewhat variable. From 2016 to 2018, gross merchandise volume has been very solid, but in 2019, this changed. Preferably one would like to see consistent GMV growth as it means that more sellers are attracted to Marketplace. Overall, the GMV increased 10% for the last five years. The real reason net transaction revenue has been able to grow every year, even when GMV is down, is due take rate increases. The overall take rate has increased by 40 basis points since 2015. This means that more buying has taken place on Marketplace postings and is now at a rate of 8.86%. The operating income for the Marketplace segment has historically been around 31-32%. For 2020 the trend is clear; with more e-commerce, it seems that both GMV and take rate will be higher. This should result in a great year-end.As of the most recent quarter, eBay has a current ratio of 1.58x, which is very solid liquidity. The debt to equity is somewhat high at 5.90x, but times interest earned using just Marketplace operating income is 24.68x. Therefore there is not much concern in managing this debt. Along with that, the sale of Classifieds segment hasn't closed out yet, so $2.5 billion in cash has yet to be received. Overall, in the future, the company will be leaner than it is right now even though it is currently in good financial standing.As of writing, the current price for a share of eBay is around $49. Therefore, using 2019 EPS of $2.10, the stock is trading at a P/E of 23.33x. Using the high forecast EPS for 2020 of $3.70, the P/E is 13.24x. Using just operating income per share from the Marketplace segment of $2.44, the multiple is 20.1x. The book value and net tangible asset per share are $3.95 and $20.50 each, meaning the stock is trading at 12.41x and 2.39x. Overall, I think this is a rather fair valuation.eBay is one of the founders of the internet marketplace. The company has recently decided to focus on just that, Marketplace. With the sale of StubHub and the Classifieds segment, Marketplace will be the only part left of the company. Marketplace has seen some solid results in 2019 and has been doing great in the past two quarters due to strong e-commerce demand. The long-term trends show that eBay has been able to increase purchases and increase volume on the Marketplace platform. With good financial standing, solid past performance, high margins on the Marketplace segment, and trading at a fair valuation, I'm interested."
4359876,69675,2020-07-22T10:25:22-04:00,The management team at eBay struck a deal to sell off its Classifieds segment to Adevinta.This deal allows eBay to leave the business in the hands of another experienced operator and gives it a large ownership stake over that enterprise.Synergies have the potential to create significant value for shareholders long term.,"On July 21st, news broke that eBay (EBAY) had elected to sell off a segment of its company that it calls Classifieds. The reality is a little more complex than that, with the transaction generating cash for the online marketplace while simultaneously grabbing for the company an almost half ownership of Adevinta ASA (OTCPK:ADEVF), an international classifieds specialist. In all, this move appears like a reasonable one for eBay, though the market clearly seems to think that Adevinta is walking away a winner while eBay is getting the short end of the stick. In truth, eBay seems to be doing just fine in this deal as well, and investors should applaud management's creative thinking and financial engineering.The deal between eBay and Adevinta has been called a sale by eBay of its Classifieds segments. In reality, the picture is more complicated than that. In exchange for contributing its Classifieds business to Adevinta, eBay is slated to receive total consideration of $9.2 billion. This is split between $2.5 billion in cash and 540 million shares of Adevinta valued at about $6.65 billion on the day the transaction was announced. Shares of Adevinta ended up surging in response to the development, closing up 33.1% compared to where they closed at on July 20th. This move higher pushed the equity side of the transaction up to $8.85 billion, pushing the entire deal up to $11.35 billion. Either way, upon completion of the transaction, investors in eBay will end up with a 44% ownership stake in the business and a 33.3% voting stake in it. It's also worth noting that Schibsted, presently Adevinta's largest shareholder, agreed, after completion of the deal, to acquire the Danish Classifieds operations that are currently owned by eBay. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.eBay's Classifieds business is the smallest of its three segments, but it's incredibly vital to the company's success. The segment accounted for just 9.8% of the firm's revenue in 2019, with sales of $1.06 billion. This is up 18.3% compared to the $897 million the segment generated a year earlier. Over the same three-year window, the segment's operating profit soared 33.8% from $314 million to $420 million. This works out to about 12.5% of the firm's overall operating income before factoring in corporate costs. The operating margin of Classifieds is a healthy 39.6%. This compares to the 32.6% margin for the firm's Marketplace segment and it's well-above the 12.4% segment reported by the company's StubHub business.Adevinta is no pushover either. Using current exchange rates and bearing in mind that there are fundamental differences between IFRS and GAAP reporting, revenue for Adevinta totaled $853 million last year. This is up from $743 million a year earlier. EBITDA for the segment over this two-year period rose from $180 million to $238 million, while operating cash flow grew from $85 million to $155 million. With its 1.5 billion in average monthly visits and 4,700 employees, Adevinta is a sizable player in this market. The company has 35 digital products and websites, with operations across 15 countries. eBay has some overlap, with 12 brands in 13 countries, but combined the firm will touch 20 countries with the Classifieds business.Because this transaction is all-stock in nature, it increases the probability of synergies being realized from some internal restructuring. Getting rid of duplicative operations and increasing supplier power might help to lower costs. In all, management expects synergies to form over the first three years following the deal's completion. If all goes according to plan, annual run-rate synergies of between $150 million and $185 million will eventually be realized. I don't like assuming that these will actually come to fruition, but they could end up creating real value if management is accurate.There are different ways to look at this transaction to see if it makes sense. I like to use the simplest. While some investors might look at the $9.2 billion in consideration and compare that to the $420 million operating cash flow associated with Classifieds to get a multiple of 21.9, I prefer a more integrated method. After all, this isn't an outright sale. eBay is getting cash, but it's also getting stock that now includes the very company it is giving up. First, let's look at this without synergies.Without synergies included, eBay is contributing a company with $420 million in operating cash flow to a firm with operating cash flow of $155 million. This works out to $575 million. 44% of the economic interest in this combined entity belongs to eBay. That's $253 million. If we take that out from the $420 million contributed by eBay, we get $167 million. The $253 million evens out with the $420 million from the contributed Classifieds business and, in a way, eBay is receiving $2.5 billion in exchange for the $167 million in cash flow it's giving up moving forward. That works out to a multiple of about 15 that eBay should receive.The other way to do this is by factoring in synergies. At the mid-point, these should be $167.5 million. Added to the $575 million, this gives us $742.5 million. 44% of that works out to $326.7 million, with the difference from what eBay contributed and what it's receiving from its ownership in Adevinta being $93.3 million. This implies a trading multiple of closer to 26.8 that the company is receiving. If the non-synergy piece of the deal was decent, this is appealing.It is important to say that this analysis isn't perfect. No analysis is. With more information, like the EBITDA generated by eBay's Classified segment, we could do the same kind of assessment utilizing an EV/EBITDA approach. This would be interesting since Adevinta's capital structure must change to accommodate the cash payment. Even so, it seems improbable that the details would change enough to warrant a revision to this analysis.Based on the data provided, it looks a lot like eBay has made a pretty reasonable decision here. Investors appear to think that Adevinta is walking away with the best end of the transaction, but I would argue that their end to it isn't much better than eBay's. Surely, there appears to be no loser from this move and investors on both sides should be happy with this maneuver."
4362003,103480,2020-07-30T09:30:00-04:00,"Shares of eBay pulled back ~4% after reporting highly-anticipated second-quarter results.The company saw constant-currency GMV growth shoot up to 29% y/y in Q2, after being negative for most of 2019.This was largely expected, however. eBay had already commented on strong April results back when it reported Q1.eBay's guidance for Q3 calls for marketplace volumes to moderate to the high teens, indicating that the majority of the coronavirus bumps were temporary.Shares look fairly valued at ~15x forward P/E.","Out of left field this year, eBay (EBAY) came roaring back with a vengeance. Most investors had left this stock for dead as eBay struggled for relevance with a marketplace business that was quickly fading in Amazon's (AMZN) shadow, while it struggled to unload a Classifieds business (aka, a Craigslist competitor) that it only just now managed to splinter off for just north of $9 billion.But then, the coronavirus came along and injected new life into eBay, sending its core marketplace business into double-digit GMV growth rates after sinking into decay for much of 2019. Shares of eBay were up more than 50% year-to-date (versus a flat S&P 500), its best stretch of outperformance in recent memory. But after reporting Q2 results, eBay shares pulled back ~3% in after-hours trading after already falling ~2% in the regular session - signaling that the eBay rally may be losing steam.Data by YChartsI put eBay in a category of internet businesses for whom coronavirus has made relevant again - but only temporarily. But the main question we were concerned about heading into Q2 was: how much of its growth kick is sustainable? Because if the coronavirus only produced short-term lifts without really changing eBay's growth trajectory, then there really is no justification for the stock's ~50% richer valuation. After all, shares (at least theoretically) should be valued as the sum of all future earnings, not just a good few quarters in the near term.The bottom line on eBay: I find very little permanence in eBay's strong Q2 results, and I remain neutral on this stock. While investors' enthusiasm for e-commerce names and the novelty of being in double-digit growth territory will still keep eBay floating for a while, I don't think there's much further upside in this stock. Continue to stay on the sidelines here until prices erode further.Let's now dive into eBay's most recent results in greater detail. In particular, let's zoom into eBay's key customer and GMV metrics.On the bright side is eBay's count of active buyers. The company added 8 million net-new buyers in the second quarter, after being flat for many quarters. Wall Street, meanwhile, had only hoped for 181.5 million active buyers, meaning that the company exceeded net adds by about 0.5 million (~6%).Figure 1. eBay active buyer trendsSource: eBay Q2 earnings deckA bigger base of buyers, plus a more engaged user base, of course, led to vastly expanded gross merchandise value (GMV, the dollar sum of all the sales on eBay's platform).As seen in the chart below, eBay's GM soared to $27.14 billion this quarter, up 26% y/y on an as-reported basis and 29% y/y when stripping out the impacts of currency fluctuations. Even better is the fact that the U.S. - which had been dragging in the high-single digit declines for most of last year - was the strongest-performing region with sales up 35% y/y.Figure 2. eBay GMV trendsSource: eBay Q2 earnings deckThere's no doubt that these trends were strong - but to play devil's advocate, they were largely already expected (hence the reason why shares sold off in the post-earnings reaction). Recall that when eBay announced Q1 results at the tail end of April, it already commented that April GMV was shaping up to >20% y/y growth. Knowing that that the lockdowns only worsened in May and June, and seeing the read-through from other e-commerce companies' results and commentary through that time period, we already knew that eBay would see tremendous >20% y/y growth in Q2.The major question that investors need clarity on, however, is how much of this growth can sustain into Q3 and beyond. That question, in my view, is already partially answered by eBay's third-quarter guidance:Figure 3. eBay guidance updateSource: eBay Q2 earnings deckAlongside a deceleration to 13-16% y/y revenue growth (versus 18% y/y this quarter), the company has guided to marketplace volumes in the high teens - implying at least ten points of deceleration versus Q2 levels. CFO Andy Cring's commentary around the linearity of the coronavirus bump also suggests that the company expects buying/selling activity on eBay cool off, though, through July, trends have remained strong. On the Q2 earnings call, his tone is one of caution (key points highlighted):Aside from a general shift out of e-commerce when lockdowns lift, one additional reason for decelerating growth in the post-coronavirus era is that many people turned to sites like eBay for pandemic-related odds and ends. Consider the fact that Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) reported that 17% of its April GMS (the Etsy equivalent of GMV) was made up of masks alone and was a major contributor to its GMS acceleration.We don't have any of this kind of data reporting from eBay, but eBay stocks all kinds of pandemic-related goods, including masks, hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes - you name it. These are not sales we can count on to recur. So, the key message here is: don't just look at eBay's fantastic GMV growth in Q2 and assume that the business has achieved a new growth baseline.Right now, eBay's share price of ~$55 implies a 15x forward P/E ratio based on Wall Street's FY21 expected EPS of $3.81 (per Yahoo Finance), for a trailing P/E of 16.9x based on trailing twelve months EPS of $3.25.That's what I'd call a fair, on-par-with-market multiple. For eBay to justify a significantly richer valuation, it has to demonstrate growth - more specifically, that it can grow GMV at the ~20% pace at which it has grown post-coronavirus (or even ~10%). But in all likelihood - and consistent with management's own commentary - we're likely to see growth moderate to the mid/low teens through the remainder of FY20, and once we get into FY21 and start comping against a tough FY20, eBay is likely to sink back to negative growth territory.This is not a business, in my view, that can continue rallying and sustain a valuation substantially beyond where it's trading today. The coronavirus has made eBay temporarily look like a growth stock, but when the dust settles on 2020, eBay will still be battling for relevance against the increasing dominance of Amazon. Steer clear here."
4355114,105689,2020-06-23T03:01:55-04:00,"After the carve out of StubHub and the likely sale of its Classifieds segment, eBay shares are valued at $63 (mid-point sales price scenario).I use a multiple-based sum-of-the-parts approach to derive the price target while considering a 100% consideration in cash for eBay's classifieds unit.Transaction proceeds are likely to be distributed to shareholders via dividends and/or buybacks.Becoming a pure-play marketplace business might position eBay as an acquisition target itself.","Using a multiple-based SOTP approach, the shares of eBay (EBAY) appear to offer an upside potential of 30% (based on the closing price as of June 19, 2020), factoring in a successful sale of its Classifieds unit (negotiations are currently ongoing) for 100% cash consideration. My medium price target is at $63 per share.""We believe that eBay Classifieds Group represents $8-$12 billion of value"", concluded activist investor Elliott Management Corporation (Elliott) on January 22, 2019 in a letter addressed to eBay's Executive Board (businesswire.com). At that time, eBay shares traded at $31.00 (close price the day before the release of the letter), while Elliott indicated a value of $55-$63+ per share (implied upside potential of 77-103%). Actually, Elliott suggested a pretty concrete five-step plan to realize this value-creation opportunity centered around a comprehensive portfolio review:Today, roughly 18 months later, eBay's ticket marketplace StubHub has already been sold to Viagogo for $4.1 billion (Bloomberg), while its Classifieds unit is in the middle of a sale process. According to rumors, the bidders are Prosus (PROSY)/Naspers (NPSNY), Adevinta (MKPEF)/Schibsted (SBSNF) (both strategic investors) and a consortium consisting of various private equity companies (Hellman & Friedman, Blackstone and Permira, among others). In my first analysis of the deal, I dug deeper into the question of who is potentially the more suited long-term holder of eBay’s Classifieds business.If everything goes as envisaged, then eBay will solely consist of its Marketplace segment. According to the company’s Form 10-Q, “Marketplace includes our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com, its localized counterparts and the eBay suite of mobile apps”.Using a quick and dirty multiple-based SOTP approach, I obtain the following output:To derive the current trading multiples of the Marketplace segment I use the peer group suggested in the company's Form 10-Q. Data from Bloomberg as of June 19, 2020 are shown below. Adjusted for outliers, the average EV/EBIT multiple stands at 22.8x. Next, I apply this multiple to the Marketplace operating income over the trailing twelve months (TTM) as of 1Q20.At eBay, corporate costs run through a non-operating segment. I use a pro rata approach (TTM per 1Q20) to proxy the costs of the Marketplace segment standalone. Usually, the multiple on operating income (which normally is negative) for a corporate costs segment is calculated as weighted average over the multiples of the operating segments. However, as I assume that the Classifieds sale will be successful (and the StubHub segment already sold), the multiple on costs is the same as for the Marketplace segment.The main drivers behind eBay's valuation are both the EBIT multiple for its remaining operations and the sales price for its Classifieds segment. Plugging both variables into a sensitivity table, price targets are obtained as below. The intrinsic share value is $63.02 at the current trading multiple and the mid-point of Elliott's valuation of eBay's Classifieds segment.With regard to StubHub, Elliott's valuation estimate of $3.5-4.5 billion, as indicated in its letter, has been proven to be quite accurate. Therefore, it seems reasonable to build my model around the mid-point of Elliott's valuation for eBay's Classifieds unit.Considering that there are several parties interested in this potentially once-in-a-lifetime opportunity might help the seller to drive up the sales price.There is one major shortcoming worth mentioning. In my approach, the proceeds from the StubHub transaction ($4.1 billion) are not fully reflected. I have taken the cash and cash equivalents item from the balance sheet ($880 million), however, it appears that the company's management includes non-equity investments in its cash position to calculate net debt. My understanding is that the StubHub proceeds are included herein (at least partly). According to this methodology, the cash item stood at $5.2 billion per March 31, 2020. This basically means that my approach underestimates the net cash adjustment.Against the background that the deal has a good chance of going through, eBay shares are currently significantly undervalued. The upside potential in share price of up to 30% primarily originates from two aspects: (i) the holding discount which eBay is/was suffering is disappearing with the sales of StubHub and the Classifieds segment, and (ii) for capital markets, it is much easier to attribute value to pure cash than to business operations.If eBay is able to close the sale of its Classifieds segment successfully, the company would become a pure-play marketplace business. As Elliott outlined in its letter this would convert eBay into a potential acquisition target itself:In my opinion, the transaction proceeds are very likely to be distributed to shareholders via (special) dividends and/or share buybacks. Probably, Elliott would rather push for a dividend payment to see its investment case materialized sooner than later.In a nutshell: Firstly, in the short run, investors can bet on a successful sale which most likely will translate into a (sharp) share price increase. Secondly, depending on the means chosen by the management to distribute transaction proceeds to shareholders, short- and medium-term horizons are required. And thirdly, the transaction scenario (eBay as a target) represents another investment case alternative for medium- to long-run oriented investors."
4357694,20715,2020-07-09T11:51:20-04:00,eBay is up 125% off its March low and it has moved above potential resistance.Earnings are expected to increase by 54% compared to Q2 2019.Sentiment toward the stock is mixed with analysts being surprisingly pessimistic.,"Editor's Note: On 7/15/2020, company management reached out to SA and clarified that its official earnings announcement will occur on July 28 at 2PM PT. The article's original text has not been amended. Ever since the pandemic started, we have heard about certain companies that could benefit from people working and shopping from home. There were the obvious ones like Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) with its video conferencing technology, and of course Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as consumers had to shift their shopping habits and the online retailer benefitted. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) seemed to fly below the radar, at least I never saw it mentioned in any articles, when it came to discussing companies that could benefit from a work-from-home economy.In the meantime, all eBay has done is jump 125% from its March low. The internet retailer dropped to $25.93 in March and it is now trading north of $58.00. That is an incredible run in less than four months. You can see the incredible run on the weekly chart below.The severity of the rally and the slope are incredible. The stock didn’t slow down at all when it approached the $40-$45 range. This area had provided resistance in 2018 and 2019, but the stock blew right through the potential resistance.Thanks to the rally, the weekly overbought/oversold indicators are at tremendously overbought levels right now. The 10-week RSI is the highest it has been since the fourth quarter of 2010. The monthly chart shows that the 10-Month RSI is the highest it has been since 2012.The overbought levels on the weekly and monthly charts are a bit of a concern at this time, but the momentum is definitely to the upside.eBay is set to report second quarter earnings results at some point in the next few weeks. Investor’s Business Daily has the results coming out on July 17, the Wall Street Journal has them coming out on July 15, and Stocksearning.com has the results confirmed for July 15, before the market open. There wasn’t a confirmed date on eBay’s own investor relations page.Regardless of when they come out, analysts have ratcheted up their consensus estimate considerably over the last three months. The current consensus estimate is for earnings per share of $1.05 and 90 days ago, the estimate was for EPS of $0.70. That is a 50% increase in the estimate and it is 54.4% higher than the $0.68 the company reported in the second quarter of last year. eBay has seen earnings grow at a rate of 17% per year over the last three years and they grew by 18% in the first quarter.Revenue is expected to come in at $2.79 billion and that would mark an increase of 3.9% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Revenue has increased by an average of 5% per year over the last three years, but it was down 2% in the first quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2019.For 2020 as a whole, earnings are expected to increase by 21% while revenue is expected to decline by 3.6%. I wouldn’t be surprised if the company ends up seeing a revenue increase for the year.Like many companies, eBay has been able to increase EPS due to a share buyback program, but in this case, the management efficiency measurements have helped the company. The return on equity is well above average at 52.5% and the profit margin is at 26.1%.With the huge run-up in the stock price, you might think that eBay’s valuations would be off the charts, but in fact, the trailing P/E ratio is only at 25 and the forward P/E is just under 17.Given eBay’s solid fundamentals and its huge rally, I expected to see sentiment indicators that were skewed to the bullish side, but only one of the three I look at was showing signs of optimism. The put/call ratio is at 0.724 with 125,426 puts open and 173,125 calls open at this time. The ratio was at 0.76 back in April when the company last reported earnings, so it’s still in the same range.Analysts are surprisingly reserved toward eBay at this time. There are 33 analysts covering the stock and only 14 have the stock rated as a “buy.” There are 17 “hold” ratings and there are two “sell” ratings. This gives us a buy percentage of 42.4% and that is well below the average stock’s buy percentage.The short interest ratio is at 2.47 currently and that is in the average range, slightly below maybe, but not enough to worry about. The ratio was considerably higher at the beginning of the year, but the short interest has declined and the average daily trading volume has nearly doubled.Overall I would give the sentiment a neutral reading and that’s okay. Sentiment analysis means the most when it is extremely skewed to one side or the other. When all three of these indicators are showing extreme bullish readings, that is usually a time to be concerned as it means that expectations are high and one misstep can send the stock reeling. Conversely, if all three sentiment indicators are extremely bearish, any positive news can send the stock soaring.The rally eBay has experienced in the last three and a half months has been incredible. There is no way I would step in front of the upward momentum and suggest a bearish play at this point in time. On the other hand, I am reluctant to suggest jumping into a bullish trade at this time. Obviously, if you are already holding eBay, congratulations and I would suggest holding on to the stock. Depending on where you bought the stock, I would suggest taking some action to protect your gains - maybe buying some out of the money puts as insurance.I like eBay’s fundamentals and I like the fact that the sentiment isn’t over-the-top bullish. But there are two areas where I am concerned. First, the way analysts have ratcheted up the EPS estimate over the last few months suggests that expectations are extremely high. When this happens, even if the company beats the estimate, it can lead to disappointment and a quick move to the downside.My second area of concern is the overbought levels on the weekly and monthly charts. When you start talking about readings from the indicators that haven’t been seen in eight and 10 years, it gives me reason for concern. Personally, I have always had trouble adding a stock when the oscillators are at extreme highs, but I know other traders that have no problem with such a scenario.Looking at the last eight earnings reports, eBay has beaten estimates in all eight of them. Unfortunately, it hasn’t always led to jumps in the stock. In fact, there have been two instances where the stock gapped lower, two where it gapped higher, and it had little impact in the other four quarters.Right now, the earnings bar seems to be pretty high and I’m not just talking about the analyst estimates. Given the huge run-up in the last few months, I think investors are expecting a blowout quarter and that could be setting the stock up for drop after the report. If that is the case, I will be looking for a potential entry point - ideally down around the $45 area, but I think anything under $50 would be good."
4355719,22148,2020-06-25T16:49:02-04:00,eBay is getting multiple boosts from transitioning the business to support small businesses and the surge in online sales from COVID-19.New CEO Jamie Iannone is a potential game changer.The company wisely bought $4 billion worth of stock at lower prices in Q1.The stock is cheap at 13x '21 EPS estimates with upside potential.,"The online marketplace entered the coronavirus crisis as a slow growing retailer stuck below $40, and now, eBay (EBAY) is poised to break out above $50. Amazingly, the stock is at all-time highs despite years of failure after spinning off PayPal (PYPL). The potential sale of Classifieds is a catalyst for my bullish investment thesis, but the big play is the company finally making a digital transformation with small business sellers unlocking value in the stock.Image Source: eBay websiteSince the start of the virus crisis, eBay has made an apparent remarkable digital transformation. The company hired the COO of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) eCommerce as the new CEO and ramped up the Up & Running program for small businesses.The result, as of June 4, was an astonishing boost to Q2 numbers for the period ending next week. Investors should note that eBay had originally provided quarterly guidance on April 29. This investor update was only slightly over a month after the original guidance and the virus had already rampaged the economy and forced consumers online far before the Q1 earnings report and forward guidance for this quarter.Source: eBay 8-KeBay is guiding to GMV values up 23% to 26% with demand driven by increased organic traffic and better marketing efficiency. In addition, the platform has added 6 million new and reactivated buyers along with adding tens of thousands of small business sellers.The hiring of Jamie Iannone on April 13 as CEO effective April 27 has already had profound benefits. The company dramatically hiked current quarter revenue guidance by 14 percentage points with currency-neutral revenues targeted to grow at an 18% clip. Just as important, EPS is set to surge to $1.04, up over 50% from last year.The big question is whether eBay is adding short-term buyers/sellers due to people shopping more online temporarily or whether the company has finally unlocked the holy grail of making the platform an independent shopping platform for small retailers unhappy with Amazon (AMZN) or Walmart.The recent meteoric rise of Shopify (SHOP) due to providing a leading commerce platform for retailers wanting to maintain a brand presence is a prime reason why a digital transformation at eBay holds so much promise. The company had failed to innovate beyond an online auctions marketplace, while Shopify has soared to a $110 billion market valuation.eBay is only worth $35 billion despite a larger quarterly revenue base than Shopify is forecast to generate in all of 2020. eBay is on pace for $2.75 billion in the current quarter, with Shopify only targeting $2.2 billion in sales this year.While stock buybacks were crucified during the market crash in March, one company making very timely buybacks was eBay. The company bought $4 billion worth of shares during the quarter due to funds from the StubHub sale. eBay bought 98 million shares for an average price just above $40.Over the last year, the company bought nearly $7.5 billion worth of shares at prices far below the current price near $50. With revenues soaring, the money was well spent.Data by YChartseBay is cheap here even at the highs near $50. Analysts have the company earning $3.50 to $4.00 per share over the next few years, and the digital transformation could easily boost EPS further. The stock has substantial upside from returning to revenue growth story.The biggest risk to the stock here is that all of the sales gains in the last few months completely roll back when the virus risks are gone. eBay traded below $40 before the virus started, so the risk is the stock returning to those levels, giving up at least $10 of the recent gains.The key investor takeaway is that eBay was an unlikely winner from the virus crisis. The big question is whether the company has finally unlocked digital sales growth or if this is only a temporary spike.The new CEO is very promising, making the stock a compelling hold here at 13x '21 EPS targets with catalysts from finally growing eCommerce sales and the potential sell of the Classifieds business."
4341978,103480,2020-05-01T12:09:44-04:00,"eBay shares have traded largely flat after reporting strong Q1 beats, with indications that trends have improved in March since the lockdowns began.Year-to-date, eBay's ~10% gains have beaten the overall market, but pales in comparison to Amazon's gains.The question is if higher revenue growth can be sustained once the shutdowns subside. Initial metrics are encouraging.eBay has taken a cautious stance to guidance, maintaining its outlook of flat revenue growth for Q2 and FY20.Upgrading eBay to neutral based on improving performance.","Heading into this year, nothing was going eBay's (EBAY) way. Growth had stalled as both buyers and sellers drifted to competing platforms, and talks to sell the company's Classifieds division had stalled. But then, the coronavirus struck - and what has become a nightmare for retail businesses has proven a boon to e-commerce players like eBay and Amazon (AMZN).eBay gave us its first look of how the coronavirus has impacted its business in reporting Q1 results. Despite beating Wall Street's expectations, shares of eBay have traded roughly flat since the announce; and though its year-to-date stock gains of just under 10% have outperformed the broader market, other e-commerce and remote-work stocks have soared much higher.Data by YChartsI have long been bearish on eBay, believing it to be dead in the water because of consistently slowing GMV growth and growing irrelevance in the e-commerce space. I acknowledge, however, that the stay-at-home ordinances and the fact that many people have little to do all day outside of online shopping and streaming TV may give eBay a much-needed jolt. The question remains to be seen if eBay can sustain this coronavirus-driven growth injection and grow its brand in the face of steep e-commerce competition - but with shares looking cheap at a ~13x forward P/E based on eBay's updated 2020 pro forma EPS guidance of $3.00-$3.05, I'd say eBay is worth a small gamble.I'm upgrading my outlook on eBay to neutral; investors should continue to monitor stock movements and fundamental performance as the year progresses.The most important update that eBay gave us in Q1 is that performance in its flagship Marketplace business has begun to turn around, thanks to the recent surge in online shopping that began to hit eBay in March. GMV has long been the number-one metric that investors focused on for eBay, and this was the first in many quarters that eBay's earnings release didn't spell out dire news - at least, relatively speaking. Take a look at the trends below:Figure 1. eBay GMV trendsSource: eBay Q1 investor presentationGMV trends accelerated in both the U.S. and worldwide. Though domestic GMV was still contracting at -4% y/y, it improved five points relative to a terrible -9% y/y showing in Q4; while international returned to +3% y/y growth. These GMV trends drove Q1 revenue of $2.37 billion (-2% y/y) - again, still negative, but substantially better than Wall Street's expectations of $2.32 billion (-4% y/y).But eBay's Q2 and beyond could look even better than Q1. In his prepared remarks on the Q1 earnings call, CFO Scott Schenkel noted that April GMV was trending closer to 20% y/y, far above the flat performance that eBay delivered in Q1.Management has noted that the surge in demand spanned a wide variety of categories, including: ""home offices, gym equipment, and indoor leisure activities like video games and consoles,"" whileOf course, the question is whether eBay's improved performance in March/April can be sustained into posterity. Is the sudden twenty-point improvement in eBay's recent performance a pull-in of future demand because people are bored and have no access to retail stores, or does it represent a turnaround in eBay's brand presence in the e-commerce landscape? Uncertainty on this question is what prevents me from being overly bullish.Nevertheless, there's a case to be made that eBay's current guidance is leaning to the conservative side. eBay's revenue growth has always tracked closely alongside GMV growth, but eBay's Q2 guidance seems to diverge from the recent April performance (perhaps suggesting management's reluctance to believe the boost is permanent). For Q2, eBay is guiding to an essentially flat revenue range of -2% to +2% y/y, with the low end of that range representing no improvement from Q1 despite the boost in April GMV.Figure 2. eBay Q2 guidance updateSource: eBay Q1 investor presentationFor the full year 2020, eBay again held its outlook at a flat -1% to +1% revenue range:Figure 3. eBay FY20 guidance updateSource: eBay Q1 investor presentationeBay's official statement on why the company was reluctant to move its outlook guideposts is as follows:However, even though eBay didn't increase its guidance, consensus actually called for eBay to slash it. Wall Street's consensus FY20 revenue was pegged at $9.51 billion, $50 million below the low end of eBay's stated range.We do like the fact that even without any revenue upside for FY20, eBay is still projecting strong 12-15% y/y EPS growth, making its ~13x forward P/E look rather benign. The fact that eBay cleaved off the troubled StubHub division for $4.05 billion to Viagogo has helped the company become leaner, with operating margins improving 190bps to 26.5% in Q1 on a GAAP basis. If eBay does manage to generate revenue growth coinciding with its recent double-digit April GMV growth rates, earnings growth could be substantially stronger.Investors in eBay have long thirsted for GMV growth, and the coronavirus/shelter-in-place orders may finally give eBay that long-needed boost. As of now, eBay is careful to flow forward its 20% y/y April GMV growth into its FY20 outlook - but the fact that eBay is projecting flat Q2 revenues is almost certainly over-conservative.Given that shares are cheap at ~13x forward P/E and haven't seen the enormous gains that other e-commerce stocks have seen this year, I believe eBay is worth a small bullish wager while we wait for further updates on a Marketplace turnaround."
4345715,105526,2020-05-10T11:49:23-04:00,"eBay posts a further decline in top-line trends for Q1 on weakness in Classifieds.eBay's guidance has not been revised downward, which could leave the stock vulnerable to a disappointment should the strong April trends falter.At 18x GAAP earnings, I would hold off on eBay shares.","Looking through eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) Marketplace strength in April, it remains unclear at this point the extent to which the growth pickup is sustainable. Instead, I find it hard to justify paying 18x GAAP P/E (13x non-GAAP P/E) for the stock considering its current focus on cost rationalization and aggressive share repurchases amid a limited growth outlook. My base case calls for eBay's gross merchandise value (GMV) weakness continuing at the core platform level, as competition within the e-commerce space ramps up, and eBay cedes share. The strategic review update around Classifieds could prove to be a positive, value-unlocking catalyst, but it is hard to see buyers paying up amid the current macro backdrop.eBay's Q1 performance reflected the ongoing weakness in its underlying business as revenues declined 1.6% YoY to $2.37 billion. Overall COVID-19's impact to revenues was minimal this time around, as the downside in the Classifieds top-line (-3% YoY) was offset by a relatively better performance at Marketplace (-1% YoY). Nonetheless, the fact that GMV is still on the decline (-1% YoY) is disappointing, especially in the US, where volumes fell 4% YoY.Source: Investor PresentationNon-GAAP EPS was higher at $0.77 (+15.6% YoY), though this was mainly attributable to a $4B buyback for the quarter. eBay now has $0.5 billion remaining of the $4.5 billion initially guided for 2020. On a pro-forma basis, net income declined by 3.6% YoY (vs. the 15.6% YoY increase in non-GAAP EPS).Source: Investor PresentationFor now, the 2020 full-year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance remains intact at $9.56 billion-$9.76 billion and $3.00-$3.10, respectively. Q2 guidance, on the other hand, stands at $2.38 billion-$2.48 billion and $0.73-$0.80 for revenue and non-GAAP EPS, respectively. The longer-term targets for advertising ($1 billion) and payments ($2 billion in revenue and $0.5 billion in profit by 2022) still stand, supporting the case for a 2%pt margin expansion by FY22.The biggest change was to FCF guidance, as the $1 billion cash tax payment associated with the StubHub sale is now set to be recorded in discontinued operations. The net effect is an increase in the FCF guidance to $2.1-$2.3 billion, up from the $1.1-$1.3 billion prior guidance.Source: Investor PresentationI would note that the guidance provided implies a 1-2% organic revenue growth for the second half of the year, consistent with the 1% YoY growth rate posted in Q4. In essence, I think this suggests that management views GMV growth returning to pre-COVID levels by the end of Q2, which could be feasible if the buyers acquired throughout the stay-at-home period remain on the platform. However, considering eBay has seen continued volume declines in recent quarters, I think current expectations might be a tad optimistic, leaving room for a disappointment ahead.Source: Company DataCOVID-19 has hit eBay particularly hard on Classifieds, with the Auto vertical bearing the brunt as dealer shutdowns and downsizing in ad budgets present meaningful headwinds, with fee relief from eBay further weighing on Classifieds revenue. Top-line numbers slowed 600bps sequentially as a result.Source: Investor PresentationUnsurprisingly, Classified revenue is expected to decrease significantly by 30%-40% in Q2. The positive, however, is that eBay remains in talks with multiple parties as part of its strategic review of the Classifieds business and is on track to provide an update by next quarter's earnings. I do not think COVID-19 headwinds should affect the long-term value of the Classifieds business, but the slowdown could impact strategic value or deal timing if it lingers or even worsens.I was positively surprised by April GMV growth, which accelerated a further 20% YoY growth. The spike is likely the result of multiple near-term factors, including a broader shift online amid COVID-19, along with government stimulus checks. Thinking longer-term, though, I do not see this trend as sustainable as a weakening consumer over the course of the year could weigh on the growth outlook. Additional risks to be cognizant of include Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) rising US Prime penetration, which has risen from 25% in 2013 to 59% in 2019 and could further weigh on eBay's outlook coming out of the downturn.Source: Yahoo FinanceFor now, there is limited visibility into trends beyond COVID-19, and coupled with the rising unemployment rate, I am maintaining a conservative stance on eBay's GMV growth path. The implied assumption is that most (if not all) of the benefits eBay has seen thus far will ultimately prove transitory. Given the challenging automobile sales environment, I think any Marketplace strength that does emerge will also likely be offset by weakness in Classifieds.eBay's status as a key e-commerce player is not in question, but the lack of operating improvement over the last few quarters does not bode well for the outlook once near-term trends normalize. Open questions also remain over the sustainability of eBay's growth and margin trajectory in the coming years, as repurchases have been the primary driver of EPS growth. I continue to believe that a reversal of market share losses in the Marketplace business, or the emergence of new growth drivers, is key to the eBay investment case.Considering eBay's limited growth profile, a multiple based on peers in retail (Target (NYSE:TGT), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW)) makes the most sense to me. On that basis, a blended P/E multiple of 12x on 2021 non-GAAP earnings gets me to a $36 price target. What would change my perception of the stock is if longer-than-expected COVID-19 headwinds materialize, resulting in a long-term shift in consumer buying patterns, or if the strategic review of the Classifieds business yields a better-than-expected valuation."
4344064,56142,2020-05-07T09:42:06-04:00,"eBay's reorganization is translating into better operating performance.The company's e-commerce resale and new retail sales business model has greater value during the coronavirus pandemic.Wall Street may reprice ownership valuations much higher over time, especially if underlying sales trends improve.","eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is primed for better organic growth after a number of years of stagnation. Several large activist investors have encouraged the company to refocus on its core e-commerce website, divesting other businesses purchased and developed over the years with its huge cash flow generation. My bullish take on the company is based on the coronavirus pandemic increasing eyeballs and sales, at the same time as margins/returns from the original business are improving. Wall Street will likely decide to place much higher valuation multiples on the remaining blue-chip technology, profit machine.eBay is a global e-commerce leader, with two divisions - Marketplace and Classifieds matching millions of buyers and sellers around the planet. The company uses online technologies and services to give buyers a choice of inventory from sellers worldwide, virtually anytime and anywhere. Marketplace includes the company's main operating business at ebay.com, plus localized counterparts and the eBay suite of mobile apps. Classifieds includes brands such as mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats, eBay Kleinanzeigen and others.Image Source: www.ebay.comOn February 13th, eBay completed the previously announced sale of its StubHub business to an affiliate of viagogo for $4 billion. The company used proceeds to buy back stock and repay debt. In addition, the Classifieds unit is up for sale, with negotiations ongoing. Expected sales proceeds are in the $8-10 billion range. After this final divestiture, eBay will be left with its original operating business. Large hedge fund investors are hoping a renewed focus on the eBay platform will produce organic growth at improved margins, and an even higher Wall Street valuation of the remaining business.In March, activist firm Starboard Value nominated four candidates to the board of directors to add pressure in the search for a new like-minded CEO. In the end, this effort was dropped with the hiring of Jamie Iannone a former executive at Walmart (WMT). Mr. Iannone served as chief operating officer for Walmart's U.S. e-commerce and had previously served as a vice president at eBay for eight years. He succeeded Devin Wenig, who resigned in September under pressure from Starboard and fellow activist Elliott Management.eBay is part of a small minority of U.S. businesses actually issuing revenue and income guidance for the year, expecting the coronavirus economic shutdown to have only a cursory effect on operations. Including cost control initiatives, its large share buyback after selling StubHub, and just slight organic growth, management is projecting free cash flow of $2.2 billion on revenue of $9.65 billion in 2020. You can review a better explanation of the numbers below, released last week.Image Source: Company 1st Quarter PresentationThe standout reason the stock is rising in price and becoming more valuable daily is a result of the huge uptick in e-commerce demand from the coronavirus pandemic. Consumer buying preferences all over the world are now an online choice first. Going to the local store, if open for business, to purchase goods is now a second choice for billions of people. eBay is part of an e-commerce retail group expected to see a big uptick in viewership and final sales, as consumer shopping from home expands.The company's online dominance in ""resale"" items, in my mind, puts it in an even stronger position going forward vs. new goods retailers. During an economic recession, individuals and businesses short of cash look to liquidate goods in a hurry. eBay is by far the easiest to use, largest marketplace for a recessionary garage sale across the globe.I am modeling the potential of even greater gains in revenue, profitability, and free cash flow the rest of the year than management guidance. The primary reason, as I have discussed in past Seeking Alpha articles during late April and early May, is my projection the coronavirus problem is here to stay for a year or two. A stagnant economy for several years works in favor of eBay's platform for growth future, pure and simple. If my suspicion proves correct, 20-25% annual growth rates in ""per share"" revenue and income are coming in 2020-21 (not including the effects of a potential Classifieds sale).With all the moving parts, in terms of the business unit shuffle, it's hard to make clear valuation comparisons over the years. However, on price to trailing sales, cash flow and free cash flow generation per share, March-April was the cheapest point for new investment in at least three years. I have this situation pictured below.The divestitures are a push to increase profit margins and returns on capital/assets, focusing on the core eBay website in the end. If the Classifieds division is sold for $10 billion or more, the company will reach for record margins by the end of the year, well above the improving picture below (post StubHub).Strong momentum is gathering for eBay shareholders in April-May. I have drawn a 12-month chart below of the upswing in some of my favorite momentum indicators alongside a now ""outperforming"" stock price. Since late January, eBay has gained +30% better than the S&P 500 market typical return, comparing the green circles on the chart. The red arrow points to a steady accumulation trend the past year in the Negative Volume Index (NVI). On falling volume days, plenty of buyers have bid up prices. The blue arrow highlights the powerful ramp higher in the On Balance Volume (OBV) line since late March. Basically, buyers have appeared on both high and low volume days. Taken together, the conclusion has to be bullish, from a technical perspective. How many other blue-chip stocks are up +15% year to date?I am planning to purchase shares on weakness in my diversified long/short portfolio. I am projecting a solid period of outperformance vs. the market will be eBay's future in 2020-21. If we get another big market decline into the November election, just a flat return from eBay will be a win for my portfolio design. Given a rising stock market, eBay could reach $50-60 a share by December.eBay is also a strong inflation hedge candidate. I am in the camp expecting stagflation, a rare economic condition of falling GDP output alongside rising prices for goods and services. Company performance could improve at a compounding rate, from more goods being sold at higher prices, capturing increased fees for listing on the e-commerce site.The sale of the Classifieds segment may propel the stock quote much higher, as Wall Street is forced to revalue eBay as a super-strong margin/return business, on renewed growth and unique online assets. A reappraisal of the underlying business setup and improving organic performance could put eBay into the elite valuation class of the FAANG stocks. Specifically, I would not be surprised by a stock quote above $100 a share into 2022, if smart management execution combines with a bump in demand for eBay's resale and new retail e-commerce offerings. ($2.2 billion in free cash flow during 2020 moves to $3.1 billion at a 20% annualized growth rate into 2022. Valuations jump from 12.5x free cash flow today to 24x in two years, supporting a share price of $105.)Want to read more?

(NASDAQ:EBAY) is one of the original poster boys of e-commerce. However, competition, changing relationship with its partners and activist shareholders have changed the complexion of the company. Looking through eBay’s business model and its expected evolution, we discuss why we think even the higher end of the company’s 2020 revenue guidance may turn out to be stretch, leave alone the 2022 expectations from the payments business. We model out our assumptions across a range of scenarios and find that even in the best case, the company trades at valuations comparable to those of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).The company operates an online platform to enable transactions between buyers and sellers. eBay makes money through commission (also called take rate on gross merchandize value or GMV) on the sale of GMV, through online advertising on its online properties and payment intermediation services.Source: Company filings, Author analysisA few quick notes about the businesses highlighted here:Source: Company filingsMuch of the growth in eBay’s revenue has been driven by the company’s take rate (or pricing growth), given the GMV varying seasonally around the $22-25 billion range.Source: Company filingsSource: Company filings, Seeking Alpha, Author analysisInterestingly, despite eBay’s buyer and seller counts growing until the last couple of quarters, the GMV has been relatively flat. One of the reasons behind the weakness in GMV was a reduction in marketing spend and also possibly the sustained increase in take rates.While not directly part of the company’s business model, Elliot Management’s $1.4 billion investment in the company in mid-2019 also deserves mention since it has been driving much of the strategic business review, sale of SH and a focus on increasing shareholder returns.The future hinges on payments piggybacking on the marketplace ecosystem to drive GMVIt is no secret that eBay trails the leaders in e-commerce space due to a variety of factors. The bigger worry is that most of the metrics have been trending down or have been flat. For example, average GMV per buyer has been trending down (save for the seasonal uptick last quarter).Source: Company filings, Seeking Alpha, Author analysisThe GMV per seller has seen a much steeper downtrend.Source: Company filings, Seeking Alpha, Author analysisThe number of buyers per seller also does not present a very inspiring picture.Source: Company filings, Seeking Alpha, Author analysisGiven the company’s take rate aggression, coupled with lack of volume growth predicates most of the growth on eBay’s payments business coming onstream in 2H20.Source: Company filingsSource: 4Q19 Earnings Call To see how the numbers tie-up the actual possibilities, we project the revenue and GVM growth in light of the company’s guidance for payments and the trends in the core market place business. We have not considered SH or the classifieds business since they are likely to be disposed off during the year, and the proceeds from these sales will possibly contribute to incremental dividends or buybacks.We have focussed on GMV per seller, the number of sellers and the take rate for the core marketplace (ex-payments) and for the payments business to establish the revenue that each of these businesses can drive until 2022.Using the data from the last six quarters, we chart out three scenarios for all the quarters until the end of 2022 and summarize the quarters for the respective years. The excel model used to analyze these numbers with all the scenarios is also attached.Lastly, we have not modelled in any weakness due to the ongoing demand crisis, with the assumption that this is a temporary phase and shall soon pass.Core marketplace (ex-payments)PaymentsEven in the bull case, we arrive at a total revenue of $10.74 billion which is closer to the lower end of the guidance provided by the management.Source: Company filings, Seeking Alpha, Author analysisFrom a valuation standpoint, this becomes even more challenging to address. At the $36 per share price, the company is already trading at a price to sales of 2.6x time the 2020 revenue, which is almost in line with the likes of Amazon.200310_Ebay_Model.xlsxSource: Company filings, Seeking Alpha, Author analysisAmazon is a behemoth and a growing one. eBay is barely growing and is expected to see first signs of real growth post-July this year and possibly into 2021, which makes the valuation comparison starker.While the lure of near-term dividends and buybacks (financed by the sale of the eBay’s assets) might keep the company’s stock price at elevated levels, we find it hard to see how the eBay stock can trade at valuations closer to those of Amazon. Unless eBay can pull a rabbit of out of the hat, the company’s share might end up being available at a significant discount. (We are refraining from hazarding a guess to the number due to activist shareholders trying to generate a return from the company could keep the price at irrational levels, for longer than expected. Even during the last month or so the stock has barely corrected by 10% versus 15-20% for the broader markets.)"

A seller on Amazon (AMZN) would deliver it to me in a month (shipped from China) or I could pay twice as much to receive it from a US seller in a week. Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) and CVS (CVS) were both sold out online and in stores. So was Walmart (WMT). So, I went to a site I hadn't visited in a while - eBay (EBAY). There, I found plenty of sellers willing to deliver the product to me in a week at a reasonable price. I bought the item and eBay got some revenue from me after many years.Hmm… I thought. If this is happening to me, it's probably happening to many others. So, I decided to look at the stock and liked what I saw. It is trading at a reasonable valuation and its business should be doing fine these days.Of note, Amazon is prioritizing medical supplies and household staples and not accepting most other products in its warehouses. This leaves an opening for eBay's decentralized seller base to supply these products to those who need them.For the full-year 2019, the company had revenue of $10.8 billion, an operating income of $1.8 billion, and an EPS of $2.10 per share. Excluding some charges (mainly stock compensation), the company claimed non-GAAP EPS of $2.83.The company generated more than $2 billion of cash in the year, consistent with its net income. It spent $5 billion buying back stock and used $0.5 billion to pay its dividend, drawing down its cash balance.At the end of 2019, the company had $7.7 billion of debt and $2.8 billion of cash. With 800 million shares, the company has a market cap of $23 billion and an enterprise value of $28 billion.For 2020, the company gave guidance of roughly flat revenue, with GAAP EPS at the mid-point of its range of $2.23 and non-GAAP EPS of $3.00. This assumed that StubHub would continue to be a part of the business. StubHub contributed $1.1 billion of revenue in the prior year.In 2007, eBay bought StubHub for $310 million. Its founder left to start a similar ticker-reselling business in Europe called viagogo. In November 2019, eBay announced that it would sell Stubhub for $4.05 billion to viagogo. In somewhat fortuitous timing, the sale was completed in February 2020. After tax leakage of about a billion dollars, the company was left with net proceeds of $3.1 billion. The company intends to use the bulk of the proceeds to buy back stock, expanding its share buyback plan for 2020 from $1.5 billion to $4.5 billion. At current prices, this would amount to almost 20% of the company. It is possible that eBay will dial the amount down as share buybacks are no longer as fashionable as before.With live events largely canceled, it's safe to say that this business would have had a hard time this month. If StubHub had a margin consistent with the rest of the company, the sale price amounted to approximately a 20x multiple of taxed earnings. That is a healthy price.Post the sale, the company increased its guidance for GAAP EPS slightly to $2.25 and non-GAAP EPS to $3.05, reflecting increased buybacks offset by the removal of StubHub's operating profit.Earlier this year, there were press reports indicating that Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, was looking to acquire eBay. This was a head-scratcher for ICE's investors who promptly sold off its stock. In response, the company decided not to go ahead with exploring the acquisition. Could ICE be back? I wouldn't bet on it.Starboard Value has been a shareholder for more than a year and has goaded the company to unlock value by disposing of non-core businesses. It has nominated four candidates to stand for election to the company's board at its 2020 annual meeting. Elliott Management was also a shareholder last year, although it is unclear whether they continue to hold a position.To value the stock, I would place a multiple of 16x on the company's GAAP earnings or 12x on its non-GAAP earnings to derive a fair value of $36. That is a 24% upside from the current $29 stock price.In a bear case, a prolonged recession will decrease the company's revenue, resulting in earnings that fall short by 20%. At a slightly lower multiple, that would translate to fair value for the stock of $24 or 17% downside.In a bull case, the company would see increased business from stimulus checks and the like and exceed earnings estimates by 10%. At a slightly higher multiple, the stock would rise to $40 for more than a 35% upside.It is hard to find another comparable company to fine-tune the fair value multiple. The company pays an annual dividend of $0.64 or a 2% dividend yield while you wait.The global economy is in a state of flux. Accurately predicting financial results for any company is hard as revenues and costs can vary greatly from estimates in the next few months. So, there is a real risk that the company's results may come in lower than expected.Investors losing faith in equities could result in them paying lower multiples for businesses.Companies are likely to maintain higher cash buffers going forward, delaying the return of cash to shareholders.The company could make execution errors, resulting in a loss of business. Also, it could make an overpriced acquisition, destroying shareholder value."
4351718,105689,2020-06-03T11:13:16-04:00,"The potential sale of the eBay Classifieds Group represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity in the classifieds industry.eBay Classifieds Group offers a high degree in complementarity in terms of geographical fit for both Prosus and Adevinta.For Adevinta, the deal would potentially revive its growth story which has slowed in recent years.In some countries, there might be antitrust concerns by the competition authorities.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is about to sell its classifieds unit, which as a standalone is one of the biggest players in the industry. Prosus (OTCPK:PROSF) (OTCPK:PROSY) and Adevinta (OTCPK:ADEVF) (OTC:MKPEF) would both benefit from the deal since eBay Classifieds Group's portfolio offers an outstanding geographical fit.We all know that history quite often repeats itself. Back in 2014/15, eBay was forced to carve out its payment services PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) by activist investors Paul Icahn and Dan Loeb. Since 2019, it is Paul Singer who wanted eBay to spin off its profitable subsidiaries StubHub (ticket marketplace) and Classifieds Group (various digital classifieds advertising platforms). Thereafter, rumors about potential buyers have gone wild. In May 2020, for eBay Classified Group (going forward referred to as ECG), things became more concrete as a list of potential buyers appeared: On the one hand, there is a pack of strategic investors such as South Africa's Naspers (OTCPK:NPSNY) (OTCPK:NAPRF) through its Amsterdam-listed spin-off Prosus and Oslo-listed Adevinta backed by Norwegian media house Schibsted (OTCPK:SBSNF) (OTCPK:SBSNY); on the other hand, a consortium consisting of financial investors Blackstone, Permira, and Hellman & Friedman have also expressed their interest.As most of the valuable classifieds assets are already in the hands of (potential) long-term strategists, Paul Singer's push on eBay has set the industry in motion. In an industry where the winner takes most (not necessarily all), this deal represents a unique opportunity to tap into totally uncharted geographies and new verticals.By means of the ECG portfolio (for main ECG brands, see Appendix), which primarily consists of horizontal platforms and a couple of verticals which center around cars/motors (at the end of this article you will find a detailed overview), either Prosus or Adevinta would convert into the industry's leading player in one fell swoop. This is illustrated in the chart below.In my analysis, I will exclusively look at Prosus and Adevinta since they are strategic buyers. Both companies pursue similar strategic approaches, namely buy-and-hold with a long-term perspective to build market-leading portals. Both have accumulated vast expertise in running horizontal and vertical classifieds on a global scale relying on (an)organic growth. While Adevinta is a pure classifieds player, Prosus, additionally, runs material operations in payments/fintech and food delivery.In any case, apart from the FOMO consideration, which I hinted above, a similar deal rationale applies to both Prosus and Adevinta. In the digital classifieds business, it is all about scale. While there are a couple of products and features that may work just in one country, there are also plenty of things that are basically the same globally. Therefore, the bigger the organization, the easier it becomes to amortize incurred costs for generally applicable developments. This applies, particularly to data and analytics. Adevinta states in its Annual Report 2019:Looking at geographies, there is a high degree of complementarity with the ECG portfolio for both potential new owners. Only in a few countries, there is an overlap in operations (ECG/Prosus: Poland, Mexico, South Africa; ECG/Adevinta: Germany, UK, Italy, Mexico).Adevinta's map above is somewhat misleading as the company's sales originate from Europe (mainly France and Spain) in every single year from 2016 through 2019. In Brazil, Adevinta operates a 50:50 joint venture with Prosus. A geographical breakdown of Prosus's classifieds business is not disclosed; however, it is reasonable to assume that its operations are, for traditional reasons alone, less Europe-centric.Against the background that the majority of the ECG assets are active in uncharted territory, it seems reasonable to assume that they offer immediate value to the potential buyer. Hence, we should concentrate on the geographical overlap and break it down further. As we dig deeper, some strategic options come to light.H=horizontal/generalist classifieds, V=vertical/specialized classifieds Source: own illustration based on data from respective companies.In Germany, Adevinta's Shpock (short for ""shop in your pocket"") offers a very similar value proposition as eBay Kleinanzeigen. Both online marketplaces bring primarily private sellers and buyers together. However, eBay Kleinanzeigen is far more popular as traffic data from SimilarWeb shows. Thus, the deal would be a comfortable way for Adevinta to secure a big chunk of the German market for general classifieds. Additionally, with mobile.de, Adevinta would welcome the number one car classifieds company in Germany in its portfolio (autoscout24.de, which is owned by Hellman & Friedman, part of the bidding consortium, ranks second).In the UK, the situation is very similar. With Gumtree UK being clearly ahead of Shpock in terms of user engagement, the deal would allow Adevinta to scale up its presence in the UK. As in Germany, the car vertical would come as an additional, valuable item.In Italy, the story gets a totally different spin as Adevinta already owns subito.it, the country's most popular horizontal classifieds site. While automobile.it is, currently, the number three in cars (behind subito.it's car vertical and autoscout24.it, which is owned by Hellman & Friedman), the combination of subito.it and automobile.it will allow for motors listings syndication back and forth between both portals. This cross-listing opportunity results in a totally new value proposition to offer to professional car dealers. As they can be listed on both sites, the amount of leads would see an uptick which translates into faster sales and higher volumes for the dealer and into an interesting monetization opportunity for Adevinta. Therefore, the ECG deal eventually changes the competitive landscape in Italian car classifieds in the medium to long term to the detriment of autoscout24.it because dealers might get convinced by the advantages of the bundled offer.With regard to antitrust concerns, I am rather optimistic that no material deal changes would be necessary to receive approval. As autoscout24.it would still be a strong number two, competition should not be harmed significantly. For instance, in the French real estate vertical, in 2018, the leading portal seloger.com acquired the number three, logic-immo.com, without any bigger problems.The situation in Poland is quite different. With olx.pl, Prosus enjoys a huge lead over ECG's gumtree.pl, both in terms of site visits and unique visitors. Therefore, with regard to Poland, the deal does not offer any material upside for Prosus.Mexico is a very interesting case since both ECG (vivanuncios.com.mx) and Adevinta (segundamano.mx) own well-positioned portals there. And to spice things up, both platforms are going head-to-head in terms of user engagement and real estate listings. Thus, the deal would help Adevinta consolidate the real estate classifieds market. It will be interesting to see if Mexican authorities will give green light against the background of a dominating real estate portal.For Prosus, the ECG acquisition would be a significant catalyst for its motors vertical in Mexico. To understand the implications for vendetuauto.com, we need to get familiar with the portal's business model. Actually, vendetuauto.com is part of the Frontier Car Group (FCG), which is majority-owned by Prosus/Naspers since its latest financing round in November 2019.FCG is offering retail car sellers not just a simple listing but inspects the vehicle in one of their 300+ globally spread inspection centers (also in Mexico). After this inspection step, the seller can choose between (i) engaging in a spot sale to FCG, (ii) a listing, ideally, on a Prosus platform, or (iii) no sale. Under (i), FCG takes the car on its own books in the first place but auctions it to its dealer network; thereafter, the dealer may use a listing to sell the car online.Consequently, purchasing ECG would open up material strategic options to Prosus to accelerate its footprint in the Mexican car vertical using vivanuncios.com.mx as well-known sales funnel. ECG's strong position in Mexican real estate would be an extra, for which Prosus will surely have meaningful use.In South Africa, after a successful closing, Prosus would be able to tap significantly into the real estate vertical. In addition, Gumtree RSA comes with an attractive option to corner the car vertical as there would be only one relevant player left (cars.co.za).However, in March 2020, the South African Competition Tribunal prohibited Naspers/Prosus's acquisition of WeBuyCars (WBC). Although WBC is not a listing platform but rather operates a similar business model as FCG (presented above), these decisions underline that the South African watchdogs have an eye on this market. I, therefore, assume that the chances are relatively high that the ECG deal could undergo some adjustments prior to approval. Obviously, this would limit Prosus's strategic alternatives significantly.I want to be very clear: In my personal opinion, both Prosus and Adevinta appear to be excellent long-term owners of ECG. It is absolutely normal that, in a deal of this size, antitrust concerns arise. But, in this case, they are definitely no show-stopper.One consideration: Adevinta has significantly more exposure to Europe's mature markets, which is also reflected in the low FY17-FY19 revenue CAGR (15%) compared to Prosus Classifieds (43%). Therefore, the deal gives Adevinta the possibility to refuel its growth story which, currently, foresees a medium- to long-term annual top-line growth target between 15% and 20%. In other words, for Adevinta, the deal might be a little more important than for Prosus (if that is even possible).However, it is too early to draw any conclusion for the long-run. A more in-depth analysis is necessary to understand the potential gains from the ECG deal.The main ECG brands are:"
4337295,100386,2020-04-13T12:37:43-04:00,Sale of StubHub increases value of the company.A Margin of Safety exists for Investors.Low debt and historic performance suggest eBay can weather an economic storm.,"eBayinc.comThesiseBay (EBAY), once a glamor stock during the dot.com era of 2001 with the stock selling at high earnings multiples, is now a boring and under-loved company. Having sold or spun off businesses such as Skype, PayPal (PYPL), and most recently StubHub, the company also finds themselves without a permanent CEO. They are dealing with an activist investor in Starboard Value, who is pushing for a sale of the classifieds business. This all comes at the same time the world is faced with a global pandemic, threatening businesses and the world as we know it.StubHub is a low margin yet high growth business. I will argue eBay is worth more without it. eBay’s valuation is compelling making it worth looking at for long-term investors.With StubHub being sold to Viagogo, eBay now has two segments, Marketplace and Classifieds. Both remaining businesses have operating margins around 40%, while StubHub’s margins were only in the teens. By selling StubHub, EBay’s overall operating margins will go up, a plus for valuation.Company annual reportseBay also competes around the globe with the United States accounting for about 40% of revenue. While there are certain risks for an international company, such as currency exchange, political risks, etc. the company operates by being the exchange between buyers and sellers. It is thus an asset-light business much like Priceline (BKNG) or Expedia (EXPE).eBay has a competitive advantage in Marketplace with global reach, customer preference, and customer lists (buyers and sellers). This is backed up by their strong operating margins and returns on invested capital.With respect to operating margins, eBay is a leader in E-Retail compared to Alibaba (BABA), ETSY (ETSY), Amazon (AMZN) as well as sites such as Shopify (SHOP), Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK), and Wayfair (W). The graph below displays the wide variance from Wayfair’s negative 10.2% to EBay positive 22%.What comps are reasonable for eBay? I think of the company as an exchange between buyers and sellers as well as an auction site. This prompted me to compare eBay to companies such as ICE (ICE) (International [stock] Exchange), NASDAQ (NDAQ), Priceline (travel site), Copart (CPRT) (automobile auction), and Ritchie Brothers (RBA) (large equipment auction). In this comparison, eBay drops from being a leader to middle of the pack, yet without StubHub, operating margins should increase roughly 5%, to 27%, based on my calculations. eBay’s management’s guidance for 2020 suggests operating margins of 28.5% to 29.5%, yet I like to be conservative.The classifieds segment has high margins, yet Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) dominate online advertising. As the company notes in their MD&A (management discussion and analysis) in their annual report, companies with larger capitalization may be a threat and have substantial power if they elect to yield it. Activist investor Starboard Value suggest eBay sell the classifieds business, yet with its high margins, one could argue, eBay shouldn’t be in any hurry to sell it.In Starboard’s recent letter to eBay, they note classifieds businesses trade at much higher multiples than eBay has historically, therefore selling the business could enable eBay to land a nice pile of cash. With little debt after selling StubHub, it would be encouraging to see eBay invest in other assets to drive growth in their Marketplace segment.My purpose is not to evaluate the propositions proposed by Starboard Value. They are capitalists, as we all are, and trying to unlock shareholder value.To asses if there are barriers to entry for eBay, one must examine the competitive landscape as well as the returns the company is able to earn, if they are stable, and if there is a trend.According to a February 2020 report from eMarketer, eBay has a 4.7% market share in U.S. e-retailing. It suggests Amazon’s market share is 39%.As far as global market is concerned, they have a 3% market share according to Statistica.Worldwide e-commerce is fragmented. Alibaba commands a 56% market share in its home country of China according to business insider and trying to grow its business in Europe as well as the rest of the world. While I don’t have the specific global market share for each company, for 2019 Amazon had $280 billion in revenue, Alibaba $70 billion, and eBay $10 billion. Both Amazon and Alibaba have cloud business subsidiaries which are included in those figures however.A sign of eBay’s barriers to entry is the interest in the company by ICE (Intercontinental Exchange). On February 4, the Wall Street Journal reported ICE was considering a takeover offer for eBay. Talks have since ceased without a deal. ICE would be interested in the Marketplace, eBay’s core business. Given StubHub’s sale last month, the company could sell the classifieds business to make it more attractive as a take-over target. eBay is operating with an interim CEO since September 2019 when Devin Wenig stepped down from the post.While eBay’s return on invested capital (ROIC) is in the high teens, the company has very little debt. It seems to make sense for someone to buy eBay as opposed to building what exists, which would be costly and time consuming.Here I will conduct two valuations for eBay, an asset value and an earnings power value. These are the methods taught at Columbia Business School’s value investing program and a part of the Graham Dodd value investing continuum. See Bruce Greenwald’s Value Investing, from Graham to Buffett and Beyond for more information about this type of valuation.The asset value should be looked at as how much it would cost to reproduce the assets, both physical and intangible. Looked at another way, how much would it cost a new entrant to enter the market. Some of the challenges to valuing eBay include their patents, customer lists, software, and computer equipment.The asset value of a company uses information which exists now. While others try and forecast growth five and ten years into the future, asset values are from the balance sheet. They are tangible and exist now.Real estate is found on the balance sheet under GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Practices) at historical cost. It is however possible there could be hidden value if the current value of the real estate is higher than its depreciated value on the balance sheet. Page 91 of the company’s 10k lists the balance sheet values for property, plant, and equipment.To determine the value of the real estate, I have taken the owned square of eBay, which consists of 1.3 million square feet. The annual report notes the headquarters is located in San Jose California and the owned data centers are in Utah. The company leases another 0.8 million square feet of real estate. Other details are not provided in the annual report. I contacted eBay with questions yet not had a response at the time this article was completed. The values in the table therefore is an estimate based on what we know. I am assuming for this purpose the real estate owned is in California.Intangible assets need to be properly evaluated. In completing an asset value, I will set the balance sheet valuation of “Goodwill & Intangible assets” to $0.00, then separately value the brand and workforce. The annual report states Goodwill is $5.2 billion and Intangible assets are $67 million.The eBay brand is also a valuable asset. Interbrand suggests the eBay brand is worth $13 million while Brandz suggests $12 million. Another approach would be to capitalize the advertising expenses. Taking $1.4 million in 2019 advertising expenses and capitalizing them at 10%, suggest a brand value of $14 million. For this analysis, I used the average of $13 million.eBay has a valuable workforce with many of the employees being software developers and other knowledge workers. Using Glassdoor as a reference point, I estimated the average eBay employee to make $90,000 a year. The recruiting fee is higher than generally used for blue collar workers used in estimates for retail stores and such as these workers are more difficult to acquire and may require incentives.Other small adjustments I made include writing down computer equipment and software by 25% as well as leasehold improvements and furniture by 50%. Estimates for real estate include a write down from reported values as well. The current carrying value for “customer list and database” was added and likely a conservative value.EBay Annual report, Author’s calculationsThe current market cap is significantly higher than their asset value suggesting the company is able to use its assets affectively to generate income.The earnings power value method is essentially a discounted cash flow without growth. A value investor seeks to buy a franchise business close to its earnings power value enabling them to get the growth for free. To begin the valuation, the discount rate, or weighted average cost of capital must be determined. I used an 8% cost of equity given the low interest rate environment we are in along with 3% as an estimated of eBay’s weighted cost of debt.I valued eBay with and without StubHub to demonstrate the increased value the company gained by selling the business. In both cases, I use last year’s revenue. In the ex-StubHub example, I subtracted out their share. The same adjustment was made to operating margins. To obtain NOPAT (net operating profit after taxes), I added back depreciation and subtracted capex. In 2019, there was a small amount of over depreciation. Historically, the two usually offset one another. I also added 50% of internal software development as I believe it should be viewed as a part of growth capex.The WACC (see above) is used for the discount rate. In the ex-StubHub valuation, I adjusted (lowered) debt for the after-tax proceeds of the sale. After adding cash and subtracting debt, the remaining amount is the EPV (earnings power value) of the equity. This can be compared to the company’s existing market cap.My estimates suggest eBay is worth 29% more without StubHub. Given the closing price of the stock on April 9th, investors have a Margin of Safety of 9%. If eBay experiences growth, investors get it for free.Source: Company annual reports, author’s calculationsOn the recent earnings call, eBay management guided for revenue of $10.7 - $10.9 billion and operating margins of 28.5% to 29.5%. If the company is able to obtain those goals, the value would increase by about $4.00 per share and raise the margin of safety to roughly 21%.A franchise business such as eBay can be valued in terms of return. The expected return is comprised of its distribution yield, organic growth, and economic growth.The distribution yield is equivalent to all distributions including dividends, share repurchases, debt reduction, and interest paid divided by Enterprise Value (market value of stock + net debt).My calculation of 25% represents the most current cash flow statement, balance sheet, and stock price. I also adjusted long-term debt by subtracting the by the sum of net (after-tax) proceeds from the StubHub sale. To be conservative, to calculate the total return, I am using the 5-year average of 9%.There are a couple of methods of calculating organic growth. Using an average of 10 years of growth for revenue, operating earnings (EBIT), and PP&E, organic growth is about 1.9%.The second method of calculating organic growth utilizes ROIC (return on invested capital). In addition to the capital expenditures on the cash flow statement, I added internal software and development as it’s a part of the expenditures eBay needs to make to grow. In addition, acquisitions are also added to capital expenditures. Depreciation is then subtracted to get growth capital expenditures (CAPEX).Growth capex is divided by NOPAT (net operating profit after taxes) to calculate the return eBay is earning on the investments it is making. Lastly, I multiply the return on additional earnings by the return eBay is able to achieve on its capital employed (ROIC). For 2019, the organic growth using this method is a little less than 1%. The 5-year average is higher at 1.2% and somewhat lower than the Method A calculation of 1.9%. To be conservative, I will use the average of the two methods.Adding together the distribution yield of 9% with organic growth of 1.9%, the return for an investment in eBay should be about 10.9%. The economic environment is too difficult to predict at this time. As Howard Marks says, “there are two types of forecasters, those who don’t know and those who don’t know they don’t know.” eBay may benefit as an online e-commerce marketplace during a recession. Amazon is seeing amazing growth right now as is Walmart. During the financial crisis, eBay’s revenue rose 2% from ‘08 to ’09 and 5% from ’09 to ’10. Even economist Carmen Reinhart says this time is different. Bottom line, I am not predicting an economic growth or decline.Investors can buy the stock with a margin of safety to the earnings power value. Future growth opportunities are free for investors. The company has been able to use its free cash flow to initiate a dividend and repurchase shares. The e-commerce business is growing, and likely to only become larger in the next 5 to 10 years. There are certainly risks as the company does not have a permanent CEO and they have not experienced the marketplace growth many feel the company has the potential to achieve. The risk reward here seems compelling for a long-term value investor.Source: Author’s calculations, FactSet data, Company annual reportsThe final piece an investor should keep in mind is the market multiple. In the graph below, I examine the EV/EBIT multiple eBay is trading at. Buying at a high multiple generally suppresses returns. eBay’s market multiple over the 13 years shown here is 12. The stock is currently trading with a market multiple of 14. Multiple contraction will depress your returns while expansion will increase your returns from those calculated above. In this case, multiple expansion looks possible.In February 2016, eBay issued $25 notes which trade under the symbol EBAYL. They have an annual interest rate of 6% per year. EBay may repurchase them at any time thus investors must be careful not to pay too much of a premium given the call-risk. For example – one wouldn’t want to pay $28 only to have eBay buy them back at $25. The company’s annual report provides more information for those interested in this type of security.A potential long-term annualized return of around 10% for a stable company with very little debt presents a compelling investment opportunity. With an asset value in the neighborhood of the current market cap, the downside risk seems low. The margin of safety gives investors protection as well. Any margin expansion or growth is free."
4324793,102404,2020-02-17T17:48:55-05:00,"eBay is one of the most famous 2-sided marketplaces in the world and one of the major networks connecting buyers and sellers.Usually, such networks lead to a wide economic moat, but in case of eBay, the company was not able to outperform the overall market in the last five years.eBay is facing some major corporations as potential competitors like Amazon or Facebook and smaller companies gaining market shares like Etsy.This is a great case study how a company can create a 2-sided marketplace and also how such marketplaces can still be challenged.","eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is one of the most famous two-sided marketplaces, which is connecting buyers and sellers. And while many other companies relying on network effects are rushing from all-time high to all-time high, eBay has only been a mediocre investment in the recent past for various reasons.(Source: Pixabay)But, despite the network effect in place, eBay was struggling in the recent past, and the company might be a good case study to learn a little more about network effects - why they are so powerful and where problems and limitations of the network effect and 2-sided marketplace can be found. In this article, we will look mostly at eBay, but also at companies which are a potential threat to eBay - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Etsy Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY), for example.eBay was founded in autumn 1995 and went public in September 1998. It was not only one of the companies founded during the so-called dotcom bubble, but - like Amazon - it is one of the very few companies and stocks that actually were a success and didn't collapse after 2000. Today, eBay is a global commerce platform, which includes the eBay Marketplace, StubHub (which eBay is about to sell to viagogo for a purchase price of $4.5 billion) and classified platforms, which include brands like mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree or eBay Kleinanzeigen. From 2002 till 2014, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) was a subsidiary of eBay and contributed to the revenue and earnings. In September 2014, it was announced that eBay would spin PayPal off into a separate company. This was a move demanded by Carl Icahn.When looking at the performance of eBay since the IPO, the stock increased 4,260% in the last 22 years, which is a really impressive performance, and the stock was easily outperforming the S&P 500, which increased 225% in the same timeframe. For a very long time, eBay was also outperforming Amazon as an investment, but in the last few years, the stock performance of eBay lost ground to Amazon, which has increased 14,490% in the same timeframe.Data by YChartsBut when looking at the performance of the last few years, eBay's performance is not so impressive anymore. During the last five years, eBay could increase about 60% - similar to the performance of the S&P 500, while Amazon could increase 472% in the same timeframe.Data by YChartsWhen looking at other metrics than the stock performance, we also see eBay having problems to grow. Since 2007, eBay could increase its gross merchandise volume 5.66% annually on average, but in the recent past, the growth of GMV was slowing down. In the past five quarters, the gross merchandise volume in the United States declined every single quarter, with the year-over-year decline being especially steep in the last quarter (8% decline). In the last quarter, the international GMV declined as well (about 1% decrease YoY), while in the previous quarters eBay could at least report a mid-single digit YoY increase.(Source: Own work based on 10-K and earnings releases of eBay)When looking at the trailing 12-month number of active buyers during the last few quarters, we also see a slowdown. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the number grew only 2%, while the reported growth rate was at least 4% in the previous quarters.(Source: Own work based on earnings releases of eBay)We mentioned above that eBay is one of the classical examples of a 2-sided marketplace and that these companies usually have a wide economic moat around the business, which is protecting the companies against competitors and leading to stable revenue growth and high levels of profitability. In the next sections, I am showing why eBay should profit from network effects. But I will also show where the network effect has its limitations and what that implies for eBay's business and performance.eBay is a classical 2-sided network characterized by the fact that there are two different classes of users which come to the network for different reasons, and each side offers complementary value for the other side. It is also a 2-sided network that is easy to understand: it just connects sellers that want to sell a certain item on the one side as well as buyers that want to purchase a certain item on the other side. eBay is basically offering the marketplace where buyers and sellers can be matched.So far, we have just described a simple business model. To understand why it is such a powerful and durable business that is difficult to attack, we have to go a little deeper. While an ordinary company which is selling an item or a service can offer value to its customers from the very first day as the service or item is valuable in itself, a marketplace is only creating value over time when a high number of sellers and buyers are trying to offer and purchase products. To use an extreme example: if there is just one buyer or just one seller active at a marketplace, this marketplace won't have any value at all, as it is not possible to sell or buy anything. And even with only a few buyers and sellers being active, it is rather unlikely that one seller is offering exactly the item a buyer is searching for. Only after time and with an increasing number of active users, the marketplace becomes valuable to both sides, and every new buyer offers additional value to the sellers, and every new seller offers value to the buyers.And once such a large marketplace exists, it is difficult to attack as a new marketplace has to draw in buyers and sellers at the same time and, therefore, has to offer value to both groups at the same time. Once a marketplace like eBay with an active base of 180 million buyers is in place, it is very difficult for new marketplaces to convince sellers and buyers not to use eBay but another marketplace with a fraction of active buyers and sellers instead. Buyers won't use a marketplace without sellers, and sellers won't use a marketplace without buyers as it has no value for the other side. A competitor can even offer a better app, a more user-friendly marketplace or a better service - it probably won't matter as the most important value proposition for buyers and sellers is the network of buyers and sellers. And such a large and dense network is almost impossible to offer for young companies in the early days.And considering these aspects, it is not surprising to learn that eBay is on the 44th spot on the list of most valuable companies in the world (according to Interbrand). Until 2014, Interbrand saw the brand value increase every single year, but since then, Interbrand saw the brand value declining every single year. And this brings us to the next important section of our article - why eBay seems to be in trouble despite its network and how such networks can be attacked after all.We mentioned above that it is difficult to attack a network like eBay with about 180 million active buyers as it is quite difficult for competitors to create a similar marketplace from scratch. Nevertheless, eBay seems to have problems to achieve growth and several metrics - like GMV, revenue or active users - are either declining or growing only in the low single digits. And there are two different reasons for these problems: eBay is facing competitors that already have a large and dense network in place and additionally, eBay is facing a phenomenon called ""multi-tenanting"".Multi-tenantingLet's start with multi-tenanting, which is one of the major weaknesses of marketplaces and is undermining the defensibility and is often mentioned in the articles and whitepapers of Nfx. Multi-tenanting basically describes the problem that sellers can offer their products not only at eBay, but also at other marketplaces, and buyers can also search on different marketplaces for the products they want to purchase. If you can't use two marketplaces at the same time - because it would be too expensive or too time-consuming - marketplaces like eBay could defend themselves against competitors. As long as a marketplace can't ""lock in"" its sellers and buyers in a way that doesn't make using other marketplaces unattractive, a company (or its marketplace) will face competition.Rising marketplace: EtsyAnd therefore, eBay is facing competition from new companies, which can enter the market due to the above described multi-tenanting effect as the existing users of eBay can also try out new marketplaces without facing huge additional costs. A good example would be Etsy, which has about 44.8 million active buyers already (reflecting a 20.7% increase YoY) and 2.6 million sellers (reflecting a 26.9% YoY growth).(Source: Etsy Investor Presentation)And Etsy can not only increase its GMS with a high pace, the company is also increasing the GMS per active buyer a little bit. In the last few quarters, Etsy could increase the GMS per active buyer about 2% to $101.50 in the third quarter of 2019. According to Etsy's guidance, the GMS for 2019 will be about $5 billion, and this is still only a fraction of eBay's gross merchandise volume, which is about $90 billion. But 44 million active buyers are quite a lot, and Etsy can, therefore, be a threat to eBay. The strategy to handle such threats could be to just buy the competitor, but with a current valuation of $6 billion, Etsy might be too expensive for eBay to buy. Facebook (FB) could successfully purchase Instagram, but at a point in time, where Instagram had only about 1 million users.Existing networks: Amazon, Alibaba, FacebookAnd that would not solve the problem for eBay as it is not just facing competition from Etsy, but also from companies like Amazon, Alibaba, or Facebook. The problem is that these companies already have a huge customer base and a huge network. Amazon might have about 110 million Amazon Prime members just in the United States. Facebook has about 1.6 billion daily active users. And Alibaba's marketplace Taobao has about 700 million monthly active users, but is probably not the biggest threat for eBay, and therefore, we will rather focus on Amazon.When looking at companies like Amazon or Alibaba, there is a huge advantage. Both are selling products that already have a large number of customers using the site, and the buying side of a 2-sided network already exists. Millions of customers are using Amazon in order to buy products, and while this is not enough to create a similar 2-sided marketplace as eBay, it is much easier as if a company had to start from scratch. The huge number of buyers is a huge incentive to sell at Amazon, and it is therefore much easier to attract sellers to the marketplace. Amazon launched its marketplace already in 2002 - seven years after eBay - and might therefore be the major competitor of eBay. In the last quarter, Amazon generated about $17.4 billion from ""Third party seller services"", which is not only reflecting a growth of 30% YoY (while eBay is struggling to grow its GMV). According to the press release, third party sellers sold more than a billion items during the holiday season (including more than 100 million items shipped with Prime Free One-Day Delivery). And in 2018, the gross market volume generated by Amazon Marketplace (third party sellers) was about $160 billion and therefore about twice as high as eBay's GMV.Facebook might also be an additional example for a company that can pose a threat to eBay. Although people are not using social networks like Facebook primarily to buy or sell items, the company has already an impressive network it can use. With 1.6 billion daily active users and almost 2.5 billion monthly active users, it is easier to start a 2-sided marketplace like eBay.(Source: Facebook Investor Presentation)In 2016, Facebook re-launched its marketplace after the company had already tried to launch its marketplace several times in the past without being successful. And with more than 700 million monthly active users as of March 2018, it seemed to be more successful this time. And aside from Facebook, there are many more companies with similar social networks in place like Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) with more than 1 billion monthly active users for WeChat, which could pose a threat to eBay at some point in time.Considering the network effect of eBay, one might expect that eBay should report metrics of high stability and consistency. But when looking at the last decade, the numbers show a different picture. A stable gross margin can show consistency of the business and maybe some form of pricing power (and both are indicating a wide economic moat). In case of eBay, the gross margin is actually quite stable - the improvement between 2014 and 2015 stems from the PayPal spin-off. The return on invested capital (ROIC) is another metric indicating if a company might have an economic moat (and companies with a strong network in place usually have a wide moat). On average, eBay has an RoIC of 12.71% during the last decade, which is acceptable, but the numbers show extreme fluctuations from year to year.(Source: Own work based on numbers from Morningstar)While margins and RoIC are acceptable, revenue, earnings per share, and free cash flow show a different picture. When looking at revenue, we can see an uptrend, but after the PayPal spin-off (which explains the decline between 2014 and 2015), eBay could increase its revenue only 5.88% on average (compared to 18.25% on average in the years 2010 till 2014). And especially in 2019, revenue could only be increased 0.5%. When looking at earnings per share, we see wild fluctuations during the decade without any real trend. In 2016, earnings per share (on a GAAP basis) were as high as $6.35 and in 2017 as low as ($0.95). For 2019, eBay could report a non-GAAP EPS of $2.83. In the years until 2014, free cash flow could increase with a steady pace, but in the two years after the spin-off, the free cash flow dropped and is now fluctuating between $2 billion and $2.5 billion.(Source: Own work based on numbers from Morningstar)Considering the slowdown in growth rates, it makes sense for eBay to start paying a dividend and distribute money to shareholders. It also makes sense to buy back shares, but eBay should not forget to invest in its business. Just buying back shares can be dangerous - even with network effects in place, but especially when facing competition like eBay is facing right now.I am certainly not saying that eBay is a bad investment, but during the last five years, it performed pretty similar to the S&P 500 and, therefore, not a great investment. And especially considering the 2-sided marketplace and the competitive advantage that often stems from such networks, eBay as investment was a disappointment. While other companies built on strong network effects outperformed the market in the last few years, eBay was facing some competitors, which created serious troubles for eBay, and the challenges will probably continue."
4310017,22148,2019-12-02T09:16:13-05:00,eBay sold StubHub for a solid $4.05 billion.The company could be on the pace for selling StubHub and Classifieds for roughly half the stock value.The remaining marketplace business would only trade for ~6x EBITDA estimates providing substantial upside potential.,"eBay (EBAY) has stumbled in the last few quarters, but the company successfully sold their StubHub division for a sizable gain. My investment thesis wasn't ready to cash in gains over the summer around $40, and the stock is an even better deal now with a sizable cash infusion and a catalyst for higher prices.Image Source: eBay press releaseFor a business that doesn't generate a lot of operating income before corporate expenses, eBay got a very strong $4.05 billion from Viagogo for StubHub. The business contributes about $1.2 billion in annual revenues making the deal value of $4.05 billion a premium to the current revenue multiple assigned to the stock as a whole at about 2.8x sales targets.On CNBC, the interim CEO claimed the business was sold for about 25x EBITDA estimates for StubHub. For 2019, StubHub was a minimal part of the operating income generated by eBay with only $31 million for Q3 and $68 million in the YTD period.Source: StubHub Q3'19 10-QWith corporate costs of $247 million in the last quarter, an assignment of nearly 15% of those costs would actually push the division into a breakeven level for a business just sold for over $4 billion. The company didn't provide any details on the financial impact of stripping StubHub out of eBay.The only problem here is that StubHub was one of the revenue growth businesses. GMV for the marketplace was down 2% while revenues grew 1% in the quarter. StubHub only had flat GMV, but revenues were up a strong 5% to easily exceed the corporate wide flat revenue growth.Source: eBay Q3'19 presentationClassifieds, payments, and the burgeoning ads business were the actual revenue drivers of a business with limited growth. Overall, revenues were flat and up 2% adjusted for currency.The point here is that eBay got a solid cash payment for the StubHub business. The price was at the midpoint of the estimated value listed by Elliott Management. A similar deal for the Classifieds business in the estimated $10 billion range by Elliott Management would provide a total value to eBay of $14 billion (half the current stock value) for two business units that only generated ~20% of revenues in the last quarter.The issue remains whether the company can ever turnaround the main marketplace business to make the revenue growth from payments and ads as a growth driver versus just offsetting revenue declines in the core business. Selling these two units doesn't necessarily solve the problem, but they do highlight how cheap the stock is around $35.eBay ended Q3 with a net debt position of $3.6 billion. The $4 billion in cash from StubHub will place the company close to a net cash position depending on the taxes payable after only paying $310 million to buy the business in 2007.New capital returns won't necessarily drive the stock without a new CEO fixing the business, but the company has a strong history of repurchasing stock that provides support for shareholders. For Q3, eBay spending $1.0 billion on share buybacks on top of the current dividend yield of 1.5%. In the last year or so, the company has consistently spent over $1 billion on repurchasing stock.Data by YChartseBay has one of the top net payout yields in the market which generally indicates strong value in a stock. With a market value of ~$29 billion, the net payout yield calculates to 20% based on $5.39 billion in net stock buybacks and a 1.5% dividend yield.The yield could easily rise further as the company will have more cash to return capital to shareholders next year while still generating annual free cash flows above $2.25 billion this year.The key investor takeaway is that the StubHub sell was a solid price, but the market may end up punishing the company for removing a growth avenue from the business. eBay needs a new permanent CEO that drives GMV growth and improves weakened margins on the marketplace to take advantage of not only take rates but also the ads and payments growth drivers.Regardless, the core eBay only trades at about 6x EBITDA estimates offering a true value to shareholders. The new CEO will only need to focus on improving the marketplace and when combined with strong capital returns will reward shareholders."
4309805,25120,2019-11-29T17:10:08-05:00,"eBay has sold StubHub at a decent valuation, in line with expectations of Elliott.More divestments might arrive, potentially revealing more upside for the shares.Despite the potential, I have concerns on the thesis as well, driven by a chronic poor organic growth profile.","eBay (EBAY) announced a lucrative deal for shareholders as it has sold its StubHub unit in a more than $4 billion cash deal. The deal is driven by the pressure initiated by Elliott Management which is trying to unlock value in eBay as its growth and share price performance have been underwhelming compared to peers. While I see the rationale for the deal and multiples for StubHub look very high, and the plans of Elliott seem to make sense, I do not see a compelling risk-reward at this point in time.eBay has reached a deal to sell its StubHub unit to Viagogo in a cash deal worth $4.05 billion. Interim CEO Scott Schenkel stresses that the board has contemplated all options to maximize shareholder value, yet in the end it was determined that a sale of StubHub was the best outcome.The ticket marketplace for life sport, music and entertainment events has been the choice of many fans to obtain tickets at competitive prices in a secure setting, including guarantees. Eric Baker, the founder and CEO of Viagogo actually founded StubHub and sold it to eBay in a $310 million deal back in 2007. Now more than 12 years later he is buying the business back at more than 10 times the initial value attached to the business back in 2007.The unit generated $1.08 billion in sales in 2018 with revenue growth coming in at low single digits. Being able to sell a unit with very modest growth and modest margins at a 3.8 times sales multiple sounds pretty solid.eBay held cash, equivalents and investments worth $4.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, as the deal could essentially double this gross cash position towards $8.6 billion. Total debt stands at $7.8 billion, suggesting that the company overnight could operate with a net cash position of around $800 million. That is a bit too optimistic, as it seems that this will become a taxable event because of the structuring of the deal, yet the conclusion seems fair to say that eBay operates with a flattish net cash position following the deal.Trading at $35 per share, the 837 million shares outstanding represent a $29 billion equity valuation implying that eBay's operating assets are valued at $32 billion ahead of the deal.For the current year the company guides for more or less flattish reported revenues, although up slightly adjusted for currency effects. Sales are seen at a range of $10.75-$10.80 billion, with adjusted earnings seen around $2.75-$2.78 per share. With a $32 billion valuation ahead of the deal, all of eBay is valued just below 3 times sales, far below the multiple at which StubHub is now valued. This is certainly the case as segment margins of the unit come in at low double digits, below that of eBay at large.The sale of the unit at a very high segment profit multiple suggests that interest expenses being avoided, or actually net interest income being generated, more than offsets the earnings contribution of the unit. Hence, eBay will shrink somewhat in sales, but not in profits, as the adjusted earnings number should not really be impacted. Note however that this number excludes over half a billion in stock-based compensation, or about $0.60 per share, being a real expense. Hence I am happy to work with a $2.20 per share realistic earnings number.Based on the $2.20 per share in fair earnings power as calculated above, the initial optimism fades quite rapidly. Trading around the $36 mark, shares actually trade at 16 times realistic earnings measure. While this marks a small discount to the market, and we have to acknowledge that the company operates with a flattish net cash position, reality is that growth is pretty much non-existent. The counterargument is that more focus on the core should perhaps reignite growth somewhat, although the days of double digit growth are far behind us, and the question is if this could be achieved again.In January of this year I last looked at eBay following the involvement of Elliott Management, the activist investor. This investor aggressively called for a spin-off or sale of StubHub and Classifieds, as the first has happened now. At the time, Elliott actually put the value of StubHub at $3.5-$4.5 billion, with the deal tag coming right within the middle of the range. That bodes well for the classified business, valued at $8-12 billion by Elliott.Trading at $30 in January, Elliott believes that good execution might allow shares to double in 2020, as I called that guidance downright aggressive, with shares now at $36, down from the highs in the low-forties this summer.I noted that while Elliott might be right, I had my own concerns about the thesis on the remaining core business, certainly given the fierce and relentless competitive threat posed by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). This competitive threat and the usual ''solution'' of selling assets and cutting costs might not just do it in this case, although it is too early to rule on the outcome of the Elliott thesis, and in fact shares are up 20% from those levels.While a sale of the Classified business at $8-12 billion could be very compelling, adding about $8-12 per share in cash, eBay remains a show-me-first story, although one which I will follow with continued healthy interest. For now I am sticking to a neutral to slightly upbeat thesis, although the risk-reward is not good enough to jump on board in my opinion."
4324431,22717,2020-02-14T16:19:42-05:00,"eBay just closed on the sale of StubHub. It is going to use the net proceeds of $3 billion to buy back shares.In the past 2 years, eBay has been repurchasing $1 billion worth of stock a quarter. As a result, its shares outstanding have dropped one-third in 3 years.The buyback yield is 14.4% based on its 2019 average buybacks. eBay's dividend yield is 1.7%. So its total yield is now 16.1% annually.Based on this my estimate is that the stock will be worth 50% more in 2 years. This is based on the run-rate of FCF in Q4 divided by its FCF yield and 25% fewer shares in 2 years.This model is very simple and shows the power of the total yield approach to stock investing. Subscribers to the Total Yield Value Guide can see the model.","On February 13, 2020, eBay (EBAY) closed on the sale of StubHub. It received a net of $3.1 billion. eBay immediately issued a press release saying it would use the proceeds to buy back $4.5 billion in shares during 2020:Source: 2-13-20 Press ReleaseSince EBAY stock has a $29.6 billion market value, the $4.5 billion in buybacks this year gives the stock a buyback yield of 15.2%. To be conservative in my modeling of EBAY stock, I have assumed that the buybacks will be at the average for the past 8 quarters. More on this below.Here is the bottom line: In 2 years, EBAY stock will be worth 50% more based on these massive buybacks and the company's FCF. I will show you how I derive this model. But first, let's look at what EBAY has been doing with buybacks.EBAY has been on a buyback binge. This is based on the massive amount of free cash flow (""FCF"") it has been generating. Look at the table below, where you can see the last 12 months (""LTM"") history of its FCF generation:Source: Hake calculationsThis chart shows that on a rolling quarterly LTM basis, EBAY has been producing over $2 billion annually. In fact, in the last several quarters its FCF generation has been over $2.5 billion annually.Now, since the market value of the stock is just $29.6 billion, that means its FCF yield is now over 8.6%. In addition, EBAY has begun paying a dividend in the last 4 quarters. It started out at $0.14 per quarter, and just raised the dividend to $0.16 per quarter. So that gives the EBAY stock a prospective dividend yield of 1.72% (i.e. $0.64 dividend per share / $37.19 stock price).So the total yield is now between 16 and 17% annually. That is derived from the 15% buyback yield and the 1.72% dividend yield.Source: Hake estimatesSource: HakeAs I said above, I estimate that the annualized buybacks will be the average of the past 8 quarters which is $1.067 billion.Source: Hake calculationsHere is the result of all these buybacks. EBAY has cut its shares outstanding by one-third in the past three years:Source: Hake calculationsThis is amazing. There are only a few companies, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that have such an aggressive buyback program. And just since some always asks, yes, this includes the small number of shares that the company issues to employees. This is the net result of the buybacks.That is important since it will allow us to estimate the value of the company going forward.But first, let's look at how EBAY has paid for this.As you can see in the second chart above, there is a deficit between the amount of FCF EBAY generates and its buybacks. In fact, if you look at the dividends and debt paid down, the net deficit has increased.Source: Hake calculationsIt is easier to see this in chart form. The first chart below shows the total uses of EBAY's FCF in the past several years, by quarter:Source: Hake calculations and formulationSo, as a result, the net deficit has increased. But EBAY has paid for this deficit by reducing its net cash and increasing its net debt.Source: HakeSo you can see that the net deficit of $8 billion has been roughly paid for by the increase in debt.Source; Hake calculationsSo, as a result, the company has drawn its net cash balance of $2.3 billion in Q3 2017 and increased borrowing so that now it has a net debt balance of $3.59 billion. Note this includes its long-term investments. In other words, adding up all its long-term stakes in other companies, plus marketable securities plus cash, less total debt outstanding, results in a net balance of $3.59 billion as of Q4 2019.So you can see that the asset sale of $4.05 billion for StubHub on Feb 13, 2020, which resulted in net cash of $.1 billion effectively eliminates the net debt balance.But, as EBAY made clear, they are going to use all those proceeds to buy back $4.5 billion of shares in 2020.Why are they doing this? What do they think will be the result? We can model this out.We can derive a simple model using existing trends. It is very simple. There are three steps: (1) Calculate how many shares will be outstanding in two years based on existing trends; (2) Calculate the market value based on its expected FCF in two years, and (3) Divide the market value by the new lower number of shares in two years. Here is the result.Source: Hake calculationsNote the bottom line is that the shares outstanding will be lower by 25% in 2 years, even if the stock price rises 10% per year each year.Next, we estimate the market value of the stock and divide that value by the new lower number of shares outstanding:Source: Hake calculationsThis model says, based on the annualized FCF in Q4 2019 time 4, there will be $2.688 billion in annual FCF generated by the company each year. Then, we divide that number by today's FCF yield, which is 8.65%. But I decided to improve that yield by at least 5% since the market will likely value the stock more by 10% each year. This brings the yield to 8.04%. That results in a new market value of $33.4 billion. This is 12.9% higher than today's market value of $29.6 billion.Now we can take the third step. Dividing $33.4 billion, by the new 25% fewer number of shares outstanding in two years (596.8 million) results in a stock price of $56.00 per share. That is 50.6% higher than today's price.So this is a simple model which shows why management is so aggressive in buying back its shares. It expects to return significant value to shareholders in a very short period of time by doing this.eBay is aggressively buying back its shares. It is doing $4.5 billion a year. Based on its $29.6 billion market value that represents over 15% in buyback yield. Adding in the 1.72% dividend yield results in a total yield of over 16%.I have shown that the stock is worth $56.00 per share, based on this buyback model. That is a potential expected gain of over 50% for EBAY stock.If you liked this article, click on the like button (and the follow-on real-time alert for future articles)."

Its GMV declined in the US and it missed revenue estimates. While the new internet sales tax laws are partly to blame, increasing competition is also a tough challenge for eBay.eBay's Q3 revenues remained flat over the year at $2.6 billion, missing analyst estimates of $2.65 billion. Net income narrowed to $310 million or $0.37 per share from $720 million or $0.73 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $0.67, beating the analyst forecast of $0.64.By segment, the Marketplace platform revenues grew 1% to $1.83 billion, with US GMV declining 6% to $8.5 billion and international GMV up 1% to $13.2 billion. eBay's transaction take rate, the fee it charges sellers to use its platform, grew to 8.93% from 8.39% a year ago but was down from last quarter's 9.4%. Global active buyers and customers increased by 4% to 183 million.StubHub transaction revenues were flat at $286 million with its GMV flat at $1.2 billion. Marketing services and Other revenues were down 5% to $534 million with revenue from Classifieds growing 4% to $265 million and marketplace marketing revenue declining 16% to $254 million. eBay is yet to decide on the fate of its StubHub and Classifieds businesses. It is expected to take a final call in the next quarter.eBay experienced strong momentum for its two new business lines. Since launching the managed payments offering approximately one year ago, eBay has processed over $1.1 billion in payments for more than 20,000 sellers, with over $500 million of those payments processed in Q3. In September, the service reached 9.4% of volume in the U.S. and successfully launched in a second market, Germany.First-party advertising also continued its momentum. It now has over 1 million sellers promoting over 300 million listings on the marketplace, which has resulted in revenue of $103 million, up 119%.The company's cash and cash equivalents and non-equity investments portfolio totaled $4.2 billion as of September 30, 2019. The company repurchased approximately $1.0 billion of its common stock, or 25 million shares, in the third quarter of 2019. The company's total repurchase authorization remaining as of September 30, 2019, was $3.2 billion. The company also paid cash dividends of $115 million during the third quarter of 2019.For the fourth quarter, eBay forecast revenues of $2.77-2.82 billion with non GAAP EPS of $0.73-0.76. The market was looking for revenues of $2.81 billion with an EPS of $0.76. eBay expects to end the year with revenues of $10.75-10.80 billion and an EPS of $2.75-2.78. The market was looking for revenues of $10.78 billion with an EPS of $2.77 for the year.During the quarter, eBay introduced new tools and features to enhance the customer experience and attract sellers to its platform. It integrated Terapeak into Seller Hub in major markets. Terapeak is a suite of features that help sellers identify what to sell, when to sell, and how to price inventory. The company also introduced additional seller protections.eBay also continued to enhance the new buyer experience. It announced a Managed Delivery fulfillment service in the U.S. and bolstered its grocery partnership with Coles in Australia. Additionally, Multi-User Account Access became available for sellers in the U.S., with a planned expansion to Germany in 2020.eBay's GMV in the US has been declining by 5% to 6% each quarter through the first nine months of the year due to the new internet sales tax laws. The impact is expected to persist in the fourth quarter and through 2020, as California, Texas, and nine other states enacted their laws last month.However, the slowdown in GMV is not just limited to the US. International GMV growth has also declined from 7% growth a year ago to just 1% this quarter.eBay's biggest competitor, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), also faces the same internet sales tax challenge, but it is growing at over 20%. To offset the GMV slowdown, eBay is taking a leaf out of Amazon's playbook. Pricing for eBay's new fulfillment service will be competitive with the rest of the industry and it hopes to attract more sellers. But eBay will be getting into another highly competitive arena with this move.Its stock is currently trading at $35.14 with a market capitalization of $28.6 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $42 in August. It had fallen to a 52-week low of $26.01 in December.Original postEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

The internet auction site, once one of the proudest and most innovative companies in Silicon Valley, has continued its slow death march into irrelevance. eBay has just reported fourth-quarter results and initiated fourth quarter guidance - and just like last quarter, investors aren't impressed. Shares of eBay are down more than 5% on the news:Data by YChartsThere are many investors in the eBay camp who now think the stock is a value play. eBay is roughly flat over the past twelve months (versus a ~30% lift for the S&P 500 as a whole), the stock is trading at a ~16x P/E ratio (well below the current S&P 500 average), and eBay has started a massive capital returns program to assuage worried investors. Yet there are plenty of reasons (hiding in plain sight in eBay's most recent string of quarterly results, plus its new dim outlook for 2020) that indicate that eBay is instead a value trap.There's no doubt that Amazon (AMZN), as well as other niche-focused e-commerce plays like Etsy (ETSY), have pushed eBay into irrelevance. Investors should continue to steer clear of eBay and invest elsewhere.If we look across most of the major technology companies that have reported earnings thus far this year, the outlook is, at the very worst, cautiously optimistic. Not in eBay's case. The company has flat-out admitted that it's no longer capable of growing. Take a look at the company's recently-initiated 2020 outlook below:Figure 1. eBay 2020 outlookSource: eBay Q4 earnings deckKey to note as well is that, when tallying up eBay's FX-neutral growth drivers (which adds up to minor single-digit positive growth), the company expects its core Marketplace volume to be a headwind. Sure, advertising will provide some measure of growth - but at its heart, eBay is a marketplace business. If its flagship marketplace is in trouble, then the rest of the company is as well.Wall Street analysts had pegged a consensus revenue figure of $10.92 billion (+1% y/y) for FY20, the exact top end of eBay's range. History shows, however, that eBay's guidance isn't the most conservative of forecasts - unlike the majority of the tech sector, which tends to gradually increase its outlook throughout the year. At one point, eBay's FY19 revenue guidance called for $10.85-$10.93 billion in total revenues. It cut its outlook twice from that point (in Q2 and Q3) and ended up generating only $10.80 billion in revenues.It's difficult to justify investing in a company that is forecasting zero growth when it's also shouldering such a large debt load. As of the end of the fourth quarter, eBay held $7.8 billion in debt and $3.8 billion in cash - totaling net debt of $4.0 billion.Figure 2. eBay debt loadSource: eBay Q4 earnings deckThe company's accelerated pace of share repurchases (it just authorized an additional $4 billion in repurchases) also exceeds its free cash flow intake. Investors should be careful of a company that is aggressively pursuing shareholder returns programs while facing headwinds in its core business.There's a good reason eBay isn't projecting any growth in 2020: trends look incredibly poor exiting Q4.The most important metric to look at here, of course, is GMV. For investors new to eBay, Gross Merchandise Value is the aggregate sum of all the goods traded on eBay's platform, from which eBay then takes a revenue cut. It's GMV that ultimately dictates the direction of eBay's revenue trends.Figure 3. eBay GMV trendsSource: eBay Q4 earnings deckAs seen in the chart above, eBay's U.S. GMV growth decelerated a further two points from -6% y/y decline in Q3 to a -8% y/y decline in Q4. International GMV, meanwhile, slipped from positive +1% y/y growth in Q3 to a-1% y/y decline this quarter. Note as well that in the past, eBay was able to claim that while dollar-based GMV was down, constant-currency GMV remained flat. As of Q3 (and worsening in Q4), this is no longer true.Another metric we've been tracking closely over the past several quarters: eBay's total pool of active buyers. In Q4, that figure remained flat at 183 million (+2% y/y), slowing down two points from last quarter's +4% y/y growth. This is yet another data point that illustrates how sidelined eBay has become in the modern e-commerce marketplace, among a plethora of better-positioned rivals.Figure 4. eBay active buyer trendsSource: eBay Q4 earnings deckIt's equally important to note that these marketplace weaknesses have driven eBay's revenue (on an as-reported basis) to -2% y/y this quarter. What's meaningful about this number is that eBay's guidance actually calls for acceleration in FY20, to a range of -1% y/y to +1% y/y growth (or +1% y/y to +3% y/y on a constant-currency basis, vs. +1%. y/y in Q4).Figure 5. eBay revenue trendsSource: eBay Q4 earnings deckWhere have we seen any acceleration in eBay's results? eBay's core business has been in a steep secular decline since the second half of 2018, when growth was still hovering in the ~6% y/y range. Are investors truly comfortable banking on this legacy internet company to accelerate its revenue growth when all its trends point otherwise?eBay's generous capital returns program, as well as its continuous ability to generate moderate free cash flows despite zero growth, will prevent the stock from completely sinking in the near future. However, with growth projections flat and GMV trends continuing to turn south, it's difficult to imagine any tailwinds for this stock that can drive a multiples re-ration. More than likely is that eBay stock will continue to vastly underperform the broader markets as it did in 2019. Remain on the sidelines here."

4303119,103763,2019-11-06T08:55:43-05:00,"eBay recently reported Q3 results, delivering above consensus numbers - yet shares are down over 9% since the report.The company's core marketplace segment has seen GMV growth decelerate and revenues stagnate.Going forward, we believe that the company will face increased competition from specialized marketplaces.In spite of this, the company is valued similarly to industry-leading peers - we believe investors can find better returns elsewhere.","eBay (EBAY) is one of the world's largest e-commerce marketplaces processing over $100 billion in annual gross merchandise volume. The company's achievements are nothing short of impressive.SourceJust this past week, the company reported their Q3 results which came in higher than consensus estimates. Shares dipped after the release as activist investors continue to pressure the company to spin off its StubHub and Classifieds business.Looking years down the road, we believe eBay is vulnerable in an increasingly competitive e-commerce environment. Although the company boasts a strong network effect, the rise of new specialized marketplaces has the potential to chip away at this. At a valuation in-line with better-performing peers, we believe that long-term investors can find better returns elsewhere.When eBay first came to life in the early 1990s, the company was one of the first e-commerce marketplaces. This first-to-market advantage allowed the company to create a strong network effect. This was further helped by the subsidization of seller fees. Much like a snowball, the company grew to considerable scale and value. In 2018, eBay's share of e-commerce was larger than retail icons like Apple (AAPL), Walmart (WMT), and Costco (COST).Source: TechCrunch, eMarketerSince then, the company - with the help of its strong network effect - has become a significant player in the e-commerce space. With business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer transactions taking place, items on the eBay marketplace are widespread serving many different verticals.Yet in recent years, we have seen the rise of many specialized marketplaces. These new specialized marketplaces have grown to significant sizes themselves, and are serving specific verticals. One example of a specialized marketplace is CarGurus (CARG) which has both B2C and C2C offerings.These new specialized marketplaces will break up eBay's widespread marketplace by offering niche marketplaces with a much more tailored set of solutions to buyers and sellers. In the coming years, we continue to expect new entrants and believe this poses a risk to eBay's core marketplace offering.Source: QuickFSTrailing twelve-month revenue came in at $10.9 billion in Q3, flat year-over-year. Total gross merchandise volume decreased by ~2% y/y, with marketplace GMV also declining by 2% y/y. TTM active buyers on the marketplace continued to increase steadily at 4% y/y, with transaction take rate increasing 30 bps sequentially and 50 bps y/y.Marketplace GMV comprises ~94% of total GMV. Marketplace revenues - both transaction and MS&O - comprised nearly 80% of revenue. Going forward, we believe this segment is most vulnerable to new specialized marketplaces which can chip away at the company's network effect and adversely impact transaction volume.StubHub saw GMV growth come in flat year-over-year. StubHub transaction take rate increased by 10 bps y/y, and 150 bps sequentially. In the recent past, activist investors have been pushing for eBay to spin off StubHub. In Q3, StubHub revenue comprised ~11% of total revenues.Source: QuickFSGross margins in the quarter continued to slide, reaching ~77.2%, down 50 bps y/y. On the operational side, the company spend just over 30% of their revenue on sales & marketing. In the long run, should new vertical marketplaces really take off, we wouldn't be surprised to see eBay ramping up S&M spend in an effort to retain active buyers which could pose a risk to margins.Looking at free cash flow, the firm is quite profitable. Operating cash flow margins sit at ~38%. Given low CAPEX, the firm is able to turn up strong free cash flow margins. However, we see this as a double-edged sword - it places eBay in a vulnerable position against competitors with deep pockets. With nothing more than their network effect, we see eBay in a vulnerable state.When comparing eBay to other marketplaces, the company's valuation is in-line with the peer median of ~3.8x EV/sales. Marketplaces like Etsy (ETSY) and CarGurus (CARG) trade at lofty multiples given their high growth rates, while industry leaders like Amazon.com (AMZN) trade at sub-4x EV/sales.Source: Yahoo! FinanceWhen an industry-leading company like Amazon is trading in-line with eBay, which has seen GMV growth decline y/y and faces considerable competition in the coming years, we become skeptical of the company's valuation. With this in mind, we believe long-term investors can find better returns elsewhere."
4302646,105217,2019-11-05T12:24:59-05:00,"When I last analyzed eBay, the share price had developed very promisingly until then.Nevertheless, I came to the conclusion not to be fooled by this. The current third quarter results have proved me right.Personally, I am missing the long-term perspective of the company. I therefore expect prices to decline further in the medium term.","When I last analyzed eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), the share price had developed very promisingly until then. At that time, the share price was only ten percent away from the all-time high. The share price increases were backed by good half-year numbers. In the second quarter, eBay grew active buyers by 4 percent across its platforms, for a total of 182 million global active buyers. Furthermore, eBay raised EPS guidance for the full year, which was the second quarter in a row. Investors speculated that the share prices would exceed the all-time high in the near future. Nevertheless, I came to the conclusion not to be fooled by this. In particular, I doubted whether the investments made would actually be sufficient to catch up with companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). I also missed a long-term plan and criticized the bad relationship with the sellers. I also wanted a stronger focus on vertical integration of services. To sum it up, this was my conclusion:Now, eBay has published the latest quarterly figures. I expect that investors will have to be prepared for further declines in prices despite a favorable overall environment.Let's look at first at the highlights of the third quarter results:eBay really surprised positively with a jump in earnings per share of almost 20 percent. It is also worth noting that eBay still attracts more buyers every quarter.(Source: Third quarter results)However, the first negative aspects of the quarterly figures can already be seen here. eBay performs worse than the overall market. This can be seen in several aspects. By this, I mean the growth of buyers in e-commerce and the growth of total turnover in e-commerce.This projection from eMarketer shows that growth of digital buyers in general is much bigger than the growth of eBay's active buyers:(Source: Digital buyers worldwide)A summary of projected sales from eMarketer shows that retail e-commerce sales will increase to USD 4.058 trillion in 2020, making up 14.6 percent of total retail spending. This shows that eBay is operating in a growing market and thus should have good growth opportunities.(Source: Retail e-commerce sales worldwide)However, this is offset by extremely weak eBay revenue figures. Revenue was up 3 percent. And that brings us to the next negative aspects: Gross Merchandise Value (""GMV""). GMV was down 2 percent. This is far from Amazon's double-digit growth rates in GMV. To sum it up, Amazon has more customers, handles more sales and also grows faster than eBay. In particular, Amazon has grown vertically along the value chain in online distribution. The company has been able to provide incentives for both retailers and customers to use the Amazon Platform through free shipping with Amazon Prime and alternative delivery options in some countries.Likewise, eBay seems to be acting without any plan in terms of growth in the marketplaces business:I would have liked to have seen a much stronger focus on vertical growth.. In particular, eBay's logistics subsidiary Shutl launched the beta phase for two new multi channel logistics solutions designed to make 24-hour shipping easier for eBay sellers. This service is particularly promising. This will allow merchants to ship not only orders from eBay customers, but also goods sold through other channels. Theoretically, in the long run, it would even be possible to send Amazon orders from the eBay fulfillment warehouse of a multi-marketplace retailer. But eBay doesn't seem to have any further information about it or any other interest in expanding this service.Rather, eBay is now considering strategic options, which means the sale of business units. Especially eBay Classifieds Group is available for disposal. The same applies to the StubHub platforms. If a spin-off is considered here, shareholders can benefit here, as for example with the spin-off from PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). But then, you can also wait for the spin-off and then buy the company. The most important thing for me, however, is that such a spin-off would destroy vertical opportunities and at most create short-term profits for eBay.The company also tries elsewhere to keep its investors happy. Since this year, eBay pays a quarterly dividend to its shareholders. Over the year the payout amounts to USD 0.56. In addition, the company buys back its own shares. In the third quarter of 2019, eBay repurchased approximately USD 1.0 billion of its common stock, or 25 million shares. eBay's total repurchase authorization remaining as of September 30, 2019, was USD 3.2 billion. The share buybacks indicated that management believes the company is undervalued. However, it may also be a sign that management has no other use for the money.Personally, I am missing the long-term perspective of the company. The new quarterly figures have confirmed this. The company is worse than its competitors and currently has no ace up its sleeve to accelerate long-term growth. Selling pearls will only bring joy in the short term, but increase difficulties in the long term. As a long-term investor, a purchase is therefore out of question for me.(Source: eBay webpage)If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on my latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article, and check ""Get email alerts""."
4298586,103480,2019-10-24T10:43:04-04:00,"Shares of eBay declined 6% after reporting poor third-quarter earnings results.Though eBay's EPS beat estimates again, revenue disappointed as core user growth continued to show signs of sluggishness.GMV declined -4% y/y, the worst performance in many quarters.Avoid buying shares of a company that's behind the times.","Prior to releasing its third-quarter earnings results, shares of eBay (EBAY) were flirting near all-time high territory, with most investors cheering eBay's improved profitability, plans to spin off non-core subsidiaries, and largely ignoring the decay in eBay's core marketplace business. That changed after Q3, when all eyes turned back to the heart of the issue: eBay's GMV, or gross merchandising volume. Intrinsically at heart, we all know that online shoppers just aren't going to eBay anymore; Amazon.com (AMZN) has firmly won the e-commerce war. Yet eBay's GMV - which has been flat or declining for each of the past several quarters - cements that reality into cold numbers.Disappointed by eBay's third-quarter print, shares of eBay fell more than 6% after-hours on the news.Data by YChartsMany investors will be tempted to buy the dip in eBay - after all, it's an iconic brand, and earlier this year its stock rocketed from below $30. In my view, however, investors should avoid buying shares of a company whose users are defecting and whose core business is at risk. With eBay also shedding non-core divisions such as StubHub, there is little room for the company to grow beyond its primary auction platform. And who, these days, really prefers auction-style buying when virtually anything can be bought from Amazon and arrive at your doorstep two days later?Steer clear here. eBay's third-quarter update brings plenty of new red flags, and investors getting in now are buying shares of a company that is limping toward old age and obsolescence.Hands down, the single-most important metric that investors should be watching in eBay right now is its GMV - which quantifies the dollar value of all the goods that flow through its platform. Hit hard by competition on the buyers' side as well as angst from sellers about high fees, eBay has struggled to maintain the popularity that its platform had in its heyday.Quarter-over-quarter, eBay's GMV story deteriorated markedly. Total GMV fell -4.4% y/y to $21.7 billion, or -2% y/y on a currency-neutral basis, or two points worse than the prior quarter. The U.S. saw its weakest performance in six quarters in Q3, while international performance also declined to flat (versus high single-digit growth in the back half of FY18).Figure 1. eBay GMVSource: eBay Q3 earnings deckEqually concerning is the fact that the number of items sold on the eBay platform declined -3% y/y. All metrics point to the harsh reality that both buyers and sellers are defecting from eBay.eBay's CEO, Scott Schenkel, noted on the Q3 earnings call that one of the biggest headwinds to GMV growth is the recent implementation of the U.S. sales tax on online purchases. Unfortunately, this is not a headwind that will fade.The key message here: expect U.S. performance to continue deteriorating. Not every state has implemented online sales-tax laws yet, and once more and more buyers are affected, U.S. GMV will get hit even harder.Yet underneath eBay's sagging GMV, the company still managed to keep revenues flat at $2.65 billion (representing two points of deceleration relative to +2% y/y growth last quarter). This was in-line with Wall Street's expectations:Figure 2. eBay revenue trendsSource: eBay Q3 earnings deckTo hold its revenue flat while seeing declining GMV trends, eBay has boosted its transaction take rate - up 50bps to 9.7% this quarter, versus 9.2% in the year-ago quarter. This implies an increase in seller fees - a revenue trick that can only be stretched so far. eBay already receives constant flak for having industry-high fees; and higher take rates are not a sustainable source of growth. Without finding a way to reinvigorate GMV growth, eBay is dead in the water.Amid such poor current-quarter performance, few investors probably noticed the fact that eBay slashed - yet again - its revenue outlook for the full year. The company is now guiding to full-year revenues of $10.75-10.80 billion, a cut at the top end relative to the Q2 view of $10.75-$10.83 billion, and a drastic cut relative to eBay's Q1 view of $10.85-$10.93 billion:Figure 3. eBay guidance updateSource: eBay Q3 earnings deckDespite the revenue cut, eBay has raised its EPS target - yet again. The company's full-year EPS view of $2.75-$2.78 is three cents higher at the high end relative to a prior range of $2.70-$2.75. The company is trying to build excitement around the fact that it has slightly improved its operating margin profile. But eBay is mainly doing this through cutting its advertising budget, down 170bps as a percentage of revenues in Q3 - which was barely even enough to offset a one-point increase in cost of revenues:Figure 4. eBay margin trendsSource: eBay Q3 earnings deckI worry that a focus on squeezing every penny out of the bottom line and curtailing customer outreach will further hurt growth, especially in a new tax environment that is already proving to cast a deep chill on eBay's U.S. sales. eBay's pile of debt - $7.8 billion on an absolute basis, and $3.6 billion on a net basis after stripping out cash - is equally concerning, especially to a business whose revenue growth is dipping positive and which has to rely on advertising cuts to sustain cash flow.With this quarter's results, we saw that online sales tax implementation drove eBay's worst U.S. performance in recent memory, and even international sales - a bright spot amid declining U.S. trends in FY18 - is seeing a meaningful slowdown. In my reason, eBay stock has no fundamental justification for being up 27% YTD (even after the Q3 tumble). Investors would be wise to avoid eBay and instead buy shares of cloud software companies that have been pummeled, with many high-quality names like Workday (WDAY) and New Relic (NEWR) trading well below 30% of peak value."

It is also very likely that this will be the case again.As a long-term investor, a purchase is therefore out of question for me.","After the eBay (EBAY) share price has slumped sharply, it is now back on the upswing. The share price is only ten percent away from the all-time high.Data by YChartsGiven that, it seems that the company is back on course. The share price increases are backed by good half year numbers. In the second quarter, eBay grew active buyers by 4 percent across its platforms, for a total of 182 million global active buyers. The Marketplace platforms delivered USD 2.2 billion of revenue and USD 21.5 billion of Gross Merchandise Value (""GMV""). Marketplace revenue growth was 1 percent on an as-reported basis and 3 percent on a FX-Neutral basis. StubHub, eBay's online ticket exchange company platforms drove revenue of USD 264 million, up 7 percent. GMV was USD 1.1 billion, up 5 percent. Classifieds platforms delivered revenue of USD 271 million, up 5 percent (up 12 percent on a FX-Neutral basis). Furthermore, based on these results, eBay raised EPS guidance for the full year. This was the second quarter in a row. Investors could speculate that the share prices will exceed the all time high in the near future. This might be true as the forward P/E ratio of 14.58 indicates that the company is slightly undervalued.One problem that I want to highlight with this article is the relationship between eBay and its retailers.eBay is dependent on its retailersTo understand what I mean, lets do a role backwards to some economic basics.The success of platform markets is mainly built on economic network effects: The more customers make purchases on a platform, the greater the incentive for other retailers to also use eBay as a platform. This attracts even more customers. This gives the platform provider the power to establish new services etc. and the circle continues:(Source: Indirect Network Effects)Over time, this effect becomes like an avalanche that gets bigger and bigger. In essence, however, the driving force behind this growth remains the same: a high number of returning users. However, as always, in every lever lies a risk. I strongly believe that the lack of retailers will lead to a drop in user numbers and buyers. But with fewer buyers on the platform, the platform will become less attractive for the retail side. The same effects that led to a platform's growth would therefore be reversed.For a long time, the company has not been able to offer its retailers more value. This was where the first negative impacts of the network effects took effect. eBay suddenly found it difficult to match new buyers and retailers on its platforms. This was due solely to the poor management of eBay and not to more general circumstances. This can be seen especially at Amazon. Amazon was able to gain a huge advantage because it not only presents itself to the retailers as a platform, but also as a logistics partner. Accordingly, regarding the retailer platform, Amazon (AMZN) has more customers, handles more sales and also grows faster than eBay. In particular, Amazon has grown vertically along the value chain in online distribution. The company has been able to provide incentives for both retailers and customers to use the Amazon Platform through free shipping with Amazon Prime and alternative delivery options in some countries.eBay tries hardIn view of this development, it was absolutely clear that eBay had to invest. Taking Amazon's development as a benchmark, eBay needs to drive vertical growth along the online retail value chain. An important step was taken here last year. eBay's logistics subsidiary Shutl launched the beta phase for two new multi channel logistics solutions designed to make 24-hour shipping easier for eBay sellers. A service is particularly promising. This will allow merchants to ship not only orders from eBay customers, but also goods sold through other channels. Theoretically, in the long run it would even be possible to send Amazon orders from the eBay fulfillment warehouse of a multi-marketplace retailer.Likewise, eBay tries to keep investors happy elsewhere. Since this year, eBay pays a quarterly dividend to its shareholders. Over the year the payout amounts to USD 0.56. In addition, the company buys back its own shares. The share buybacks indicated that management believes the company is undervalued. However, it may also be a sign that management has no other use for the money. The relatively low P/E ratio speaks for the former.Singer's entry is not sustainableBut all this is torn down again in my opinion because the activist investors Elliott Management and Starboard Value are demanding eBay to divest its non-core activities and focus on its core business. Ebay Classifieds Group, (including the car brokerage platform mobile.de), is available for disposal.However, I find this pointless, as it only offers short-term added value through special payouts or one-time share buybacks. In the long run, however, the vertical deepening will be lost. Such a measure would therefore only create added value for shareholders in the short term, but would be extremely detrimental to the company in the long term.Comparable actions have so far only hurt eBay and its investors. In 2015, it was Carl Icahn who pushed through the PayPal (PYPL) spin-off. But that was only a blessing for PayPal. PayPal market capitalization is now USD 123 billion. In contrast, eBay's market capitalization today is only USD 37 billion. The same applies to MercadoLibre (MELI). eBay sold its shares in 2016 for USD 1.05 billion in 2016. Today, MercadoLibre has a market capitalization of USD 49 billion. Furthermore, today, the shares in MercadoLibre would be worth almost USD 5 billion.Conclusion(Source: eBay webpage)I really appreciate it when companies keep investors happy with dividends and share repurchases. However, I doubt whether this is the right way for eBay. I would have preferred to see investments in vertical growth so that eBay could build a lever of network effects. When it comes to spin offs, I am extremely sceptical. It will bring maximum short-term success, but it will undermine the foundation on which the success of any platform is built.

(EBAY) is a high-quality, platform business that is currently selling at a significant discount to my estimate of fair value. Most people are aware of eBay, but might still believe that it’s primarily an auction site. The company has, however, developed into a marketplace for third-party sellers to sell their goods at fixed prices - mostly not at auction - with almost $100 billion of gross market value (GMV) sold to 180 million buyers through the platform in 2018.eBay also owns StubHub, the largest secondary market for selling tickets to live events, and a group of international classifieds’ websites - the Classifieds Group - that are dominant in their respective markets. Both of these businesses are small in comparison to the eBay marketplace and are currently tee’d up for sale, with pressure coming from two activist investors - Elliott Management and Starboard Value.Elliott, owner of a 4% stake in eBay, and Starboard, owner of a 1% stake in eBay, began putting pressure on eBay’s management and board at the beginning of 2019 to right the ship, based on the then low and still currently low, share price of the company. After discussions between eBay and the two activist investors, the two sides came to an agreement in early March, giving the activists two board seats and a promise from eBay to perform a strategic review of its assets. In other words, see if they can get a good price for StubHub and the Classifieds Group or spin them off. In Elliott’s public letter to eBay, they said that eBay is worth $60 to $65 per share if eBay follows Elliott’s plan to unlock value - eBay was selling near $33 per share at the time. That provides significant upside from the current share price of ~$40/share if Elliott is correct, so it’s worth exploring whether Elliott’s valuation is realistic. Before that though, it’s critical to understand Elliott’s plan for unlocking value.Selling or Spinning off StubHub and the Classifieds Group would accomplish two goals: (1) it would allow management to focus on the core Marketplace and (2) it would be directly accretive to shareholders because both businesses should sell at much higher multiples than the current multiple of eBay as a whole. First let’s look at management’s focus.eBay has made a number of acquisitions over the years that were very smart in hindsight, including owning PayPal and Skype for a number of years. PayPal was bought in 2003 and sold in 2015. Skype was acquired in 2005, partially sold in 2009 and the remainder sold in 2011. PayPal is a very successful standalone company and Skype is a popular business communication program now owned by Microsoft. These acquisitions, although profitable for the company, have distracted eBay from its core Marketplace, where it has lost market share over the years to other platforms made for third-party sellers.StubHub and the Classifieds Group were eBay acquisitions as well, but are distractions from the core Marketplace. Selling those businesses and limiting future acquisitions to businesses that support/upgrade the core Marketplace will allow management to focus on growing and/or maintaining market share in the online retail space, with a U.S. market that is consistently growing at a 15%+ pace.Second, eBay sells at a price that is a little over 15x 2018 earnings. If it divests StubHub and/or the Classifieds Group, it should receive multiples much higher for each business, which will be directly accretive to shareholders. This especially makes sense because there are no strategic advantages to having the three businesses under the same roof.Over the past three years, eBay’s operating margin has shrunk from 25% to under 21%, mainly due to a significantly larger increase in sales and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses, in comparison to revenues. Focusing on expense management, while continuing to innovate, will be key for eBay to reach Elliott’s estimated value.eBay had a plan to return roughly $3.5 to $4.0 billion to shareholders through share buybacks in 2019. Elliott wanted the company to accelerate the buyback plan to $5 billion, which was agreed upon between Elliott and eBay and announced as part of the settlement between the two. Accelerating buybacks is a smart decision because the stock price is low and buybacks will be accretive to shareholders.eBay has been aggressively buying back shares for a while now, reducing its share count by almost 25% over the last five years. Assuming an average share price for buybacks of $39 in 2019, eBay could buy back over 128 million shares, reducing the share count by an additional 13% from its current level. As long as the share price remains depressed, I applaud these buybacks.Elliott also requested a dividend that provides a yield of roughly 1.5%, which eBay agreed to implement. I much would have rather seen all of the capital be returned in the form of share buybacks, but I’m okay with a small dividend.Elliott’s ultimate goal is for eBay to return approximately 80% of free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and buybacks, with the remaining 20% of free cash flow available to make strategic acquisitions of businesses that complement eBay’s core Marketplace.Elliott’s valuation numbers are quite aggressive, but there is still significant upside from the current share price of ~$41/share. Both StubHub and the Classifieds Group earned a little bit more than $1 billion in revenue in 2018, but eBay does not provide more detail about the costs and operating margins for each business, requiring assumptions to be made to value each business.The Classifieds Group should have significantly higher operating margins than StubHub and the eBay Marketplace. I applied operating margins of 47% to the Classifieds Group and around 17% to the other two businesses. I also applied a normalized 22% tax rate to each business line, assuming a 21% U.S. federal tax rate and a 1% adjustment to account for any additional state taxes, offset by any lower international taxes.With very high margins and high-quality growth, the Classifieds business deserves a high multiple. I applied a multiple between 22x and 28x 2018 income for the business to come to a total value for this business line between $8.2 billion and $10.4 billion. This is at the lower range of Elliott’s estimated value for the business.StubHub may have slightly higher margins than eBay based on its significantly higher take rate per transaction. To be conservative, however, I assumed that StubHub and eBay’s core Marketplace have the same operating margins. Because of StubHub’s dominant position in event ticket resales, I gave StubHub a multiple of 20 to 25 times 2018 earnings, for a value between $2.9 billion and $3.7 billion, which is lower than the range estimated by Elliott between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion. If you assume that StubHub has materially higher margins than eBay’s core Marketplace, it would be easy to get to Elliott’s values.It’s most likely that both StubHub and the Classifieds Group will be divested, so determining a likely exit multiple is the most appropriate valuation method. On the other hand, the Marketplace will be a continuing entity for shareholders and should be valued based on its discounted cash flow. With aggressive share buybacks in the near future and assumed operational efficiencies, earnings growth should be well above average for the next couple of years. After that, earnings growth will drop down more in line with revenue growth. If eBay can maintain market share, earnings growth would be near 15% per year. This, however, would be a tall task. I estimate that, with management’s sole focus on the core business, earnings can grow for 10% for the next few years, leveling off in a mid-to-high single-digit range for a few more years, followed by mid-single digit growth after that. The total value I estimate for the core Marketplace is between $34 billion and $40 billion, an implied multiple of 18 to 22 times my estimate of 2019 full-year earnings.There are risks to my thesis and valuation, including the possibility that eBay cannot find a buyer for either StubHub or the Classifieds Group at an appropriate price. Another option for those businesses would be to spin them off, but there’s no guarantee that the market would place an appropriate multiple on either business, especially because they would be smaller public companies than eBay and may have issues with forced sellers of the stock.Another issue is that eBay may not be able to realize the operational efficiencies necessary to increase margins. This would result in both lower earnings and lower earnings growth, coupled with most likely a lower multiple placed on the business by investors. This could be offset by continued aggressive share buybacks, but you’d also be stuck with owning a poorly operated company.eBay may also be too late to reinvigorate growth. Amazon has proven itself the dominant online retailer and other smaller retailers - Shopify, Etsy, etc., have continued to take market share and outmaneuver eBay.eBay may end up being old news, but the combination of activist investors pushing the company, aggressive share buybacks, moderate growth, and a low multiple of earnings makes for a situation with lots of upside and little downside, the kind of investment I’m always looking for."
4280417,103373,2019-08-01T17:43:14-04:00,"A lot of growth has been priced into the stock, but revenues have taken a hit.Debt levels are high and revenue growth prospects are looking flat.A possible StubHub sale could give them temporary respite, but the future is still too unclear to justify current valuation.Wait and watch, or be aware of the risks before getting in.","One of the major points of concern with respect to eBay Inc. (EBAY) has always been its ever-escalating debt levels over the past decade. Nothing much has changed, including the fact that eBay continues to deliver consensus-beating earnings for several quarters now. Bar the March 2019 quarter, their earnings surprise chart for the past 12 quarters (13 incl. Q2 2019 earnings) is all green, and the measure of surprise is getting larger as well. Q2 saw eBay beat an earnings consensus estimate of $0.62 by six cents or nearly 10%. While that's all well and good, the underlying story isn't as straightforward. The gist of this thesis is that this is a great company and it does have the ability to get through this time of revenue slowdown and high debt levels, but investing in it now deserves looking at the associated risks.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialIf we go a level deeper and look at their revenue numbers over the period, we'll see that between the June 2016 and March 2019 quarters, revenue has grown about 23 percent. In the first half of 2019, net revenue has grown by 2 percent, from $5.22 billion in the first half of 2018 to $5.33 billion YTD. Sounds like par for the course.Source: eBay Slide Presentation Q2 2019Step back and look at their net revenue growth for the past several years and things look a little more optimistic. Historically, Q3 and Q4 have been the seasonal peaks, and the annual growth rate stands at a very respectable 8.25% for the 2017-2018 period. However, that optimism is short-lived. Full-year revenue for 2018 was $10.75 billion and, using an upper guidance figure of $10.83 billion for 2019, that is a 1% growth rate. Revenue guidance for the next quarter is set at $2.61 billion to $2.66 billion, and full-year guidance is $10.75 billion to $10.83 billion, representing about one percentage point in year-over-year revenue growth. Even if they don't face heavy FX headwinds, we're looking at near-flat growth for the year. That's not an encouraging sign, especially when we've been seeing mid-to-high-single-digit revenue growth for the past three years or so.Source: Data from Seeking Alpha EssentialSource: Data from Seeking Alpha EssentialStill, on the topic of revenue, their recent agreement with PayTM Mall to extend their global offerings to the Indian market is a good strategic move, but revenues from such markets are not margin-friendly. Specific to India, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart-backed (NYSE:WMT) Flipkart have already got the country hooked on free shipping, next day delivery, same-day delivery, and attractive membership options. As such, eBay must bank on high GMV throughput with this channel to see any material impact on overall revenues and margins alike.Non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year, meanwhile, has been raised to $2.70 to $2.75; and for the third quarter, it has been raised to $0.62 to $0.65, representing 10% to 15% YoY growth.Estimate-beating numbers aren't that great when the top line isn't growing in a meaningful way and GAAP EPS is actually 27% down from the year-ago period. The market seems to think differently, though. As of this writing, the stock is trading near the peak levels it reached at the start of 2018.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialWith revenue growth rates coming down to low single digits, strong EPS growth means margin pressure.eBay's gross margins are holding steady at +75% levels, with Q2 2019 having reported a percentage point of growth in Cost of Revenue. But operating expenses are down across the board, specifically in sales and marketing, and product development. eBay needs more marketing-related spend to boost top-line growth, but that's not happening. It merely looks like eBay is tightening its belt to keep earnings flowing. This tightening of the belt, as it were, has given them a non-GAAP operating margin of 27%, up 170 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Source: eBay Q2 2019 slide presentationWhile it may not be the most sustainable way to grow earnings, it could serve the purpose until eBay's debt position is more under control.Speaking of debt, from a balance sheet perspective, the decision to pay down $1.6 billion of its debt in Q3 will reflect positively on its long-term debt, which currently stands at above $7.2 billion. However, short-term debt stands at $2.1 billion, up from $1.55 billion in the year-ago quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, and non-equity investments totaled $6.3 billion as at Q2 2019. eBay has also indicated that it expects to ""exit 2019 with cash and investments of approximately $3.5B."" Free Cash Flow for the quarter was reported at $607 million.It's not a situation to be worried about, but investors are advised to watch free cash flow and cash position, which will be important metrics to factor in - if the company faces prolonged flat-to-slow revenue growth in coming quarters. Meanwhile, expectant investors in eBay await any news of a StubHub re-think - not least of all because of its potential impact on the company's current financial situation.On the other side, eBay continues to buy back shares in billions of dollars. Another $4 billion was authorized with no expiration date attached to it, and YTD the company has already used $3 billion of the initial $5 billion allocated until the end of 2019. At the earnings call for the second quarter, eBay CFO Scott Schenkel highlighted 40 million shares purchased, with $4.2 billion in share repurchase authorization remaining through the end of 2019.The company also paid its second quarterly dividend of $0.14 for an annual yield of around 1.4%.The question, however, is one of valuation: again, is the current price too expensive for this stock?From a forward earnings multiple perspective, the 47% gain to around 15 since the start of the year makes it a tad expensive, especially considering where the EPS beats are coming from.The reason I believe the company is valued too high is that it resembles the P/B ratio of at least one growth company I've covered before. A very loose correlation can be made here between eBay and Alibaba (BABA) - both marketplace veterans, although Alibaba is much more diversified and enjoys revenues of more than five times that of eBay, not to mention enviable revenue growth rates. But with respect to a Price to Book Value comparison, both companies are at very similar levels. That means Alibaba is trading too low or eBay is trading too high, considering their respective sizes and revenue growth rates.While it might be tempting to hope that it's BABA that's undervalued, that's very unlikely. A lot of potential growth has been priced into Alibaba's stock price, and the valuation is certainly not that of an underperformer. Neither is eBay's, per se, but considering all the factors we've discussed here, I would suggest that EBAY is pricey with a moderate-to-high degree of risk.So, earnings are down, revenue is not on a strong growth path, valuation is high, and it has now been confirmed that eBay is reconsidering its position with StubHub and its Classifieds business. From the Q2 2019 earnings call transcript:That might spell trouble for StubHub. It's growing, but sales growth is primarily happening in first-party sales, where margins are less than the 4% growth rate posted for the entire segment.Even on the revenue front, StubHub isn't doing that well: GMV and MS&O are up on a YoY basis, but Transaction Revenue was flat and segment margin growth rate, as we saw, was 4%.Source: eBay Q2 2019 slide presentationThe word on the street prior to the earnings call was that the company had decided to move forward with the sale of StubHub, but the details are sparse at this point and the earnings call itself did not reveal much other than the fact that the matter is under active review.A possible sale of StubHub should free up cash that can go towards exploring other revenue streams, paying down debt, returning to shareholders, or initiating a key acquisition. The core Marketplace segment reported 3% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis, but GMV is now down for the third sequential quarter. eBay must quickly establish another growth pillar in the absence of any real organic growth. If the company does ax StubHub, it will give them a small additional cash buffer, but it will not look pretty on their revenue growth chart. Moreover, MS&O revenue is down for the quarter, offset by the gain in transaction revenue for a growth rate of 3% on an FX-neutral basis.Source: eBay Slide PresentationDespite the somewhat precarious situation that eBay finds itself in, the company somehow finds ways to appease investors through return on equity, share buybacks, and dividends. The market rewarded eBay's earnings beat with a 5.8% jump during aftermarket hours post the Q2 earnings announcement. The stock has been creating new 52-week highs since the earnings call, but it looks like its settling in at the $41 level.Source: Seeking AlphaValuation is considerably high after YTD gains, and there doesn't seem to be any immediately realizable upside from any of its current units. The only silver lining is annual ad revenue, which the company estimates at $700 million by the end of the year and to eventually cross $1 billion. Unfortunately, that's been tempered by the fact that low-margin first-party sales have been a significant contributor to growth.Payments are up as well, with eBay having processed $636 million in payments with the help of a 6,000-strong growing pool of participating sellers. The target is $2 billion in revenues (not transaction value, which was $270 million for Q2 2019) from the managed payments alone, with $500 million in operating income for a 25% operating margin. It's a long way off, but the year-end launch in Germany pending regulatory approval is a good sign that the service actually brings value to sellers, not to mention savings on fees. A more rapid expansion of this service across its geo-specific web properties would bode well for future revenues. At this point, however, I don't believe the high valuation is justified.If you already own shares of EBAY then it's a good idea to hold on to your stock. You can start enjoying the dividends and wait for meaningful contributions from ads and payments; either that or a significantly accretive acquisition. But there's risk involved: if eBay misses a step along the way, the stock is going to bear the brunt of it. That misstep could come from a revenue or earnings miss, as well as any slowing momentum in the two new focus areas: ads and payments. The debt situation is not overwhelming, and it's encouraging to see an attempt to slowly pay it down. But it does cause undue stress on other areas such as the ability to maintain its BBB+ rating, which impacts not only creditworthiness but also eBay's expanding payments business.You can still choose to invest new money in eBay now, but you should be aware of these risks. It's a great company and a subtle nostalgic reminder that there's actually an Internet company that's nearly 25 years old. But the reality is that the company is on a financial tightrope, walking away from slowing revenue growth and growing debt, and toward growing parts that haven't yet matured to scale. Any disruption of this estimate-beating EPS streak could reflect in share prices almost immediately. If you're a potential investor looking for validation, be prepared to buckle up for the long haul. I have every confidence that eBay can come out of this challenge even stronger, but it could be a bumpy ride for the stock before the company is actually worth what it is valued at today."
4276299,22148,2019-07-21T19:33:52-04:00,eBay topped $40 on increased EPS guidance for 2019.The Marketplace GMV continues to struggle with growth.A strategic review that unloads StubHub and Classifieds will actually hurt revenue growth.The stock is still too cheap to unload at only 13x '20 EPS estimates set to rise over 10%.,"My bullish investment view on eBay (EBAY) suggested the market was far too pessimistic when the stock dipped below $30 last October. The hope was that the online retailer would drive revenue growth via payments and advertising initiatives. The rally above $40 changes the value equation, but the company remains on pace to reach the 2020 EPS target above $3 that warrants holding onto the stock for now.Image Source: eBay website Any company isn't going to thrive without the main business line thriving. The problem with eBay is that the Marketplace platforms are the main source of revenues and the key GMV (gross merchandise volume) of the core eBay platform was down for the third consecutive quarter in Q2 at 5%. Currency issues are playing a big part of the problem, but GMV was still down 1% on an FX-neutral basis. The total GMV was closer to breakeven with the inclusion of StubHub growth. Source: eBay Q2'19 presentation The market might never pay a large premium for a stock of a marketplace platform that can't grow. And while investor groups want the company to unload StubHub and Classifieds, a business like StubHub generated GMV of $1.1 billion for 5% growth that if removed from these totals would be a disaster for eBay. Investors need to be very careful what they ask for in the case of unloading the business units that are actually growing. The biggest pressure is coming from Elliott Management, which made this statement back in January (emphasis added):The managed payments and first-party advertising initiatives are only helping offset struggles with slow global buyers growth and no GMV growth. The advertising business generated $89 million in Q2 revenues and grew at a 130% YoY clip. So investors need to be cognizant that dumping any one of these business units will return the company to being too focused on the core Marketplace platform that is in decline. If anything, eBay needs to rollout initiatives to grow platforms like StubHub and Classifieds. eBay is doing just enough to keep investors from exiting a winning position up here at $40. The company raised 2019 EPS guidance to $2.70 to $2.75, up from analyst consensus at $2.70. The strong guidance provides confidence that eBay will top a current consensus analyst EPS estimate of $3.07 for 2020. Such a target has the stock trading below 13x those forward EPS estimates. Data by YChartsInvestors need to be cognizant to not hate the stock too much despite the GMV pressures. Also, one needs to realize that Elliot Management is pushing for a strategic review in order to push the stock up to unload their position for a big gain. A lot of the EPS boost will come from stock buybacks such as the $1.5 billion share repurchase in Q2 to buy 40 million shares at about $37.50 per share. The minimal 1.4% dividend adds to the capital returns that combine for a large payout to shareholders. eBay has now spent nearly $3.0 billion on share buybacks this year. For this reason, the share count is down to 867 million shares from 1,004 million last Q2. In total, the share count has declined by 13.6% over last year. The net debt balance is up to $3.0 billion so the online marketplace can continue using the $6.3 billion cash balance and solid cash flows to repurchase more shares, but aggressive buybacks will eventually hurt the balance sheet. The key investor takeaway is that investors can't be blamed for flipping the stock for a 30%+ gain in the last 8-9 months. The company is still struggling with the core marketplace business and the strategic review caused by Elliot Management might hurt long-term growth.Regardless, the payments and ads business provides enough reason to stay in a stock trading at about 13x '20 EPS estimates. Selling the stock at $40 is too early as a big jump following the strategic review is the more opportune time to sell eBay."

After reporting rather mixed Q2 results and mixed forward guidance, shares of eBay rallied more than 6%, bringing the stock's year-to-date gains above 40%:Data by YChartsGiven eBay's robust year-to-date performance, along with the fact that barely any progress on the front that matters (GMV) has materialized, investors should reconsider their bullish position on eBay. In my view, this is a tired old company that has little room to run further.Let's look into the company's guidance update first:Figure 1. eBay FY19 guidanceSource: eBay Q2 investor presentationFor the full year, eBay has boosted its EPS view by 2% to $2.70-$2.75, relative to a prior outlook of $2.64-$2.70. The fact that eBay shares rose more than 6% on a profit guidance increase of barely 2% is already concerning, but even more so when we consider the fact that eBay also slashed its revenue forecast by 1% to $10.75-$10.83 billion, representing 2-3% y/y organic constant currency growth and lower than both its prior view of $10.85-$10.93 billion as well as consensus expectations of $10.92 billion.I'm of the opinion that revenue matters a lot more than EPS for eBay. In my view, eBay is at a transformational crossroads in its lifecycle, when most consumers have already fled the auction-based e-commerce model in favor of sites like Amazon.com (AMZN). eBay's sluggish revenue growth has become building proof that the eBay model no longer has a place in the modern consumer market. Without an ability to reinvigorate revenue growth or transform its flagship business, eBay has no future. Any EPS tailwinds that eBay can capture now will be quickly wiped out if revenues continue to dwindle.eBay's planned sale of StubHub doesn't help either. While downsizing in the face of an existential crisis is a common playbook item (look at GE (GE), for example), StubHub gave eBay a foot into the world of experiences and ticketing, which its Marketplace business sorely lacked. If the StubHub sale goes through, we're banking on eBay's ability to hawk more physical goods through its Marketplace, at a time when consumers - especially those in the US - are leaving the platform in droves.The major remaining hope for eBay is its new payments service. The company has reported that 6,000 sellers have opted into the program, and has intermediated just over $600 million in GMV to date, with approximately 4% penetration in the US market:Figure 2. eBay payments updateSource: eBay Q2 investor presentationHere's some further color on payments from CEO Devin Wenig's prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:Still, despite eBay's good traction in its payments initiatives, I still view payments as a kind of ""attach product"" to its marketplace business. Without growth in marketplace transactions, eBay's payments platform can only go so far. Any tailwinds that payments can offer to revenue growth now will be eliminated once adoption becomes saturated.Let's now parse through eBay's Q2 results in further detail. The company beat Wall Street's expectations on both the top and bottom lines this quarter, though the company's revenue beat - growing at 1.8% y/y to $2.69 billion - barely inched past Wall Street's expectations of $2.68 billion, or 1.4% y/y growth:Figure 3. eBay revenue trendsSource: eBay Q2 investor presentationSimilar to the past few quarters, a big piece driving eBay's revenue growth is a higher transaction take rate. In Q2, in fact, eBay notched a multi-quarter high in take rates at 9.4%. But this type of ""growth"" can only go so far. eBay has been bashed in the past by its sellers for exorbitant fees, and without raising its fees in any visible way that can spark seller outrage, the gains from transaction take rate growth has its limits.GMV is what we need to see improving - unfortunately, eBay's GMV has more or less been ""stuck"" for the past several quarters:Figure 4. eBay GMV trendsSource: eBay Q2 investor presentationAs shown in the chart above, GMV growth only improved marginally to flat y/y growth, versus -1% in Q1. This was primarily due to a one-point improvement in the US GMV, which still remains quite poor at -5% y/y. As previously noted, the continuous dip in US GMV is a strong reflection of current market trends - consumers just aren't going to eBay anymore for their e-commerce needs. At the same time, eBay's International GMV growth showed its poorest quarter of growth yet in Q2, clocking in at just 2% y/y growth.The US will continue to be an area of weakness for eBay, and the company is pointing to new tax legislation as one of the key drivers behind the sluggish performance. Wenig noted as follows on the Q2 earnings call:And while eBay noted stronger performance in Korea and Japan due to boosted advertising, it also cited macroeconomic pressures in Western Europe as the primary driver behind the International GMV slide.The bottom line here: in my view, it's eBay's GMV that really counts when we're evaluating the company's long-tern viability. To me, it doesn't matter that eBay's EPS of $0.68 in the quarter beat Wall Street's mark of $0.62; if GMV continues to slide, eBay's earnings potential will continue a downward spiral in future quarters. Growth coming from payments initiatives or transaction take rate increases can only help revenue growth go so far, as both are ultimately tied to the dollar volume of transactions on eBay's marketplace platform.eBay has failed over multiple quarters to raise its GMV growth, and the biggest challenge it has identified to date - the US sales tax collection on online sales - has no clear remedy in sight. In my view, eBay remains a ""dead stock."" The company has risen by more than 40% since the start of the year, but when I look at GMV trends, I don't see a company that has suddenly lifted its prospects by 40% since the beginning of 2019 - at best, trends are flat if not declining.At the same time, eBay is struggling under a $9.0 billion debt load ($3.0 billion in net debt, if we consider the company's cash balances) as well as a potentially distracting spinoff of its StubHub and Classifieds units. In my view, investors should lock in gains and go long elsewhere."

The company continues to experiment with its sales model to drive additional revenues. While it may still not reach Amazon's (AMZN) might, the market is pleased with the steps it is taking to retain interest.Q1 revenues grew 2% over the year to $2.64 billion, ahead of the market's estimates of $2.58 billion. Net income was $608 million and adjusted EPS was $0.67, better than the market's forecast of $0.63.During the quarter, eBay generated $550 million of operating cash flow and $368 million of free cash flow from continuing operations, repurchased $1.5 billion of its common stock, and announced $125 million in cash dividends.Among operating metrics, its active buyers grew 4% across its platforms to 180 million. Within the segments, revenues from Marketplace platforms grew 3% to $2.2 billion and GMV fell 4% to $21.6 billion. StubHub revenues were flat at $230 million, while registering a GMV decline of 3% to $1 billion. Classifieds platforms revenues grew 4% to $256 million.Over the past few quarters, eBay has been focused on driving advertising revenues through promoted listings. During the quarter, more than 800,000 active sellers took advantage of this program and helped bring in $65 million in advertising revenues. Overall, advertising revenues grew 4% over the year to $256 million, with revenues from promoted listings reporting a growth of 110% over the year. eBay expects advertising to be a $1 billion revenue opportunity for itself, and it clearly has a long way to reach that target goal.For the current quarter, eBay forecast revenues of $2.64-2.69 billion with EPS of $0.61-.63.

Launched as a month-long retail experiment, the store will allow 40 local, small businesses to host free workshops to attract customers. The stores will transact using QR codes instead of cash to help eBay perform analytics over footfall, sales, and transaction volumes.This is not the first time that a digital store has experimented with a physical store. A few years ago, Amazon began experimenting with physical pop-up stores. But in March this year, Amazon announced plans to shutter down all of the 87 stores that were operated as part of a year-long experiment. It will be interesting to see how eBay fares with its experiment.Meanwhile, eBay remained focused on improving product experience for new users. During the quarter, it launched an expedited registration process at multiple points across its experience. It is also helping sellers by providing them with new guidance to improve their product aspect coverage, which is driving improvements in its structured database catalog, search, and product pages, and ultimately, conversion. The company continues to invest in visual search, and reported that customers were performing more than 150,000 visual searches a day. It is expanding its Guaranteed Delivery program, and now claims to deliver a coverage of 25% volume in the U.S.For the sellers, eBay made it easier to manage listings. Sellers can now see competitive pricing data side by side when listing or managing their inventory. It also improved recommendations on items that its AI tools claim will benefit most from Promoted Listings.Within the Payments segment, it continued to ramp sellers and volume in its intermediated experience. It launched Google Pay in early April and completed the integration of PayPal on its new platform. It is working on regulatory approval to begin rolling out its Payments platform in Germany next. Germany is among eBay's largest international markets, and a successful launch of a payments platform in that market will provide a good testing ground for international expansion.The stock is currently trading at $36.13 with a market capitalization of $31.5 billion. Nearly a year ago, it was trading at a high of $40.86. Like most other stocks, it had fallen to a year low of $26.01 in December last year.Editor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4260906,105094,2019-05-07T11:30:20-04:00,"Though investors received significant alpha from EBAY over the past several years, future returns may be negatively impacted by the deterioration of its balance sheet.Net debt continues to grow at an alarming rate and should cause unease for investors.Management’s aggressive capital allocation strategy may not be sustainable.EBAY’s fwd P/E ratio implies a 10% cost of equity, which seems quite low relative to profit estimates and its weakening balance sheet.","Data by YChartsDuring this current bull market, investors in eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) have enjoyed attractive investment returns through the years. However, its balance sheet has consistently weakened over this same timeframe, which is discouraging as it coincides with a strong economy and a corresponding strong consumer. The past several years reported little (if any) growth in operating earnings and this is quite concerning as it relates to the current stage of the economic cycle. If the economy were to turn over and the consumer were to tighten up its discretionary spending, EBAY’s balance sheet could become a significant issue for its future financial health.Though EBAY’s balance sheet continues to deteriorate, management has increased its share repurchases and dividend payments, thus providing attractive shareholder returns. This capital allocation strategy seems to be providing short-term benefits at the expense of EBAY’s long-term health. Instead of increasing leverage to return capital to shareholders, perhaps EBAY’s management should be focused on paying down debt and improving operations, especially since profits have been relatively stagnant over the past several years. There is a plethora of content throughout Seeking Alpha discussing the investment merits of EBAY, and whether profits can rebound out of its sluggish state. This investment thesis will instead discuss the increasing risk associated with EBAY’s balance sheet and the potential for increased leverage to compound future losses should operations turn sour.Please note: this is not a short investment thesis. In addition, all financial statement data is sourced directly from EBAY’s financial filings.In assessing EBAY’s balance sheet, it would be prudent to analyze both the liquidity and solvency trends for the company.LiquidityAs it currently stands, there is little concern regarding EBAY’s ability to meet short-term obligations. Even though cash flow from operations has declined over the years, it remains a net positive and is able to support EBAY’s operations. Below is a chart presenting EBAY’s key liquidity ratios since FY 2013:As displayed above, its liquidity ratios peaked in FY 2015 and have consistently worsened since. This is quite concerning, especially since cash (& short-term investments) account for most of its current assets (69%, 76%, and 81% in FY 2018, FY 2017, and FY 2016, respectively) and have steadily declined, yet short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt have steadily increased:EBAY’s interest coverage ratios have materially declined over the past several years, as well:What is most concerning about this deterioration is the fact that EBITDA has not grown since FY 2013, yet EBAY keeps piling on more debt. This trend in EBAY’s liquidity raises concerns regarding the capital allocation decisions management pursues involving share repurchases and dividend payments. Furthermore, free cash flow has declined substantially (~50%) from FY 2013 and should cause some unrest among investors as they contemplate the future potential of this company:SolvencyAs shown above, EBAY’s net debt to capital ratio has skyrocketed over the past several years. At the end of 2013, EBAY sported a balance sheet that was net cash. Currently, EBAY’s balance sheet is close to 40% net debt to capital. During that time, EBAY’s cash & short-term investments have dropped 50% while total debt has more than doubled. This is troubling, especially considering that EBAY’s free cash flow has steadily declined while operating earnings have remained stagnant:It is quite clear that EBAY requires excess debt to support its operations and to return capital to equity shareholders, especially at such an aggressive rate: it repurchased $4.5b in 2018, has $5.6b currently authorized, and started paying a quarterly dividend of $0.14/share – which equates to approximately $500mm annually. This aggressive return of capital does not seem sustainable based on EBAY’s profit and cash flow trajectories.Another solvency concern surrounding EBAY is the amount of intangible assets relative to total assets. The chart below plots total liabilities as a percent of total assets, as well as total intangible assets as a percent of total assets:Not only has EBAY’s balance sheet deteriorated from the perspective that growth in liabilities has materially outpaced growth in assets, but the quality of those assets has faded, as well. If EBAY is faced with serious concerns about the health of its balance sheet, management cannot easily divest tangible assets to pay down its debt burden. In fact, one poor year in operating results can drive shareholder’s equity negative (especially considering that shareholder equity has dropped 50% over the past two years).Finally, it is worth noting that all three credit agencies currently peg EBAY as an investment grade company, but towards the lower end of the spectrum. In fact, Fitch’s rating is just two notches from being considered “junk”. Any further weakening of the balance sheet could lead to these rating agencies categorizing EBAY as below-investment grade, which will have a profoundly negative effect on its stock price.The street consensus for EBITDA and EBT (ex. unusual items) growth in 2019 and 2020 is approximately 5% Y-o-Y for both line items. After reporting 1Q19 results, EBAY posted $2.2b of EBT (ex. unusual items) over the past four quarters. Applying a tax rate of 20% results in $1.76b in normalized net income, or $1.83/share based on 960mm diluted shares outstanding. Applying the street’s estimate of 5% EBT growth will result in NTM normalized EPS of $1.92/share. Based on EBAY’s current price of ~$38, its normalized fwd P/E ratio is ~20x. A fwd P/E ratio of 20x with expected earnings growth of 5% implies a 10% cost of equity.A cost of equity of 10% seems way too aggressive for many reasons. As previously mentioned, EBITDA has not grown over the past several years, and EBT (excluding unusual items) has actually declined since FY 2013. It seems quite unreasonable to expect such a rebound in profit growth for the foreseeable future, especially as competition intensifies and the economy further matures. In addition, the entire investment thesis revolves around a balance sheet that has substantially depreciated over the past several years. A decline in revenue (either from company specific issues or from the economy rolling over) will substantially impact the profitability and health of the company, as highlighted by the constant decline in free cash flow. Applying a 10% cost of equity to an investment in EBAY seems to encompass little upside with much greater downside.EBAY investors have enjoyed significant investment returns over the past several years. However, operating profits have been lackluster, and the balance sheet has materially deteriorated throughout this timeframe. This is very concerning as we head into the later stages of the economic cycle, especially since management seems focused on compensating equity shareholders at the expense of the balance sheet. This is not a recommendation to short the stock; however, investors should strongly consider whether the implied cost of equity compensates them enough for the increased balance sheet risk that accompanies uncertain profit growth."
4256438,103480,2019-04-25T09:30:00-04:00,"Shares of eBay jumped ~5% to a YTD high after reporting Q1 earnings, extending a ~30% run so far this year.Despite a beat to this quarter's revenue estimates and a raise to the FY19 forecast, GMV growth remains the biggest area of concern.GMV slipped to negative y/y decline in Q1 for the first time in several quarters, while active buyers remained flat.eBay remains a no-growth company that will continue to face immense pressure from more popular e-commerce giants.","This year's impressive market rally has taken many stocks to underserved highs, and chief among them is onetime Silicon Valley wonder eBay (EBAY). The internet auction pioneer just posted Q1 results, and in the spirit of ""no bad news is good news,"" investors sent shares of eBay up 5% to YTD highs near $40:Data by YChartsI find investors' enthusiasm on this decaying name quite confusing. eBay and its management team have a gift of making their no-growth situation appear attractive to investors, even as all of eBay's core metrics appear to be in decline. This quarter, investors are particularly excited about eBay's Q2 guidance, which beat Wall Street's more dour expectations:Figure 1. eBay Q2 guidance updateSource: eBay Q1 earnings deckRevenue of $2.64-$2.69 billion (+1% y/y growth at the midpoint) came in higher than analysts' consensus of $2.65 billion. But since when is zero growth something to celebrate? Recall that in FY18, eBay had clocked in 8% y/y revenue growth - not altogether impressive, but at least in the high single digits. Expectations for eBay have sunk so low that even meager 1% growth is enough to lift this dead stock.Note that last quarter, investors had bemoaned eBay's initial full-year FY19 revenue guidance at $10.7-$10.9 billion (and back then, the share price had been ~15% lower). Today, eBay's full-year revenue range is only about 1% higher - hardly enough to proclaim a recovery in fundamentals for this company.Investors may also be feeling hopeful about eBay in the wake of an early March announcement that the company was exploring ""strategic alternatives"" in an effort to boost shareholder value, particularly by exploring a sale of subsidiaries like StubHub and eBay Classifieds. Though divestitures would help eBay either cull down its significant ~$9 billion debt load or fund a special dividend to investors, hewing off these tertiary platforms would weaken eBay's revenues even further. Note also that take rates (what eBay earns from a transaction) on StubHub are substantially higher in the low 20s compared to core Marketplace take rates, which hover in the ~8-9% range.All in all, investors aren't judging eBay harshly enough for the poor performance it has shown each successive quarter. In my view, there are few catalysts to get eBay back on track, and the company's current ~15x forward P/E ratio (based on the above EPS guidance of $2.64-$2.70) appears rich when accounting for the fact that eBay's growth has essentially flattened out to nothing. Sure, EPS and cash flow growth count for something, but there's only so much that eBay can do to improve profitability through cost reductions - unless GMV growth is re-stimulated, eBay will eventually succumb to competitive pressure from far more popular e-commerce giants.Each and every quarter, I ask myself - am I the only investor who notices eBay's continued GMV decline? In my view, the souring of eBay's core GMV and user metrics tell the entire story. And if you thought last quarter was bad, this quarter is far worse:Figure 2. eBay GMV trendsSource: eBay Q1 earnings deckAs seen in the chart above, total GMV dipped into the negatives for the first time in several quarters, declaring three points on a constant-currency basis relative to +2% y/y growth in Q4. Underneath the hood, we can see that both U.S. and international markets contributed to the problem, with the domestic decline seen last quarter widening significantly to -6% y/y.Here's how Devin Wenig, eBays CEO, justified the GMV performance on the Q1 earnings call:There are a few points to address in the statement above. Wenig mentioned ""steady sold item growth"", whereas the number of sold items was flat as it has been for the past four quarters. Essentially the decline in sold item ASPs was the driving contributor behind the decline in GMV. Second, Wenig also mentioned ""positive buyer growth"" - but in reality, buyers were also approximately flat:Figure 3. eBay active buyer trendsSource: eBay Q1 earnings deckeBay has a funny way of playing with the scaling of its charts to make the trends appear better than they are, but the 180 million TTM active buyers that eBay is reporting is essentially flat to Q4's active buyer count of 179 million.The flat performance in GMV/buyers had a tangible effect on revenue growth as well. Q1 revenues of $2.643 billion (+2% y/y) beat Wall Street's expectations of $2.58 billion, but decelerated sharply relative to 6% y/y growth in the prior quarter:Figure 4. eBay revenue growthSource: eBay Q1 earnings deckThe only reason eBay was able to show two points of revenue growth despite flat GMV growth was a 60bps swing in take rates to 9.3%, versus 8.6% in the year-ago quarter. However, upticks in take rates are not a sustainable source of revenue growth - eBay has already been assaulted numerous times by sellers for exorbitant fees, so the company can't continue to milk more out of its flat transaction base indefinitely. GMV growth is the key, yet eBay seems incapable of reversing the declining GMV trend.Seeing as eBay's stock has already jumped >30% in the year-to-date despite little fundamental progress, investors should lock in their gains and invest elsewhere. eBay will be one of the hardest-hit stocks if the market turns south, as one of the few large-cap companies in the technology sector that is experiencing step year-over-year revenue/GMV deceleration and decline. Avoid this lemon before its miraculous YTD gains sour too much."
4255601,101459,2019-04-21T21:52:33-04:00,GMV growth is slowing and showing no sign of reaccelerating until at least 2020.Competition from rivals like Amazon and Walmart is increasing.Small businesses will begin to flee eBay for competitors.Capital Structure changes aren't enough to entice investors.,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is a global e-commerce platform that seeks to connect buyers and sellers of a wide array of goods and services. It derives revenue primarily through marketplace transaction fees and marketing services associated with its Classifieds platform and StubHub. As of April 18, the company is trading at $35.98 with a market capitalization of $32.92 billion. It has a 52-week range of 26.01-43.00 and EPS of roughly $2.55. The company has performed well YTD, up 25% after activist investment firm 'Elliott Management' took a $1.4 billion stake in the company. Commentary surrounding eBay has been largely mixed in recent months. Some have focused on positive developments like growth in StubHub and advertising revenue, divestment in risky regional assets, as well as margin improvements as signals of future growth in the company. However, others have noted the slowdown in Y-Y GMV growth and a lagging macroeconomic environment as a reason for concern. I tend to agree with the latter. Though there certainly is upside opportunity in eBay, the horizon for a reasonable return on investment, or more importantly, the possibility of even seeing a return on that investment is unclear. Here, I will outline major developments within eBay YTD, and my thesis for why an investment would be unwise.Important Developments in 2019In late January, eBay released its earnings report for Q4 and 2018, and somewhat exceeding analysts expectations. Active buyers grew to 179 million, with over 1 billion listings logged. In addition, Q4 marketplace revenue was $2.3 billion, constant-currency GMV grew 3% to $23.2 billion, and StubHub revenue grew 2% to $314 million. In context, GMV growth is disappointing and marketplace revenue growth will likely remain almost stagnant throughout 2019. (eBay Investor Relations)Another notable development came when Elliott Management disclosed a 4% stake in the company and outlined a list of initiatives it believed would help the company grow in the near future. These include specific steps like spinning off the Classifieds business (which currently accounts for ~10% of revenue), and more broad goals like improving the operational efficiency of the business. The stock tumbled pretty dramatically during 2018, which in turn attracted some attention from other activist investors like Starboard Value, so it should be no surprise that another large player like Elliott has taken notice. Whether the company decides to head this advice, however, remains to be seen. eBay noted it regularly listens to shareholder advice, and will certainly take their suggestions into consideration. In fact, eBay has already signaled a willingness to listen, instituting capital structure changes with the addition of a ~1.6% dividend. This is the first time the company has offered a dividend in its history, and it's a move that will earn favor with investors.All of this considered, it is possible that eBay will find mild success in 2019. Perhaps US and Global GMV will grow at a rate exceeding 3%. Maybe competition in the e-commerce landscape will become less threatening to eBay's core business. Maybe the global economic environment will be more favorable than 2018. If each one of these upside events occurs, then a higher share price may be justified. The issue is that I'm doubtful that most or any of these will happen in 2019. Lagging GMV GrowthIn Q4 earnings, eBay beat expectations for EPS, but delivered underwhelming GMV of $24.6 billion, an increase of just 1% Y-Y. This is in in spite of 6% revenue growth. There are several reasons for this that have been outlined by management, including what CEO David Wenig referred to as ""pressure with our existing user base"" due to an overhaul of the buying experience. The company has said that it plans to address this pressure, but slowing revenue growth is a real point of concern. Just in the past year growth has fallen from 7% to 6% and now analysts project between 1-3% growth in 2019. (eBay Investor Relations)The minor increase in revenue is largely due to increases in fees charged to sellers for various listings. Though there may be a positive effect to this decision in the short-term, this will create problems in the long-run. There are significant headwinds with regard to GMV, and a buying platform that makes it more difficult to interact with the service, a fee structure that alienates sellers, and SEO issues that result in less traffic will force downward pressure on the company in the medium-term. Increased CompetitionCompetitiveness in the e-commerce space has potential add to eBay's already existing internal issues. Large competitors like Amazon have done an excellent job attracting small business owners onto its platform through a variety of strategies, including taking steps to reduce fees. In addition, Walmart has also been pushing to expand its e-commerce presence. Though on a smaller scale, the company has established a third-party marketplace where a variety of approved vendors can sell their products. This represents an obvious threat to eBay's market share. Walmart's now actually predicting Y-Y growth in online sales to exceed 40%. Clearly buyers are responding positively to the platform, which should be a concern to eBay. It's true eBay still boasts a sizeable advantage in this space with 179 million active users in 2018, however, the sheer scope of buyers that competitors like Amazon and Walmart attract is threatening to the core business. In the presence of higher fees and waning demand in the market, investors can expect small businesses to leave eBay for platforms that provide more product visibility. This combined with the global threat posed by companies like Alibaba should be worrisome to management.Not Worth The RiskThere is upside potential for eBay if its strategic review yields positive results, and growth finally begins to reaccelerate after 2019, a year in which investors will almost certainly see a significant slowdown. The e-commerce landscape, however, is always changing and if eBay is slow to adapt there will be trouble. Competitors like Amazon, Walmart, and even Alibaba are simply becoming more threatening. This combined with SEO issues related to eBay listings, and a fee structure that is frustrating some sellers creates concerns going forward. Capital structure changes like the $4 million buyback and a dividend aren't enough to warrant an investment. I remain bearish on the stock and will continue to provide analysis on the competitive landscape and revenue growth opportunities going into 2020."
4239255,101850,2019-02-07T20:56:53-05:00,"Strong balance sheet, generating cash, but headline growth metrics are not blowing the competition away.Repurchases of stock and an announcement of a dividend may attract a different class of investor.Activist investors are recommending divestiture of StubHub and the classified business, but management is standing firm.Not cheap following the recent pop, remains a show-me story.","eBay Inc. (EBAY) is one of the largest online retailers in the world today with around 179 million active users, and 1.9 billion live listings at any one time. We think eBay is now moving into a structurally new phase, one with lower growth and a focus on cost rationalization. But there's still something here for income investors, with the company accelerating capital return via aggressive share repurchases and a new dividend (~1.6% yield).We aren't, however, quite as positive on recent activist involvement by the likes of Starboard and Elliott. While the activists are pushing for the low hanging fruit, e.g., spinning classifieds/StubHub, we favor management's long-term view on the synergies between classifieds/StubHub and the core marketplace (see the quote from the 4Q call below).Furthermore, the latest push for efficiencies via initiatives such as pulling back on SEM spend will likely impact GMV going forward. Overall, we agree there is short-term value to be unlocked; we think it comes at the expense of longer-term prospects. With the stock already at ~12x EV/EBITDA, we believe long-term investors would do well to steer clear of the stock for now.eBay posted quarterly revenue of US$ 2.88 billion - in line with the consensus of US$ 2.77 billion - which was reported along with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of US$ 0.71, beating the consensus estimate of US$ 0.59. Gross merchandise volume (GMV) declined 1% YoY in the US, and global GMV was around 1.5-2% lower than analyst expectations. As noted by one analyst, eBay is an online retailer reporting declining performance measures in the US over the holiday season. Furthermore, there is data to suggest that US e-commerce actually grew 16-19% over the holiday period. It has been noted that the multiple of enterprise value to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for eBay is reliably positively correlated with its US GMV. eBay management has indicated that global GMV for 2019 is likely to be around 1%, and there is concern that this signals that US GMV for 2019 will be lower YoY. (Source: eBay)eBay is, however, moving to return capital to shareholders by announcing plans to repurchase approximately US$ 6 billion of stock in 2019/2020 (in addition to the US$ 1.5 billion repurchased in the last quarter), and it has authorized a US$ 0.14 per share quarterly dividend. This may open the stock up to a new ownership base of income investors, the dividend yield is small at around 1.7% but it is income, and repurchases are supportive of the stock price.There is a prevailing view that the capital return policy is intended to smooth over a few years of slower growth while the company makes some changes. These include driving cross-platform synergies between the marketplace, StubHub and classifieds, in the form of cross-merchandising, traffic sharing, and dual listings, and building a more extensive advertising business. This last point, concerning bolstering advertising, is crucial as currently there is a significant dependence on Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for driving traffic, and GOOG is becoming a marketplace in its own right. The end of the exclusivity agreement with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) in 2020 will allow eBay to offer other payment options, something that has been a drag on GMV growth despite marketing efforts. Management is focused on delivering intermediated payments, where sellers can see reduced costs, and conversions are higher from buyers accustomed to using credit cards, and early tests have been promising. This feature will likely be fully scaled by June 2020. The introduction of a local feature, meaning buyers can pick up from a local store when convenient, has been late but welcome. eBay is also pushing into mobile which, given that commerce volume using mobile devices has been steadily growing, is a prudent move, mainly since auction updates can be delivered to a mobile device for timely action by users.On the acquisition front, eBay acquired Terapeak last year. This platform helps companies decide what to sell and for how much. Other acquisitions include companies with expertise in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and structured data. All of these technologies will be integrated and will improve operations of eBay's platforms; for example, structured product pages are essential for search engine optimization, making sure users land on pages for products that are available. Management has stated that it is “constantly re-evaluating our portfolio” which has given rise to opinions that spinning-off StubHub and the classifieds businesses to unlock shareholder value is perhaps on the horizon. Indeed, activist investors such as Elliot Management (currently holding a 4% stake) think that StubHub and the classified business would be worth more on their own, and would enable eBay to focus on improving its marketplace technology and operations; this strategy was floated by Credit Suisse’s (NYSE:CS) Paul Bieber back in 2017. But management currently sees StubHub and the classified business as adding value organically, and they are not currently viewed as divestiture options. They do greatly complement eBay’s core marketplace business. The classifieds business captures customers looking to make local sales of items and is focusing more and more on motor sales, and StubHub is an industry leading secondary ticket marketplace.Overall, we think eBay is fairly priced at present, with the recent pop following activist involvement a double-edged sword. On the one hand, as value investors, we like the company's strong balance sheet and cash generative ability. Management's move to accelerate capital return is a big positive in our view.However, we think the involvement of particularly vocal activists like Elliott and Starboard could prove disruptive to the company's long-term prospects as they appear to be pushing for short-term gains (classifieds/ StubHub spin) vs. long-term benefits (synergies). Plus, we are wary that some of the efficiency levers being pushed could adversely impact the top-line longer term. While we like the business, at 12x EV/ EBITDA and two disruptive activists in the mix, we think eBay remains a show-me story."
4238945,102809,2019-02-07T08:45:45-05:00,"Activist investors are encouraging eBay to grow beyond its own guidance. This is likely to result in the company exceeding its revenue goals for the year.EPS rates are already subpar for eBay. If the company exceeds its revenue growth rate by increasing GMV growth, EPS multiples will likely increase significantly.Significant opportunity exists for a stock move to go more than 50% for the year.","Activist investors are knocking on eBay's (EBAY) door to encourage growth in the company. eBay's guidance for the year is paltry, at best, when you consider rival's growth rates. Considering where EPS multiples are for the company, and given the meager growth rate for merchandise sales at eBay, I believe the push by the activists may get eBay to grow beyond their guidance. This could be the beginning of a significant stock move higher. Growth for eBay's stock has been anemic, at best with very little growth:Activist investor Elliott Management has given eBay corporate a letter outlining steps to growth they want to see eBay undertake. The letter from activist investor Elliott was more polite than hostile. Elliott pointed out that they were interested in growth and provided ideas as to how a greater value to investors could be achieved. Elliott's plan is fivefold:The company stated they are working with the ideas presented. One of the strategies named was spinning off eBay's classified section as well as spinning off Stub Hub.Personally, I think the intent was a bit misguided. I do not necessarily agree that spinning off these divisions would necessarily lead to more value for the investors. What I believe is that eBay, in general, needs to continue to focus on growth as its number one priority. Recently, the company had begun a process of doing just that. The company has seen results from its recent moves. Despite that, future guidance for organic growth released in the company's latest earnings was paltry (Organic growth for FY 2019 is expected to be around 2% after hitting 9% the year prior). This seems odd to me. Amazon has the ability to grow its business and is hitting 29% percent growth. Why can't eBay as well? They are somewhat different, but then again, they are very similar. Forget the auction portion of eBay. Instead, look to the ability of small businesses to place items on the site and sell them directly to customers, a lot like Amazon. Shouldn't these two companies be neck-to-neck in this race for more? This is where I believe eBay should be focusing its priorities.I am all for companies sticking to their core business. Case in point, I believe Amazon's AWS (AMZN) should be spun off; there's not enough similarity in AWS and the core retail business with Amazon. And, Amazon's retail business is being carried by the profits of AWS. Given this, there is talk of a spinoff of the cloud business. I agree with this and wrote it up on a widely read article here on Seeking Alpha. I believe this would do two things for Amazon:But, Amazon and eBay are a little bit different in one way: Whereas AWS is quite different than Amazon, the idea of spinning off the former makes logical sense. However, eBay and StubHub are very similar services. StubHub lets individuals sell tickets to others for events such as concerts or sporting events. Basically, Stub Hub and eBay are the same types of companies selling products in different categories. So, the idea of spinning off the ticket company to bring in value does not address the bigger issue of slow growth. I have always admired the potential of eBay. The thing that grabs me the most is that they really do not do anything: They are one of the biggest middlemen in the world. Seller A lists an item for sale on to their account on eBay and Buyer B purchases said item from Seller A, with a small cut in the middle going to eBay. Other than providing the platform, there is really nothing that eBay does. While that is an overly simplistic look at eBay's business model, that is basically what eBay boils down to. But, eBay has lagged its far bigger rival with growing their business. eBay has already begun a series of items geared toward growing revenues and profits. One of the things eBay has done is to spin off PayPal into its own separate company, a move I believe was very good. The next step eBay has undertaken is to start their own payment system in order to drive down costs, thereby increasing potential profits to anyone selling on eBay and also to increase profits to investors in eBay. What does that say about PayPal? What I find striking is that if PayPal was that expensive, enough to motivate eBay to spin off the company and start another payment system, why didn't eBay - who owned PayPal - just command them to be less expensive? That's a question outside of the philosophy of this investment thesis, but I think it is something that is likely to change going forward. Nonetheless, this demonstrates that eBay is not only committed to increasing profits and investor value but doing so with big leaps. Returning investor value should be the primary purpose of management. This is the measuring stick that investors can use to determine if management is doing their jobs. Management is hired by the company owners to run the company. Given that, what is the best use of resources, or capital, eBay has at its disposal? For right now, eBay is choosing to do share buybacks to increase value to investors. I am not in love with the idea, to be honest. Buybacks are great when a company has no other things to do on their list of things to do. For eBay, they have one big thing to do: Grow. Amazon has done a terrific job of reinvesting every single penny they have ever earned back into providing a better service to its customers. While the moves to lower costs via the payment system are a good start at keeping costs lower for eBay sellers, I believe that eBay should be doing more to add as many partners as they can to continually build a system that brings larger Gross Merchandise Valuation (GMV) on an annual basis. Currently, eBay is trading at ~$35.00 off of earnings of $2.33 for the year. That's a current earnings multiple of 15-times. Guidance for earnings for 2019 come in at $2.66. If eBay's stock comes in similarly at 15-times current earnings next year, an investor would see a stock increase of a mere $4.00 for the year. While that does end up being about 10% of the current value of the stock, there are two concerns I have. Again, I will reiterate that eBay's GMV rate of growth is paltry. But, there is a law of averages that is something a lot of investors should consider. When a company underperforms relative to its sector for a period of time, say 5 years, oftentimes the company will over-perform for a like period of time. This is where that word ""averages"" comes in to play. eBay has certainly underperformed relative to the rest of the industry. But, it has not been for a moderate period of time; this is a cultural issue. However, now things are different now that there is an activist investor knocking on the door. And, that may be the opportunity. If eBay is seriously taking into consideration activist investors ideas, restructuring and reprioritizing as they say they are, then perhaps this is the opportunity to get into the stock for a long term holding. The only problem with that is, again, this is eBay. They have underperformed for what feels like an eternity. Who's to say this is the turning point in their investment? I am going to take a chance on eBay. However, it will be a small chance. The company has one specific growth opportunity right now and is hyper-focused on this opportunity. If they succeed in growing their business as they are setting out to do then it is my contention that the company's revenue will increase more than they are expecting. This increased growth rate is the opportunity that I am keying in on simply because I believe that eBay may outperform its own guidance. If eBay hits its paltry guidance this year and maintains its 13-times multiple, then an investment in the company would return about 10% this year alone. However, now there is greater emphasis being driven from the outside in. This has the potential to push eBay's GMV growth rate above their guidance level, thereby bringing in some buyers into the stock with momentum. And, that is what I am looking to invest in. Elliott Management's target stock price is roughly $55.00 per share. That is about 50% from today's price. I'd like to grab a piece of that stock move over the next year."
4250710,101850,2019-03-24T14:22:01-04:00,"eBay's financial performance has gradually deteriorated over the last few years.Industry economics are worsening.Capital return may cushion downside.But in the absence of key catalysts, we remain on the sidelines for now.","While eBay's (EBAY) valuations may screen cheaply, we don't think the stock is a buy at this point. Fundamentals remain challenged and appear to be deteriorating, and we do not see any key catalysts emerging in the near-medium term.Having reviewed eBay's performance over the last few years, we are concerned about current dynamics, namely a) slower growth in revenues and GMV, and b) declining operating margin due to competitive pressure. The ever-increasing need for e-commerce operators to plow back funds just to maintain margins speaks to the worsening economics. Thus, we remain on the sidelines.From our observations of eBay before and after the spin-off from PayPal (PYPL), we found that pre-spin-off, eBay was on the right track – solid growth in GMV was the key during the period, along with Marketplace net revenue growth of 4.7% CAGR between 2013-2018 and 6.7% CAGR between 2015-2018.We also observed certain cost synergies related to Marketplace’s operations: payment services and related cost and factored payment services cost which PayPal provides.Using Marketplace costs as a percentage of net (Marketplace) revenues as an indicator, the ratio was 21.6% in 2016 - the year immediately following the spin. The cost had risen by 1.0 percentage point compared to 2015 (the year before PayPal was spun off).Here's a summary of eBay's movements pre- and post-spin:(Source: Company Financials)Income StatementRevenues (in a million USD)Source: Company financialsSource: Company financialsNet revenues for eBay continued growing in the past five years, however, at a slower pace as GMV growth has shifted gear from double-digit to single-digit %. While active buyer growth remains may seem well and good, alternative sites and applications have also risen. A slower revenue growth puts pressure on gross and operating margin, which has been on a downward trend over the past five years. This is worrying as the need for eBay to invest in site operations continuously and data centers have become increasingly important to remain competitive.Source: Company financialsSales and marketing trends are also worrying as costs have been on the rise. eBay deployed this expense to improve the customer experience, acquire customers, and provide incentives for the seller. We are concerned if eBay’s increased need for investment into product development and higher sales and marketing expense requirements could affect margins.Source: Company financialsBalance SheetOn the plus side, eBay’s balance sheet remains strong as long-term debt stands at 1.2x and net debt to equity was at 1.1x at the end of 2018. We view eBay’s leverage ratio as healthy and appropriate in an economic context.Moody’s affirmed stable outlook for eBay in Jan 2019 with Baa1 which should provide some comfort: ""the company's high brand awareness and strong position in the growing e-commerce space. eBay also benefits from its scale in terms of revenue and a large number of buyers and sellers globally that utilize its various marketplace sites which creates a positive network effect.”Capital returnWe view eBay’s intent to return capital via buybacks (additional USD 5 billion stock repurchase program with no expiration date) as a positive. Stock repurchases along with a quarterly dividend could serve as a catalyst going forward.Based on a relative valuation perspective, eBay screens cheaply at ~12x EV/EBITDA, slightly lower than industry and S&P 500 index. However, eBay’s slower growth in revenues and earnings may justify the discount. On the flipside, its stock repurchase program should help mitigate downside risk.Despite the lower valuations, we don’t think eBay is worth dipping our toes into for the following reasons: a) slower growth in revenues and GMV, and b) declining operating margin due to competitive pressure.The latter will be the crucial challenge for not only eBay but for e-commerce and competitive retail space going forward as customers’ bargaining power has risen, thus increasing the need for e-commerce companies/platforms to invest in customer acquisition costs to maintain margins continually."
4236958,57252,2019-01-31T06:00:34-05:00,"eBay is following Elliott Management's suggestion and returning more cash to shareholders.The core business is growing slowly, but it continues to generate plenty of income.FY19 guidance was a disappointment, but more aggressive capital returns and a big opportunity in payments leave shares undervalued.","eBay (EBAY) posted better-than-expected results in the aftermath of Elliott Management's activist campaign, though shares have been minimally impacted. In addition to the quarterly results, management communicated a new capital allocation strategy and marketing spending strategy that seems well aligned with Elliott's suggestions. Overall, I believe the quarterly performance and announcements regarding capital allocation strategy reinforce my confidence that shares are undervalued with upside to $45-50. Let's take a look at the quarter, the new capital allocation strategy, and what it means for shareholders.eBay's revenue for Q4 was up 6% y/y to $2.9 billion, though the total gross merchandise volume grew a meager 2% y/y (ex-FX) to $24.6 billion. Marketplace, the legacy eBay business, saw a 3% jump in GMV, while StubHub was down 1% with a tough World Series comparison from 2018. The StubHub business can be volatile, and the two-year stack was against the Cubs vs. Indians and Astros, three teams with years of futility and rabid fan bases playing in the World Series, so I am not particularly worried about this business. SeatGeek and other competitors are ramping, but I think StubHub remains the market leader by a mile. Marketing spending was somewhat disappointing, and it was unable to drive sufficient GMV growth. This is certainly a disappointment given that GMV is the biggest driver of revenue, but it's not entirely unexpected given eBay's recent performance.Importantly, other revenue drivers like promoted listing performed well, with revenue up 150% y/y to $80 million during the quarter. Payments, eBay's largest revenue opportunity, processed $102 million in Q4. This is a substantial acceleration from the Q3 run-rate of $38 million, and I am excited to see this opportunity begin to scale.Overall, revenue growth remains a bit of an issue, and eBay's full-year 2019 revenue guidance of 1-3% growth to $10.7-10.9 billion is hardly inspiring. Management blames this on reducing marketing spending that will reduce GMV growth. However, management noted that it is eliminating low ROI marketing spending, effectively admitting that incremental GMV size would have been low ROI anyways. In a sense, this should be viewed as a positive; however, it is hard to ignore eBay's horrible performance in GMV versus Amazon (AMZN).On the cost side, I choose to ignore eBay's adjusted GAAP numbers because it excludes stock-based compensation, which is enormous, totaling $538 million for FY18. This requires an equal amount annually to offset dilution, lowering the effective level of share repurchases.During Q4, EPS was up 20% y/y to $0.71 per share driven by decline in product development costs as well as G&A expense offset by a huge jump in marketing spend, which was up nearly 21% y/y on an absolute basis to $945 million (32.8% in Q4'18 vs. 29% in Q4'17). This clearly reflects Elliott's thesis that eBay's spending on marketing has had a low return on investment. CEO Devin Wenig commented on marketing spending in FY18, saying:It sounds to me that eBay took a shot at generating really robust marketplace growth in FY18, and it failed pretty miserably. For the full-year, GMV grew 7%, sales grew 8%, and sales and marketing spending was up 18% y/y compared to FY17 GMV growth of 6%, sales growth of 7%, and a 7% increase in sales and marketing spending. Hopefully FY18 is simply an aberration because there's clear evidence that incremental spending destroyed shareholder value.Overall, this will cap earnings growth. eBay's non-GAAP earnings will be in the range of $2.62-2.68, which would be up modestly from FY18's $2.55 per share, in spite of a huge share repurchase program. I suspect we will see some modest operating margin deleverage based on this guidance, even though management guided to 50-150 basis points of margin leverage on the call. This simply does not make sense to me, as I would expect EPS guidance to be up at least to the $2.70 range based on what management has noted about repurchases.Elliott's other primary issue, in addition to marketing spending, was capital allocation. In response to Elliott, eBay's senior management team and board performed a strategic review of capital allocation. The company initiated a $0.14 per share dividend, equating to an annual yield of about 1.6% at current share prices. The board also added another $4 billion to the company's buyback authorization with no expiration date, adding to the $3.2 billion it had remaining after it bought back $1.5 billion worth of stock in Q4'18. eBay plans to buy back $5 billion in FY19, and reduce its cash balance to $3.5 billion.Over the past two years, eBay has reduced debt by about $2.2 billion, but this trend will reverse going forward. Management noted the desire to increase leverage to 1.5x net debt to EBITDA. Based on FY19's guidance of a $3.5 billion and my own estimate of flattish EBITDA, this would put total debt in the $8.7-9.2 billion range, an increase of at least $1 billion versus the current capital structure.In short, eBay will follow Elliott's guidance to add financial leverage and return more cash to shareholders. This is hardly revolutionary, but it should increase the probability of eBay creating shareholder value.Even though FY19 guidance is slightly disappointing, I think changes in capital allocation are a net positive for eBay. Although I am reducing my near-term estimate of revenue growth, I am leaving my valuation unchanged at $45-50 per share. Elliott's plan was not rocket science, but I am glad that eBay's management team is receptive to change. However, the great value driver of payments remains on the horizon, and I believe patient shareholders will be rewarded."
4235208,57252,2019-01-24T05:46:55-05:00,"Activist investor Elliott Management caused eBay share price to pop as it began to publicly engage the company.Regardless of whether or not management listens to Elliot, eBay stock is inexpensive.There's a revenue and earnings inflection point around the corner, driven by Payments and Advertising.Management is aggressively buying back the company's cheap stock.Shares are worth $45-50.","Shares of eBay (EBAY) spiked on news that activist hedge fund Elliott Management took a 4% stake in the company and is actively pushing for multiple changes at the firm in including spinoffs, divestitures, and other capital allocation decisions that could unlock value. Although Elliott has some interesting suggestions that could unlock shareholder value, I believe eBay stock is materially underpriced regardless. Shares are worth $45-50, and I believe the company is already undergoing a few initiatives to drive shareholder value. eBay has a massive payments opportunity, an advertising opportunity as well as an ongoing repurchase program that should unlock shareholder value regardless of whether or not the company pursues Elliott’s strategic suggestions.Elliott briefly mentioned payments, but I believe activist investors were too dismissive of what could be a $2 billion high-margin opportunity. In short, eBay is transitioning its payments from former subsidiary PayPal (PYPL) to payment processor Adyen, which also provides software support for Uber (UBER) and other start-ups. The transition remains fairly limited in scope, with only 3,000 sellers doing $38 million in transactions. Although it is not entirely smooth, sellers are currently charged 2.7% per transaction, versus 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction under the current PayPal system. According to management, this system has demonstrated superior conversion for guest buyers. Apple Pay (AAPL), in particular, is doing really well, accounting for 12% of volume. The ease of use could improve eBay’s overall conversion on key platforms like the iPhone and iPad.In addition to a $2 billion opportunity, eBay’s management team is confident that by leveraging its volume scale, it has negotiated sufficiently low prices to drive another $500 million in pretax profit. I believe this could be conservative, particularly if the new checkout experience is able to generate overall growth in transactions. PayPal had been a somewhat cumbersome system, and the new system should eventually provide a more seamless experience for buyers who are largely accustomed to using Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V).Overall, the Payments opportunity is in its infancy, but it has the potential to be successful for eBay. Assuming the business remained flat, which it will not, the new payments infrastructure would increase revenue by 21% and operating income by 22%. Assuming again a flat business, total operating margin would increase by 20 basis points to 24%. Even valued conservatively at 8x operating income, this would generate another $4 billion in shareholder value, or another $8 per share.According to a recent Morgan Stanley report, Amazon’s (AMZN) advertising business is worth $125 billion. This would make it the third most valuable advertising company behind Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOG). Like Amazon, eBay has a solid opportunity to grow its advertising business, which is already becoming significant. Marketplace advertising revenue is likely to top $600 million in FY18, driven by its Promoted Listings platform that grew 120% y/y in Q3. The business is likely to total $180 million, with significant growth potential as it demonstrates value for eBay sellers.Like Amazon and the other great advertising companies, eBay is building a wealth of data about its customers, allowing it to create a strong advertising platform within its existing marketplace. eBay sees total advertising sales potential in excess of $1 billion, and the upside could be even more meaningful if the company is able to accelerate its gross merchandise value.As I noted after Q2, eBay stock is undervalued, and management is well aware of this. As a result, the company repurchased $1 billion of stock in Q3 and expects to be an aggressive buyer going forward with the $4.7 billion remaining on its authorization. Admittedly, the stock-based compensation is a bit excessive at roughly $550 million, so it takes a substantial amount of capital to simply keep the share count flat, neutralizing some of the impact of the repurchase program.Still, YTD the company has repurchased nearly $3 billion in stock. eBay’s management team indicated the willingness to move into a net debt position to continue its repurchases, and I suspect buying at the currently depressed levels will create significant shareholder value.Over the past two years, eBay has demonstrated the ability to generate over $2 billion in cash flow annually. Though the TTM free cash flow sits at $1.7 billion, I think it is safe to peg the business at a $2 billion annual run rate. This then implies a P/FCF of 15x, which is relatively inexpensive for a stable business like eBay that does have pockets of growth that can generate mid-single digit annual revenue and earnings growth. Importantly, the company is about to hit an inflection point where revenue and earnings both materially accelerate. I believe the current market price has yet to reflect this reality, and shares are worth $45-50 on a DCF basis. This excludes any upside from the capital allocations advised by Elliott. I am a buyer of shares at current prices."
4235033,25120,2019-01-23T14:21:34-05:00,"eBay has ""attracted"" Elliott Management as an activist investor.I understand the rationale for the activist campaign, but believe Elliot is too aggressive in its assumptions.This and continued long-term threat from Amazon makes me cautious, despite a low valuation.","eBay (EBAY) has attracted the interest of activist investor Elliott Management, probably creating quite some nerves among its management as Elliott has a reputation of being among the most ruthless activist investors out there.The activist investor has laid out a play for eBay which more or less looks in line with what one could expect, yet I find the assumptions of Elliott optimistic, too optimistic to jump aboard as Elliott has seen some painful losses as of recent, despite still a truly impressive long-term reputation.Following the spin-off of PayPal (PYPL), which has been a brilliant acquisition of eBay in the past, the core marketplace business which remained after the spin-off has seen some tough times as of recent, and this underperformance has attracted the interest of Elliott, despite the fact that the spin-off was aimed to create a more focused business.Elliott has set-up a dedicated website called ""Enhancing eBay"" which contains a letter which it has sent to the board. In that letter, Elliott starts with the announcement that it holds $1.4 billion worth of shares in eBay, equal to roughly 4% of the outstanding share base.Elliott starts by praising the company, with eBay having become a dominant global platform within 20 years after being formed, facilitating over a $100 billion worth of transactions between 25 million sellers and 180 million users, as it has thrived in all environments. While many still associate eBay with auctions and used goods, merely 10% of transactions take place in an auction form, and only 20% are used goods.Despite the great platform, Elliott goes on to say that the company has unperformed its peer group and valuations have compressed as the power of the platform and lower multiples have attracted Elliott. That does not mean that the investor does not have criticism, as it has real issues with some parts of the business. Elliott believes that eBay has engaged in execution missteps and has an unclear focus. Elliott furthermore believes that besides the core platform, the company has very valuable subsidiaries like StubHub and eBay Classifieds.eBay Classifieds is the gathering name for all the local eBay franchises/varieties which include mobile.de, eBay in Germany, the Dutch Marktplaats franchise as well as similar businesses in the UK, Canada and Australia.With revenues seen around a billion in 2018, and showing double-digit sales growth, while EBITDA margins are estimated around 50%, these are very valuable properties. With the peer group trading around 15 times and comparable trades/M&A taking place at even higher EBITDA multiples, Elliott pegs the value of these businesses at $8-12 billion, or 8-12 times sales. That seems a bit rich if you ask me, even as the business shows solid growth and sky high margins. Hence, I am valuing these assets at the lower end of the range, at $8 billion.The other prominent subsidiary is StubHub, an online secondary ticket sales website. The business was acquired by eBay in 2007 for a mere $310 million and has seen continued growth ever since. Gross merchandise volume has risen to an estimated $4.8 billion in 2018, despite a lot of controversy among all stakeholders (artists, venues and consumers) which in general dislike some pricing and supply practices of these platforms in general. Sales are expected to top over a billion, for a very steep ""cut"" in comparison to revenues, more than 20% of gross merchandise value.Elliott pegs the value of StubHub at $3.5-$4.5 billion which in terms of sales multiples looks fairly reasonable. Using again the lower end of the valuation range, I peg the combined value of StubHub and eBay Classifieds at $11.5 billion.The basic promise of Elliott is that with a $31.2 billion enterprise valuation, the value of the core franchise is very low based on its valuation of the subsidiaries. Based on the $11.5 billion combined value of the non-core assets under my assumptions, the core marketplace trades at 6.6 times EBITDA based on a $3.0 billion EBITDA contribution from the core marketplace business.Part of this is self-inflicted as revenue compounded annual growth rate of the platform for the period 2015-2017 totals just 5% while the e-commerce market across a range of eBay's core countries is growing by 20% per year, or more. Besides a prominent password hack and change in Google search algorithm, the platform has been hit by technical issues and a poor app experience as well. The slower revenue growth has been ""achieved"" despite higher spending on advertising, R&D and stock-based compensation expenses, as this has hurt operating margins. These margins have fallen from 30% in 2013 to levels in the low-twenties currently.Trading at $30 per share currently, Elliott has a 2020 target for a valuation of $62 per share. Seeing further growth for Classified and StubHub between now and 2020, Elliott sees value of $11.5 billion and $5.6 billion for both subsidiaries, respectively, at that point in time. In comparison, using the lower end of the current valuation estimate by Elliott, we end up with $11.5 billion combined for these two businesses.With an implied valuation of $20 billion for the core marketplace business currently, Elliott has plans to grow EBITDA from $3.0 billion to $4.1 billion as improved performance (thanks to rationalisation of costs in particular) could result in a 9 times multiple according to the investor. That could lead to $61 per share valuation according to Elliott, based on a $54 billion enterprise valuation.That looks good on paper, although I have two forms of criticism on the approach of Elliott. For starters is the observation that I observe the same underperformance of the business, as a spin-off of non-core assets could indeed unleash value. Criticising eBay for some failed deals is shortsighted as well, as the $310 million deal for StubHub has certainly paid off with Elliott itself attaching a $5.6 billion value to that business in 2020.Nonetheless, I feel that Elliott is a bit optimistic in its valuation. Sticking with an $11.5 billion 2020 valuation for the non-core assets, and perhaps $30 billion valuation for the core marketplace (up from $20 billion implied currently, but less than $37 billion potential value in the plans of Elliott), I see potential enterprise value of $41.5 billion. Using the same calculations as Elliott, I peg the share price potential at $46 per share, leaving some 50% upside in a time frame of 24 months, still good enough by all means.While the thesis of Elliott makes sense on paper and value can be created if management is open for a split of the business, reality is that I have concerns with the thesis. I believe that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is taking business away from eBay, as it has the opportunity to integrate not just a marketplace but also combine it with its own logistics force as well. Thus, I believe that the giant from Seattle can eat a significant portion of eBay's lunch. Especially, if the company is cutting costs on R&D that makes the business potentially more vulnerable for further secular market share losses (to Amazon).While the overall valuation is cheap, eBay is not demonstrating a sustainable growth and has in general been quite cheap in the past. To really gain traction, Elliott has to convince other investors to engage as well and get management on board as it might be a long fight. While I will not rule out a successful campaign, the normal recipe of cutting costs and selling promising assets at a higher multiple is not enough for me, as some of Elliott's assumptions look quite aggressive, outright optimistic at some points."
4227312,57621,2018-12-09T18:39:47-05:00,Ebay hardly gets a mention in e-commerce but is still maintaining its brand presence.  Ebay ranks #9 in USA and #30 worldwide by traffic rank despite declining share of ecommerce.Growth through acquisitions and its ticketing business has propped revenues higher but profitability is declining.Margin compression has led to stagnating profits.Fairly priced at 12.7x PE based on current business lines.Potential 35% upside includes share repurchases and cost reduction plans already in place.,"I cannot quite recall but my first online purchase was probably on eBay (EBAY) and with my PayPal account. In today's context, there are many more competitors through Alibaba (BABA), Amazon (AMZN), Shopee (SE) and a host of other traditional retailers now selling online like Walmart (WMT). Somehow, eBay still thrives in spite of the competition. It thrives even though it is not mentioned much in the investment world (I will get to the financials later), and it thrives because eBay offers value to consumers and thus remains relevant since September 1995 till today.Here is a look at how eBay ranks in terms of traffic, which is a respectable #9 in the USA and #30 worldwide. In terms of e-commerce sites globally, eBay still ranks #2, behind Amazon.com (note that Amazon has other domains listed in the list below for other countries like the UK and Japan).The concern which everyone has probably expected is illustrated below. Based on a long term trend from 2004 to today, interest in eBay has declined while Amazon and Walmart have both trended upwards in a consistent manner.eBay's share of Ecommerce in the US has also declined since 2016 based on eMarketer.com data from 7.8% share to 6.6% share in 2018.A declining share of the market does make the investment outlook bleak. However, there has been transactions growth on eBay's website despite the declining share, meaning that more consumers are purchasing online, growing the wider market, and bulk of that goes to Amazon and to a lesser degree, players like Walmart.Based on statista data, eBay's active users has been rising consistently between 2010 and 2018. In eBay's Q3 2018 filings, management reported growth in ""active buyers by 4% across its platforms, for a total of 177 million global active buyers"" and ""marketplace revenue growth was 6% on an as-reported basis and 5% on an FX-Neutral basis, and GMV was up 5% on both an as-reported and FX-Neutral basis.""7% and 8% growth in revenue was reported in StubHub and Classifieds respectively. The data infers that each user on average is spending more money on eBay.At the end of 2017, eBay reported 170 million active buyers, rising from 167 million in 2016 and 162 million in 2015. Growth in active buyers validate eBay's continued relevance despite aggressive growth among competitors, especially Amazon.The ability to remain relevant and be competitive however has come with a price tag in the form of margin compression and a flat bottom line.The business continues to generate cash from operations and bulk of the cash has been used for investments and share repurchase.The main concern is the amount of debt that has risen since 2013. Net debt (debt excluding cash and short term investments) was $4.15 billion in 2017 compared to net cash of $2.94 billion. Q3 2018 Net debt was $4.37 billion.Having increasing debt is not a concern if the debt is used appropriately and helps grow the business in a sustainable manner.With free cash flow guiding at $1.9 billion and EPS of $2.29, eBay has operating leverage in managing its debt and share repurchases. Importantly the current price of $29 values eBay at a PE of 12.7x, which is inexpensive.eBay now has to execute on growing its earnings and turning its ticketing business into a profit growth driver. Stubhub contributes over 10% to the total revenue of the business but the revenue growth demonstrated above has not cascaded down into net profits. Because eBay does not report operating profits by its marketplace, classifieds and ticketing platform segments, it is my guess that the results from acquisitions have not been successfully converted into profits.From a merger and acquisitions perspective, management has made a couple of shrewd and strategic decisions around the StubHub acquisition and the sale of eBay's India business to Flipkart. The StubHub purchase valued at $310 million back in 2007 which generated $100 million sales in 2008, about 3x price-to-sales. eBay further acquired Ticketbis for $165 million in 2016 to give StubHub a global reach. It was reported that Ticketbis sales was $45 million in 2016 having grown from $25 million in 2015.The Flipkart deal has enabled eBay to profit from Walmart's acquisition of Flipkart for $16 billion. In addition, now that a competitor has bought out Flipkart, Flipkart had to cease operating the eBay.in website with eBay stating its intention to enter India again.The issue in the growth equation lies in the operating expenses below gross margins. Gross margins has declined from 82% in 2013 to 77% in 2017. That 5% decline is understandable as the competition has intensified through this period. However, operating margins has also been squeezed with rising sales and marketing costs, product development and general and administrative costs.The same trend persists into the first 9 months ended September 30, 2018.With these headwinds in place, the answer is in Adyen, the payments solution provider replacing PayPal. Management had reported a potential savings of $500 million when fully deployed in 2020. This deal allows eBay to potentially own 5% of Adyen's shares as well, valuing this stake at about $750 million (Adyen's market capitalization is about $15 billion). This additional savings translate to about 20% upside given the same 12.7x multiple.eBay meanwhile continues to repurchase shares and its business is able to afford more leverage to do so. The authorized repurchase program has $4.7 billion remaining which I reckon can be made within 2 years, through the cash generated from operations. This represents another potential 15% value creation opportunity.The total 35% in potential value being created makes this company an interesting pick for my retirement portfolio which is designed to accumulate in value before transitioning into a distribution yield focused retirement portfolio.Note: fellow investors who are interested in screening stocks with a PE under 15x and has had either a growth story or a record of earnings growth can take a quick read of some of my articles and shortlisted picks."
4235022,103012,2019-01-23T14:09:10-05:00,"Amazon and its improving victims are crushing eBay’s growth and margins.Additionally, since the PayPal spin-off, eBay’s share performance has been poor.That is about to change as eBay has two green shoots in StubHub and advertising.The bottom line is eBay is still a cash generative online retailer that still attracts meaningful amount of sellers and buyers to its platforms.Its pristine balance sheet and shareholder-friendliness also allow the company to continually retire more shares. eBay is a buy today.","eBay (EBAY) is a fascinating company in a very crowded and fast-changing retail space. In recent years, consumers have moved on from the thrill of ‘auction’ shopping. They want convenience at a good price for which Amazon (AMZN) has been the main beneficiary. Moreover, if Amazon doesn’t have it, shoppers can find specialty goods on Etsy (ETSY) or NotOnTheHighStreet, to name a few. Then, the laggard brick and mortars, who have been rushing to sell their products online, pick up whatever is left. It is no surprise, eBay’s market value has not moved much since its PayPal (PYPL) spin-off day in 2015. The bear camp on eBay has been correct. Meanwhile, Etsy and Amazon's share prices have tripled and quadrupled.Now, eBay is solely focused on the marketplace business and doing its best to remain relevant. As keen users in the past, we are surprised to see how it has evolved to co-exist even with the elephant in the room, Amazon.Despite operating an outdated business model, we argue that there is indeed a future for eBay. It has a steady marketplace business, and it will also have growth. They are from two areas. The first place comes from StubHub, an online ticket platform, and eBay’s highest margin segment. The second is advertising revenue, eBay has yet to leverage all of its the web traffic from its growing 177M active buyers. These initiatives should increase company profits over the next three to five years, even after eBay passes some of the savings back to marketplace participants.If all fails, the bottom line is eBay still generates an abundant amount of cash. The current price might not be exactly attractive considering its hyper-growth days are over, however, eBay is better positioned than the brick and mortar peers and also fundamentally stronger and trading more attractively than Etsy and Amazon.For new investors, eBay is a marketplace platform technology company. It operates three segments, Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. Throughout the years, eBay has managed to stay relevant by offering a unique selection of products at bargain prices through eBay.com. The other two segments are newer (StubHub acquired in 2007) and offer something different to its core merchandise. StubHub sells online tickets for sporting events, shows, and artists. Lastly, the Classifieds platforms sell unique products to localized markets; these include mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats, eBay Kleinanzeigen.The marketplace (eBay.com) makes up the largest portion out of the three with 67% of total revenue in 2017. However, StubHub is growing the fastest, and advertising is also showing great traction, growing by 10% each year since 2015.Source: eBay 10-K, 2017Despite Amazon eating up market share, with over 30% growth last year, eBay still managed to grow its Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) by 6% last year and active users by 4%. This proves that the products offering at eBay are sufficiently differentiated from Amazon for both platforms to co-exist.Source: eBay 10-K, 2017In the most recent quarter, the company generated $22.7 billion in GMV, a 9% growth Y-o-Y. Additionally, eBay is well diversified with approximately 60% of GMV generated outside the U.S.Source: eBay 10-Q, Q3-2018To date, eBay is still a $30B company, and its Marketplace and StubHub platforms have 177 million active buyers and over one billion live listings globally.Source: eBay’s Q3 presentationIn Peter Lynch’s words:Amazon has been crushing eBay in growth. However, the silver lining for eBay is, Amazon is doing so at the expense of profit. Nonetheless, eBay’s margin is hurting markedly. Recently, despite spending more on marketing, eBay's GMV has been growing modestly at 5%, its gross margin has dropped 1% to 77% from 78% last year, and operating margin has fallen 2% to 21% compared to 23% last year.Source: eBay’s Q3 presentationSource: eBay’s Q3 presentationIn Q3-18, sales and marketing increased 18% YoY while other expenses dropped. This impact trickled down to lower profits and free cash flow. Although the management explained that free cash flow would have been better if it was not for the timing of cash tax payments related to the investment in Flipkart (FPKT) (eBay owns 5.44%) and timing of working capital.Source: eBay’s Q3 presentationTwo green shootsDespite the margin pressure and decline in free cash flow, we see two bright spots.First, StubHub’s revenue grew by 8% in 2017, and by 7% in the most recent quarter, not a spectacular rate. However, it is higher than the consolidated growth with the take rate of 23.12%, compared to 8.39% in Marketplace. Nevertheless, it will take time to be material to eBay as currently StubHub only generates 5.4% of the total GMV. Thus, the effect on the overall transaction take rate is at or about 1%.Source: eBay 10-Q, Q3-2018The second green shoot is the strong growth in advertising revenue, at 9%. As the active user growth was only at 4%, the 9% growth in advertising means that the company has been able to attract, retain and monetize more traffic on its platform - quality over quantity.Source: eBay 10-Q, Q3-2018Advertising growth is encouraging particularly as it contributes to a larger percentage of revenue to the company, at 22%. In which, the Classifieds segment has been exceeding expectation. It recorded 13% growth in the latest quarter results.Source: eBay’s Q3 presentationThe effect of these two green shoots is evident. While eBay’s last quarter GMV growth at 5% was slower than previous quarters, the transaction take rate growth rate has improved.Source: eBay’s Q3 presentationThe sum of all the evidence above point to a very steady ship. Even if eBay’s GMV is not growing fantastically, the higher margin segments will improve the company’s future profit.There are a few other aspects that we find eBay is doing more than just surviving. For a start, we find the company very proactive in seeking growth and trimming non-core investments. Besides the PayPal spin-off in 2015, in 2016, it sold MercadoLibre, an online platform in Latin America, for $1.3B. While eBay still operates in the region, the sale allowed the company to take a huge gain on the investment and reduce exposure as the region has not grown to expectations.Instead, recently, eBay has made a strategic investment in India, a higher growth country. Flipkart was pivotal to this move. It was a $500 million cash investment plus the eBay India business in exchange for 5.44% ownership interest in Flipkart, a cost method investment of $725 million. We see the move as prudent as 'if you can’t compete then work with your competitor’. Another recent strategic investment is the in-house Payments system. The idea is to offer buyers more payment options other than PayPal. For sellers, it reduces the transaction costs. So that meansDevin Wenig - eBay, Inc., Q3 2018 CCManaging the new payments flow will allow eBay to simplify the end-to-end experience for both buyers and sellers. There are high expectations as thus far, the new system has successfully enabled $38M of GMV or $0.5B annually. However, it has only been a few months into the implementation of the Payments journey. We don’t expect to see material economic benefits just yet.For the last ten years, eBay has committed to serving shareholders, returning $1.5B worth of shares to investors each year. In 2018, the company repurchased $3B worth at an average purchase price of $37.82. We could see that the management has grossly overpaid for the shares in the past years, and forego a substantial amount of shares it could have retired.Source: eBay's financials, authors' workHowever, the consistent buyback proves that the company is committed to looking after investors’ interest. As of Q3, the remaining amount authorized for buyback is $4.7B.Source: eBay’s Q3 presentationDespite the significant capital expenditure in repurchasing shares, eBay can sustain its future commitments. It has a near $0.2B net debt position, incredibly strong liquidity supported by over $1.7B free cash flow, and a $2B five-year revolving credit facility. More importantly, the majority of its debts are senior notes, with the highest rate at 6% due 2056, the shorter-term notes are between 2-4%. Its leases stand at $311M, and other purchase obligations are $651M. Overall, eBay will have no issue with meeting its payments and buyback commitments in the foreseeable future.Source: eBay, Q3’18, 10-QAdditionally, as of Q3, 2018, eBay was rated BBB+ investment grade for long term and A-2 for short term, with a stable outlook, by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services.The businesses and markets in which eBay operates are intensely competitive. As mentioned, eBay competes with a wide variety of online and offline companies providing goods and services to consumers and merchants. eBay competes in two-sided markets and must attract both buyers and sellers. Consumers have more and more alternatives, and merchants have more channels to reach consumers. To shortlist a few in the United States, these include Amazon.com, Facebook (FB), Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Macy’s (M), J.C. Penney (JCP), Costco (COST), Office Depot (ODP), Sam’s Club, Rakuten, MSN, QVC, and Home Shopping Network, among others.The retail environment is also likely to change radically with the coming AI revolution. Amazon Go, the forerunner in this change is already seeing a positive reaction. The concept resonates well with customers as it provides convenience and a seamless retail buying experience. These automated shops are estimated to help retailers to improve revenue by 10% and at the same time reduce costs to consumers by 5%.There is not a like-to-like comparison with eBay, but we feel the most suitable comparable are Amazon and Etsy. From the following table, investors can pick any metrics and eBay would look a lot more attractive.If we have to pick just one, P/FCF shows that both Etsy and Amazon are at least three times more expensive.Source: Companies’ financials, authors’ workWe feel that the market is writing eBay off, and refuse to see the improvements that it is making. The 17.5x FCF multiple is higher than a typical brick and mortar retailer. However, eBay is a lot more asset-light and its gross and net margin are a whopping 77% and 22% respectively. These are impressive margins. They are head and shoulders higher than Etsy’s 65% and 12% respectively, and no doubt better than Amazon’s 25% and 5% respectively. Thus, we feel eBay should be trading higher than 17.5x FCF.The counter-argument is eBay’s slower growth. It recorded about 10% growth vs. 40% at Etsy and 30% at Amazon in the latest quarter results. However, we would still prefer to pay 17.5x FCF for a 10% growth than 57x and 63x for slightly higher rates (and lower margins). Additionally, the hyper-growth days will be a thing of the past as these companies get bigger. Lastly, eBay's high margin business is saying that it is doing much better than just staying relevant.Investors need to be reminded that this is a company that still attracts buyers and sellers to its platforms. It is making meaningful mid-digit growth at the core. Additionally, StubHub and Advertising are progressing nicely to add growth to the company.We argue that even in the case that strong growth does not materialize, eBay will still generate a ton of cash, more than enough to support the $1.5B annual average buyback that they have been executing over the last ten years. Thus, as long as the share price is low, they will keep using that extra cash to retire more shares, improving EPS year by year.Finally, the upside of investing in eBay today might not be substantial, but the downside is well protected. That is the number one rule of this game - ‘protect the downside'. The company is cash generative, liquidity is abundant, and its net debt position is close to zero. eBay is an excellent long-term buy in retail at the current price."

4238573,104618,2019-02-06T10:42:02-05:00,"The well-known activist investment firm, Elliott Management, sent a public letter to eBay’s Board of Directors articulating their rationale for investing in eBay and their plan for improvement.eBay appears to fit the activist investor playbook of underperforming operations, valuable assets hidden within the company, and a lagging stock price.Elliott’s “Enhancing eBay” plan appears reasonable as it looks to strengthen the core business over time rather than playing for short-term profits and putting the balance sheet at risk.","eBay (EBAY) was founded by Pierre Omidyar in 1995. He continues to be a top shareholder (owns ~6% of the company) and serves on the Board. The business has grown significantly since the first item was purchased (a broken laser pointer) over 20 years ago. Today, they are an e-commerce behemoth that facilitates nearly $95 billion worth of transactions across their various platforms.Elliott Management isn’t the first activist to be involved in the company. Carl Icahn was a large investor a few years back and ultimately pressured eBay to spin-off PayPal (PYPL). Over the last few years, eBay has struggled to grow despite participating in the secularly growing e-commerce market.Elliott made their position public with an open letter to the Board of Directors on January 22nd. Like many activist targets, eBay has some unique assets (StubHub and Classifieds) that Elliott is pushing to separate from the business. But more importantly, Elliott wants the core Marketplace segment to return to higher growth rates as well as improve an operating margin that has significantly deteriorated in recent years.In the simplest terms, eBay facilitates commerce. Through their various platforms of Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds, they connect millions of buyers and sellers. Their revenue model is based on collecting fees from successful sales on their platform as well as advertising.Starting a marketplace business is incredibly difficult. Without any sellers posting inventory, no buyers will go to the website. On the other hand, without any buyers coming to the website, no sellers will post inventory. eBay has solved this “chicken or the egg” problem and now has approximately 179 million active buyers and 25 million sellers transacting to generate a gross merchandise volume (“GMV”) of roughly $95 billion.For buyers they offer:For sellers they offer:Overall, eBay is one of the world’s largest online retailers and commands the #2 position in the U.S.On January 22, 2019, Elliott Management sent a public letter to eBay’s Board of Directors articulating their rationale for investing in eBay and their plan for improvement. The plan is organized around a handful of central pillars:Portfolio ReviewAs previously mentioned, eBay has many other online properties outside of the core eBay Marketplace. They also own StubHub, the online ticket exchange, and eBay Classifieds, a collection of online classifieds websites. These assets are growing faster than the Marketplace business and command premium valuations. Elliott believes that significant value could be created from selling or spinning off these assets.Furthermore, if eBay Classifieds and StubHub were valued on their own, then the remaining core eBay Marketplaces business would have an implied valuation of just ~6x EBITDA (at the time of the publication of the letter). This implies a depressed valuation for a profitable, growing business that is an attractive acquisition target.Revitalizing Marketplace Despite eBay’s long history and well-known brand in the e-commerce market, they have consistently underperformed industry and peer growth rates for some time. Put another way, eBay has lost substantial share over the years. As you can see in the chart below, eBay has significantly underperformed competitors such as Wayfair, Walmart (US e-commerce), Etsy, Target (digital channel sales), and Amazon.The company has had several issues over the last few years, including Google search algorithm changes, a password hack, and technical issues for sellers. Elliott wants management to refocus attention away from non-core projects towards the core eBay Marketplace business. Given the relative size of the business, revitalizing Marketplace will have the greatest impact on the overall company.Operational Improvement and Margin ExpansionAs eBay’s costs have grown much faster than revenues in recent years, margins have fallen from over 31% to ~23% from 2013 to 2018 (including the expensing of stock-based compensation). They have spent aggressively to grow the business (advertising spend up ~70% and product development spend up ~45% since 2013). Stock-based compensation has also grown rapidly, now representing over 5% of sales. This is much higher than peers. Yet, eBay is growing much slower. Needless to say, these increased investments have not delivered material incremental growth for the company and have resulted in operating profits actually declining since 2013.To tackle these issues Elliott proposes a handful of measures aimed at improving organizational productivity, sales and marketing efficiency, product development effectiveness, and vendor relationships, among others.This should result in eBay still having plenty of capital for the right projects to invigorate growth while at the same time ceasing spend on low return projects. Elliott believes this should increase operating margins by ~400bps to a 32% core adjusted operating margin by 2021. This margin target is in-line with eBay’s prior long-term margin range when they spun-off PayPal (PYPL).Capital Allocation / Leadership & OversightWhile eBay has a buyback program in place today, Elliott is pushing the company to accelerate this program given the combination of an upcoming earnings acceleration and a valuation that stands near multi-year lows.Their overall capital allocation plan calls for 80% of free cash flow to be returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends and the other 20% to be spent on M&A.Lastly, Elliott wants the Board of Directors to establish a Strategy and Operations Committee. The Committee’s mandate will be to successfully execute Elliott’s Enhancing eBay Plan.Note: On eBay’s fourth quarter 2018 conference call, they announced an increase in their repurchase authorization and expect to repurchase $5 billion of stock in 2019. Also, they initiated a dividend for the first time in their history (quarterly payment of $0.14/share). Therefore, it appears that eBay has already executed many of the capital allocation initiatives Elliott is pushing for.Based on eBay’s performance over the last few years, it’s clear they need to refocus on the Marketplace business. They have struggled to grow GMV above mid-single-digits during a time when the economic environment has been healthy. While that might not sound all that bad for a mature company, in the context of an end market that is growing double digits, it implies significant share loss.As the table below depicts, total worldwide e-commerce sales have grown in the 20% range over the last few years. Importantly, this growth is forecasted to continue into the future. For 2019, Shopify expects worldwide e-commerce to grow ~18%. In contrast, eBay expects GMV to grow just 1% at the mid-point. Clearly, eBay is not keeping pace in the quickly evolving environment.Rationalizing the cost structure while getting the business growing again will have a massive impact on the company.However, it is important to remember that eBay posted the below market growth rates while also spending heavily on advertising and product development. What would eBay’s growth have been if they didn’t ramp up that spending? This is the key question investors need to ask themselves.The answer to this question might very well be... at a similar growth rate because the advertising and product development spending was ineffective at driving GMV growth. But if this isn’t the case, then cutting the growth of investment spending will negatively impact the top line and the business could shrink.Elliott believes this won’t be the case and based on management commentary, it does look like eBay invested a lot in very low return projects.In addition to the advertising and product development spend, eBay also has some of the highest G&A costs in the peer group.In the context of below end market revenue growth and higher than average expenses, Elliott’s Enhancing eBay plan seems to make a lot of sense.Portfolio ReviewThe decision to separate Classifieds and StubHub is more nuanced. Whenever separating off an asset a company needs to decide if they are a better owner of the asset than it would be as a stand-alone entity or as a part of another company.In other words, does the core Marketplace business add value to StubHub and Classifieds or do StubHub and Classifieds add value to the Marketplace business?eBay’s management believes that there are synergies between the platforms.For Classifieds, they can increase the visibility of seller inventory by listing it across multiple websites. They are also able to leverage the traffic between the sites. For instance, if someone is searching for a product on a classifieds site and there is a product that matches the search for sale on eBay, then they will show an ad in the middle of the feed. Another big initiative for the company has been the Motors vertical expansion in several of their markets. This drove $200 million of GMV to eBay from Classifieds in 2018 and contributed roughly 1% of revenue growth to Classifieds in Q4 2018. While this sounds great, it is very small and only represents ~0.2% of Marketplace’s 2018 GMV.For StubHub, management talks about cross-merchandising between the platforms. For example, when you buy a ticket to a baseball game on StubHub, they will advertise a jersey for you to buy from eBay at checkout. Also, when you search for tickets in the eBay marketplace, they will redirect you to StubHub. They have been doing this for a few years now but haven’t quantified the impact of the efforts.Overall, there does appear to be some synergies from having eBay own all these separate websites. However, the warranted valuations for StubHub and Classifieds as stand-alone entities is probably much greater than any synergies eBay can achieve from owning these other platforms.Can eBay’s Other Opportunities Offset Competitive Pressures? eBay’s core Marketplace business faces significant threats by not only Amazon but also fast-growing e-commerce sites such as Wayfair, Etsy, Zalando, Walmart, Target, Shopify, Rakuten, etc. eBay is losing mind share with consumers as the large brick-and-mortar retailers heavily invest in their online presence and other more niche focused sites pop-up.These are significant risks, but eBay also has some very large opportunities to grow outside of pure GMV growth.AdvertisingTheir total Marketplace Advertising portfolio generated roughly $600 million in revenue in 2018, of which ~$180 million was Promoted Listings. They expect to grow this business to $1 billion over the next few years. This revenue growth should come on at a very high incremental margin.PaymentseBay is taking more control of the payments on their site which will lower costs for sellers, increase payment options for buyers, as well as increase revenue for eBay. The agreement with PayPal allows eBay to intermediate up to 5% of GMV between July 2018 and July 2019 and 10% between July 2019 and July 2020. There is no operating agreement with PayPal beyond that time.eBay’s management has framed the opportunity at $2 billion in revenue and $500 million of operating profit once they convert all their GMV.eBay has struggled to find its place in recent years with GMV growth significantly underperforming the broader global e-commerce market. They have invested significant capital and tested a wide range of initiatives, but the results have been underwhelming.Elliott’s plan is centered around separating off the Classifieds and StubHub segments as well as refocusing on the core Marketplace business. While there appears to be some benefit to eBay owning StubHub and Classifieds, any benefit is overwhelmed by the discounted valuations placed on these assets because they are part of eBay. Their plan for the Marketplace segment is to refocus on the core business which should help streamline costs while investing in the right initiatives to reinvigorate growth. This appears to strike an appropriate balance between efficiently running the company while not depriving it of capital needed for attractive projects.Overall, Elliott’s involvement appears to be positive for shareholders. They are not pushing for inappropriate leverage levels or indiscriminate cuts across the board to hit margin targets. While eBay faces many competitive pressures, which appear to be intensifying, they still participate in a secularly growing industry. If they are able to start growing at a high single-digit rate with expanding margins, it could be a very attractive investment over the coming years."
4237087,103480,2019-01-31T11:31:48-05:00,"Shares of eBay wavered between gains and losses after reporting Q4 results.Investors weighed the merits of a Q4 beat and new dividend versus a light guidance for the coming year and a deteriorating GMV print.GMV growth dipped to just 2% y/y, down from 5% y/y in the prior quarter.Management hinted that several product initiatives, while appealing to new users, led to churn in the existing user base.eBay’s tepid low-growth forecast for 2019 and continued challenges in retaining GMV volumes make it a risky stock to invest in.","In yet another quarter, onetime technology giant eBay (EBAY) reported more bad news than good. On the plus side, eBay managed to squeak past Wall Street’s expectations on both the top and bottom lines in Q4. The bad news is that transaction volumes (as measured by GMV) continue to dwindle, including in previous areas of strength like StubHub. Shares bounced around between gains and losses in response to the Q4 print; thus far in 2019, shares of eBay are already up an impressive 17%:Data by YChartsIn my view, investors should cut their exposure to eBay, especially given the meritless rise over the past several weeks. Quarter after quarter, eBay continues to show that it is a company going nowhere. Growth initiatives are limited, and the company is constantly playing defense in retaining customers and market share in an e-commerce arena dominated by Amazon.eBay’s flimsy 2019 guidance is a telling indicator of this company’s trajectory:Figure 1. eBay guidanceSource: eBay Q4 earnings deckThe company’s revenue range of $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion in revenues implies virtually no growth, despite exiting Q4 at a revenue growth rate of 6% y/y. The weak GMV seen in this quarter is likely to carry forward and provide further headwinds to revenue growth in the coming year. It’s worth noting as well that eBay’s Q1 revenue guidance of $2.55 billion to $2.60 billion is substantially below Wall Street’s consensus of $2.66 billion.One of the reasons investors are somewhat forgiving of eBay is the fact that the company has initiated its first-ever dividend of $0.14 per share. Assuming this becomes a regular quarterly dividend, eBay will pay out $0.56 annually and yield ~1.6% at current share prices. In my view, however, a dividend is scarcely a reason to be bullish on eBay: especially when its core business is showing signs of decline.The problem with eBay is that there is no guarantee that it can continue to retain its user base or GMV volumes. Without any guarantee of loyalty from eBay’s target market, this is a company that can soon slip to negative y/y growth in FY19 and beyond. As such, eBay is far too risky to invest in. Steer clear.eBay’s main problem lies in its consistently weakening GMV, or gross merchandise volume - a measure of the dollar value of goods exchanged on the eBay platform, as well as eBay Classifieds and StubHub. Here’s a look at the company’s latest GMV results below:Figure 2. eBay GMVSource: eBay Q4 earnings deckAs can be seen in the chart above, GMV growth decelerated three points to just 2% y/y, down from 5% in the prior quarter. GMV growth in the U.S. actually slipped negative. Meanwhile, sold items growth (the unit count of transactions on the eBay platform) continued to experience 0% y/y growth.The slowdown in GMV was not a fluke. Devin Wenig, eBay’s CEO, offered the following explanation for the GMV slowdown on the Q4 earnings call (key points highlighted below):There are two major red flags here: the fact that existing users seem to be peeling off in response to UI changes, and the fact that eBay is turning up less in search results. This alone is a major driver into the flat y/y revenue growth forecasted in FY19, and a huge warning into the company’s future trajectory.Let’s dive deeper into eBay’s actual Q4 results:Figure 3. eBay 4Q18 resultsSource: eBay Q4 earnings deckMiraculously, eBay managed to generate 6% y/y revenue growth to $2.88 billion, beating Wall Street’s expectations of $2.86 billion (+5% y/y). Typically, revenue growth tends to fall in tandem with GMV growth, but this quarter, eBay managed to eke out stronger revenue growth thanks to a slightly higher transaction take rate (9.3% this quarter versus 8.7% in the year-ago Q4).Increases in transaction take rates, however, are not sustainable sources of growth. eBay has already been victim to frequent complaints from sellers about its fee structure. Going forward, if eBay wants to drive continued revenue growth, it will have to produce a lift in GMV.Fortunately for eBay, the company still managed to drive positive EPS growth as well. Pro forma EPS of $0.71 grew 20% y/y, thanks to a lighter tax rate. However, we do note that eBay’s operating margins took a hit this quarter, dipping to 29.2% (60bps lower than 29.8% in the year-ago quarter).Figure 4. eBay bottom line trendsSource: eBay Q4 earnings deckThe main culprit is a jump in sales and marketing expenses, which rose to 31.8% of revenues (versus 28% in the year-ago quarter). eBay has been aggressively spending on advertisements in an effort to stimulate growth, but as previously mentioned, search hits are suffering and eBay’s marketing efficiency seems to have lost vigor. Thankfully, reductions in both general and administrative and product development spending (each of which dropped 150bps as a percentage of revenues) helped to offset the jump in sales and marketing expenses.However, we note that poor marketing results will continue to be a huge headwind for eBay in FY19 - especially because it has guided to 28-29% in pro forma operating margins for the year, up from 27.2% in FY17. How are we to believe that eBay can really improve its operating margins if it ended FY18 with poor advertising performance leading to a dip in margins?Don't be fooled by eBay's introduction of a dividend: eBay is still in bad shape, as evidenced by its deteriorating GMV performance. In fact, eBay's dividend is almost an affirmation that the company has no viable opportunities for growth left to invest in. Instead of directing its free cash flow into finding new sources of revenue, eBay is pumping capital returns (in addition to the dividend, eBay is adding $4 billion to its buyback program). Until eBay can find a way to turn its revenue and GMV growth around, investors should avoid this stock. This is a legacy technology company that may not have an adequate user base to support its existence in 2-3 years."

Auction-style e-commerce just isn't cutting it with consumers anymore, with most preferring the convenience and speed of Amazon.com (AMZN). The exodus from eBay has occurred not just on the buyer side, but from the seller side as well, where complaints of high fees have sparked defections to other e-commerce sites. In fact, eBay's loss of sellers is such a gaping problem for the company that it sued Amazon in October of using an internal messaging system to poach eBay's sellers.eBay shares rose modestly after reporting Q3 results - primarily because revenue growth was better than feared. Earlier in October, eBay investors panicked when PayPal revealed on its earnings call that eBay volumes were ""light"" - recall that earlier this year, eBay announced it would be replacing PayPal gradually over the next few years with overseas rival Adyen. EBAY data by YChartsEven with PayPal shares trailing near 52-week lows, off 35% from highs and trading at a measly forward P/E of 13.0x, it's difficult to be bullish on this legacy technology company. The company is struggling to keep up with e-commerce rivals as it hobbles along with essentially flat user growth and GMV growth, and meanwhile, it isn't cutting expenses quickly enough to become a free cash flow play.Steer clear of this stock - it's not likely to stop underperforming the market anytime soon.The biggest red flag against eBay is that, quarter after quarter, it has suffered through weak GMV growth. Recall that GMV is a measure of the total dollar volume of goods transacted on eBay's platform, and it's a metric widely used across the e-commerce space. Here's a look at this quarter's GMV results:Figure 1. eBay 3Q18 GMVSource: eBay investor relationsOn a constant currency basis, total GMV of $22.7 billion slipped two points to just 5% y/y relative to last quarter's GMV growth rate of 7% y/y. While international growth remained steady, the U.S. saw a huge decline to just 3% y/y growth. The number of sold items, meanwhile, continued its flat y/y growth rate from last quarter.One bright spot in the quarter is that StubHub GMV saw a slight acceleration, after suffering from a weak Q2. The company attributed the outperformance to strength in concerts. Figure 2. StubHub GMVSource: eBay investor relationsStill, StubHub is only a small ~5% piece of eBay's total GMV, and the acceleration here wasn't enough to counteract the steep declines in eBay's flagship marketplace sales. Let's dive further into eBay's full third-quarter results:Figure 3. eBay 3Q18 resultsSource: eBay investor relationsTotal revenues grew 6% y/y to $2.65 billion, exactly in-line with Wall Street's estimates. Of course, sentiment for eBay had been poor in the weeks leading up to the earnings release, as PayPal's ""light"" commentary had sparked fears of much worse results. Still, it's difficult to deny that eBay is in constant deceleration mode. Last quarter, eBay had grown revenues at 9% y/y. Over the next year or two, it wouldn't be surprising to see this company in negative y/y territory.eBay's revenue growth, of course, closely tracks its GMV growth. eBay's CFO Scott Schenkel blamed the sequential deceleration on a strong U.S. dollar, hurting shipments to international buyers. Per Schenkel's comments on the earnings call:eBay's failure to raise its growth rate from single-digit territory is a reflection of the tremendous challenges the company faces as an older brand that is losing its luster with buyers and sellers alike. In my view, it's a huge risk to invest in eBay just as its faint hold on the e-commerce landscape is fading. Perhaps equally concerning as eBay's revenue and GMV deceleration, however, is erosion in the company's operating margins. eBay is no longer a growth company - it's a legacy technology firm that is fighting to retain market share, and as such, the bullish value thesis relies on the company's ability to produce a strong bottom line.Unfortunately this quarter, eBay saw a huge 200bps contraction in pro forma operating margins, as shown in the chart below:Figure 3. eBay operating marginsSource: eBay investor relationsThe biggest driver of this margin contraction was a bump in sales and marketing expenses, which jumped 18% y/y and consumed 32.2% of revenues, versus just 28.9% in the year-ago quarter. Of course, advertising investments are long-term moves whose ROI cannot easily be judged in a single quarter, but it's worth noting that when 18% y/y marketing expense growth results in just 6% y/y top line growth, a loss of advertising efficiency is implied.This margin erosion also trickled through into cash flow, where free cash flow all throughout 2018 has lagged far behind results in 2017: Figure 4. eBay FCFSource: eBay investor relationsAs of the end of the third quarter, eBay is still shouldering a debt balance of about $9 billion, which is only just covered by a cash balance of roughly equal size. Over the trailing twelve months, eBay has generated just $1.7 billion in free cash flow (and the recent trend is weakening), so relative to its FCF, eBay's ~5x leverage ratio is somewhat alarming. Having a levered balance sheet in a time of revenue slowdown and margin contraction only heightens the risk of investing in eBay.eBay's third-quarter results show a company that is no closer to reinventing itself and asserting its place in the e-commerce landscape. Revenues and GMV continued a recent trend of alarming deceleration, while margins and free cash flow are compressed due to heightened marketing spend that may not yield fruitful results. Despite a seemingly cheap valuation at a forward P/E of 13.0x, eBay is hardly a value stock. There are few upside catalysts remaining for eBay, and it's difficult to see how the company's investments in new Payments and Advertising initiatives can counteract the continual deterioration of its flagship Marketplace platform. Investors are better off looking elsewhere for deals."

Rival eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) comes in a distant second with a modest 6.6% market share. The report estimates total US e-commerce sales to be nearly $253 billion by the end of the current year.eBay recently announced its third quarter results. Revenues for the quarter grew 10% over the year to $2.65 billion, in line with the market's estimates. EPS of $0.56 was better than the market's forecast of $0.54 for the quarter.During the quarter, revenue from Marketplace platforms grew 6% over the year to $2.1 billion on a GMV of $21.5 billion. StubHub revenues grew 7% to $291 million on a GMV of $1.2 billion. Classifieds platforms delivered revenues of $254 million, growing 8% over the year.Among operating metrics, eBay active buyers grew 4% across its platforms to 177 million. The Street was looking for 176 million global active buyers across the service.For the fourth quarter, eBay forecast revenues of $2.85-$2.89 billion with an EPS of $0.67-$0.69. The market was looking for Q4 revenues of $2.89 billion with an EPS of $0.67. It expects to end the current year with revenues of $10.72-$10.76 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.29-$2.31. The Street was looking for an EPS of $2.28 for the year.During the quarter, eBay rolled out several new or expanded programs to help gain more customers. For its seller community, eBay entered into an agreement with Square Capital, which will allow eBay's sellers access to $100,000 in funding to grow their business. Square Capital already had a small business loan program that it had started back in 2014. Through its agreement with eBay, sellers will be able to get loans ranging from $500-$100,000 in an easier and a faster manner. Not every eBay seller will be eligible for financing, but those who are will receive an email invitation to apply for a loan later this year. The cash can be used for anything to do with growing a business, including building inventory and marketing.For the developers, eBay introduced new application programming interfaces that will allow them to incorporate eBay features such as Image Search, machine translation, and marketplace feeds into their own platforms.eBay recently announced its plans to acquire Motors.co.uk, a UK-based classifieds site. Owned by Cox Automotive, Motors.co.uk is a leading UK-based classifieds site that simplifies the process of car buying and selling. Post the acquisition, Motors.co.uk will become part of Gumtree, eBay's Classifieds business for the UK. Motors.co.uk has more than 350,000 used car listings on its platform and has tie ups with over 5,000 of the UK's leading automotive dealers for car sales. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.In 2015, eBay and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) split to form two independent companies. Earlier this year, eBay severed its ties further with PayPal by announcing plans to use Adyen as its primary payment partner as it builds its own payment platform. It expects to have its platform ready by 2023.As part of this effort, eBay rolled out its new payments experience in the US last month. Since the launch, the service has intermediated $38 million of GMV. It also announced its integration with Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL), allowing iOS users to use that form of payment. eBay claims that it has seen 12% of iOS transactions being paid through Apple Pay.eBay is making the right moves, but Amazon is just too far ahead in the market. As users, which platform do you prefer to use, and why? Are there specific products that you select from eBay, or is it Amazon all the way for you? What features do you think eBay is missing that keeps you away from the platform?The market hasn't been very pleased with eBay this year. Its stock has fallen more than 25% since the start of the year. It is currently trading at $29.04 with a market capitalization of $28.7 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $46.99 earlier this year. It had fallen to a 52-week low of $26.36 last week amid bearish trends ahead of the result announcement."
4213228,22148,2018-10-22T16:06:20-04:00,eBay tanked following PayPal reporting weak TPV numbers for the online merchant.The online retailer has only started the process of managed payments that removes PayPal from the process.The stock is incredibly cheap with no actual confirmation that GMV will be weak due to the payments transition.,"eBay (EBAY) plunged 9% on Friday as the market reacted to GMV numbers provided by PayPal (PYPL). Considering eBay is in the process of implementing managed payments that removes PayPal from the process, investors need to be careful with data from a potentially unhappy partner. My investment thesis remains bullish.Image Source: eBay websiteeBay is in the process of implementing a new managed payments process to reduce sellers processing fees and to improve the payments process. The company said this about payments after a week into the process that included a few days at the end of September:The biggest hiccup in the new payments system is that PayPal won't be an option until 2019. Apple (AAPL) Pay is now available on mobile so a trade off exists in the beginning.The interesting part here is that eBay has been out with a couple of press releases claiming the process is going well. The following infographic has the company already processing over $20 million in GMV within just three weeks on limited sellers. The claimed savings for sellers is already an incredible $175,000 that approaches 1% of GMV. Source: eBay Sellers have to love a system that saves them money and immediately sends funds into their bank account. The major problem is that PayPal claims that sellers aren't seeing the same level of sales. In fact, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman went out of his way on their Q3 earnings call to claim sellers are seeing substantial sales declines.PayPal provided a slide showing that payments processed from eBay only grew 3.4% in the quarter. The growth rate was previously in the 7% range to end 2017.Source: PayPal Q3'18 presentationWhat's known is that eBay sales weren't impacted in Q3 due to the implementation of managed payments for a limited amount of sellers at months end. The $20 million in GMV is a fraction of the $23.6 billion that eBay processed during Q2.The question is whether eBay had done anything that encouraged the shift away from PayPal. Sales already were disconnecting in the last few quarters with eBay reporting currency neutral sales relatively flat around 7% and PayPal reporting that their eBay volumes had decelerating growth.A key point is that eBay has an obligation to shareholders to not write such glowingly positive news releases about the managed payments process, if the move was indeed impacting sales.The key investor takeaway is that eBay has become a very cheap stock at 11x forward EPS estimates. Investors should be wary of data points directly from the payments company that eBay is trying to remove from the process to cut processing fees. PayPal definitely doesn't want the online retailer to be successful.Use likely further weakness this week to buy the stock. As this chart shows, The market has become far too pessimistic on eBay.Source: MarketWatchDisclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

4211048,69675,2018-10-11T07:10:35-04:00,"One of the fastest-growing parts of eBay is its Classifieds business, which is a collection of miscellaneous sites.Though it is a small piece of the firm, its growth has been robust in recent years and it is becoming more important to the company every day.Future growth prospects should be appealing for the next several years at least.Given eBay's strong cash flow, there's a great deal of opportunity for management to invest in this attractive trend.","*Taken from KijijiAlmost everybody who knows anything about eBay (EBAY) sees the company as an online auction house and, in a sense, that’s what the business is at its core. That said, the business itself is far more complex than that, with its hands dipped in a number of areas, not only in the US but abroad as well. And while eBay has not demonstrated the same kind of robust growth over the years that rival Amazon (AMZN) has, it has thrived in its own way. In particular, an increasingly-vital part of the enterprise is its focus on the fragmented Classifieds market. It is through this small part of its operations that eBay is experiencing some of its fastest growth, growth that, in the long run, should add value for the company’s shareholders.eBay, at this time, owns several properties that fall under its Classifieds business. In particular, we have platforms like mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats, and eBay Kleinanzeigen. mobile.de, for instance, is positioned as a major platform for Germans to list and buy cars from. Kijiji, meanwhile, allows people to list homes for rent, cars for sale, tools, furniture, and more. According to the company’s website, Kijiji, which was founded in 2005, is the largest Classifieds site in Canada, with 2 new ads posted by users every second. Collectively, the site boasts that 16 million users utilize it every month.Gumtree has operations in markets like the UK and Australia (where it was founded in 2000 and eventually acquired by eBay). In the UK, the company is considered the nation’s largest Classifieds site for postings ranging from job opportunities, to vehicles and properties for sale, to enlisting tutors and joining clubs. Based on the company’s website, an estimated one-third of the UK’s adult population uses the site each month. Marktplaats, eBay Kleinanzeigen, and other platforms are known to be significant players in their markets as well.Revenue generated by Classifieds is considered MS&O revenue. This means Marketing Services & Other, and is essentially a catch-all classification by management and includes final value fees, listing fees, service ads, vehicles listing fees, and more. For Classifieds specifically, the bulk of the revenue appears to be attributable to advertisements posted by the company.Though this collection of digital properties may not be looked upon favorably by some investors, the fact of the matter is that there can be big value extracted from their sale if eBay ever decides to go that route. Though a private business with no significant public filings and a more singular focus than assets like Kijiji or Gumtree, job hunting service Glassdoor sold earlier this year for $1.2 billion. It’s not inconceivable that these miscellaneous assets eBay happens to be sitting on could be attractive assets for prospective buyers.Sadly, eBay does not issue any fundamental data related to individual Classifieds-centric companies, but it does provide investors with a look at the operations on the whole. As you can see in the graph below, sales growth posted by Classifieds has been quite significantly over the past few years. Back in 2015, revenue came in at $703 million. By 2017, that figured had grown to $897 million. To put this in perspective, StubHub, which is the only part of eBay that’s growing faster than Classifieds, generated sales in 2017 of $1.03 billion, just $131 million lower than what Classifieds generated.*Created by AuthorAggregate growth from Classifieds in the past few years is nothing to sneeze at. According to eBay’s financial filings, revenue from 2015 through 2017 expanded by 27.6%. This is slower than the 45.2% (including some corporate impacts) reported for StubHub, but it was enough growth to see Classifieds become a more relevant part of the business. Back in 2015, Classifieds accounted for just 8.2% of eBay’s revenue. By 2017, that figure had grown to 9.4%. So far, that trend shows no signs of stopping. In the first two quarters of 2018, the operation’s revenue totaled $505 million, up 20.8% compared to the same two quarters of last year, and as a percent of sales, it has risen to 9.7% versus the 8.9% that was seen in the first two quarters of 2017.*Taken from StatistaAs internet access grows globally, and as commerce becomes even more tied to the web than it is today, we will see the Classifieds space grow at a nice clip. According to one source I found, total global revenue associated with Classifieds came out to around $18.16 billion in 2017. By 2022, that figure is expected to grow by 51% to $27.44 billion. That translates to an annual increase of about 8.6%. Given that management at eBay likely recognizes this trend, and thanks to the $2.2 billion in projected free cash flow the whole entity is expected to generate this year, eBay will have plenty of opportunities to capitalize on this area.While it is true that eBay is an online auction house, the company is far larger and far more complicated than just that. Case-in-point, we have its Classifieds business, which consists of a menagerie of digital assets that collectively bring in significant sales and growth for shareholders. Individually, it’s impossible to tell how much these assets are worth, but with attractive aggregate sales nearing or possibly even surpassing $1 billion this year, and with years of robust growth prospects ahead, shareholders in eBay should find this part of the business compelling."
4210557,101450,2018-10-08T18:43:56-04:00,"Earnings numbers from eBay continue to underwhelm analysts resulting in a sharp downtrend in its trading in 2018.Despite high consumer confidence and optimism in e-commerce, eBay's volume and active user base growth remain flat.The internet retailer has healthy cash flow, but share repurchase programs of $1 billion a quarter and high debt keep the company from spending to achieve growth.","On October 17th, after the market closes, the online retail company eBay (EBAY) will report earnings for its fiscal third quarter. Shares of the company have been on a severe downtrend since the beginning of the year. Since the beginning of February, traders traded EBAY down from $46.99, its 52-week high, to its current price around $32.30, its 52-week low. Investors will be looking to see if the stock can reverse and rally if fundamentals improve. However, the company needs to find a way to successfully implement its business model in a relatively expansive macroeconomic environment.From Finviz.comWhile EBAY has done little to impress Wall Street with its earnings numbers, it hasn’t necessarily disappointed it either. Five out of the eight last earnings per share numbers have been in line with Wall Street estimates, and the other three numbers were only one or two pennies above expectations. On the revenue side, EBAY saw year-over-year growth of 9.1 percent and 12.2 percent in the last two quarters, but both numbers weren’t large enough to beat Wall Street expectations. It seems EBAY has done just enough to get by, and that has investors looking for other stocks that are exceeding expectations in a healthy economy.From FREDAn investor looking at the macroeconomic movements in the economy would expect an online retailer like EBAY to be thriving. Consumer confidence is at all-time highs based on the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey. A large part of that has to do with tax cuts introduced almost a year ago that are supposed to expand consumer discretionary spending. More specifically in the retail industry, the growth of e-commerce retail sales market share is accelerating consistently. EBAY has the platform and the reputation to take advantage of these trends, but it can’t seem to deliver impressive results.From Q2 slidesDespite revenue being higher, EBAY reported that its gross merchandise volume (GMV) did grow at all year-over-year. U.S. GMV actually fell slightly only being offset by a slightly higher international GMV. Looking at trailing 12-month active buyers, EBAY managed to keep up its 4 percent growth rate from the previous quarter (down from 5 percent in every 2017 quarter), but only with the help of the acquisition of Japanese business Giosis. The core numbers look mediocre even though the company reported a decent year-over-year sales growth of 9.1 percent. Meanwhile, its largest online competitor, Amazon (AMZN) saw sales grow 39.4 percent with profit nearly doubling.From Q2 slidesEBAY’s problem definitely isn’t generating cash from operations. Even though the last two quarters of 2018 saw significantly lower cash flows (due to tax payments), the company is consistently converting 20 percent of revenue to free cash. This seems optimistic at first, but EBAY is an internet services company trying to survive in an industry that demands high rates of returns and plenty of growth. Returning $1.0 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases suggests that EBAY’s management does not think it can spur growth by spending cash. While that’s not always the solution, management’s only attempts at improvements are being applied to a new “managed payment service” and a new “advertising campaign” according to the previous quarter’s conference call.While $8.6 billion sits as cash and investments on EBAY’s assets side, the company also boasts about $9.3 billion worth of long-term debt. Over $1.5 billion of that will become current liabilities in 2019 as those senior notes will be due. Assuming EBAY plans on continuing its $1 billion share repurchase programs every quarter, about $5.5 billion will be tied up in possible commitments in the next year. When that time comes, investors will see whether EBAY wants to take its competition seriously and plan on getting into the mergers and acquisitions market (as that seems like its only play at high growth again). On the other hand, rising rates puts a dampener on any taking on large amounts of debt in the future especially if active users and GMV growth start to flatten.EBAY won’t just flatten on its own though; it will have help from the many internet retailers that have already staked out large market share positions. Amazon and Alibaba (BABA) are the two of the most popular web services in the world and lead the internet retail industry in the two largest economies in the world. EBAY, in fact, had a recent clash with AMZN as it accused its competitor of “trying to poach sellers” for its own platform according to MarketWatch.EBAY has its work cut out for it. Management has to deal with core fundamentals that don’t signal robust growth. Large debts require it to stay cash conservative, especially if the company plans on continuing its share repurchase programs. Meanwhile, competition rages on in key markets where EBAY has shown it has relatively little success in generating fast growth. The upcoming earnings report will probably be mediocre once again, and therefore, buying before it should be avoided as the risks are high."
4206175,22148,2018-09-13T20:01:57-04:00,eBay continues to make platform enhancements that will keep growth rates close to 10%.The online platform is aggressively making stock buybacks similar to levels from back in 2015 when the stock surged.The net payout yield sits at nearly 11% now.,"After a roughly $13 dip, eBay (EBAY) has caught our attention due to strong net payout yields. A stock at 52-week lows consistently buying large amounts of stock while working on platform improvements provides some of the best opportunities in the market.Image Source: eBay websiteeBay spent the prior decade as a mostly sleepy online retail platform. The company spent the last year improving the platform with Interests and Best Guarantee, among other improvements. The excitement is in the shift to take advantage of the financial aspect of a platform that generates more than $100 billion in annual gross merchandising volumes (GMV).After the quarter close, eBay teamed up with Square (SQ) to offer sellers access to loans ranging up to $100,000. Similar to how Square Capital offers loans to existing payments customers on their platform, eBay has a few viewpoints into the health of their customer base to provide an advantage in the ability to offer top sellers additional capital to expand business.At the start of the year, eBay announced intentions to move payment processing away from PayPal (PYPL) to Adyen. The new payments process will reduce fees for sellers and offer more payment options for buyers. In the process, eBay will improve the checkout process and already has a plan to work with Apple Pay (AAPL).These platform enhancements and changes in the marketplace provide confidence that eBay can continue the recent path of growing revenues toward the 10% rate.The part that makes eBay really interesting is the signal from the company. The stock is almost priced for the EPS growth rate at around 14x, but the company suggests the stock is far too cheap down here with the initiatives undergoing in advertising, payments and platform enhancements.In Q2, eBay repurchased an incredible $1.0 billion worth of stock. The market cap is only $34 billion, so the company bought roughly 2.6% of the outstanding shares by buying 26 million shares in the quarter.An important view of the buybacks is that eBay has again become aggressive with share buybacks. The cumulative TTM total is now approaching the peaks back in early 2015 when the stock was down in the low $20s.The outcome is that eBay is again making a similar prediction that the stock is cheap just like the period back in 2015 prior to the stock doubling over the next few years. The net payout yield (combination of dividend yield and net stock buyback yield) is now back above 10%, signaling an extreme bargain. The combination of lower stock prices and higher buyback spending has been well timed this year.eBay has $8.6 billion in cash on the balance sheet as of June 30. Selling the Flipkart shares in India will add another $1.1 billion to the coffers. The online marketplace has a similar level of debt, so eBay can't wildly spend on share buybacks; but the key is the flexibility to repurchase shares as the opportunity exists.The key investor takeaway is that eBay offers a key combination for our investment model. The stock is near recent lows and the company is repurchasing shares while the long-term fundamentals remain positive. Use the weakness to build a position in eBay.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

Follow this account and turn on the e-mail alert to receive VCDeals in your inbox on Saturday mornings.Did we miss a notable deal? Let us know in the comments.  WeWork gets $1B: WeWork (VWORK) secured a $1B investment from SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBF, OTCPK:SFTBY). The disclosure happened in the co-working company’s first financial presentation, which happened due to the spring bond sale. The company remains in talks with other potential investors for an additional $1B with a $42B valuation float. WeWork continues to march towards a 2019 IPO.  WeWork’s 1H18 losses tripled Y/Y to $723M with revenue run rate of $1.8B (up from $1.5B at end of Q1). SoftBank’s latest investment, structured as a convertible note,  brought the existing cash pile and commitments up to $4B. The company plans to use the funds for overseas expansion, building office space, and acquiring new properties and leaseholds.   Uber trucking competitor: Chinese truck-hailing platform Manbang Group is seeking $1B in new funding, according to WSJ sources. Previous backers include SoftBank and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) with Manbang currently approaching U.S.-based mutual funds and late-stage investors. The new cash would push Manbang to a $10B valuation.  Manbang Group’s mobile app matches merchants to truckers to transport cargo and also offers stored-value toll cards, diesel cards, and member financing. As of June, about 3.1M truckers logged into the app at least once a month, up 36% on the year. The company will use the new funds to expand in China. Sources suggest Manbang is also building up cash for some domestic acquisitions perhaps in the field of autonomous trucking.  Competition: Uber Freight, which is undergoing a structural overhaul as Uber doubles its investments in the unit.  EBay competitor: Naspers (NPSND, OTCPK:NPSNY) provided $500M in funding for used goods app marketplace LetGo. Valuation was sitting at around $1.5B before the newest infusion. Previous backers have included Accel, Insight Venture Partners, and Eight Roads Ventures.  LetGo says the app has passed 100M downloads and 400M listings in total with monthly listers up 65% YTD. Message metrics include 13M messages sent daily and 6B total since the opening three years ago. The business is primarily based in the U.S. and Spain (through a merger with local startup Wallapop).  Competition: EBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Craigslist, and OfferUp, to name a few.  Increased Slack: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams competitor Slack is reportedly raising at least $400M on a $7B+ valuation. TechCrunch sources say General Atlantic is leading the round with Dragoneer among the backers.  Slack recently passed 8M daily active users with 3M paying subscribers. The company has 70K paid enterprise teams including Capital One, IBM, and eBay and 65% of the Fortune 100. Slack recently bought and closed competitor HipChat from Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) in exchange for a Slack stake.  Competition: Microsoft, which reported 200K paying Teams organizations earlier this year, recently launched a free tier to take on Slack and Facebook launched Workplace.  Travel experience platform: TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) and Airbnb (AIRB) competitor Klook raised $200M from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Boyu Capital, TCV, Sequoia China, Matrix Partners, and OurCrowd. Total fundraising now totals $296.5M. Klook declined to provide its valuation.  Hong Kong-based Klook will use the funding to move into the U.S. and European markets. The company’s platform sells travel experiences and attraction tickets and Klook says it’s on track for $1B in bookings this year. Klook is available across Asia with Greater China serving as the largest market. Klook plans to open its first U.S. office by the end of the year.  DDR cancer treatment: Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) Ventures, Novartis (NYSE:NVS) Venture Fund, and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) Ventures participated in a $84M Series B round in Artios Pharma, developer of DNA Damage Response treatments for cancer. Andera Partners and Life Sciences Partners led the round with participation from Arix Bioscience, SV Health Investors, M Ventures, and IP Group. The round brought total funding up to about $115M.  Artios treatments target tumors where DNA damage response factors have been lost or down regulated, which can selectively kill cancer cells without harming normal cells. The treatments can also potentially work well in combination therapies with existing treatments. You can find the current Artios pipeline here.  Competition: Sierra Oncology (NASDAQ:SRRA) is also working on DDR cancer therapies.  CNS gene therapy: Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRPT) made a $30M equity investment in gene therapy company Lacerta, which was spun out from the University of Florida. The investment gave Sarepta exclusive rights to central nervous system-targeted gene therapy for the metabolic disorder Pompe Disease and two unnamed programs for other rare CNS disease. Sarepta will take over once clinical testing starts in the programs.  Sarepta committed to paying Lacerta development and sales-based milestones plus single-digit royalties on net sales. Lacerta gained access to Sarepta’s talent, dosing and delivery platform, capsid screening library, and manufacturing technology. Sarepta got to add three gene therapies to the existing eight programs. Competition: Avrobio (NASDAQ:AVRO) and Audentes Therapeutics (NASDAQ:BOLD) are among the companies working on gene therapies for Pompe Disease.

4196109,20521,2018-08-07T20:17:16-04:00,The Walmart and Flipkart deal made eBay change its India strategy.The sale of Flipkart will imply that eBay would receive $1.1 billion from Walmart for eBay's 5.4% stake in Flipkart.eBay plans to use those funds to relaunch eBay India.,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) recently reported a lackluster second quarter that beat analyst estimates for earnings but missed the revenue estimates. Its outlook also was disappointing.eBay's Q2 revenues grew just 9% over the year to $2.6 billion, below the Street's expectations of $2.66 billion and the company's revenue guidance range of $2.64-$2.68 billion. Net income was $638 million or $0.64 per share. Non-GAAP net income was up 17% to $533 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, above analyst estimates of $0.51.By segment, revenue from its Marketplace grew 9% to $1.8 billion. StubHub revenues grew 5% to $240 million. Marketing services and other revenue increased 10% to $563 million including Marketplace revenue of $298 million (up 6%) and Classifieds revenue of $259 million (up 18%).Among operating metrics, eBay's active buyers rose 4% to 175 million at the end of the quarter. It reported that the gross merchandise value transacted on the marketplace platform was up 11% to $22.6 billion. GMV for Stubhub improved 5% to $1.1 billion.During the quarter, eBay repurchased $1 billion of its common stock. The company's total repurchase authorization remaining as of June 30, 2018, was $5.7 billion. The company's cash and cash equivalents and non-equity investments portfolio totaled $8.6 billion at the end of the quarter.For the third quarter, eBay forecast revenues of $2.64-$2.69 billion or a growth of 5%-7%. It expects GAAP EPS in the range of $0.37-$0.41 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.54-$0.56. The market was looking for revenues of $2.73 billion and an EPS of $0.56.During the quarter, eBay launched a new feature called Interests that tailors consumers' shopping experience based on their passions, hobbies, and style. Shoppers select what they're interested in, and the new feature customizes their homepage with themes and items chosen just for them.eBay also introduced Best Price Guarantee that offers US shoppers 110% of the price difference if they find an item for less on a competitor's website.eBay also released an update to simplify selling on its Android and iOS native apps that allows items to be listed on eBay within seconds.In Australia, to compete with Amazon Prime, eBay launched eBay Plus, a membership shopping program that gives members in Australia free delivery and returns on 15 million products and guaranteed delivery. It also provides the ability to search and filter items by delivery speed.During the second quarter, eBay completed its acquisition of Giosis' Japan business, including the Qoo10.jp platform. The acquisition expands eBay's footprint in Japan, one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world.eBay had made an initial investment in Giosis Pte. Ltd. in 2010. Since then, Giosis has established dynamic marketplace businesses across Asia. eBay hopes to build on Giosis' progress in Japan, enhancing the domestic customer experience and providing about two million Japanese buyers using the Qoo10.jp platform with a well-curated selection of merchandise sourced both locally and from across the globe. It did not disclose the terms of the deal. Giosis' financials are not known, but it had raised $82.1 million in funding. As part of the transaction, eBay will relinquish its investment in Giosis' non-Japanese businesses.The Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Flipkart (FPKT) acquisition also made eBay change its India strategy. The sale of Flipkart will imply that eBay would receive $1.1 billion from Walmart for eBay's 5.4% stake in Flipkart. eBay plans to use those funds to relaunch eBay India. eBay plans to focus on cross-border trade by bringing imported inventory to India and allowing Indian merchants access to the global market.The disappointing outlook has affected its stock. Its stock has been tumbling since its results last week and hit a 52-week low of $32.86 last week. Its stock is currently trading at $33.99 with a market capitalization of $33.7 billion. It had hit a 52-week high of $46.99 earlier this year. The stock has gained only 1.27%, compared to the industry's growth of 44%."
4192000,20149,2018-07-30T14:14:34-04:00,"Mid-sized tech companies are being ignored as markets ride the backs of momentum trades in the FAANG group.Strong franchises like eBay are trading at modest relative valuations, and at a discount to the S&P 500.Upcoming catalyst for eBay is the transition away from PayPal as the merchant of record for electronic payments.","With so many investors focused on the highest growth rates within the tech sector, so much so that Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the five largest S&P 500 companies in market value terms, mid-sized tech stocks can easily get overlooked. If valuation is a key consideration, and that sticking point makes holding shares of Amazon (for instance) tough to swallow, there are plenty of alternatives whereby growth can be had for a more reasonable price. So-called GARP (growth at a reasonable price) investing these days seems to be taking the form of trying to devise new metrics to justify why the market's highest priced stocks are ""actually not that expensive"" but don't be fooled.For GARP investors who also want exposure to tech, it might be worth looking at eBay (EBAY). Sure, this is not a sexy name by any means, but the company has built a dominant market position in the marketplace, online classifieds, and ticketing sector (Stubhub). Sure, you won't find 20% growth rates within their businesses, but revenue grew 7% in 2017 and is slated to bump another 12% in 2018. Free cash flow per share is rising steadily as well:Source: Company SEC Filings (expressed in millions of USD except per share amounts)For a highly profitable, strong set of franchises, eBay's stock fetches a relatively modest price, especially after the shares have sunk by more than 10% since their last earnings report.EBAY data by YChartsAt about $33 per share, the company sports a $34 billion enterprise value with cash in the bank slightly exceeding total debt. With $3 billion of annual EBITDA, an 11x EV/EBITDA multiple looks attractive, presuming the company can continue to grow 5-10% per annum.The wildcard here, and one that investors appear to be getting for free, is the expiring PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) partnership that will allow eBay to use other payment processors beginning in mid-2020. While it is hard to know exactly how much eBay could see a bottom line boost by finding a cheaper back-end service provider, some estimates put the ultimate revenue opportunity at north of $2 billion. For a company that has booked $2.6 billion of revenue in each of the 2018's first two quarters, that is not a rounding error by any means.Getting out from PayPal's umbrella opens the door for eBay to offer its own payment service offerings, rather than siphoning those opportunities over to PayPal. To get one view of the possible monetary benefit to eBay, we can look to a presentation given by Dylan Adelman at the Sohn Conference in 2017. Adelman, a student at Wharton, beat out hundreds of students to win a contest presenting eBay as a long idea, with voting coming from the money management industry's brightest minds at the conference.Adelman's research concluded that the value of exiting the PayPal agreement could be worth $8.5 billion, or $8.50 per share, to eBay equity holders. The stock today does not appear to reflect any of that potential.Source: Adelman Presentation, Page 8One reason eBay trades in the low $30s may be that we are two years away from the beginning of the end of PayPal's dominance on eBay's platform. However, long-term contrarian investors might want to consider building a position in the stock now, at low prices, rather than wait until analysts begin to look ahead (likely some time in 2019) to the potential bump to forward earnings estimates in 2020 and beyond.Since investors often look one year ahead of time (it sure seems that ""forward"" earnings estimates are now quoted more often than ""trailing"" figures), they rarely can ignore short-term performance and take a multi-year outlook. It is entirely possible that eBay's stock does not get much cheaper than it is today between now and then, given that we are getting into the back half of 2018 and sentiment for the shares is fairly low.Assuming that approximately $8 per share of value can be created by the lapsing PayPal deal, the upside could be roughly 25% from here ($42 per share)."
4188716,57252,2018-07-20T11:53:29-04:00,Shares of eBay fell 10% because of a slight revenue guidance miss and a mediocre operating margin.The company's base business is performing well.eBay is sitting on considerable PayPal separation upside.Shares are undervalued and worth at least $45.,"Shares of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) dropped a whopping 10% after the company guided to FY18 revenue that was slightly below consensus estimates. However, the company's quarterly results appear to reinforce the value of the eBay marketplace, and I believe the guidance ""miss"" simply reflects analysts' impatience with regards to eBay's transition away from PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Overall, the market reaction looks misguided, and I believe shares are worth $45.Admittedly, eBay's marketplace volume may not be growing at quite the same rate as Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) marketplace, but gross merchandise value (""GMV"") grew 7% y/y to $23.6 billion with the US up 5% y/y and the international business up 7% y/y. This is mostly driven by strength in the core marketplace business, which continues to resonate with consumers.I think investors continue to underestimate a few realities of eBay. First, the secondhand/used goods business cannot be replicated on Amazon. People who invest capital for a living may not appreciate secondhand goods, but plenty of customers around the globe do. Secondly, brands enjoy using eBay as an off-priced online outlet. This allows for slightly better margin capture than blowing out product through TJX (TJX) or Ross (ROST), though it comes at the expense of turning inventory at a faster clip.In short, though it is not growing rapidly, the core eBay business is in great shape.Source: eBay IRThe one source of disappointment during the quarter was StubHub. GMV was up 5% y/y in spite of an easy comp. Take rate remained flat at 22.7% of transaction value. With competition from SeatGeek and other marketplaces, I am not confident in the sustainability of StubHub's take rate. However, the reliability and trust in the StubHub network, as well as its partnerships and network effect, should help maintain take rates above those that are achieved in other marketplaces.Overall, reported revenue jumped 9% y/y to $2.6 billion driven mostly by organic growth (6%) and the company's acquisition of Japanese assets. The number of items sold was flat y/y, but global active buyers increased 4% y/y to 175 million. I think customers responded well to eBay's increase in advertising, which jumped 170 basis points y/y to 30.6% of sales.In addition, eBay continues to invest heavily in its new product development, which increased 30 basis points y/y to 11.1% of sales. According to management, twelve new products represent roughly 3% of GMV, and I think the company's new program to guarantee delivery by a certain time. The economics of this work nicely for sellers, as it prioritizes items from sellers with superior shipping track records without requiring sellers to pay for priority listing. This is a great way to combat Amazon without investing in physical infrastructure.In aggregate, non-GAAP operating margin declined about 120 basis points y/y to 25.2%, which drove non-GAAP EPS up 17% y/y to $0.64 per share. Free cash flow for the quarter was not great due to the timing of cash tax payments, but overall, I continue to expect eBay's cash flow to hover around $2.0-2.3 billion while growing in the high-single digits annually. eBay's capex spending seems to have settled into the $650-700 million range, and it does not look like the company requires significant incremental capital spending beyond this level.From a capital allocation perspective, I love that eBay is aggressively repurchasing shares. YTD, the company has bought back about $2 billion worth of stock at an average cost of $40, bringing its post-PayPal spin buyback to $8.8 billion - good for a 23% reduction in the float. Management has $5.7 billion left on its buyback authorization. With $8.6 billion in cash and investments as well as a track record of buying back stock at attractive prices, I think management could repurchase more than the $1.5 billion implied by guidance.Management guided to $10.75-10.85 billion in sales, below the consensus estimate of $10.95 billion. This was cited by many, in tandem with operating margin compression, as the driver of the stock selloff. However, I think the analyst community simply got too excited by eBay's prior announcement that it would be moving some of its payment processing to Adyen (ADYEN) in the back half of 2018. eBay guided to potential revenue of $2 billion, but the transition will not even start until the second half of 2018. The long-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion is compelling, but it simply does not seem like it will impact the business materially in 2018. This will drive significant long-term value.The eBay pullback looks like a great buying opportunity. At $34, shares trade below 15x EPS and roughly 14-16x free cash flow, I think eBay trades at a very attractive valuation. The base business continues to grow and become more popular, and eBay is sitting on significant upside as it brings payment processing in-house. By my estimation, shares are worth at least $45, and I think the current risk/reward is very attractive."
4191878,104565,2018-07-30T08:56:17-04:00,eBay has lagged faster-growing e-commerce peers of late.The company has made significant investments in its platform to reinvigorate growth.eBay’s stock trades at a depressed valuation multiple and could re-rate significantly higher if its platform investments pay off.,"eBay (EBAY) is a storied internet company that pioneered e-commerce. The company has lost ground as an e-commerce leader but still benefits from the booming growth in the category. eBay is making significant investments in its platform to compete with the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and Etsy (ETSY). However, investors have punished eBay's stagnating revenue growth with a depressed valuation multiple. If the investments eBay is making pay off in the form of re-accelerated revenue growth, investors could re-rate the company resulting in a much higher stock price.eBay was a pioneer in e-commerce platform. Founded in 1995, the company capitalized on the dot-com bubble by going public in 1998. 20 years later, eBay is still one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world with total revenue of over $10 billion and $23.6 billion in gross merchandise volume (""GMV"") listed on its website.In recent years, eBay has seen its prominence decline and growth slow as competitors have taken share of the rapidly growing e-commerce market. Most notably, Amazon has become the leading e-commerce platform for both business-to-consumer (""B2C"") and third-party marketplace listings. However, smaller competitors such as Etsy and many private companies have carved out niches in every major category and customer type.As highlighted in the table below from eBay's investor presentation, gross merchandise volume has grown at a mid-single-digit rate which has lagged the double-digit growth in overall e-commerce.Source: EBAY Q2 2018 Investor PresentationIn response to declining market share, eBay has announced initiatives in structured data, machine learning, and its mobile platform in order to improve the customer experience and user engagement.eBay's structured data initiative involves standardizing listings pages, providing more organized catalogs of what is listed, and optimizing the relevance of each page to what shoppers are looking for. By standardizing each page and providing more useful data, shopper conversion rates will improve and the platform will be more competitive to other platforms that are already doing a great job. The structured data initiative is also aimed at improving eBay's search engine optimization (""SEO""), which would cause eBay pages to show up more prominently on search engines such as Google. The structured data initiative is a multi-year re-platforming effort that is in the second year of its implementation.The bottom line is that eBay is re-investing in its marketplace platform. The company is not sitting idle while Amazon and others continue to innovate and grow. The results of these investment initiatives are still to be determined.Outside of eBay's core e-commerce marketplace, the company has two other segments: StubHub and Classifieds.StubHub is the largest secondary ticket marketplace for live events in the US. StubHub allows users to buy and sell tickets for live events and eBay takes a cut of each transaction (similar business model to the marketplace). This business was acquired by eBay in 2007 and has grown significantly since. In the last 12 months, StubHub generated $1.0 billion in revenue and currently has $1.0 billion in listed GMV. However, after years of very strong financial performance, revenue growth has slowed. The company has attributed the slowdown to a soft events environment, but it is undeniable that the business is maturing as well.Source: EBAY Q2 2018 Investor PresentationeBay's Classifieds business is a collection of online brands including mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats, eBay Kleinanzeigen, and others which list ads for a fee (similar to Craigslist). Through these platforms, eBay lists classifieds in more than 1,500 cities around the world. The Classifieds segment has been a highlight for the company and has posted strong double-digit revenue growth figures in recent quarters. However, Classifieds and StubHub, despite both being highlights for the company, together account for less than 25% of total revenue and thus are not the commanding drivers for the company's results.eBay has grown its revenue at a healthy high-single-digit rate. Although the company's growth has lagged the overall e-commerce industry, it has managed to grow profitably and generate strong free cash flow.In recent years, the company's operating margin has declined as a result of increased investments in its platform. eBay has managed to keep its general and administrative expenses stable to down as a percentage of revenue. However, marketing expenses and product development expenses have risen as eBay has had to spend more money to keep up with its competition.Free cash flow (""FCF"") trends have been negative in the form of lower FCF margin and lower absolute FCF dollars. However, if eBay's massive investments in its platform result in long-term growth, the company should see FCF benefits for many years in the future. The lower FCF is primarily driven by lower operating profits as capex has remained stable.While operating earnings have been a sore spot for investors in recent years, capital allocation has been a highlight. The company has repurchased over $14 billion in stock over the past five years alone. To put this into perspective, eBay's market cap today is $33 billion. These share repurchases were made at attractive valuations and have not resulted in taking out a lot of debt at high interest rates. eBay had net debt of $600 million at the end of the last quarter. On average eBay pays an interest rate of less than 4% on its outstanding debt. This capital allocation has significantly advantaged shareholders.eBay's stock trades at an EV / Forward EBIT multiple of 12.8x. This is a very attractive multiple in the current market and simply isn't comparable to other e-commerce companies which trade at nosebleed multiples relative to their profitability. Because most e-commerce companies are unprofitable or barely profitable, it makes more sense to compare their revenue multiples. eBay trades for 3.5x its current EV / forward revenue compared to 7.4x the median e-commerce peer. However, on average, eBay's peers are growing their top lines at much faster double-digit rates.eBay's revenue growth is roughly in line with the average S&P 500 company although eBay is much more profitable. Despite this, eBay even trades at a 13% discount to the S&P 500 on an EV / forward EBIT basis. This seems overly pessimistic. In my opinion, eBay should trade at least in line with the S&P 500 if not at a premium to it. The company could see its stock price rise by over 13% if investors were to re-rate it with a multiple in line with the index. Investors will further benefit as the company continues to repurchase more shares.A more bullish scenario would be if eBay's re-platforming initiatives were to result in a re-acceleration of revenue growth and investors decided to value eBay more like an e-commerce company. If that were to happen, shareholders could see significant upside.eBay's investments do not result in a more competitive platform. eBay has made a massive bet on re-platforming which has resulted in significantly lowered operating margins and free cash flow. If these investments do not result in an acceleration in sales growth, the return on investment will be fairly low and investors may not re-rate it with a higher valuation multiple.E-commerce industry growth slows. eBay has been able to post growing revenues because the overall e-commerce industry has been growing at double-digit rates. If e-commerce growth stagnates to single-digit territory, eBay may see anemic low-single-digit revenue growth rates or even revenue declines.Cybersecurity breach. Cybersecurity issues are a major risk for online platforms. A breach could result in a tarnished reputation, lawsuits, and damage to the online platform."
4180619,67775,2018-06-10T20:22:30-04:00,Businesses that benefit from a “network effect” can differentiate themselves from peer companies and enjoy strong customer loyalty.Value investor Warren Buffett has frequently and recently targeted these types of businesses.eBay’s leading Marketplace unit appears to benefit from such a network effect; management’s latest improvement initiatives look to enhance the dynamic.,"Photo Credit: Forbes.comThe big news from Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B) (NYSE:BRK.A) last week was Warren Buffett’s targeting of leading ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER). While the $3B proposed deal ultimately didn’t materialize, the interest from Berkshire is in line with one of Buffett’s preferred investment strategies.Buffett provided insight into this strategy in his 1989 annual letter to Berkshire shareholders:Uber’s string of problems over the past year is no secret, satisfying Buffett’s “huge problem” criteria. And Buffett has long admired new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, implying his confidence in solving Uber’s problems. But what evidence is there of Uber being a “marvelous business?”Buffett likes to invest in companies with wide moats or strong competitive advantages; one type of a moat comes in the form of a network effect. A network effect develops when a company’s products and services become more valuable to its customers, the more customers it attracts. Like American Express and GEICO that Buffett mentioned, Uber’s customers benefit when more drivers and ride-hailers use the service (for example, more riders attract additional drivers, which cuts down on wait times).A network effect is powerful and when value investors can identify one within a stock trading at an attractive price, it can present a great investment opportunity. eBay’s (NASDAQ: EBAY) commerce business appears to benefit from such a network effect (more on that below) and its current stock price implies nearly 25% upside. As such, let’s take a closer look at eBay’s competitive position and how management is navigating a challenging retail environment.eBay is a global commerce leader through its Marketplace, StubHub, and Classifieds platforms. Marketplace includes the www.ebay.com and mobile platforms; StubHub is eBay’s online ticket platform www.stubhub.com and Classifieds offers online classifieds through mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, and other brands.Revenues are generated both as fees on transactions (fees payable on Marketplace and StubHub platforms) as well as marketing services (advertising and marketing fees):Source: eBay 2017 Annual ReportInternational revenue contributed 57% of total net revenue in 2017 with the U.S. market providing the balance. eBay’s $88 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV) represented roughly 4% of the world e-commerce market.Latest Quarter ResultsIn eBay’s 2018 first quarter, its top line increased 7% (currency-neutral basis) YoY to $2.6B with total GMV up by the same percentage. Trailing 12-month active buyer growth was up 4% YoY to 171 million (25M+ active buyers); the deceleration of 1% compared to the previous quarter was attributed to Korea and eBay.com short-term headwinds. Cost of revenue declined 60 bps with customer service and Korea inventory investments offsetting savings and site operations.GAAP EPS came in at $0.40 versus $0.94 the prior year, which was supported by a non-cash income-tax benefit of $695M. End-of-quarter cash and short-term investments stood at $4.8 billion with debt of $9.3 billion.eBay’s “Network Effect”With such a large base of active buyers and sellers, eBay appears to benefit from a network effect. Smaller firms looking to enter the space have much to overcome in selling their value propositions. eBay’s take rates (7.69% and 22.35% for Marketplace and StubHub, respectively) also compare favorably to an estimated 15% for Amazon.com, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN). eBay’s partnership with payments company Adyen should also lower costs, thereby improving the seller experience and supporting eBay’s network effect. In all, it appears eBay maintains a moderately-sized moat, or competitive advantage, against peers.Management Initiatives and Sources of GrowthManagement is working on its “back-to-basics” strategy, in part to compete against Amazon’s own third-party platform enhancements. The strategy includes streamlined listing processes, data-driven merchandising, and AI investments. As far as growth, StubHub poses a source of long-term growth and an agreement to acquire Giosis’ Japan business provides exposure to a leading e-commerce, high mobile adoption market.Wall Street analysts expect mid-teen, top-line growth and EBITDA margin expansion from 30.7% to 33.7% in 2018:Source: eBay 5-Year DCF Model, finbox.ioSource: eBay, finbox.io Revenue ExplorerThereafter, revenue is expected to experience high-single-digit growth with relatively steady EBITDA margin. Using these assumptions across nine of finbox.io’s valuation models produces an average fair value estimate of $45.97 per share, or 15% upside to recent trading levels. Wall Street’s 1-year target price is even higher at $48.47, providing nearly 25% upside:Source: finbox.ioA competitive e-commerce environment including large players such as Amazon (and its third-party offerings) looms. The effectiveness of management’s “back-to-basics” plan is significant. Adverse economic conditions and a weakening consumer along with foreign currency and data security also pose risks.Buffett’s targeting of companies with “marvelous businesses” often feature businesses that benefit from a strong network effect. eBay’s Marketplace unit offers such a dynamic and management’s efforts to improve its service offerings look to support this source of what appears to be a moderately-sized moat.Management needs to continue to drive organic traffic, but eBay’s current stock price offers downside protection with nearly 25% upside. Buffett-style value investors should take a closer look at eBay ahead of its earnings announcement next month."

Adjusted EPS grew 9% over the year to $0.53 and was in line with the market's forecast for the quarter.During the quarter, the Marketplace platform brought in $2.1 billion in revenues. eBay recorded a 13% growth in the gross merchandise volume (GMV) to $22.5 billion driven by the continued focus on new user experiences. StubHub contributed revenues of $232 million and GMV of $1 billion. The increase for the segment was driven by a record Super Bowl and strong international growth. Finally, revenues from Classifieds platforms grew 24% over the year to $246 million.Among operating metrics, global active buyers and customers increased 4% to 171 million. The market was looking for active buyers and consumers to grow to 173 million for the quarter.For the current quarter, eBay forecast revenues of $2.64-$2.68 billion with an EPS of $0.50-$0.52. The market was looking for revenues of $2.68 billion for the quarter with an EPS of $0.52. eBay expects full-year revenues of $10.9-$11.1 billion with earnings of $2.25 to $2.30 per share. The Street was looking for revenues of $11.02 billion for the year with an EPS of $2.29.eBay continued to invest in the improvement of the user experience. It recently launched a new Interests feature which is expected to help simplify the search process for shoppers significantly. It will gather details on the customer's interests, hobbies, and style and then use algorithms to offer merchandise that best meets those insights. The feature is currently available on the eBay mobile app in the US for both iOS and Android devices. It plans on bringing the service to the rest of the world during the coming months.Last year, eBay had launched its Authenticate service that offers an authentication service for luxury products. eBay's reports reveal that conversion to a sale on authenticated inventory is twice that of similar non-authenticated inventory. Driven by the results, it recently expanded this service to several European markets and into the luxury watch category.eBay also is trying to improve its international presence. Earlier this year, it announced the acquisition of Giosis Japan, a leading e-commerce platform in the country. eBay was already an investor in Giosis prior to the acquisition. Giosis operates several localized marketplaces in Asia, including Giosis' Japan business. As part of the transaction, eBay will relinquish its investment in Giosis' non-Japanese businesses. It did not disclose the terms of the deal. Giosis' financials are not known, but it had raised $82.1 million in funding.The recent Walmart and Flipkart acquisition also made eBay change its India strategy. The sale of Flipkart will imply that eBay would receive an approximate $1.1 billion from Walmart for eBay's 5.4% stake in Flipkart. eBay plans to use those funds to relaunch eBay India. As part of the process, eBay will focus on cross-border trade by bringing imported inventory to India and allowing Indian merchants access to the world's market.Its stock is trading at $39.07 with a market capitalization of $38.8 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $46.99 earlier this year. It has recovered from the 52-week low of $33.89 in June last year."

FY revenue reduced.Competitive questions linger.,"eBAY (EBAY) reported weak Q2 2018 earnings on 7/18, after the close, and the stock declined over 10% on Thursday. This article analyzes quarterly financial metrics in a historical context, and discusses key questions raised in the quarter. As always, I encourage investors to view stocks as ownership of businesses and take a fundamental, long-term view of their ownership.(Unless otherwise noted all historical data are from the company, and all consensus numbers are from FactSet.)Revenue for Q2 2018 came out to $2.6B, missing consensus estimates by -0.8%. This represents a y/y increase of 13.4%, vs. 4.4% y/y in Q2 2017. This is the second consecutive top-line disappointment for the company, which followed four quarters of increasing beats - so quite a reversal.Importantly, EBAY reduced its FY revenue guidance to $10.75-10.85B, down from the prior range of $10.9-11.1B. The top end is also below consensus of $10.95B.Operating Income for Q2 2018 came out to $665M, missing consensus estimates by -3.3%. This is the third consecutive quarterly miss for the company, each time by a greater amount. This represents a y/y growth of 4.7%, vs. -2.2% y/y in Q2 2017. Margins contracted by -209 bps y/y, although revenue grew 13% over the same time period. Investors do not like negative operating leverage, to say the least.Non-GAAP EPS for Q2 2018 came out to $0.53, beating consensus estimates by 3.5%. This represents a y/y increase of 17.8%, vs. 4.7% y/y in Q2 2017. Investors who do not follow EBAY closely may be scratching their heads on how EBAY could drop over 10% on an ""earnings beat,"" but that's not the most important metric. I believe adjusted EPS is the least important metric as it is frequently engineered to ""make the numbers."" (Generally speaking, not trying to pick on EBAY.)CFFO for Q2 2018 was $372M vs. $699M a year ago, implying a 46.8% y/y decline. Given the slight uptick in capex in the quarter, FCF for Q2 2018 was $188M vs. $517M a year ago, implying a 63.6% y/y decline. I believe EBAY's struggles with profitability can really be seen in the cash flow metrics, which has gone down over the past 3 years.After a strong Q4 2017, EBAY's momentum seems to be hitting a wall. Revenue for Q2 grew ~ 6% FX neutral, despite a 50-60 bps contribution from the acquisition of Giosis. Furthermore, management cut its FY revenue guidance.StubHub decelerated significantly in Q2, growing only 5% FX neutral, which was blamed on a weak events environment in concerts, theater and Major League Baseball. In the Q2 earnings call, management commented that it expects this weakness to continue into the second half.Besides StubHub, judging from the call, it appears that EBAY was having various execution issues, including a slower roll-out of new initiatives. The promotional environment also appears intense, which drove sales and marketing expenses up 170 bps.There appears to be multiple factors contributing to this slowdown, which raises the question if this management team is up to the task of taking on e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN), emerging e-commerce giant Walmart (WMT), and specialized e-commerce competitors like Etsy (ETSY) and Wayfair (W).At just above 10x 2019 consensus EBITDA, EBAY's valuation is not demanding. However, the declining margins, cash flow and loss of momentum are certainly metrics to monitor for investors."
4188922,103480,2018-07-21T15:18:46-04:00,"eBay's second-quarter earnings report fell heavily short of analyst expectations, with revenue growth dimming to 9% y/y (from 12% y/y last quarter).The company's below-consensus guidance caused the stock to take its biggest hit.GMV growth in the U.S. also showed its weakest growth rate since a year ago, while the volume of sold items stayed flat.Margins also showed a worrying contraction.","Despite all the signals that keep pointing to its demise, eBay (EBAY), the one-time e-commerce wunderkind, continues to plod forward as if it was still a giant of the internet. Like last quarter's earnings release, eBay's Q2 post showed a company that is continually unable to meet analysts' targets as the company fails to accelerate the process of bringing new buyers to its platform.Rightly so, eBay has been one of the worst-performing of the large-cap internet stocks all year, despite general enthusiasm for the e-commerce space. Companies like Etsy (ETSY) and Stitch Fix (SFIX) that were earlier pegged as losers, for example, have shot up meaningfully in the first half of 2018, as has perpetual giant Amazon.com (AMZN). eBay, however, seems incapable of reversing its slow decline. Year to date, the stock is down nearly 10%:EBAY data by YChartsYet, I believe the shares have further to fall. Activity on eBay seems to simply be running cold. Call it the hangover effects of eBay's fee hikes in the past several years - as sellers walked out on eBay in protestation of higher seller fees and took their variety of wares with them, buyers also saw less and less reason to buy on eBay. One of the things shoppers like most about Amazon is that it's the ""everything store,"" where you can type in even the most obscure of items and find at least one seller that carries it. On eBay, with both the selection and volume of items getting thinner, it's getting harder and harder to bring buyers to the platform and, more importantly, reverse the steep deceleration in GMV growth.I've always found the following chart in eBay's earnings presentations entertaining - largely due to the fact that eBay manipulates the scaling of the chart in an attempt to show massive user growth. In reality, buyer growth has been stagnant and essentially flat over the past two years. Since the start of 2017 (six quarters back) to 2Q18, eBay has grown active buyers by a measly 6%:Figure 1. eBay active buyersSource: eBay investor relationsThis quarter, active buyers grew just 4% y/y - but if we strip out the 3 million buyers associated with the Giosis acquisition, that metric becomes about one point worse.In my view, eBay will likely stick around for quite a while longer, but it will continue to stagnate and disappoint both its customers as well as its investors. I've long been an eBay bear, and its most recent Q2 numbers validate the thesis that eBay has a very limited future.Here's a look at eBay's Q2 results:Figure 2. eBay Q2 resultsSource: eBay investor relationsRevenues grew 9% y/y to $2.64 billion, falling one point short of analyst expectations of $2.66 billion (+10% y/y) and worse yet, also decelerating three points from last quarter's growth rate of 12% y/y. Note also that eBay's revenue was still helped by positive FX movements; on a constant-currency basis, eBay's revenue growth would have been just 6% y/y (versus 7% y/y last quarter).Whenever an internet company's growth stalls to sub-10%, it's always a red flag. In eBay's case, the problem is closely linked to its stagnation in GMV:Figure 3. eBay GMV trendsSource: eBay investor relationseBay's international business seems to be holding up just fine with the same 6-7% y/y growth it has seen for quite some time, but U.S. GMV at 5% y/y growth saw its worst performance since 2Q17. Note also that StubHub, which has long been one of eBay's growth drivers, saw anemic 5% y/y GMV growth in the quarter. Devin Wenig, eBay's CEO, further commented that the company is struggling through a ""weaker StubHub event landscape, which will put pressure on our revenue for the second half."" You'll note also as well that the count of sold items were exactly flat in the quarter, the first such quarter since 2017.It's not surprising, then, that eBay's forecast heavily missed analyst consensus for the remainder of the year. The company is guiding to $10.75-$10.85 billion in revenue versus expectations for $10.95 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, this range implies just 6-7% y/y growth.Making the situation worse in a time of revenue deceleration is the fact that eBay has been unable to drive down costs and produce margin growth. Operating income of $406 million represents an operating margin of 15.4%, and is down -15% y/y versus 2Q17's operating income of $480 million. That's also a 540 bps contraction in operating margin from 2Q17's 19.8%.All of eBay's operating expense components - from sales and marketing to product development - saw a significant y/y increase. eBay's CFO called out ""increased investments in payments, marketing, and Japan"" as major drivers for the cost increase in the company's earnings call. But despite the ongoing ""investments"" that eBay has made over the past several quarters, we are still yet to see meaningful signs of improvement in GMV growth. The company further noted that due to the Japan acquisition, the company's pro forma operating margin performance would be at the low end of a previously stated range of 27 to 30%.All of eBay's bottom line EPS improvements were driven by tax changes, not by true operating improvements. Last year's quarter had a one-time tax charge, and this year includes the benefits of a lower-rate corporate tax code. As such, the company's pro forma EPS of $0.53 beat analyst consensus of $0.51 by a hair.Though eBay may have the look and feel of a cheap internet stock - it's one of the only companies in the space that hasn't advanced double digits in the year to date - the company is a true value trap. When a company of eBay's scale stops growing as quickly, it's typically expected to take a laser focus on costs and begin improving operating margins. In eBay's case, however, it seems that the company is throwing good money after bad in an attempt to resurrect its growth - and as a result, margins are declining while revenue growth fails to keep up.In my view, eBay's challenges aren't going to let up anytime soon. Continue staying cautious on this name."
4167250,103480,2018-04-28T18:51:53-04:00,"eBay reported Q1 results that missed analyst expectations on both the top line and bottom line.Active buyers on the platform grew just 4% in the quarter, and GMV rose just 7% on a constant-currency basis.While eBay may appeal to a niche groups of users, it's completely dominated by Amazon in the U.S. and by Alibaba in China, the two most important markets.Without any sweeping changes to its product that can bring in a bevy of new users, eBay may soon face declining y/y comps.","Make no mistake: eBay (EBAY) is heading for near-certain wipeout in the not-too-distant future. The company's latest Q1 results reveal a platform that's struggling to be relevant to users and poor forward-looking guidance that indicates management's uncertainty about the future. eBay shares have lost about 5% since posting disappointing Q1 results, but the company still sports a hefty $40 billion market cap. Anyone who can remember the fallout of Yahoo only a few years ago will recognize how hard Internet giants can stumble when they fall out of favor.Here's a chart from eBay's Q1 earnings deck that shows the ""growth"" in its trailing 12-month active buyers:Source: eBay investor relationsWhile eBay has undoubtedly played with the scaling of the above chart to make the growth seem more impressive, in reality, the company has been churning out low single-digit growth in its base of active buyers. In addition, the company is calling out headwinds in its core eBay Marketplace as well as Korea.Amazon (AMZN), as we know, just raised the price of a Prime subscription to $119. Most Wall Street analysts are praising the move and saying consumers will pay the fee anyway. It costs nothing to use eBay as a buyer, yet eBay's active buyer pool absolutely pales in comparison to Amazon. There is no better indication that eBay's platform no longer jives with the modern consumer. Quasi-auction style or even clunky ""Buy it Now"" items are no longer the most convenient or most popular way to buy items on the Internet, outside of a few select niches.Among technology stocks, eBay looks like one of the cheapest names at just 17x forward P/E and under 4x forward revenue - but for a company that's posting low single-digit growth, contracting profit margins, and has little hope of being relevant in five years, eBay is more of a value trap.EBAY data by YChartsContinue to stay away from eBay - there are far better Internet and e-commerce stocks to invest in, such as Stitch Fix (SFIX), which also has undergone a recent correction.Here's a look at eBay's first quarter results:Figure 1. eBay Q1 resultsSource: eBay investor relationsRevenues grew 12% y/y on an as-reported basis to $2.58 billion, missing analyst consensus of $2.57 billion by $10 million. Note, however, that eBay's revenue growth was helped by foreign currency fluctuations. On a constant-currency basis, revenues grew just 7%, equal the constant-currency growth that eBay saw last quarter.Underpinning this sluggish growth, of course, is tepid performance in GMV (gross merchandise value), the measure of all goods bought and sold on the eBay platform and the No. 1 driver of its business, as eBay's transactional model generally takes a percentage slice from each transaction (for both the listing itself and the payment processing functions).The chart below, taken from eBay's earnings deck, showcases its GMV over time:Figure 2. eBay GMV growthSource: eBay investor relationsTotal GMV in the quarter was $23.6 billion, up 7% y/y. This isn't altogether bad, seeing as eBay suffered from low-single digit growth for most of last year. However, 7% growth is hardly anything to get too excited about. International GMV growth, one of eBay's largest growth drivers, also looks like it's hitting a small speed bump. eBay did announce an acquisition of Giosis' Japan business (Giosis is a Korean e-commerce company and a major player in Asian markets) that will help accelerate GMV growth in Japan, but until eBay can materialize promises into results, it's hard to see the company breaking from a trend of tepid GMV.StubHub, also another eBay acquisition and up until recently a major contributor to GMV growth, contributed just $1 billion of GMV in the quarter (13% constant currency growth). eBay still relies heavily on its core Marketplace business to drive results, but looking at the low user growth and just 1% growth in sold items, it doesn't seem the product is capable of appealing to today's buyers.eBay's widespread reputation for charging high seller fees also has alienated a large part of the supply side of eBay's marketplace. In today's environment, where the choices of venue for opening up an online store are all equally user-friendly (such as Amazon, or a Shopify (SHOP) store that sells primarily on Facebook (FB)), eBay also is losing sellers alongside a flat-growth buyer pool.eBay's issues on the top line have cascaded down into pressure for the bottom line. eBay has increased its promotional spending to drive more buyers to the platform (with mixed results, it seems), as well as put more headcount into its product development staff. eBay is attempting to leverage AI technologies to improve the marketplace search functions on the site, but it's unclear whether this alone can bring back a swath of users. Total operating expenses rose to 51.1% of revenues, up 150bps y/y.Pro forma operating margin in the quarter was 27.9%, down 100bps from 28.9% in 1Q17. Pro forma EPS of $0.53 barely eked out 9% growth over last year's $0.49, but that's largely a function of eBay's expanded stock buyback program over the past year. EPS was in-line with what Wall Street was expecting.Also important to note: Though eBay blamed it primarily on the timing of tax payments, free cash flow also declined 25% y/y to just $337 million in the quarter, an FCF margin of 13% (versus 19% in 1Q17).Where Wall Street really ripped into the company, however, was in its guidance ranges:Figure 3. eBay guidanceSource: eBay investor relationsFor the second quarter, analysts were expecting $2.68 billion in revenues (the high end of eBay's $2.64-$2.68 billion range) and $0.53 in EPS, above eBay's range of $0.50 to $0.52.For the full year, analysts had penciled in $10.98 billion in revenues (essentially in-line with eBay's range, though the company does have a spotty track record for performing against its own targets) and $2.29 in EPS, the high end of eBay's range of $2.25-$2.30.With the way GMV currently is trending, it seems eBay may have an even more difficult path forward. Acquisitions and buybacks can only help the optics for so long - the company does heavy $10.7 billion of cash on its balance sheet, but that's balanced by an almost equal ($9.2 billion) load of debt. Investments in product development are a good attempt at driving organic growth, but it's doubtful that eBay can return to double-digit user and GMV growth.It's now been more than 20 years since eBay opened its virtual doors, and the world has largely moved on. eBay's Q1 results reveal a company that's struggling to remain relevant and is having only modest success at growing its user base and GMV.It's difficult to envision this company still being healthy in five years. eBay already has tried many different measures to revitalize itself, all to mixed results. I'd place my bets elsewhere."
4162465,102764,2018-04-11T14:43:07-04:00,"Amazon is delivering outstanding revenue growth, and the company is well-positioned for sustained performance going forward. However, profitability is scarce and valuation quite hard to grasp.eBay makes healthy profit margins, revenue is accelerating, and the stock looks undervalued. But eBay comes way behind Amazon in terms of growth prospects.Which one is a better purchase for investors going forward?","Amazon (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY) are long-time rivals in e-commerce, and they both offer some interesting traits for investors. Amazon is a disruptive force in the retail industry, and the company is positioned for continued growth in the years ahead. eBay comes way behind Amazon in terms of growth, but the business is far more profitable and the stock looks undervalued at current levels.Amazon has a relentless competitive drive, and management is deeply focused on long-term growth, even if it comes at the expense of current profit margins. Amazon sells its products at competitively low prices to gain market share in a wide range of retail categories, and it's also investing huge sums of money in areas such as building its distribution network and digital content.Back in 1995, Amazon was making only $511,000 in revenue per year. Fast forward to 2018 and the company is estimated to generate $233.48 billion in revenue and growing at full speed. In the process, Amazon has consolidated its leadership position in online retail and cloud computing infrastructure, and the company is now also a big player in hardware and digital content.Depending on which area of the income statement you focus on, this strategy can be described as a massive success or a complete failure: Sales are growing at an extraordinary speed considering the company's size, but profit margins are low and volatile.Amazon delivered $177.9 billion in revenue for 2017, growing 31% versus 2016. It takes a unique business to generate that level of growth from such a gargantuan revenue base.On the other hand, the company made only $4.1 billion in operating income during the period, representing only 2.3% of revenue and falling 2% in comparison to $4.2 billion in operating income for 2016.AMZN Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThe Amazon Prime program creates customer loyalty. According to data from Feedvisor, 85% of Prime members visit Amazon at least once a week and over 45% of Prime members purchase from Amazon once a week or more often. Amazon also offers brand differentiation, operational efficiency, and a strong focus on customer service.These unparalleled competitive strengths have allowed Amazon to gain market share across a wide variety of retail categories over the past several years, and there is no reason to believe that this dynamic is going to change any time soon.US E-Commerce Sales as Percent of Retail Sales data by YChartsOnline retail is rapidly gaining share versus traditional retail, but online still represents a relatively small 9.1% of the overall retail industry in the U.S. Amazon is positioned to be both the main driver and the leading beneficiary from growing online retail sales in the years ahead.The Whole Foods acquisition is opening intriguing possibilities for Amazon in groceries and related categories. In addition, the company is the top player in cloud computing infrastructure, while also expanding into digital content and hardware. When looking at Amazon's multiple growth engines, it's easy to see that the company offers attractive growth prospects for investors.On the other hand, the company reinvests most of its cash flows for growth, so both earnings and free cash flows are low and volatile. The value of the company ultimately depends on these key variables, so it's remarkably hard to tell if Amazon stock is reasonably priced or overvalued. It's practically impossible to justify Amazon's valuation based on current earnings or cash flows, and this keeps many investors away from Amazon stock.As opposed to being an online retailer like Amazon, eBay is mostly an e-commerce facilitator, meaning that the company is in the business of matching buyers and sellers and making a commission on every transaction. This business model has low capital requirements, and eBay doesn't need to worry about factors such as inventory risk, cost of merchandise sold, or distribution costs.Because of this, eBay generates impressive profitability levels. Operating profit margin amounted to 25.4% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017, while non-GAAP operating margin came in at 30.9% of revenue.eBay has launched a series of initiatives to accelerate growth over the past several years. The company is prioritizing unique product selection and inventory discoverability, launching improved seller tools and investing in technologies such as data-driven merchandising and artificial intelligence to optimize search engine listings and improve the overall customer experience. In addition to that, eBay is expanding into adjacent platforms such as StubHub and eBay Classifieds in order to build additional growth venues.These moves are generating some results, and revenue growth is accelerating. The company produced $2.6 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter of 2017, a year over year increase of 9% and growing 7% on a foreign exchange neutral basis. Gross merchandise volume amounted to $24.4 billion during the period, up by 10% in U.S. dollars and growing 7% on an FX-neutral basis.Image source: eBayThe fourth quarter of 2017 was a record quarter for eBay, representing the fifth quarter in a row of volume acceleration in the company's US marketplace. eBay can't even begin to compete against Amazon when it comes to revenue growth or size, but it's relevant to note that eBay is making some progress in this area.Importantly, eBay stock is priced at fairly convenient levels, and it's not much of a stretch to say that the stock is undervalued. Wall Street analysts are on average expecting $2.29 and $2.61 in earnings per share for eBay in 2018 and 2019 respectively. This puts the stock at a temptingly low price to earnings ratio of 17.8 for the current year and 15.6 for next year.Even if Amazon and eBay are direct competitors in e-commerce, the two companies could hardly be any more different in terms of what they have to offer to investors. Key return drivers such as growth levels, competitive strengths, profitability, and valuation are notoriously dissimilar.eBay is no match to Amazon in terms of growth and innovation, but it has a far more profitable business model. Importantly, current valuation levels should buffer the downside risk in a position in eBay unless there is a serious deterioration in the fundamentals. This means that eBay is clearly the right choice for value-oriented investors looking for a business with predictable performance, an attractive entry price, and limited downside risk.Amazon, on the other hand, is a unique growth story with remarkably solid competitive strengths and a visionary management team. As long as the company continues leading the market in industries such as online retail, cloud computing, and digital media, the stock offers substantial room capital appreciation in the long term. However, profitability is quite volatile and hard to predict, and valuation is a major risk factor for investors in Amazon.Amazon is hence the right choice for growth-seeking investors willing to accept much higher uncertainty and a bigger downside risk in exchange for superior upside potential over the long term."
4114665,103480,2017-10-19T11:41:52-04:00,"eBay reported an in-line Q3, with EPS matching consensus estimates and revenue a hair better.Its Q4 forecast, however, fell far short of analysts' profit expectations.Shares of eBay tumbled nearly 6% in after-hours trading, ending a year-long rally that had taken the stock up as much as 30%.The future of eBay's core business remains uncertain, as the e-commerce model has largely shifted away from auction-style purchases. StubHub, an eBay subsidiary, also continues to struggle in the U.S.","In a largely expected turn of events, eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) reported a mixed quarter that disappointed Wall Street and knocked shares off its yearlong rally. This should come as no surprise to anyone: eBay has failed to impress investors (as well as its customers) for the past few years. This is a company whose zenith has passed; now begins its slow decline.EBAY data by YChartsThe chart above shows eBay's meteoric performance in YTD17 prior to its Q3 stumble. As I wrote in my previous article, eBay's phantom rally seems to bear no fundamental support - it's a mystery why investors have bid up shares of a platform that is failing to meaningfully grow its customer base and show it has a defensible moat against Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). After all, nearly everything on eBay is a ""Buy It Now"" auction, no different than the instant purchases available on Amazon. Making it worse, eBay sellers gripe about the astronomical fees, limiting eBay's appeal to the critical constituents who supply it with the variety of goods it needs to succeed.While a 6% drop in a name-brand stock typically makes it appealing for value investors, eBay is a name to stay away from. This is a company that belongs to the category of Yahoo, AOL, and Pets.com - hot concepts at first, but not resilient to changing times.eBay's Q3 print actually wasn't all that gory, despite the drastic aftermarket trading. Revenue clocked in at $2.4 billion (+9% y/y), slightly ahead of consensus expectations of $2.3 billion. Pro forma EPS of $0.48 (vs. last year's $0.45) was right in line with Wall Street's expectations for $0.48.Both of these results came in at the high end of the company's prior guidance - in its Q2 earnings release, eBay guided to Q3 revenue and pro forma EPS of $2.35-$2.39 billion and $0.46-$0.48.See the company's summary results - taken from its press release - in the chart below:Figure 1. eBay Q3 resultsGMV (gross merchandise volume, or the measure of all sales on the platform in a quarter) is arguably the more important to keep a close eye on, as it's the true indicator of eBay's success with customers. GMV for Q3 tracked as follows:Margins, however, continued to decline in Q3. Q3 operating margin dropped 40bps to 24.0%, down from 24.4% in 3Q16. This is becoming a trend for eBay: in Q2, it suffered a 330bps decrease in operating margin.Given the soft Q4 profit guidance coupled with in-line revenue estimates, it looks like eBay's shrinking margin trend isn't going to abate anytime soon.It's really in its Q4 guidance that eBay really missed the ball. Management guided as follows:At first glance, it doesn't look like too horrible of a miss. Upside on revenue, downside on profits, with no major deviance from Wall Street consensus on either. Why the cool reaction?Most likely, investors' displeasure with eBay's guidance owes to the fact that Q4 includes the all-important holiday season, and is the company's biggest quarter by far. Despite what Wall Street had posted for expectations, investors wanted more. In addition, the profit shortfall combined with in-line revenues points to further margin compression, which isn't a trend that investors are too happy with seeing quarter over quarter.For most technology and internet companies in the earlier or middling stages of their lives, margins are almost an afterthought for investors, as are profits. But in the mature stages - after all, eBay isn't growing double-digits anymore - it's profits that really count.eBay is no longer an exciting company anymore, either to investors or to the buyers and sellers who (for inexplicable reasons) continue to use its platform (the company reported 168 million active buyers on its platform in Q3, by the way; and it lost a couple million after its sale of eBay India to Flipkart, according to its press release).eBay is on a clear path to shrinkage. Though investors have rejoiced in the company's (very small) return to growth in FY17, a few quarters of growth (which followed a few quarters of decline, basically barely enough to recover the shortfall) is not enough to merit a 27% stock rally. Investors, upon seeing that eBay's critical Q4 wouldn't bring the upside they were hoping for, immediately cashed in on their profits and cut eBay loose.EBAY EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartseBay's revenue and earnings valuation multiples, shown above, suggest that the company is still being treated like a growth company, with valuations above peer benchmarks despite its slow, single-digit growth in profits and revenue. The company's growth is very much at-risk, too, and a large miss in the critical holiday season (a likely event, given the unpredictability of consumer spending habits) could spell doom for the stock.This risk is not worth the slight premium that eBay trades at. At this price, there are far better internet companies to invest in, those that might actually live to see 2020."
4156652,104232,2018-03-15T09:55:37-04:00,eBay has hundreds of thousands of buying guides to convert prospects into buyers.eBay has already removed the guides from Google.On April 12th the guides will be physically removed from the website.The guides have been seen an estimated billion times in its history and likely generate millions in revenue.,"For eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), revenue comes primarily from its websites. Traffic to its websites is generated by one of four methods:Free TrafficPaid TrafficFree traffic is obviously valuable. Management stated in the 2017 Annual Report that changes in search traffic obtained from Google can have a material impact on company finances:Free search traffic is so critical to eBay that one of the company’s largest initiatives has been to better compete for online sales by incorporating more static product pages instead of auction pages that disappear after a sale. This has made eBay become more like Amazon.In that context, a recent decision to delete buying guides seems inexplicable. Instead of Google actively sending less traffic to eBay, the company is voluntarily telling Google to do so.Before reviewing in more detail the financial ramifications of the decision, here is the email the company recently sent regarding buying guides:The static product pages where items are directly purchased have been supplemented on the eBay website by “Guides”. Purchases are not made on these pages. Instead, the Guides help direct readers to product pages to make a purchase. Before removal, there were close to 500,000 of these guides.In addition to helping guide purchases, these web pages were indexed by the search engines and available to drive customers to eBay.For those not familiar with eBay Guides, eBay members could create web pages helping others to making purchase decisions.For example, Top 10 Donald Duck Toys for Children could be a guide discussing different products, explaining their pros and cons, showing pictures, and providing links to where the suggested products could be purchased on eBay.An actual guide: The Star Wars Action Figures Buying Guide has five printed pages of product recommendations and has been viewed more than 35,000 times.Guide writers received no compensation and Guides could not externally link to web pages outside of eBay. They purely benefit eBay.Some Guides are over a decade old. How many Guides exist?When I first looked I saw about 500,000 in the search engines.This subsequent search in Bing on the eBay url where Guides are located shows over 400,000 Guide pages:A search in Google shows about 40,000 pages:Why the discrepancy? Simply – the pages are disappearing fast and will soon be down to zero because eBay has directed, within the source code of the web pages, that search engines should no longer index the pages. Here is a sample page telling “robots” (aka Google and Bing search engine spiders) that they should no longer index a Guide and remove it from their Internet database:The bottom line is that eBay is deleting about a half million pages of content used to direct prospective customers to make a purchase. eBay is first having the search engines remove the pages from the listings, and, by April 12th, physically deleting these pages from the website.Guides included discussion commenting. The comments for Guides have already been removed from the web pages.eBay’s email says sellers can instead use Promoted Listings to advertise their offers.This is an additional fee, up to 20%, sellers can pay for their product listings to be found on other eBay pages. The way it works is a seller with a product listing on Page A can pay an additional fee to be shown as a sponsored listing at the bottom of Page B.On top of the regular 10% selling fee and a 3% eBay fee, using a Promoted Listing can cost a seller a third of their selling price.In my opinion the issues are unrelated and deleting Guides will not cause sellers to pay eBay for more exposure. There are several reasons why:My educated guess is that removing Guides will result in negligible increased income from Promoted Listings.From personal review of a couple hundred Guides, I conservatively estimate each Guide is viewed on average 2,000 times. Each guide lists how many times it has been viewed.500,000 guides at 2,000 views each result in a billion views.Not only is eBay losing these page views going forward, it is also losing additional potential future views from new Guides that will never be written.eBay’s 2017 Annual report says the company’s average fee is 7.69% of the product sale price. Although the annual report does not list the average transaction size, a prior report from a few years ago derived from research by Trefis said the average order on eBay was about $60 .Assuming a 2% conversion rate, a billion page views plays a part in 20 million sales or $1.2 billion of which a 7.69% eBay share results in $92,280,000 lost profitFeel free to use your own numbers if you disagree with any of my assumptions.The 2017 Annual Report states eBay’s total marketplace revenue was $6.45 billion. Subtracting $92M would have reduced annual revenue to $6.37 billion. Over a one percent decrease.During the January 31, 2018, earnings call management said increasing use of Promoted Listings was being driven by making it available to more sellers.Maybe sellers deprived of the ability to create free buying guides will shift to paying eBay money for Promoted Listings and the company will greatly profit. But I don’t see it and the two issues seem divorced from each other. The company is losing page views and sales and I see no reason to believe Promoted Listings revenue will replace the lost free traffic. Promoted Listings revenue is likely to increase on its own but will now be partially offset from lost traffic.The bottom-line result is perhaps a one percent decrease in growth, the cause of which will not be reflected in the financial statements."

The US markets did not experience a single negative month. Large caps led the way with the S&P 500 logging a total return of 21.8%. Small caps and value indices logged much lower returns compared to the S&P 500. Motiwala Capital accounts on an aggregate basis returned 11.7% after fees and expenses.When the entire market is rising, it is difficult to take credit for stock picking. That said, I am pleased that only a few mistakes were made. The numbers in brackets that follow the company names are the contribution to the portfolio performance. The two positions that detracted from performance were New York REIT (-0.9%) and Hennessy Advisors (-0.4%). Positions that contributed positively to performance included Fortress Investment Group (NYSE:FIG) (1.1%), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (0.85%), Cision (NYSE:CISN) (0.85%), Hostess Brands (NASDAQ:TWNK) (0.75%), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) (0.5%), Dollar General (NYSE:DG) (0.5%), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) (0.5%), Linamar (OTCPK:LIMAF) (0.8%), Retail Holdings (OTCPK:RHDGF) (0.6%), Vistra Energy (NYSE:VST) (0.6%), LyondellBasell (NYSE:LYB) (0.5%), Vanguard Financials ETF (NYSEARCA:VFH) (0.5%), and Japanese stocks (1.7%).Our portfolios are divided into three buckets. The 'Generals' are undervalued equities that require either earnings improvement and/or multiple expansion to be profitable. The second bucket is Special situations where a specific corporate event could unlock value. Since Q3 2017, deep value Japanese stocks comprise the third bucket of the portfolio. The size of each bucket may vary depending on the relative attractiveness of the potential investments. In the Generals bucket, the portfolio held 24 positions at the end of the year.Positions sold:During the second half of 2017, we sold two profitable positions.eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) was sold as shares appreciated to my target valuation. In early 2016, EBAY was trading in the $22-23 range. Here is the snippet from my 2016 letter.eBay operates the well-known e-commerce platform along with classifieds and the StubHub event ticket platform. In early 2016, eBay shares were under pressure possibly due to slowing growth in its core business and increasing competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other platforms. At purchase, eBay had a strong net cash balance sheet and generated excellent free cash flow and available at a low valuation. Fast forward two years later and the stock has doubled. The company has performed reasonably, but its profits have not doubled. The low valuation of early 2016 has been corrected, and investors who bought when the shares were out of favor have been rewarded. I was likely conservative in my valuation and sold along the way and hence did not capture the full upside.Syntel (NASDAQ:SYNT) is an information technology and knowledge process outsourcing service provider. SYNT shares had been under pressure since purchase as the company warned of tougher business conditions and kept reducing guidance. Luckily, I had purchased a small initial position, and I added to the position on continued decline in the share price. At one point, the stock was down 40% to $16 from the initial purchase price of $27 (dividend adjusted). Despite the decline in revenues and profits, the company was quite profitable, produced ample free cash flow, and the valuation was attractive. From the summer of 2017, the stock reversed course and hit $25+, and I sold the position. If the business resumes growth, my sale may prove to be conservative. However, given that the turnaround was still in the works, and the stock had given us a decent return, it felt prudent to sell the stock.Positions reduced:I trimmed several positions as prices increased, thus reducing the gap between price and value. These included Vistra Energy, Cision, Hill International (NYSE:HIL), and Dollar General.New PositionsDave & Buster's (NASDAQ:PLAY) owns and operates entertainment and dining venues in N. America. Its mega-sized restaurants offer large assortment of video games as well as live sports viewing. This sets them apart from other restaurants and their margins are best in class. PLAY has grown rapidly since 2011, doubling its store base to 105 stores. It has generated cash-on-cash returns of 52% since 2011, and its growth has been self-funded. The company has a solid balance sheet and generates excellent cash flows. Most of this cash flow has been re-invested in its growth. PLAY intends to open 10+ stores annually. Recently, it has been repurchasing shares. Shares began a sharp decline in the summer of 2017 as same store sales first cooled off and then turned negative. While this is a concern, it does not seem that the business is broken. The valuation of 8x enterprise value to operating cash flow was attractive relative to its trading history as well as its potential growth.Cision provides public relations software, media distribution, and media intelligence services via a cloud-based platform. CISN has a short operating history and came public via a reverse merger with a shell company (aka SPAC). While CISN has a debt-heavy balance sheet, it produces solid free cash flow and should be able to reduce debt over the next 2-3 years. CISN has very little coverage, and if it keeps executing, it should attract analyst and investor attention.Positions added:I added to the following existing holdings.As I mentioned in the semi-annual letter, I have managed a personal account investing in deep value stocks in Japan since the summer of 2013. I was intrigued by Ben Graham's deep value strategy but did not know where to find such bargains. A friend pointed me in the direction of Japan. Over a four and half-year period, this strategy has produced annual returns in excess of 20%. In August 2017, I started investing 10% in these opportunities. While it is very early, the initial results have been good. The combined Japan portfolio contributed 1.7% to the full year portfolio performance. I intend to increase the investment in the 'Japan basket'.I am employing two strategies in Japan.(1) Net Nets: A Net-Net is a term coined by Ben Graham and refers to a stock that is trading at a discount to its net current asset value or NCAV. NCAV is simply total current assets - total liabilities. When a company's market cap is below NCAV, it is considered a net-net. It is an extreme level of cheapness as no value is assigned to non-current assets, but all liabilities are subtracted. Graham advocated a diversified net-net portfolio. Several studies have shown that this investing strategy has exhibited excellent investment returns. I start with screening to find candidate investments and then conduct further due diligence on the historical financials and valuation ranges.Example Net Net (all numbers in Yen)Nichiwa Sangyo (OTC:NCWAF) (TSE:2055) is packaged foods and meats company in Japan. It sported a market cap of 6.3 Billion, book value 17 Billion, total current assets 21.7 Billion, total liabilities 10.8 Billion. NCAV = Total current assets - Total liabilities = 21.7 - 10.8 = 10.9 Billion. P/NCAV = 6.3/10.9 = ~0.6. P/B = 0.37. Nichiwag Sango trades at a 40% discount to NCAV while being profitable, paying a dividend and having excess cash on its balance sheet. It meets my criteria for a net-net holding.(2) Low multiple stocks: The second strategy I employ is buying companies that trade at very low valuation multiples. I shortlist companies with history of operating profit and strong balance sheets. Companies that meet majority of my criteria are selected for addition to the portfolio.Sample low multiple stocksThe Japan strategy is now open to current and potential clients as a separate strategy. Please contact me if you have an interest.In December 2017, tax reform bill was passed in the US. Major highlight was the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and a lower tax rate to repatriate overseas profits. The reduced tax rate should boost corporate profit after tax and cash flows and encourage investment.Thank you for the opportunity to manage portion of your assets. I will continue to work hard to protect and grow your capital in 2018 and beyond.Sincerely,Adib MotiwalaPortfolio ManagerDisclosure: None"

The company also announced that it would change its payment processor from PayPal (PYPL) to Netherlands-based Adyen. The stock closed 13.8% higher the following day.While eBay has had a terrific quarter, stockholders might want to consider taking profits in the short term. The stock's recent run-up in price has brought its forward PE multiple to a record high. And although I expect improved margins for eBay and eBay sellers from the switch to Adyen, eBay's current agreement with PayPal still lasts another three years. Management also has indicated that stockholders should expect increasing expenses as eBay has decided to become a payment intermediary for sellers. The stock's forward PE now sits above 20 and implies analyst earnings estimates of $2.29 (non-GAAP) for 2018. This is at the higher end of management's guidance for 2018:If you are against using non-GAAP earnings, management's GAAP earnings target of $1.70 implies that EBAY trades at a forward PE of 24.8. Considering that this is higher than the S&P 500's forward PE, it makes sense to take profits.(Source: eBay 2017 Q4 Earnings Slides)According to an announcement made by eBay's seller news team, eBay plans to start intermediating payments ""on a small scale"" starting in the second half of 2018. Management's guidance for 2018 predicts this new expense will come out to $(0.03) to $(0.05) a share. At 1.305 billion average diluted shares outstanding in Q4, this is equal to roughly $39 to $65 million in additional expenses. And while this already has been priced into guidance for 2018, payment intermediation expenses could grow rapidly in 2019 as eBay processes more payments.If eBay intermediates 1% of transactions in 2018 and then decides to intermediate 25% of transactions in 2019, payment mediation expenses would grow equally in proportion (25 times) if costs are variable and not fixed. In addition to that, we should expect the expense to double in 2019 because eBay would be performing payment intermediation for a full year.In the end, it is not very clear what these ""payment intermediation"" costs are for because eBay's current agreement with PayPal does not expire until 2021. It is possible that management is using this money to cover costs associated with setting up payment infrastructure for eBay's eventual transition to Adyen.Another possibility is that eBay is intermediating payments to become more similar to Amazon (AMZN), as eBay would gain the ability to put holds on seller payments. This will allow eBay to reduce seller fraud and eBay would be able to guarantee buyer refunds instead of relying on PayPal.eBay proved me wrong and overcame a lot of the problems I discussed in my last article. But at a GAAP forward PE of 25, the valuation has gotten a little too rich and this could be an opportunity for stockholders to take profits. In the short term, payment intermediation costs will be growing pains for eBay, but this is an investment that will pay off once eBay transitions to using Adyen. Unfortunately, we will have to wait until 2021 to see any tailwinds from Adyen.If you liked this article, hit the ""Follow"" button and you will be able to see future articles I write on your home feed.

At eBay's current price, another 71.8 million shares can be repurchased.","(Image Source)eBay Inc. (eBay) currently trades at a trailing 12 month (TTM) PE of 5.3 which looks very cheap. But before buying, investors should be asking themselves, ""Is this too good to be true?"" In Q4 of 2016, eBay had two irregular events which resulted in record earnings of $5.9 billion for the company that quarter. The first was that eBay sold their equity stake in their Latin American cousin MercadoLibre, Inc. (MELI) for a $1.3 billion pre-tax gain. In hindsight, this was actually a mistake because the stock has nearly doubled since they sold their stake. The second event was the completion of a tax restructuring after the spinoff of PayPal (PYPL). After the tax restructuring, eBay recorded a non-cash income tax benefit of $4.6 billion. With an irregular Q4 in 2016, eBay's TTM PE of 5.3 can potentially mislead novice investors. I suggest using eBay's forward PE of 16.2 to value the company, especially when comparing eBay to its competitors:At its current forward PE, eBay still looks cheaper than its major competitors. But is eBay's stock cheap for a reason? I believe that the company will face significant challenges in growing its Marketplace earnings long-term because its current business practices are unsustainable. I will go over some of the reasons why below.While U.S. e-commerce spending has been experiencing double digit growth, eBay has been unable to participate in the e-commerce gold rush. Lack of GMV growth indicates that eBay has been unable to grow market share, and market share has actually been declining relative to the rest of the market.Quarterly Gross Merchandise Volume (in billions)(Source: statista)The real problem lies in the fact that eBay only has two ways to increase transaction revenue. Either GMV increases or they increase the fees charged to merchants to sell on the platform. Because GMV has been stagnant, their only option has been to increase fees charged to merchants. This leads to the second problem eBay faces.eBay has been unable to improve take rate even after final value fee hikes on merchants.For unfamiliar readers:Final Value Fee - is the % fee eBay charges to merchants (depending on product category) as a percentage of sales to sell in the eBay Marketplace.Take Rate - is the % of GMV that eBay earns as transaction revenue. Take rate is calculated as total transaction revenue divided by total GMV. Take rate effectively ""averages out"" final value fees collected across each product category.Top Rated Seller - is an eBay merchant with a high on time delivery rate and very low order defect rate. eBay gives Top Rated Sellers a discount on final value fees as an incentive to promote quality service from merchants.In May of 2017, eBay began a series of final value fee hikes on subscribed merchants. Final value fees increased by .15% across most categories. The Top Rated Seller final value fee discount was also cut from 20% to 10% (of the fee). This resulted in a .4% to .9% final value fee increase for Top Rated Sellers. eBay also decided to charge merchants that did not meet ""eBay's minimum performance standards"" an additional 4% in final value fees. This would double the fee for subscribed merchants selling in the lowest fee product categories.May 1st 2017 Final Value Fee Schedule After Increases (Sources: eBay 2017 Seller Updates)What is alarming is that eBay's Marketplace take rate has not improved after final value fee hikes. Most people would expect an improvement in take rate by roughly the same amount as the increase in fees. Instead, eBay's Marketplace take rate remained unchanged from 7.75% Y/Y. (The .15% increase in final value fees should have brought the take rate close to 7.9%.) It seems like this fee hike was an attempt at masking rising costs or eroding margins.On the other side of the eBay Marketplace, customers have also been affected by eBay's cost cutting. At the beginning of the year, eBay cut their customer rewards program, eBay Bucks, in half. Instead of earning 2% back on purchases, customers now earn 1%. Reductions in customer rewards could also lead to less spending and in turn lower GMV.There are serious sustainability issues that could arise from continuous fee hikes. A downward spiral in GMV could occur if management decides to abuse fee hikes:So far in 2017, $1.82 billion has been spent on stock buybacks. For comparison, eBay has generated $2.16 billion in free cash flow from its operating activities.Q3 2017 Buyback Activity and Balance (Source: eBay Q3 2017 Report)There is still another $2.57 billion in cash authorized for stock buybacks. At eBay's current price, another 71.8 million shares (roughly 6.6% of current diluted outstanding shares) can be repurchased.Relevant Financials For the nine months ended September 30. All values in $millions except where indicated.(Sources: eBay Q3 2016 and Q3 2017 Reports)I admit that in the past year, eBay has benefited from financial engineering through buybacks. Earnings per share grew 26.1% Y/Y. But net income growth has not been from eBay's core business, eBay Marketplace. Percentage wise, buybacks have outpaced eBay Marketplace GMV growth. Unfortunately, buybacks still don't solve the stagnant GMV growth problem.Investors should not be fooled by eBay's TTM PE of 5.3 or even their forward PE of 16.2. The company has very serious sustainability issues in their eBay Marketplace segment due to stagnant GMV. Raising final fees on merchants puts eBay on a very slippery slope because it can potentially create a downward GMV spiral. While Marketplace GMV and transaction revenue have increased about 5% Y/Y, the fact that the take rate hasn't increased after numerous fee hikes suggests that there have been rising costs in the segment. What the company needs is organic GMV growth, but I don't see this being accomplished by fee hikes on merchants or cuts to the customer rewards program.The company has resorted to stock buybacks to propel earnings per share. Normally, I would not be against buybacks. eBay's forward PE is lower than the S&P500's (SPY) 19.5, but a forward PE of 16.2 is still not low enough to perform buybacks when you consider all the risk factors the company is facing.If you liked this article, please press the follow button or leave a comment below.

4142875,103480,2018-02-03T09:24:14-05:00,"eBay reported Q4 earnings that were marginally in line with analyst expectations, but on the whole were not impressive for a fourth-quarter holiday season.The increasing popularity of Amazon and other e-commerce channels implies that eBay's share of the pie is getting smaller. Auction-based sales are no longer in vogue.The company's FY18 outlook calls for revenue acceleration, a scenario that's difficult to believe.Overall reaction to eBay's results were largely positive, with the stock rising after-hours (though falling again the next day in line with the broader market).While eBay likely won't have a dramatic flameout, the slowdown in its GMV and user growth is a leading indicator of an outdated technology and a presently overvalued stock.","eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), once one of Silicon Valley's hottest companies, has reported Q4 earnings that failed to dazzle most investors, though the immediate reaction on the results was overwhelmingly positive. Certainly eBay's results packed a bit of punch for one other company - PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), which tanked on the news - when eBay announced it would not be renewing its contract with PayPal and instead powering its payments through the Netherlands unicorn Adyen.As it concerns eBay itself, however, its competitive positioning and long-term viability as a company are very much unchanged from the previous quarter. eBay followers will recall that the company crashed after its Q3 report (which, like this one, was just in line) and its weak Q4 outlook. Now - with Q4 in the rearview mirror and eBay just barely meeting expectations for an already-weakened outlook - it's confusing why any investor would think there's any juice left in eBay at all.In line is probably going to be the norm from here on out. For Silicon Valley companies, which prize growth, in line isn't exactly an achievement. It would be one thing if eBay were immensely profitable and had earnings support for its valuation (like, for example, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)), but as it stands, eBay's earnings aren't meaningful enough to warrant valuation support. With eBay projecting full-year 2018 EPS of just $2.25-2.30 (on a continuing operations basis; total company EPS will be lower at $1.65-$1.75), eBay trades at a forward P/E of about 20x - not exactly cheap for a company whose growth trajectory is in question.See below eBay's forward P/E and forward revenue multiples:EBAY PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsTurnarounds in Silicon Valley are tough bets, especially in the Internet sector. Very few companies can pull it off (Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) seems to be the only one that's mildly succeeding right now). At eBay's current valuation premium, it's not worth putting money on the line for a decades-old company that doesn't really have any new tricks up its sleeve.Just like in the previous quarter, eBay's biggest problem is sluggish growth in GMV and active users. GMV, for those who are unfamiliar, represents gross merchandise value - the dollar value of the transactions conducted on eBay's platform. It's both the most direct measure of eBay's viability as an e-commerce platform and the biggest driver of its revenues.GMV in the fourth quarter was $24.4 billion, up only 10% y/y (and only 7% in constant currency terms). Growth in global active buyers was even weaker, up only 5% to 170 million users.On a segment basis, Marketplace (eBay's core functionality) grew GMV by 9% y/y to $23.0 billion, and StubHub grew 16% y/y to $1.4 billion (note that StubHub faltered in a big way two quarters ago, and is likely to see additional volatility ahead).This drove revenue growth of 9% y/y to $2.61 billion, exactly in line with analyst estimates. See the financial summary below:Figure 1. eBay Q4 resultsSource: eBay investor relationsIt's important to take eBay's top-line numbers in context. When the company unveiled its Q4 revenue guidance along with Q3 results of $2.58-$2.62 billion, the stock fell on concerns that the company wasn't doing more during the crucial holiday season. Hitting $2.61 billion - essentially in line with this guidance - shouldn't be treated as an accomplishment, especially when the original attitude toward that ~$2.6 billion range was bearish.The impact of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on retail stores is well-documented. Stocks like Macy's (NYSE: M), Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN) and grocery names like Kroger (NYSE: KR) have all fallen on fears of Amazon stealing a disproportionate amount of share from them. But Amazon probably has an even larger impact on old-school e-commerce names like eBay as well. When we look online for our purchases, unless we're really trying to score a tremendous deal on a used item, we generally turn first to Amazon (and even on that used item, Amazon might have it cheaper).The lure of Amazon extends to the supply side of the picture as well, not just buyer demand. eBay's excruciatingly high fees (total fees, plus PayPal fees - though in the future, Adyen's rates might be lower) can take up to a staggering 13% of your sale. For reference, here is eBay's current simplified fees table:Figure 2. eBay feesSource: eBay.comNote that PayPal takes an additional 3% on top - and while PayPal isn't required, it's the most popular option as the credit card route is also costly. Sellers have balked at these high fees, and many of eBay's highest-volume sellers have uprooted their stores to Amazon, hurting the company's GMV growth.While PayPal was the primary recipient of investors' displeasure after the announcement of the split, eBay has a lot at risk as well. While Adyen has a large presence in Europe, it is relatively unknown in the U.S.; whereas PayPal has built a reputation for credibility and security. A switch from the payment processor that sellers are used to can cause an even greater migration off the eBay platform.The bottom line picture, like the top line story, was also entirely uninspiring. eBay's operating margin decreased to 25.4%, down from 26.6% from the same quarter last year. A company that's slowing down its growth trajectory should be turning an eye to opex efficiencies and cost reduction, but clearly eBay hasn't succeeded in that realm.The company's bottom line was impacted by a $3.1 billion tax charge due to the Trump tax bill, so its GAAP earnings picture is fairly meaningless. On a pro forma basis, however, eBay generated net income of $618 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, up only 3% y/y. This, too, was in line with analyst estimates for $0.59.eBay's revenue guidance for FY18 is also a concerning figure. The company is pointing to $10.9-$11.1 billion of revenue in FY18 (versus consensus of $10.3 billion - probably the reason the stock rallied immediately after its earnings post). But we really have to ask ourselves: is this guidance, which is an acceleration scenario of 7-9% growth relative to just 7% constant currency growth in Q4, a realistic target? What is eBay doing, exactly, that will allow it to achieve acceleration? In most investors' view, its most dramatic move so far is to kick out PayPal, a decision that may even bear some consequences for eBay. eBay is fairly lacking on the innovation space (at least relative to other e-commerce names), and with continued defection of both buyers and sellers, the company may soon see a return to negative GMV y/y comps as well as negative revenue growth.Its EPS guidance, as previously mentioned, is $2.25-$2.30. This puts eBay's forward P/E at about 20. For a company that only managed to grow pro forma net income by 3% in Q4, eBay isn't a good deal.At current levels, eBay seems to be priced at a premium despite its below-average growth figures on both the top and bottom line. Investors aren't discounting deeply enough the risks to eBay's core business, especially as both buyers and sellers migrate away from the platform.eBay has already lived through the hype of its heyday. With no exciting offerings coming out of the company that can entice its user base to remain, the company is likely to underperform going forward."
4124249,103856,2017-11-13T11:54:20-05:00,Recent dip in expected Q4 profits shouldn't worry investors.Data points towards eBay being undervalued.E-commerce sales are growing at a fast rate.,"Recently, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) forecast fourth-quarter adjusted profit of around $0.58 a share, which caused a big drop in price. While many were expecting a higher profit per share and rushed to sell their stock, there’s no need to panic. The dip in expected earnings, while a disappointment to many, doesn’t look bad when considering what caused it and the future outlook of the company.The dip in expected profits is a result of bigger spending in both marketing and the development of its website. While that extra spending reduced expected earnings by a bit, it was made with an eye towards the future. For example, the company began testing with user listings, enabling customers to organize their search results by products rather than listing, and is developing eBay Guaranteed Delivery which would enable three-day business shipping or less on over 20 million items. eBay has been taking the right steps towards capitalizing on an expanding e-commerce while making a push to catch up on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).If that’s wasn’t enough, the expected earnings per share of $0.58 represent a 29% growth from last year's $0.45. So overall, eBay actually had a strong year and is ready to take on bigger challenges. Other metrics also point towards eBay being a good buy. With a book value per share of roughly 1/3 of its market value, and a P/E of 5.27, it’s not unreasonable to think eBay might be undervalued. Its EPS (TTM) of 6.77 represents a 299% growth. Taking everything into account, I believe eBay is undervalued and is a good investment opportunity.Another positive thing for eBay is the market in which it operates. Marketplaces and ecommerce sales in general are trending upwards. Everyday more people decide to buy online rather than going to the brick-and-mortar stores.Retail e-commerce sales in the United States from 2016 to 2022 (in million U.S. dollars)(Chart taken from Statista)The chart displays the expected growth of e-commerce in the US. With an expected e-commerce sales growth of 12.7% for 2017 and 11.25% for 2018, eBay seems perfectly positioned to take advantage of it. According to Business Insider, the NRF expects online retail to grow 8-12%, while brick-and-mortar sales are only expected to grow 2.8%. This seems to point towards customers migrating towards online sales rather than brick-and-mortar stores.In terms of marketplaces, eBay is second only to Amazon in terms of sales. A research done by BigCommerce estimates 45% of all e-commerce sales are done through marketplaces, with Amazon (36%) and eBay (8%) leading the way, while the rest (1%) is handled by other websites. In its research, it also found that 51% of Americans prefer to shop online, and 80% of them have done so in the past month.All of the data points towards e-commerce growing and thriving, which bodes well for eBay. While it may not be as big as Amazon, being second in an ever-expanding e-commerce market is great news for shareholders.Forecast Earnings Growth (Chart taken from Nasdaq)When looking at the forecasted growth in earnings of 12.74% in 2018, it’s clear the stock is headed upwards. For the next five years, expected earnings growth of 7.86% seems reasonable, considering the growth in e-commerce market and the changes eBay is implementing.(Chart taken from TipRanks)Many analysts are predicting eBay's price will rise. Using data from 19 analysts, TipRanks estimates an average price target of $39.06, which represents an 8.59% upside. Of the 19 analysts, 7 recommend to buy, 10 to hold, and only 3 to sell. Analysts from Aegis Capital, City Group, Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo are some of the ones recommending to buy.I believe eBay is undervalued right now and that its price doesn’t accurately reflect its performance and future growth. With a large expected growth in e-commerce sales, changes to the company's platform to make it more user friendly and efficient, and expected growth in revenue, eBay is a great buy. This is the perfect opportunity to buy low on a stock that I believe will exceed expectations."

These initiatives are generating accelerating growth.The business model is remarkably profitable, the stock is priced at reasonable levels, and the company distributes tons of cash to investors via buybacks.If he company can sustain revenue growth in the high single digits going forward, then eBay stock could deliver material gains from current price levels.","eBay (EBAY) is in a very particular position. The company operates in the much attractive e-commerce industry, and it has a profitable business model. On the other hand, eBay is facing daunting competitive pressure from Amazon (AMZN), and this is a major limitation.The fact that eBay lives under Amazon’s shadow is a crucial uncertainty factor affecting the company. However, uncertainty can many times create opportunities in the market, and there are reasons to believe that the e-commerce underdog could be offering a convenient entry point for investors.Saying that eBay has underperformed Amazon in the long term is actually an understatement. Amazon is all about growth and disruption, and Jeff Bezos prioritizes long term revenue expansion above business profitability. This means that competing against Amazon can be a tremendously daunting challenge for any company in the world, and eBay is no exception.But eBay has taken multiple measures to improve its product selection, increase catalogue visibility, and revamp the overall customer experience over the past several years. It’s still too early to tell what kind of impact these initiatives will have over time, but the most recent financial report from eBay is showing some encouraging signs.Total revenue during the third quarter of 2017 amounted to $2.4 billion, increasing 9% versus the third quarter in 2016. Marketplace gross merchandise value - GMV - came in at $20.5 billion during the period, also growing by 9% year over year. eBay added nearly two million active buyers in the quarter, for a total of 168 million global active buyers at the end of the period.The company benefited from accelerating growth across its three main platforms during the quarter, and volume growth was the fastest in three years. Devin Wenig, President and Chief Executive Officer, sounds quite optimistic about the company's ability to deliver results.While Amazon is mostly an online retailer, eBay is simply in the business of matching buyers and sellers off all kinds of products. This means that eBay doesn't need to worry about inventory risks or the big logistics expenses that are hurting Amazon's margins so much. eBay has accelerated its investments in different areas lately, which obviously has a negative impact on margins. In spite of that, operating margin accounted for 24% of revenue last quarter, and adjusted operating margin was an impressive 29.9%.Cash flow generation is quite healthy: eBay produced $877 million of operating cash flow and $720 million of free cash flow from continuing operations during the quarter.The stock is priced at fairly reasonable valuation levels, if not downright undervalued in comparison to the broad market. eBay carries a forward price to earnings ratio (PE) of 17.05 versus an average forward PE ratio of 19.8 for companies in the S&P 500.Considering that eBay is a widely profitable company making big and consistent cash flows, valuation levels look quite attractive. Especially if eBay can sustain the improvements in revenue growth over the coming years.Another major positive in eBay stock is the company's aggressive stock buyback program. Over the past five years eBay has reduced the amount of shares outstanding by an impressive 19.4%.EBAY Shares Outstanding data by YChartsAcademic research has proven that companies with big buybacks, solid profitability, and reasonable valuation levels tend to outperform the market in the long term, and my own backtesting data confirms such findings.The chart below shows backtested performance for the Quality Buybacks System. This is a quantitative system exclusively available to subscribers in my research service: The Data Driven Investor.In simple terms, the system looks for companies with big buybacks, elevated profitability, and moderate valuation levels. eBay fits into that description quite well, and the stock is in fact one of the names recommended by the system.Backtested performance is quite solid. The Quality Buybacks system is an equal weighted and monthly rebalanced portfolio with the 50 best companies recommended by the algorithm. The portfolio is assumed to have an annual expense ratio of 1% to account for trading expenses and similar considerations, and the benchmark is the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY).Chart and data are from Portfolio123. Since January of 1999 the Quality Buybacks system produced a compounded annual return of 17.02%, far surpassing the 6.13% annual return delivered by the benchmark ETF in the same period. In cumulative terms, the Quality Buybacks system gained over 1,867% versus a gain of 209% for the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF.Past performance is no guarantee of future returns, and system implementation can be far more difficult than it seems to be. This means that backtested performance needs to be taken with a big grain of salt.That acknowledged, it makes sense to expect attractive returns when investing in companies with attractive indicators in areas such as profitability, valuation, and capital distributions, and eBay is one such company.The numbers look good for eBay, and one of the main reasons the market is not giving much credit to the company is because of the competitive threat from Amazon and what it means for eBay in terms of the company's growth rates. If eBay can sustain the acceleration in performance over the middle term, this could drive material gains for investors in the company."
4108095,102683,2017-09-19T16:06:11-04:00,"eBay currently has a strong network of users to experiment its strategies on.Moreover, StubHub, as well as future acquisitions aid in management's international expansion efforts.Lastly, the company's capital allocation strategies continue to add value to shareholders.","eBay (EBAY) continues to present an attractive buying opportunity, even as it rises to fresh record highs. For one, its strong network effect is difficult to recreate by rivals, giving it a large, entrenched user base to experiment with. Additionally, StubHub, is an interesting asset in its portfolio, providing large potential overseas growth opportunities. Lastly, its capital allocation strategies are adding value to shareholders, further boosting the company's share price going forward. In total, eBay looks attractively valued for its future growth prospects.Although the operating landscape for eBay is changing, and getting more competitive, they still look to have a foothold on e-commerce. eBay's growth plans are aided by a strong network effect inherent in its marketplaces' 25 million-plus active sellers and 171 million active buyers across the globe, not easily recreated by rival networks. Regardless of the company's strategy, they are working with a large user base to experiment with, and to potentially adopt new products and services.Additionally, on top of their strong network, StubHub, as well as future acquisitions, could present attractive international expansion for the company going forward. eBay is currently pushing for growth in its global operations, with StubHub being one of its key assets in the endeavor. While U.S. growth lags currently, StubHub's global event marketplace saw significant double-digit international Gross Merchandise Volume growth in the most recent quarter, due in large part to innovations in its native app social commerce and a globally integrated event catalog. Sports is a global phenomenon, and signals that management is taking its expertise in marketplace development, and applying it to the global sporting event space.Below is a chart of eBay's revenue growth, price to sales multiple, as well as its price. A healthy rally consists of rising revenue and expanding valuation multiples. Although eBay's valuation multiple has been expanding due to broader equity market strength, and optimism for its future growth prospects, underlying revenue remains flat. As eBay utilizes its expertise in marketplace development, as well as global growth through acquisitions and organic operations, revenue growth should similarly pick up, leading to further capital appreciation of its share price.The chart below is of eBay's shares outstanding relative to its price over the last decade. Due to a high cash pile, and an initiative to buy back shares, outstanding shares dropped by nearly 500 million since peaking in early 2006.Despite the competitive e-commerce space currently, eBay remains in a strong financial position, with $13.6 billion in cash. For income-oriented investors, eBay's capital allocation activity, including $3.5 billion remaining on its share repurchases authorization, look very attractive. Moreover, with the cash pile it is sitting on, expect additional capital allocation moves in coming years, such as a dividend and increasing M&A activity, which could further benefit shareholders.A risk to investing in any e-commerce player is that competition is tough. eBay faces rivalry from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) in the domestic and international space, which will force management to be cutting edge in its thinking. Although these are formidable opponents, eBay has shown it is able to navigate the ever changing waters of e-commerce.Ultimately, eBay looks like a continued buy at current levels due to a number of reasons. The company's strong global network allows it to experiment with new ventures on its vast user base. Moreover, it is growing both organically, and through acquisition, further driving future growth higher. And lastly, its capital allocation strategies continue to benefit shareholder value. Collectively, these should all lead to eBay seeing capital appreciation in coming years."
4113640,103480,2017-10-16T10:00:00-04:00,"eBay's organic revenue growth has slowed down to the mid-single digits, most recently growing only 4% y/y in the last quarter.The company is slated to report earnings this week, and its forecast for 6-8% revenue growth may be overreaching.GMV (gross merchandise volume), the aggregate amount of goods sold across eBay's platforms and the primary measure of its marketplace power, is virtually flat.With no growth left in its future, eBay looks exceptionally overvalued.","Before Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime became so popular, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) was the e-commerce king. The idea of peer-to-peer exchanges of goods was so revolutionary that it vaulted eBay immediately to the top of Silicon Valley and created a multi-billion-dollar company. But now - while I am no fan of overhyped Amazon drama - it's easy to see that the majority of buyers and sellers prefer Amazon to eBay.Driven mostly by fierce online competition, eBay has lost its glitter: GMV is flat, revenue growth is subpar, and it's counting on acquisitions like StubHub to boost its growth. eBay no longer deserves the $40 billion market cap it's currently sporting, and it's a mystery why the stock is marching toward 52-week highs.EBAY data by YChartsOne major risk catalyst coming up this week is eBay's Q3 earnings release. With GMV in the core eBay platform flat at $21.5 billion for 2Q17 (up only 2.9% from 2Q16's $20.9 billion) and GMV at StubHub, eBay's growth engine, actually down 5%, the company may not be able to achieve the 6-8% constant currency revenue growth it has guided to.The company's earnings are not in tiptop shape either - 2016's EPS was helped by a one-time gain on the sale of its stake in MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI). Consensus estimates for the company call for earnings of $2.00 for FY17, implying a P/E of nearly 20x for eBay, according to Yahoo Finance - a steep multiple for a company whose earnings growth is grinding to a halt and facing difficult y/y compares.Unless the company can over-deliver on Q3 results as well as lift guidance, eBay's year-to-date rally may soon be over.With organic growth disappointing, eBay has turned to a tried-and-true tactic of many slowing industrial concerns: acquire the growth. According to eBay's 10-K, the company spent $212 million in six acquisitions in 2016. The acquired companies include:Of these six companies, only Cargigi and Ticketbis are actual marketplace platforms that can add to eBay's GMV (and even so: have you heard of these companies? Do you think they can save eBay from sinking into irrelevance?). The other four are software startups, and while every technology company needs to show proficiency in data analytics and machine learning these days, software is out of eBay's realm of expertise. It's not clear why eBay would spend cash to buy something like Expertmaker, a big data startup, instead of licensing or subscribing to similar software if needed.$212 million isn't a whole lot for a company with a market cap of $40 billion and approximately $13.6 billion of cash. But also recall that, as of eBay's Q2 balance sheet, the company is also carrying $11.4 billion of debt, making its net cash position actually a lot thinner at ~$2 billion. eBay had better make its shopping choices wisely.To tack on to the acquisition disappointments, StubHub - which provides about 5% of its GMV and has driven strong growth for eBay since the company acquired it for $310 million in 2007 - is seeing declining GMV.eBay reported Q2 GMV for StubHub of $1.0 billion, down 5% y/y, citing ""a softer U.S. events landscape compared to last year."" The revenue growth StubHub did provide was due mostly to Ticketbis, the international ticketing company eBay acquired in 2016.What investors want to see is an uptick in both organic growth and the core eBay business, and this isn't happening. eBay's core Marketplace platform saw total GMV of $20.5 billion in Q2, up only 3% y/y. Furthermore, the website's user growth isn't accelerating too quickly either - the company added 2 million users in Q2 to expand its global active buyer base to 171 million, or only a 1% quarter/quarter growth.In times of slow revenue growth, what we'd expect from a well-managed company is that it begins to harvest cash and improve margins to maximize profits. Technology investors can forgive margin deterioration or outright losses if they are accompanied by strong top-line growth, but when growth is flat, investors want to see profit expansion.eBay's operating income has largely held flat in the past five years, as has its revenue. During this time, operating margins have contracted slightly - from a high of 30% in 2013 to just 26% in 2015 and 2016.Figure 1. eBay summary financials, 2012-20164% might not sound like a lot, but on $9 billion of revenues, 4% translates to $360 million, or nearly one full quarter of GAAP net profit for eBay.Making matters worse, margin deterioration has continued into 2017. Q2 saw 330 bps of margin deterioration, with operating margin of only 20.5% compared to 23.8% in 2Q16. Operating income itself fell 10% y/y to $478 million, down from $531 million in 2Q16, erasing all of the benefits of some (though not stellar) top-line growth.To explain this erosion of margins, the company primarily cites in its 10-Q ""increased costs from acquired businesses"" and ""expansion of our Marketplace customer support offerings"" have driven gross margins down by 2%. The remainder of the margin decline owed to an increase in general and administrative costs, primarily to support acquisition integration - surely, a sign of ineffective management during times of flat growth.The quick take from the points raised in this article: beware eBay's upcoming Q3 print. The company has recently returned to Wall Street's favor after posting revenue growth in the past few quarters (reversing a decline seen in 2015), but stagnating GMV and user metrics are a leading indicator of the disappointing results to come.Like most companies struggling to reinvent themselves, eBay has turned to acquisitions in the hopes of finding another StubHub to invigorate growth. Yet acquisitions have been painful to margins, and StubHub itself - eBay's flagship subsidiary that has been in its portfolio for 10 years now - is showing a decline in GMV for the first time.eBay is not, by any means, a bad business. It's not going to flame out spectacularly like Yahoo, but it's not a growth stock anymore, and it shouldn't be valued like one. With the stock commanding premium multiples but showing subpar growth, I'd be careful heading into the Q3 print."

Jeff Bezos started Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in his Bellevue garage in 1994. And perhaps the most famous garage startup story ever is that of Bill Hewlett and David Packard and the garage they rented in 1939 to start the electronics company that would later bear their names. That garage is now a private museum and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.It turns out a lot of other important tech giants got their start in a more respectable part of the house - the living room.That's where Reid Hoffman hatched the idea for LinkedIn in 2003 after inviting hundreds of his friends to create online profiles to get his idea for a professional online networking site off the ground.It's also where Airbnb (AIRB), quite literally, got its start. After hearing that a big conference was coming to San Francisco and that hotel rooms were totally sold out, two 27-year-old guys, who were living there in 2007 and struggling to pay rent, bought three airbeds and turned their living room into a makeshift bed and breakfast. Six days and a website called airbedandbreakfast.com later, three people had paid Joe Gebbia and Brian Chesky $80 a night to sleep on those air mattresses on their living room floor and eat the breakfast they cooked for them the next morning. Airbnb was launched a year later.Over Labor Day weekend in 1995, Pierre Omidyar wrote the original code in his living room for the company that would later become known as eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). ""AuctionWeb"" was the name of the site, and its first listed item wasn't a Pez dispenser but a laser pointer that Omidyar had purchased for $30 and later broke. He advertised it as broken, set the starting bid at $1.00 and watched the bidding frenzy begin: The pointer sold for $14.83. Omidyar was said to have been so stunned that someone would actually pay money for a broken laser pointer that he became convinced that an online marketplace where people could buy and sell collectibles - even broken ones - held great promise.Almost 22 years later, another startup founded in 2004 in a living room (of sorts) - a dorm on the campus of Harvard University - could end up being eBay's most promising buyer ever: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).For much of its first decade, eBay was on a roll.Two years after the successful sale of that broken laser pointer, Omidyar raised $6.7 million from Benchmark Capital and changed its name to eBay. A year later, in March of 1998, Meg Whitman was hired as president and CEO. In September of that year, eBay went public.On its first day of trading, eBay closed at $53.50 - nearly three times its target share price. Four years later, in 2002, eBay announced that it would buy PayPal for $1.5 billion in an effort to eliminate the friction associated with paying sellers for their stuff, which, unbelievably, was done by check most of the time.Almost overnight, eBay became the ""it"" site for collectors and bargain hunters - the ""Craigslist killer,"" as it was called - expanding internationally to 27 countries. In August of 2001, The Industry Standard published a piece describing the firm as ""unstoppable"" given its power as a platform that simply facilitated the sale of goods between buyers and sellers without taking possession of any inventory. They wrote then that ""what started as a quaint auctioneer of useless collectibles has grown into a commerce powerhouse … arguably the only large, unquestionably successful consumer internet survivor.""In 2004, Fortune published an article lauding eBay as the fastest-growing company in history eight years in - faster than Dell or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) had grown over a similar period of time. That piece chronicled eBay's growth from its humble beginnings of $5.7 million in revenues to $3.2 billion in just an eight-year span of time.But it would be over the next four years that eBay would find itself increasingly pulled into a riptide of changing market dynamics.Consumers were getting tired of auctions, which made it harder to attract and keep sellers. Consumers also found eBay's site difficult to navigate because of its clunky search function - not exactly a great characteristic when a key driver of success is finding the right item quickly. Consumers also began complaining about the quality of goods sold to them and the relatively poor customer service they received when they reported that the items they purchased weren't the real deal.Sellers had their own complaints about payment terms which they said were too high. Sellers also grumbled and fretted about the sharp drop-offs in traffic to their pages and sales as a result of buyer auction fatigue and the growing crop of competition from other online players - including Amazon - that offered new products at a discount on a site that was easier to buy from and navigate.So, eBay set in motion a number of things in an attempt to blunt the impact of these shifts and to bring new buyers and sellers into the mix.The auction model was largely disbanded over time in exchange for a ""Buy It Now"" option and fixed price listings. eBay acquired online ticket exchange StubHub in 2007. And, in 2011, eBay acquired eCommerce tech platforms GSI Commerce and Magento to create more synergies with the online retailers that were its customers.Speaking of online retailers, eBay went all out to court them. In 2012, eBay CEO John Donahoe, who had taken over from Meg Whitman in 2008, more or less told retailers that ""Amazon is your enemy, eBay is your friend"" to persuade them to upload their product catalogues to branded eBay storefronts. That year, it was reported by Reuters that 50,000-plus stores in the U.S. had done so, including Home Depot, Neiman Marcus, Lowe's, JCPenney, Barnes & Noble, Best Buy, Target and GNC - all using eBay as a way to sell inventory that hadn't moved in other channels and could be sold at a discount to eBay's buyers.At the same time, consumers found other places online to buy the things that eBay's marketplace had once dominated.Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), founded in 2005, had grown from a place online that only hosted artisans selling one-of-a-kind handmade goods to a destination for buying vintage collectibles. Online consignment shops like The RealReal, Poshmark (both founded in 2011) and Tradesy (founded in 2012) became the destination for women (mostly) who wanted to scratch their luxury, high-end designer consignment itch, given the quality of the merchandise they listed. Gilt Groupe and Rue La La, both founded in 2007, sold new designer merchandise at deeply discounted prices with inventory replenished daily. Zulily, founded in 2009, became a favorite platform for moms who wanted to buy stuff for their kids and loved the surprise of seeing new selections and flash sale options every day.Meanwhile, stalwart eBay-ers really didn't know what to make of eBay anymore.Its once seemingly impervious reputation as the go-to for quality collectibles of all kinds - a reputation that eBay was simultaneously working hard to shake - seemed a bit tattered. Collectibles now included too much junky stuff that stretched the definition of ""vintage"" or ""antique.""Buyers who were attracted to eBay to buy new merchandise - clothes, electronics, toys - found themselves comparing those deals with a number of other online sites, including Amazon, that offered better prices, in some cases, and better and more predictable delivery windows, too.Yet eBay's marketplace problem had been largely masked by the performance of the entire portfolio of businesses that eBay had bought and had been built up over the years - PayPal and StubHub in particular. Post the PayPal split, it became the only thing on which that analysts and investors focused. (eBay also spun out eBay Enterprise in 2015.) Seven months after the eBay/PayPal split, eBay's disappointing earnings performance drove a 13 percent sell-off in its stock, with analysts citing marginal growth in both revenues and active buyers.Unfortunately, eBay has had a tough go of it ever since.The company has seen five straight quarters of declining consumer spend - now at $41.30 per month and dropping. During its Q2 2017 earnings call, CEO Devin Wenig reported that revenues from its marketplace grew at a modest 4 percent and that two million active buyers were added last quarter, bringing its total to 171 million active buyers worldwide. Wenig also reported that StubHub, which had always been the counterweight to eBay marketplace's slowing growth - accounting for approximately 9 percent of sales and 34 percent annual growth - saw its own performance soften: GMV (gross merchandise volume) was down 5 percent and revenue was up only 5 percent, due to increasing competition and a secular slowdown in the events business. While, on average, the e-commerce sector overall has seen a gain of 46.4 percent year to date, eBay's seen gains of only 18.7 percent.And eBay's operating margins seem headed in the wrong direction, too: down from a high of 50 percent in 2012 to 38 percent in 2016 to 20.5 percent in eBay's Q2 2017 earnings call. That was down from 23.8 percent from the same period a year ago. Margins have taken a hit at the hands of investments in marketing, seller services and the core product to keep sellers on board, new buyers coming and existing ones spending. Many believe that initiatives like its newly launched Price Match Guarantee on 80,000 deals worldwide will only add more pressure to those softening margins.The bright spot? Classifieds: a small but growing part of the eBay platform worldwide. Reported revenues of $216 million for the quarter were up 6 percent, Wenig said, on strong traffic and user engagement.Exactly the type of business that Facebook has been trying (unsuccessfully) to ignite since 2004.Facebook has had e-commerce ambitions from the get-go.It created its first ""marketplace"" for classified listings in 2007. It was a long and largely unsuccessful slog for seven years, with a business that failed to get any significant traction at all. It was shuttered in 2014.Facebook Stores was launched in 2009 as a way for online retailers to sell to the fans who ""liked"" them. Or so they thought. The agency-driven campaigns that retailers spent a fortune funding, on the premise that fans would easily convert to buyers, found they didn't even convert to fans. Only 4 percent of consumers who liked a brand as a result of a campaign ever returned to that brand's page again.But so what, you say, since 99.5 percent of user engagement happens in the News Feed anyway - and a ""like"" is the ticket to getting content in the News Feed. Well, not exactly.What Facebook Storefront shopkeepers didn't know at the time (this was before Facebook went public and its algorithms were explained) was that Facebook's algorithms kept that from happening. The only way to reliably get into the News Feed and get noticed by users was to buy advertising and hope that enough consumers saw an ad, clicked and then clicked again to buy.Most users didn't.Stores have evolved over the years to include buy buttons and partnerships with players like Shopify in an effort to expand the ability for users to ""buy"" from those Storefronts. And e-commerce has evolved, as well, to include promotions to buy inside the News Feed from retailers who advertise there. But commerce revenues from those efforts on Facebook appear unimpressive, given that Stores/Storefronts and revenue from commerce sales overall have nary a mention on most earnings calls.Facebook Gifts was launched in 2012, which sounded like a logical slam dunk for a social platform. The feature reminded users that it was a friend's birthday or other special occasion and a selection of gift cards was presented for that friend to send. But in a case of execution gone badly, at launch the only thing that a user could do was send a physical gift card, sort of defeating the whole point of surprising someone on the day of their special event. A year later, Facebook bagged physical gift cards for virtual ones, but by then the bloom was off that commerce rose. Facebook shuttered Gifts in August of 2014.In the fall of 2016, Facebook decided to take another swing at Marketplace, launching with a service that the tech press described as ""the friendlier Craigslist."" This P2P marketplace lets people buy and sell the stuff they don't want anymore - clothes, furniture, collectibles, toy, tickets, even items from retailers - just like Craigslist.And eBay.Last week, Facebook and eBay announced a partnership to show eBay's Daily Deals on a separate tab in Facebook's Marketplace section to select mobile users. As part of this test, Facebook users can see the deals but are pushed to eBay's site to complete the purchase. A few days after than announcement, Facebook said that it was expanding Marketplace to 17 countries throughout Europe and many of the same countries where eBay also has a presence and Daily Deals.Facebook has found commerce to be illusive because people never came to Facebook to shop - and, according to our own research, don't trust them to power their commerce experience. There's something about a social network and storing payments credentials to buy things on a social network that doesn't - and apparently hasn't ever - sat well with consumers.But that hasn't mattered much to Facebook, since being a commerce kingpin wasn't its focus. The company has crushed it as an advertising platform and managed the shift to mobile extremely well. According to eMarketer, Facebook will pocket nearly $34 billion in digital ad spend in 2017, and Facebook and Google will account for 46.4 percent of all global digital ad spend this year.But Facebook and analysts are worried about an impending ad revenue slow down as Facebook runs out of places to stick ads - the News Feed is all out of inventory. Messenger, the once-hailed wunderkind of commerce and chatbots, hasn't moved the needle much (any?) when it comes to commerce. Even Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, told investors on its last earnings call that Messenger isn't moving to a monetization model nearly fast enough. As I wrote a few weeks ago, I'm dubious that it ever will.That means that Facebook will have to look for new ways to monetize its user base and diversify its revenue risks. Commerce may now be one of the opportunities it wants to pursue seriously. Perhaps leveraging its social networks across all of its platforms around a Marketplace model could be one of those logical paths to explore.If the past is prologue, it's not likely to get there without a lot of help.But eBay could provide that help at the same time Facebook solves several of its own problems: attracting quality sellers and buyers and getting them to transact on its platform.Two billion people a month and 1.3 billion people a day hanging out on Facebook could increase those odds - attracting eBay buyers that might not have ever considered them an option and sellers who might be intrigued by the possibility of being seen by the largest concentration of human beings ever assembled online. It's not as if eBay isn't growing or adding new active buyers to its platform - it's that its growth is slowing and has been slowing for quite some time at the same time. And at the same time that the cost of attracting new buyers and sellers is increasing - and so is the competition for both sellers and buyers.A partnership with Facebook could change that equation, reducing some of its marketing and product investments to bolster its margins. And eBay also comes with a growing global event ticketing business: StubHub acquired Ticketbis last year, and a built-in global buyer and seller base. A partnership with eBay also comes with something else: a number of seller tools and features that also leverage PayPal's seller services portfolio, including payments, working capital and a global shipping and returns platform.With a market cap of $37.2 billion and falling, the company could be the ticket for Facebook to get into commerce for real. Perfect - no, because of all the flaws I just talked about. A no-brainer - no, because taking one property that is struggling and combining it with another that hasn't really gotten commerce off the ground isn't a sure thing either.But it is likely to be a lot cheaper for Facebook to build off eBay's assets, reputation and client base than continuing to build its own commerce capability on a global scale. And it's a whole lot cheaper than buying Amazon - by about $440 billion. The marriage could be a win for eBay, too, which needs a shot in the arm and could get it from a partnership with Facebook's enormous global user base that can also drive commerce on a local level too.Now, this is just me talking, after thinking about the eBay Daily Deals/Facebook mashup on one of my morning runs. Plenty of players partner up and a transaction never happens - and most of the time one was never contemplated in the first place.But this one doesn't necessarily sound that farfetched either.Who knows, maybe if Facebook ""friends"" eBay for life, its third Marketplace revival could be the charm."

Our price target is $48/share for 46% upside.Please find the original presentation deck from the Sohn Conference at the end of this article.Part I: Merchant of RecordeBay spun off PayPal in July 2015. Three details of their post-spinoff operating agreement are of interest to us. First, the agreement lasts for five years, concluding in July 2020. Second, the agreement requires continued use of PayPal as eBay’s transaction aggregator, netting PayPal a fee for each transaction processed. The third detail is likely the most unappreciated part of the eBay story, and concerns eBay’s plans to become a “merchant of record.”A merchant of record is the party who intermediates a transaction. As eBay’s merchant of record, PayPal intermediates every transaction. Buyers pay PayPal, and PayPal pays the seller. PayPal takes a ~3.5% fee from the buyer and pays a ~1% fee to the acquiring merchant bank that processes all transactions in bulk. The spread, less SG&A and fraud-related costs, is PayPal’s profit from serving as eBay’s merchant of record. All major e-commerce sites today are merchants of record, including Amazon and Alibaba. eBay has been the historical exception due to its ownership of PayPal, which profited handsomely by processing every individual eBay transaction for a ~2.5% fee on gross merchandise volume (GMV).But eBay does not own PayPal anymore, so why does this relationship continue? In response to a proxy fight for splitting eBay and PayPal led by Carl Icahn in 2014, eBay’s management noted the following:- PayPal grows faster because of eBay- eBay accelerates the success of PayPal- Data sharing leads to more profitable growth- eBay Inc. provides efficient capital for PayPal- Commerce and payments are convergingCareful readers would also note the disclosure that “eBay delivers about 30% of PayPal’s new users at virtually no cost, more than 30% of PayPal’s revenues and approximately 50% of PayPal’s profits.” The benefits to eBay are much less clear, but their pre-spinoff relationship is frozen until 2020 all the same.When the operating agreement expires in July 2020, eBay will have the opportunity to establish itself as a merchant of record. But once they can end the relationship, how do we know that they will? One could certainly speculate about the hiring of Alyssa Cutright to “lead eBay’s global strategy and operations of billing and payments.” One could also research eBay’s early history with Wells Fargo and the use of Billpoint as a payments intermediary, perhaps seeing this as a blueprint for a post-PayPal future. Easiest of all, one could pay close attention to Section XIV of the eBay-PayPal operating agreement:“Following the three (3) year anniversary of the Effective Time, eBay shall be permitted to declare itself as a Merchant of Record for transactions effected by third Persons in up to two (2) Covered Jurisdictions as selected by eBay in its sole discretion (each, a “Test Jurisdiction”); provided, that (i) the GMV transacted as a Merchant of Record on all eBay Covered Properties in each Test Jurisdiction during the fourth (4th) year of the Term shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the GMV on all eBay Covered Properties in such Test Jurisdiction during such year, and (ii) the GMV transacted as a Merchant of Record on all eBay Covered Properties in each Test Jurisdiction during each of the fifth (5th) year of the Term and the Tail Period shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the GMV on all eBay Covered Properties in such Test Jurisdiction during each such year.”This short footnote sets the groundwork for eBay’s full transition to a merchant of record model in mid-2020. Provisions for test jurisdictions as early as 2018 give eBay the opportunity to test the merchant of record model, with full rollout possible at the expiration of the operating agreement in 2020. eBay has a financial incentive to pursue such action due to the substantial value it would create. Our calculations for the upside from such action are based on the terminal value of such action discounted back from 2020:Rationale for assumptions- 84.26 billion = trailing 12-month GMV as of Q1 2017- 3.47% = PayPal aggregate take rate (last disclosed in 2014); this number blends in the 0% take rate on various Braintree platforms (i.e. Venmo), meaning the true on-eBay take rate is closer to 4%.- 1.0% = back-end fees for debit and credit transactions (network fees, acquirer fees, fraud fees, etc.).- 50% = incremental SG&A costs for creating a merchant of record arrangement within eBay, including costs for incremental hires, customer service expenses, and ironing out the kinks.- 25% = tax rate (eBay’s historic tax rate is closer to 20%)- 3% = terminal rate- 10% = discount rateThe catalyst for this value realization will be the disclosure and detailed explanation of plans to become a merchant of record. We expect this to transpire no later than mid-2018, as eBay will begin exploring test jurisdictions at this time. Earlier catalysts might include management discussions on future earnings calls or disclosures by PayPal of this risk in their financial statements. This upside is PayPal’s downside, and the merchant of record transaction could make for a separate, compelling short thesis on PayPal.Part II: ClassifiedsClassifieds are local markets for the exchange of services and secondary goods. They are basically hyper-local versions of eBay. Americans are generally familiar with Craigslist, the dominant classifieds service in the United States. eBay owns a dozen major classifieds services worldwide, ten of which are dominant in their national markets. High-level information about eBay’s classifieds holdings is quite promising: eBay’s classifieds services have the most popular mobile applications in eight countries, 29% yearly growth in page views, 270 million unique monthly visitors, and over 50 million ads posted each month. Classifieds are a higher-quality business than eBay’s main marketplaces business (and indeed, one of the highest-quality businesses we have ever seen) for several reasons:1. Monopolistic: 10 of the 12 classifieds services owned by eBay are national monopolies. Marktplaats.nl dominates the Netherlands, Mobile.de dominates Germany’s automotive market, Kijiji dominates Canada—the list goes on. Classifieds have the most powerful moat in business: network effects. Each new user benefits from the presence of existing users à-la social media, and each new user widens the moat between the winner and its competitors.2. Higher Margins: eBay’s classifieds services have ultra-high operating margins near 60% (an estimate based on comparable companies, as eBay does not disclose classifieds data), versus 30% for its core marketplaces segment. Margins are higher for classifieds because the segment requires effectively zero marketing and maintenance expense. Moreover, the high fixed costs of the segment offer massive margin expansion. Most important, the monopolistic nature of the business creates huge untapped pricing power. Examples from comparable businesses in other countries (Schibsted and Naspers) indicate that operating margins could exceed 70% as the segment matures.3. Faster Growth: the classifieds services are growing 15% top-line. Some platforms, such as the U.S.-based mobile offering Close5, are growing at >100% top-line. This compares favorably to eBay’s core marketplaces segment, growing at 5% FX-neutral annually. This fast growth will continue for years due to roll-ups of smaller competitors and expansion into adjacent countries and verticals. Moreover, as the segment becomes a larger overall share of eBay’s total profits, the firm will deserve a higher multiple from faster growth.But crucially, the market is missing the value of eBay’s classifieds holdings. In 8000+ pages of sell-side analyst reports published since the spinoff of PayPal in July, only one analyst (at UBS) took any time to discuss eBay’s classifieds holding in depth. Interestingly, this analyst placed a price target on eBay that was 50% higher than the second-highest price target. We also note that the buy-side analysts with whom we spoke have shown zero interest in eBay’s classifieds portfolio and assign trivial value to its assets. One Seeking Alpha contributor recently noted that “concerns about eBay’s growth are valid considering that it makes its money from its marketplaces and ticketing services. It does not have significant revenue outside of the two.”This lack of appreciation for the Classifieds segment is especially interesting when one compares it with the new darling of Wall Street analysts, StubHub. Classifieds LTM revenue is $804 million versus $964 million for StubHub. Classifieds likely commands margins near 60% (again, very reasonable based on competitors’ data; see here for margin details on Leboncoin, a comparable service owned by Schibsted). Meanwhile, StubHub commands margins closer to 30%. Revenue times margin equals an estimated EBIT of $482 million for Classifieds and $289 million for StubHub, meaning that Classifieds contribute 67% more EBIT than StubHub to eBay. But you won’t find that in a sell-side report.Two plausible explanations for the under-appreciation of eBay classifieds are management’s lack of detailed disclosure on the segment and the lack of U.S.-based comparable companies. Gathering the relevant data for valuing each of eBay’s classified businesses required an arduous search for tiny pieces of information that we believe most analysts would not have endured. Moreover, U.S.-based analysts do not appear to understand the nature of classifieds markets because there are no comparable companies in the U.S. The only major U.S. classifieds service is Craigslist, which is private.So what is the Classifieds segment worth? We have calculated the following valuation:Rationale for assumptions- 804 million = trailing 12-month revenue as of Q1 2017- 422 = free cash flow produced by Classifieds in 2017, (804)*(70%)*(1-25%) = 422 million- (422*10) = value of interim payments before terminal period; because the growth rate equals the discount rate, they cancel out during the projection period, i.e. 1.1 1 /1.1 1 = 1.- 10% = growth has trended at 10-15% over the last five years. Comparable firms (Schibsted and Naspers) estimate 15% growth over the long-term due to tailwinds from further market penetration, monetization, and new listing verticals like real estate and employment classifieds.- 70% = operating margin, based on mature peers owned by Schibsted (i.e. Blocket and Finn).- 25% = tax rate (eBay’s historic tax rate is closer to 20%)- 4% = terminal rate- 10% = discount rateeBay’s Classifieds segment has plenty of room for future growth. The segment benefits from a high degree of operating leverage, has a sticky and price insensitive user base, is recession-proof, holds no inventory, and has several levers for additional monetization that have not yet been deployed. This segment may well be the long-term growth engine for eBay.Part III: StubHub and MarketplacesA full valuation of eBay also requires valuing its StubHub and Marketplaces segments. The market has a fair understanding of these components, and our valuations for are more conservative than consensus. The valuations for both segments are not central to our thesis, and they are offered primarily in order to conduct a sum-of-the-parts valuation for the entire company.Our valuation for Marketplaces (eBay’s core segment) is straightforward. Current management guidance on revenue growth is 5% FX-neutral annually, which matches closely with historical FX-neutral growth rates over the last decade. We have chosen to exclude FX headwinds from our projections because we expect those headwinds to normalize or reverse or time. We place Marketplaces revenue growth at 3% in perpetuity for conservatism. We assume normalized margins of 30%, which adjust from current 25% operating margins that are temporarily depressed due to costs related to the structured data initiative and search engine optimization to recover eBay’s traffic after Google’s search engine algorithm update. Our tax rate is 25% and our discount rate is 10%. Use trailing 12-month revenue of 7.28 billion, we arrive at the following valuation for Marketplaces:Our valuation for StubHub is quite a bit more conservative than market consensus. We do not factor in any additional pricing power, despite StubHub’s take-rate increasing 3% last year alone. We do not factor in any additional operating leverage that could cause margin expansion, despite the fixed cost leverage widely known to exist in two-sided marketplaces. We do not factor in market consolidation benefits despite StubHub’s dominance in a winner-take-all market (StubHub has nearly 5x the market share of its next-largest competitor, Ticketmaster). With these conservative assumptions in mind, we arrive at the following valuation for StubHub:Rationale for assumptions- 964 million = trailing 12-month revenue as of Q1 2017- 217 = free cash flow produced by StubHub in 2017, (964)*(30%)*(1-25%) = 217 million- (217*10) = value of interim payments before terminal period; because the growth rate equals the discount rate, they cancel out during the projection period, i.e. 1.1 1 /1.1 1 = 1.- 10% = the segment grew nearly 40% last year, and management is guiding for 10-15% annual growth. The acquisition of TicketBis opens international markets, and the underpenetrated and massive total addressable market offers a long growth runway.- 30% = operating margin, backed out from known Marketplaces and likely Classifieds margins- 25% = tax rate (eBay’s historic tax rate is closer to 20%)- 4% = terminal rate- 10% = discount ratePart IV: ConclusionIncluding 2.20 billion of excess cash, the sum of our valuations is the following (in billions):The current enterprise valuation of eBay is approximately 34 billion, implying 46% upside from current levels ($33.15 as of this writing) and a fair value of $48 per share. This valuation disconnect provides an ample margin of safety. Downside is further protected by a low valuation on the basis of normalized free cash flow (trading at 6% FCF yield), continued share buybacks (nearly 1 billion in buybacks are authorized for the remainder of 2017), and organic growth in each operating segment. Investors should be further comforted on the downside by the fact that eBay is a highly stable business that is consistently growing at a low-to-mid single digit rate with a sizable runway for continued growth. Investors in eBay can sleep soundly knowing that time and the math of compounding are on their side.Catalysts for value realization include continued share buybacks, additional insider buying, management discussion of the merchant of record arrangement, a more detailed breakdown of the classifieds segment, strategic bolt-on acquisitions for the core segments, continued growth in the StubHub and Marketplaces segments, and pressure on management to act decisively on the merchant of record arrangement.Thanks for reading.Presentation from Sohn Conference(Editors' Note: This is a republication of an entry in the Sohn Investment Idea Contest.

4074535,21434,2017-05-18T17:42:12-04:00,Etsy's new CEO embraces the idea the website is a for-profit business.A couple of activist investor groups are pressing for changes that make sense.eBay could integrate with Etsy in a way that doesn't destroy its unique feel.,"Two weeks ago, shares of online artisan outlet Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) plunged in the wake of a disappointing first quarter report as well as a concerning replacement of its CEO. While it had become clear that Chad Dickerson wasn't the right person to be at the helm, it wasn't clear Josh Silverman would fare any better.Silverman, who was formerly an executive at eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) but has also worked closely with American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK), is a tried-and-true Wall Streeter who may not truly embrace the original vision of Etsy. That is, Etsy is an online marketplace that focuses on the quality of the crafts and the people making them more than it worries about profits.It's an admirable mission. Unfortunately, by choosing to go public in early 2015, the company ceded the rights to maintain or alter that mission as needed. Majority shareholders now make that call.To that end, the bad news is pair of major investment groups just bought in and appear to have plans to either fix what's broken, or sell the company to an outfit that could do something with it (or both). The good news is, patient Etsy shareholders may finally start to get some of their money back on their soured investment.And the odds on favorite suitor? Some say Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). But, more likely eBay would not only be more interested, eBay and Etsy would make the better symbiotic relationship.Change is (Finally) ComingThe surprise came earlier this week, when TPG Group Holdings and Dragoneer Investment Group both disclosed in required SEC filings that they collectively held an 8% stake ...... not that either fund was trying to keep it a secret. The pair both acknowledges the wanted ""to engage in discussions regarding strategic alternatives.""Silverman responded with the typical boilerplate response:That's usually Wall Street code for ""We really don't care what these activist investors have in mind because they don't truly understand our business."" In the case of Etsy though, its new chief is not only something of a hired gun that's been around the block a few times, he's a former executive of the company that could arguably do the most with Etsy. That's eBay.That's Wall Street code for ""some big changes are coming, and ideally it will be some sort of sale.""Not everyone agrees that eBay is the logical buyer here. Think tank L2's Research Director Cooper Smith recently opined ""The most likely suitor for Etsy is an e-tailer experienced with marketplace transactions and that has a global cross-border fulfillment network, which would suggest Alibaba or Amazon as potential acquirers.""Makes sense. Though Handmade at Amazon is reasonably successful for being in place less than two years, it's only got 800,000 product listings versus Etsy's 45 million. It could use a few more...On the flipside, Smith also concedes that artisanal one-offs -- or even just small-run goods -- aren't Amazon's strength. That's eBay's forte, not because it only sells one of anything (plenty of eBay store operators have hundreds of the exact same, factory made item for sale at any given time), but because it's at least got some experience with connecting buyers with sellers of one-of-a-kind goods. And, as Ansira Assistant Vice President Luigi Ferguson recently noted, ""Ebay has been able to make significant moves over the last 12 months from a technology, advertising and personalization standpoint and Etsy would be able to benefit greatly from integrating similar optimizations to their core platform.""That puts eBay back at the top of the likely-suitor list.With that backdrop in place, the one aspect of Etsy that's either been overlooked or mischaracterized since it went public in 2015 is just how near it is to being viable.Don't misread that. Etsy has never been profitable on a full-year basis, and is rarely profitable on a quarterly basis. It's never been wildly unprofitable though, and with a few nips and tucks, could turn into a sustainable profit center.Data from Thomson Reuters, chart made by authorThose nips and tucks are most likely what Dragoneer and TPG Group have in mind, at least for starters. With or without Dragoneer and TPG Group's involvement though, Silverman is likely thinking along those same lines.Those cost cuts would take aim at some of the very things that make Etsy what is. In enough interested parties' sights are employee perks that most would deem a bit too lavish. These include an oddly nice catering service, square footage devoted to employee's personal pursuits of printmaking and yoga at the company's headquarters, and Etsy's adherence to managing its own servers rather than outsourcing that function to a cloud-based provider.Those things haven't come without a cost though... a literal cost. By not outsourcing its server needs and getting far more serious than Amazon and eBay have gotten about marketing themselves on the web, Etsy has not become all it could have become, sales-wise or earnings-wise.Bottom LineSure, its chic feel played for a while, but the company and its sellers can't pay bills with social responsibility. When all is said and done, it's a business ultimately meant to make money. If it's not willing to do what its competitors are willing to do -- even the indirect ones like Amazon and eBay -- it can't grow.The masses are starting to see this now, and a trio of players seem willing to start the necessary changes. In the meantime, fears that Etsy will be altered into everything it initially suggested it didn't want to become may be a tad overblown.Whatever the case, eBay seems best suited to fix the biggest part of what ails Etsy, which is scaling up the sale of one-off items, and helping Etsy's merchandise be found by consumers who weren't necessarily shopping at etsy.com. The cost-culling measures should already be well underway by the time eBay would be interested in making a move, right in front of what analysts had widely expected to be a nice swing to profitability anyway.It's been said before but it merits repeating now -- owning a stock just because it's a rumored buyout candidate is a bad reason to own it. Most suspected buyouts don't seem to pan out. If a company is a legitimate turnaround candidate that might also be an acquisition target though -- and that's what Etsy is here -- the rationalization holds more water.It won't be something that happens soon no matter what. Any potential buyer wants to see that Etsy can be fixed before taking on the project. The company's fiscal second quarter numbers due in early August, which will be the first with Silverman in charge, will be the first possible opportunity to present any evidence that Etsy isn't doomed. And realistically, it will take a couple of quarters for Silverman to produce any meaningful amount of such evidence.Nevertheless, the stage is set with all the right players. It's not too soon to take Etsy off the shelf, blow the dust off, and put it back on your mental watchlists. The pot's just been stirred, and a deal could be brewing."
4089380,33291,2017-07-21T10:30:58-04:00,Q2 earnings are out and we discuss the key metrics.Keep an eye on declining operating margins.The results have led to some volatile action on the back of varying interpretations of the quarter.Where I see the name heading.,"eBay Inc. (EBAY) has just reported its earnings and they were essentially in line with consensus expectations on many metrics. Strange as it seems, I think this is a volatile situation for the stock as investors are sure whether to buy, sell or hold. As such since the report was released we have seen volatile action in off market hours and to start the day. I want to reiterate my position so there is no mistake. I think the company is in the strong position it has ever been in, but as a stock, I still prefer you trade this one. When I last reiterated how much of a trading vehicle eBay stock was, the name dropped 12-13% following the article only to rebound to new 52 week highs, all in a matter of a few weeks. However, given that the stock is not too far off a 52 week high, there are likely many investors riding the name trying stay long and catch an upswing to the $40 range. Will that happen?These results could move the stock either way, and that explains the volatility. If history is to be repeated, there is a strong chance we see the name trading in the low $30 range before the $40 range. However, the name is trading at a very cheap valuation of just 5.3 times trailing earnings, so this time the situation is a bit different. In the quarter, there were solid results, but the company matched consensus. In many cases this is a good thing but for a trading vehicle like eBay, sometimes an in-line quarter is negatively perceived. I think that is the case here. eBay's Q2 revenue increased 4.5% year-over-year to $2.33 billion, and this essentially in line. GAAP earnings came in at $27 million or $0.02 per share. Much of this GAAP figure was driven lower by a non-cash tax charge of $311 million related to the continued realignment of its legal structure, primarily impacting its foreign 'Classifieds' platforms. If we look at adjusted earnings we see these rolled in at $493 million, or $0.45 per share, also matching expectations.Of course, the headlines only tell us so much. One strong metrics that we must utilize to measure the health of the company is eBay's gross merchandise volume. This metric saw growth on an as reported and constant dollar basis. On as reported basis, gross merchandise volumes were $21.5 billion, rising 3%. If we exclude the negative impact of currency related issues which are plaguing all domestic companies, the gross merchandise volume increased 5% year-over-year. Of course, absolute year-over-year comparisons are complicated because foreign currency movements continued to have a negative effect, impacting the revenue growth rate of the eBay Marketplaces and of course StubHub.One place of year-over-year disappointment was the operating margin. This metrics has been worsening over the last several quarters and I think you need to keep an eye on it. Operating margin dropped precipitously to 20.5% versus 23.8% last year. This is also down from last quarter's 24.6%. Adjusted margins also dropped to 27.3% from 29.1% last year, as was down from 30% last quarter. Keep an eye on this. Cash flow is another important indicator and this was up from last quarter. Cash flow was a healthy $699 million of operating cash flow and $517 million in free cash flow. What is important to also point out, and this is good for long-term investors, the company bought back $507 million in stock in the quarter. I have said this before and will say it again. I think however that these repurchases are best made when the stock is slumping, when shares are truly undervalued, if the goal is to create shareholder value. Regardless, in conjunction with this report the Board has just authorized an additional $3 billion repurchase program. David Wenig, president and CEO of eBay said:So where are we going from here? I think we move lower, below $35 before we get a rebound to new highs over $40. We could have been helped by guidance, but this is somewhat light looking ahead. This is because for Q3 the company sees $2.35 to $2.39 billion in sales For all of 2017 the company still sees $9.3 billion to $9.5 billion of sales, while consensus is $9.4 billion. Let the name pull back to under the $35 range before getting in. I will say this. All things considered, this is the strongest the company has looked in years. An investment is compelling here, but once again, you have to wait for the right price.Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

4077915,102671,2017-06-01T01:36:22-04:00,"Compared to other hot tech firms, eBay looks undervalued.CEO Wenig's plan to differentiate eBay brand is bearing fruit; the 2016 holiday season was a record quarter.Healthy cash flow enables the company to return lots of capital to shareholders.User growth slow but steady; network effects and the loyal user base are keeping eBay afloat for the long haul.","In the face of high-flying rivals, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is often overlooked in the business press. There is reason for this, of course. It was once thought that auction-style selling would create the most efficient prices, but traditional retailing is still the norm in 2017. As a result, arch rival Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) market cap is approaching $500 billion, making eBay's $38 billion value look puny by comparison. But by any measure, eBay stock has been an incredible wealth generator for long-time shareholders, having appreciated nearly 4,300 percent since the 1998 IPO.Beginning in the late 2000s, eBay entered a prolonged slump. For years, the stock price languished amid bungled expansion schemes and a slowdown in the core business. Over the last year, however, the company has exceeded earnings expectations after implementing a turnaround plan to differentiate the eBay brand. The company has also generated strong cash flow, enabling it to buy back a huge amount of its stock. Although investors have sent shares up more than 40 percent over the last year, eBay still looks relatively compelling.Current StrategyContrary to popular perception, over 70 percent of goods for sale on the site are new, not used. The company is now focused on rebranding itself accordingly. Under CEO Devin Wenig, eBay has shifted from being a free-for-all platform to a curated marketplace. The new homepage looks more like a traditional retailer, offering ""daily deals"" and showcasing products offered by professional merchants or corporate vendors who sell in quantity. Wenig envisions eBay becoming a destination for unique goods, while Amazon will be the place to go for commodities. eBay seeks to be more like T.J. Maxx (NYSE:TJX) in spirit than Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), with the former offering a ""store of discovery"" experience rather than a quick trip to purchase necessities.Image: Current eBay homepageThe second piece of the turnaround plan involves revamped advertising. Wenig seeks to bombard shoppers on all fronts, from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP) to television. Wherever possible, online data will be used to better target ads toward customers and customize the homepage. Despite a tough last few years for eBay, the latest changes seem to be bearing fruit. Shares soared earlier this year on a record holiday quarter and restructuring that benefits shareholders. Now a mature business, eBay churns out cash in the absence of large capital investment. In 2015 it spun off PayPal, and late last year, the company sold its stake in Latin American auction site MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) for a substantial profit.As its flagship business faltered, eBay previously sought to shore up its position with acquisitions and overseas expansion. Its track record here is pretty mixed. The early PayPal purchase obviously turned into a huge winner. The StubHub acquisition has also done well, and the subsidiary now accounts for a 6 percent (and growing) share of revenue. But the 25 percent stake in Craigslist ended after a flurry of litigation, and eBay's subsequent effort to enter classified ads through Kijiji largely flopped. The China brand degenerated into an infamous and costly misadventure when it failed to gain ground against homegrown competition. The memory of that fiasco seems to have informed the current strategy of partnering with overseas rivals, as the recent $500 million investment in India's Flipkart (FPKT) demonstrates.StrengthsDespite the proliferation of competitors, eBay has benefited from significant network effects, which occur when a product or service becomes more useful when more people consume it. In eBay's case, the enormous network of buyers and sellers forms a large economic moat. Even though Amazon has long since taken the top spot, eBay remains the second-most popular ecommerce site in terms of unique monthly visitors.Source: StatisticaThen there is user growth. While these numbers are weak compared to those of Amazon and smaller startups, eBay has experienced fairly steady growth in the number of active users, which now tops 160 million.Source: StatisticaFinancially, the company is in pretty good shape. Although it carries $9 billion in debt, there is also almost $7 billion in cash on the books. Strong cash flow has enabled the company to reduce its share base by 17 percent since 2014. As of the last quarterly report, nearly $1 billion remained in the repurchase program.Weakness and UncertaintyWhile the plan to become a curated marketplace seems to be working, it risks squeezing out small sellers and alienating its core shoppers. eBay forums are replete with stories of small sellers who have gone bankrupt as a result of huge changes to the internal search engine. As J.C. Penney's (JCP) botched turnaround demonstrated, changes to the core business can backfire badly.So far that has not happened, but eBay's smaller competitors in the used goods market have rushed to fill the void. Bonanza brazenly promotes itself to sellers as an eBay alternative, both for its ease of use and the large ratio of buyers to sellers. Apps such as Letgo (backed by South African internet conglomerate Naspers (OTCPK:NPSNY)) make prominent use of the smartphone, eliminating a large amount of friction by integrating picture-taking into the program. eBay has responded with its own consumer-to-consumer used goods app called Close5, which only shows items within a five-mile radius. Then there are niche platforms such as CarDaddy, Poshmark, and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), which all focus on specific categories.ConclusionFor a while, I believed that eBay was doomed to the dustbin in a two-front war against Amazon and competition in the used goods marketplace, but now I think the effort to differentiate eBay from its rivals is more likely to succeed than fail. I do not think the company is another IBM, which is throwing off cash as its core business shrinks. Even though eBay is not growing as quickly as ecommerce as a whole, it is nevertheless growing steadily by every metric. Devin Wenig has wisely chosen not to go head-to-head with Amazon, saying that ""the world doesn't need an almost-as-good Amazon,"" but rather ""a better eBay.""Right now, the company is valued at 21 times its 2016 earnings, which is very cheap compared to other tech high-flyers. In my view, sentiment toward many tech companies is getting too cheery, making eBay relatively more attractive. If the company authorizes a fresh buyback program, investors could reap even more rewards on top of healthy earnings growth. Given all of these factors, I would feel comfortable owning eBay at the current price of $34 a share."

The stock is up 23.32% year-to-date.","eBay (EBAY) reports second-quarter earnings after market close on Thursday, July 20. As more consumers shop online and it faces competition from Amazon (AMZN), Wal-Mart (WMT) and many more, the company has focused on carving a niche for itself in the ecommerce world with its Marketplace, Stubhub, and Classifieds segments.In the last quarter, eBay’s gross merchandise volume (GMV), the total dollar amount of merchandise sold across its marketplaces, was reported to have increased 2% to $20.9 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, management reported a 5% increase. GMV is one metric used by ecommerce analysts because these companies ultimately generate revenues through the fees earned from sales on their platforms.Another metric for ecommerce companies that is routinely followed by analysts is the number of active buyers a site has. In the first quarter, eBay reported it had added 2 million active buyers, a 4% increase from the 167 million reported in Q4 2016. CEO Devin Wenig partially attributed that rise to a “relatively robust consumer-spending environment” on the company’s earnings conference call.One factor beyond improved consumer spending that might be helping eBay’s GMV and number of active buyers is its ongoing efforts to improve its platform. Over the past several quarters, the company has made several changes including a redesign of its website, and on the back end the company has been focused on what it calls its “structured data initiative”, which is focused on improving the user experience on its Marketplace platform by making products easier to find.The company also recently announced a price match guarantee on more than 50,000 items in the United States. eBay said it “guarantees that an eligible deal will be the best price online, or eBay will match the lower price of a competitor.”FIGURE 1: EBAY OUTPERFORMING. eBay has been outperforming the broader tech sector since the start of the year.

4063675,102436,2017-04-20T08:09:08-04:00,"Yesterday, eBay reported its Q1 results.The results were not impressive, but we still believe in the long-term outlook for the company.Shares are undervalued based on 2017 expected EPS.The company is still a favorable acquisition target.","Last month, we explained why eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is a safe investment and why it may be a possible takeover target (read here).After eBay reported its first quarter results yesterday, we still believe that the company is a safe equity investment. But, investors should not put high expectations on the stock performance. We believe eBay is a place where investors can park their money while having a gradual price appreciation in their holdings. However, if our prediction comes true and eBay is acquired, investors would be rewarded with huge returns.Let's go back to the main thesis of this article, earnings.Taking eBay's history of hitting analysts' estimates, it's no surprise that Q1 results were in line with the street's expectations.The California-based company reported a 3.7% Y/Y increase in revenues and a 130% increase in net-income (purely caused by taxing benefits as a result of changing the legal structure). On the other hand, EBITDA decreased 9.2%, mainly due to higher operating expenses.The company's Marketplace GMV increased 5% (on neutral currency basis) reaching the $20 billion mark, with eBay's take-rate being steady at 8.6%, nearly triple Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) rate.StubHubWhat we liked in the released results is eBay's 18% surge in revenues driven from its StubHub platform, the leading platform in the tickets industry. The current take-rate of eBay from StubHub increased to an astonishing 22.2% from 20.3% in March 2016, which means that every $1 increase in StubHub's GMV will add $0.22 to eBay's pockets.The platform's GMV increased 5.5% Y/Y but decreased 26% Q/Q due to seasonally-strong Q4 sales.In Q1, the platform became the official ticket resale marketplace for the Los Angeles Angels and Toronto Blue Jays, offering a panoramic 360-degree virtual view-from-seats for buyers, paving the way for more future sales.More prosWhat we also liked is the 10% increase in shareholder's equity when compared to Q4's reported SE. This means that the company is adding value to its shareholders in a relatively short amount of time. For example, the book value increased 67% since March 2016.Another thing we liked is the announced partnership with the Singapore-based e-commerce Flipkart (Flipkart is a leader in the Indian e-commerce sector). eBay invested $500 million in Flipkart in return for an equity stake and a partnership between both platforms (customers of both platforms will have access to inventories on both platforms).Concluding, we believe that eBay is poised to more revenue increase in the future. The company is expanding rapidly into the international markets while having the highest take-rates in the industry. Not to forget, there is $986 million left for the current share-repurchase program. Last but not least, the company's partnership with Flipkart will significantly increase the traffic into eBay's platform. The company guided for a 6%-8% increase in 2017 revenues (on neutral currency basis) with an expected EPS midpoint of $2. This values eBay at ~16.5x 2017 diluted EPS, which is low for a company that has 169 million active buyers, a high take rate, and international expansion. We remain long eBay with a $40/share price target.Note: We try to be the first to provide earnings analysis for stocks we follow.

4063385,102757,2017-04-19T11:31:05-04:00,"eBay's turnaround seems to be working.The net income should grow by 14% to 28% in 2017.Management thinks the shares are undervalued and are buying them back.Depending on the level of execution, eBay's share could appreciate.","IntroductioneBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is busy repositioning its business. The turnaround strategy is ""having the most relevance coupled with a powerful selling platform, while clarifying the eBay brand"". I'll be arguing that this is strategy is showing signs of effectiveness and that, if management manages to execute, the company can be considered undervalued at the moment. Management seems to agree with this as they bought back $1 billion worth of shares.The turnaround is very much needed, because when we take a look at their historical fundamental performance, it is nothing short of troublesome. A dwindling cash pile coupled with an increasing debt load, is a recipe for disaster. Keep in mind that a dwindling cash pile for a technology company is different than for, say, a retailer. This is because technology companies usually don't have a lot of fixed assets, which reduces the need for heavy capex spending. The other side to this is that tech companies must spend a lot in R&D, because they are always trying to keep up with, if not be, the latest technology.eBay specifically is not spending a whole lot on capex (as expected), but is certainly purchasing a lot of investments, while simultaneously selling a lot of investments. This has to do with their goal to reposition the business.Turning it aroundeBay's biggest problem is that it is competing with Amazon for e-commerce dollars. More specifically, it is losing from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). While eBay calls a 5% growth in GMV value a record quarter, Amazon is recording double digit growth rates. It's interesting to note that this record quarter came during the holiday season. In other words, the boost was not necessarily organic, but on the back of holiday spirits.eBay is attempting to reposition its business by having the most relevance coupled with a powerful selling platform. They also seem to have a keen interest in clarifying their brand as can be deduced from Devin Wenig's, the CEO, comments during the conference call:This is a terribly vague strategy. How exactly does a 'powerful selling platform' differ from their current platform? Is their current platform not powerful? Yes, they are improving their Buyer Protection Plan (BPP), which is supposed to make eBay safer. The thinking here is that if more people feel safe buying through eBay, the company will be able to generate more revenue through its commissions. The reason why this BBP is important, is because eBay is more a forum that connects buyers than an online retailer, and trading with strangers is not as safe as trading with an established company. The biggest benefit for eBay users is that the BBP promises users to intervene in disputes.However, not all is vague. The company also has some specific things that they're doing to turn the business around like simplifying the experience and tailoring pricing in markets like Germany.The strategy presumably has been in the works for quite some time now and is showing some signs of effectiveness. The evidence to support this theory lies in their C2C business. This business has notably been lagging for roughly three years. Last quarter, it reported its first positive growth in nearly three years. 2016 was also the first year since 2012 that recorded a year over year growth. While the 4.4% growth was not terrible impressive, in eBay's context - a struggling turnaround company- this counts for something. Together, these strategies should increase the operating margin from 26% in 2016 to 29%-31% in 2017.Addition to bottom lineSo what does this mean for the bottom line?Source: company presentationFrom this graph we can deduce that the operating income is expected to be $2,697 to $2,945 billion for 2017. We still have to subtract around $225 million in interest expense. Finally, we multiply it by 1-tax rate to get to the net income. This works out to be $1,804 to $1,985 billion in net income. For perspective, the company's adjusted net income was $1,533 billion in 2016 and $1,725 in 2015. So best case scenario is that the company records a 28% growth from 2016 levels. If we zoom out even further and notice that 2016 actually showed a sequential decline to $1,533 from $1,725 in 2015, the growth becomes somewhat less impressive and comes in at 14%.To sum this part of, the company is expected to grow 14% to 28% depending on their execution.Management thinks the share are undervaluedThe EPS growth is not the only positive thing for investors. Investors are buying eBay, because they think the company is undervalued. Management is aligning themselves with this way of thinking and is actively repurchasing shares. Management bought around $1 billion dollar worth of shares, which reduced the total shares outstanding by 6.2%. So not only did the EPS grow by 2% organically, the company reduced its shares outstanding by 6.2%, which in its turn increases the EPS. This is because the earnings are shared by a lower amount of shares. There is about $1.3 billion left in the share repurchase plan. If management decides to spend this in 2017, this could give the EPS growth rate an additional boost.Source: company presentationFinal thoughtsThe company has a Forward PE of around 15, which is reasonably for a 14% income growth, but unreasonable for a 28% growth rate. So while the turnaround seems to be working, it might be wise to wait and assess the level of execution. If execution turns out to be second to none, eBay could see its share price appreciate."
4083986,33291,2017-06-26T14:43:43-04:00,"As a stock, to me, it's never been reliable as an investment, but is a great trading vehicle.The name caught my eye today with a new service.A discussion of recent performance shows the name is stronger than ever.","It has been well over a year since I initiated coverage eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY). I want to remind you that in the past I used the site to sell a ton of old sports cards and memorabilia, as well as some random items including printer cartridges, video games, unopened posters and more. PayPal, its once subsidiary has now been separated into its own standalone company. I want to be very clear. As a stock, to me, it's never been reliable as an investment, however, you can always cherry pick a time frame to argue against this assessment. I personally view it as a trading vehicle. In fact, it is one of the best trading vehicles out there. When I last reiterated how much of a trading vehicle this was the stock proceeded to drop 12-13%, only to rebound to new 52 week highs, all in a matter of a few months. Hence the trading power. From a longer-term investing perspective, the stock has mostly traded sideways since I opened coverage. Today the stock has caught my eye with major news that it is launching a price matching guarantee, to help it compete and improve upon its earnings power.That is right, eBay, which already has deals which are genuinely lower priced or equal to its competitors, is now going to offer price matching. This will cover more than 50,000 listings, in its eBay Deals section. Obviously the guarantee doesn’t work with auction items or items from third parties that are being bid on. This is a big step as the eBay Deals selection has grown exponentially since being launched in 2011. To qualify, it must be in this section and be identical to another competitors item in every way. The competitors that eBay will match are Amazon.com (AMZN), BestBuy.com (BBY), Jet.com (JET), HomeDepot.com (HD), Sears.com (SHLD), Target.com (TGT), Walmart.com (WMT) and Wayfair.com (W). This move is eBay’s way to guarantee that its users aren’t going to go to a competitor for the same item over price. It’s a smart move, especially when the deals are open to everyone and ships for free, unlike Amazon and others, which require a membership in many cases to access these benefits. But will it be enough to bump up earnings?Well in the most recent quarter there were somewhat impressive results as the company outperformed expectations. Guidance however, was a touch light in some areas. eBay's first quarter revenue increased 3.7% year-over-year to $2.22 billion, and this was above estimates by $10 million. GAAP earnings came in at $1 billion or $0.94 per share, which is a strong performance for this period. Much of this was driven by a non-cash $695 million income tax benefit related to the continued realignment of its legal structure, primarily impacting its foreign ‘Classifieds’ platforms. If we look at adjusted earnings we see these rolled in at $538 million, or $0.49 per share.Of course the headlines only tell us so much. I think a good place to check the health of the company is eBay's gross merchandise volume. This metric saw growth on a constant dollar basis. If we exclude the negative impact of currency related issues which are plaguing all domestic companies, the gross merchandise volume increased 5% year-over-year. Of course absolute year-over-year comparisons are complicated because foreign currency movements continued to have a negative effect, impacting the revenue growth rate of the eBay Marketplaces and of course StubHub.One place of year-over-year disappointment was the operating margin. Operating margin dropped precipitously to 24.6% versus 28.7% last year. However, this is a rise from last quarter's 24.4%. Adjusted margins also dropped to 30.0% from 33.4% last year. Cash flow was higher, coming in at $582 million of operating cash flow and $447million in free cash flow. What is important to also point out, and this is good for long-term investors, the company bought back $350 million in stock in the quarter. I think however that these repurchases are best made when the stock is slumping, when shares are truly undervalued, if the goal is to create shareholder value. Early January 2017 was a prime example of a good time to buy. David Wenig, President and CEO of eBay said:The stock is getting a bit of momentum now, with shares back above $35. The price match guarantee could help revenues, but may impact margins slightly, and will impact margins when we look solely at the eBay Deals section. Guidance was a touch light looking ahead, so I would wait for a nice pullback before getting long this side of the trade. This is because for Q2 the company sees $2.28 to $2.32 billion in sales, while consensus was $2.32 billion. For all of 2017 the company still sees $9.3 billion to $9.5 billion of sales, while consensus is $9.4 billion. Let the name pull back to the $33 to $32 range before getting in. I will say this. All things considered, this is the strongest the company has looked in years. An investment is compelling here, but wait for the right price.Note from the author: Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

4061745,102646,2017-04-11T13:54:05-04:00,eBay does not appear in the media regularly.The company has a proven track record of making acquisitions.There is more room for growth especially internationally.,"No one talks about eBay (EBAY) anymore. This year, only 25 article entries have been made in TechCrunch with the word eBay. Amazon (AMZN) has been mentioned more than 300 times. In Seeking Alpha, only 6 articles on eBay have been submitted this year compared to almost a hundred on Amazon. eBay’s stock is currently trading at an all-time high of $34. In this article, I will give the reasons why you can expect eBay to grow in the future.eBay operates one of the most popular e-commerce platforms in the world with more than 167 million customers. In the past three months, its website and mobile app have been visited more than 3.3 billion times according to analytics firm Similar Web. eBay is the 25th most popular website in the world and the 6th in the United States.eBay has also diversified its revenue sources with most of its revenues coming from the international market.Source: 10-KIn the past 20 years, eBay has managed to grow to become one of the leading tech firms in the world. This growth is partly attributed to the company’s past acquisitions. In 2002, eBay acquired PayPal (PYPL) for $1.2 billion and spun it off in 2015 giving it a valuation of almost $50 billion in its first day of trading.In 2001, the company invested a tiny sum of money in Mercadolibre (MELI) and sold its stake in 2016 for $1 billion. In 2007, eBay acquired StubHub for $307 million. In 2016, StubHub generated almost a billion dollars for eBay. Yesterday, it was reported that eBay invested $500 million in Indian e-commerce company, Flipkart. You can view eBay’s other acquisitions here.eBay is a highly profitable company with high margins compared to other e-commerce companies. In 2016, the company sold merchandise worth $84 billion giving it more than $9 billion in revenues. Its net income was $7.3 billion and its operating margin was 25%. In comparison, Amazon, Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY), and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) have operating margins of 3.08%, 4.71%, and 13.49% respectively. In 2017, the company forecasts revenues of between $9.3 billion and $9.5 billion and operating margins of between 29% and 31%.eBay is a slightly undervalued company. Its P/E ratio using its projected one-year earnings is 15.38. This is lower than that of its peer companies like Amazon, Ulta, and Alibaba (BABA), which have P/E ratios of 71.36, 29.3, and 20.5 respectively. The reason for this I believe is the fact that eBay has not ventured out of its e-commerce universe. Amazon has diversified its portfolio to include devices (Amazon Echo), cloud (Amazon Web Services), and Music among others. Alibaba on the other hand has invested in cloud (Alibaba Cloud), payments (Alipay), film, and social media (Sina Weibo).Concerns about eBay’s growth are valid considering that it makes its money from its marketplace and ticketing services. It does not have significant revenue outside of the two. This is compounded by the fact that the company is not hot anymore. As mentioned in the introduction, very few people talk about eBay these days. A recent report by Piper Jaffrey (PJC) showed that only 2% of teens shopped at eBay compared to 40% at Amazon. There are also concerns about increased competition from the likes of Wal-Mart (WMT) and Amazon, which have more resources than eBay.However, I believe eBay can overcome these challenges. First, eBay has more room to grow in the international market. In the past, eBay has made several strategic investments internationally. Investments like MELI have returned huge returns in the company. They have also contributed to eBay’s growth in the international market. As mentioned, 59% of eBay’s revenues come from the international market.In 2016, revenues in the U.S. grew by 3% compared to 7% in the international markets. Learning from its past failings in China, eBay has returned to the country by partnering with Ningbo. Adam Minter of Bloomberg notes that the new arrangement will help eBay compete with the likes of Wish, the popular e-commerce app. As global commerce continues to grow, eBay will benefit with its presence in the manufacturing hub of China.Second, I believe that eBay can win the hearts of the younger demographic again. In online shopping, young people want four things: price, security, variety, and shipping. They want the low-priced products shipped faster. eBay is in the process of fixing this. eBay has introduced Guaranteed Delivery, a service that simplifies the shipping process.This is a good start although it still does not match Amazon Prime, which bundles so many products together. Young people also want to shop using their mobile devices. Their impression of the mobile apps determines whether they will continue buying or not. Last year, eBay updated its apps across its devices leading to significant improvements in user reviews.Third, this year, eBay plans to increase its ad spending to reach out to the young people. In 2016, the company spent $2.3 billion in sales and marketing. This was a 4% increase from the previous year. This figure represented 23% of the company’s total net revenues. At this point, this is in the best interest of the company as it reaches out to the millennials. The percentage of marketing to net revenues is also slightly lower than that of other e-commerce companies.Finally, in 2016, eBay generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow. It returned $3 billion to investors through share repurchases. Also, the company has more than $7.5 billion in cash and short-term investments against total long-term debt of $7.5 billion. This means the company can continue making investments in strategic companies while continuing to return cash to investors through repurchases.In conclusion, as global e-commerce spending increases, eBay will benefit from these trends. Although a lot of emphasis has been put on Amazon, I believe eBay is another company that investors and the media should focus on. As demonstrated above, eBay has a number of avenues to achieve growth in the future. It is also impressive that the company continues to return excess cash to shareholders."
4058189,102436,2017-03-27T13:07:11-04:00,"eBay has immunity from political risks.A steady cash-flow company with a reasonable valuation and a probable acquisition target.Alibaba is the most likely company to acquire eBay, but this doesn't remove the possibility of other acquirers.","As a result of the current Healthcare debacle, and the probably-coming Tax Reform debacle, we feel more safe holding stocks which have a low dependence on the current political agenda and a reasonable valuation. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) provides this kind of safety. Besides having an attractive valuation, we believe that eBay is a compelling acquisition target, and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) would be the most likely acquirer (if any) .The stock is cheapeBay has the lowest valuation among tech giants. While it has the lowest growth rate, its business model provides a steady source of cash flow.eBay's P/CFO and P/FCF are nearly half that of Alibaba and Amazon. The lower the price to cash flow is, the safer the investment.Remember, we are not saying that eBay is undervalued with respect to the other 2 companies, since taking the huge difference in growth rates, it's obviously not. However, we are implying that the stock is cheap with respect to the steady cash flow the company generates.For example, taking a 3.5% long-term growth rate and a WACC of 9%, eBay's value would be around $43.5 billion, a 13% premium to current valuation (using a FCF of $2.651 billion after a $450 million adjustment due to taxes paid related the sale of MercadoLibre).Moving on the right trackIn the last few years, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) surpassed eBay significantly in attracting shoppers. The fast and free shipping offered to Amazon Prime users made those shoppers prefer Amazon over eBay. Actually, according to Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), Prime users now account for nearly 60% of Amazon's GMV. This means the fast and free shipping plays an important role in attracting revenues. Unfortunately, eBay figured that out late, however, better late than never. Last week, eBay announced that it will launch fast-free deliveries for millions of items, in addition to giving buyers (who paid for shipping) the ability to refund shipping funds in case the package arrives late.Moreover, the turnaround plan, which was announced by eBay's CEO last year, involves focusing on improving eBay's search results, another area where eBay lagged Amazon in.These steps, if implemented effectively, will attract more shoppers to eBay, which will increase eBay's revenues significantly, taking into consideration eBay's high take-rate of 7.7%.Immunity from political risksAnother reason for why we like eBay is its immunity from political risks. Healthcare, the expected Tax Reform, and the Regulation Reform debacles, will weigh down on policy correlated stocks. These stocks include companies that have a very high effective tax rates like most tech companies, and companies that demand a less regulatory environment to operate in like the Financials and E&P companies.Fortunately, eBay is immune from these risks. The company has a low effective tax rate (19% in 2015, and an adjusted 24% in 2016), and there is no single regulation that serves as a hurdle for the company's operations. This immunity means that eBay stock will outperform other policy correlated stocks in case of any political shake out.A possible acquisition targetAdded to all of that, we believe that eBay is a possible acquisition target by Alibaba (BABA). While it's true that Jack Ma denied having any intention to acquire the company two years ago, eBay still serves as the only possible gate for Alibaba to enter Europe and the US effectively, and in the cheapest way possible. Here's why.Weak international segment for AlibabaAlibaba's 2016 retail international segment is still at its early stages with $353 million in revenues. That amount is low considering Alibaba's $270-billion valuation. Thus, Alibaba needs to make a major acquisition in order to grow its international segment in a way that suits the company's valuation.Buyers in Europe and North America are the highest spenders on e-commerce.But, these spenders avoid buying from Chinese companies due to the high fraud rate on Chinese sites compared to North American sites. The difference in cultures is also a problem for Alibaba. Thus, the only way for Alibaba to grow in the developed world markets is through acquisitions.And eBay is one of the most respected platforms globally.(source: eBay 10-k 2016)By buying eBay, Alibaba adds $9 billion to its international revenues, a number that it needs 5 years to reach, assuming it doubles its revenues every year.Currency riskAlibaba is listed on the NYSE, thus it reports its financial statements in the US dollar. However, the vast majority of its operations are in the Asian markets, which exposes Alibaba to a major currency fluctuation risks, especially when considering that Asian currencies are the most to get hit from higher interest rates in the US.By buying eBay, Alibaba will be able to somehow balance this risk.Same business model and Alibaba's financial abilityeBay and Alibaba have the same business model. This makes it easier for Alibaba to apply its successful experience in attracting more buyers to the platform. In addition, the recent move by eBay to depend on its own advertising efforts, and not on 3rd party advertisers, means it's getting closer to Alibaba's Taobao business model. Thus, Alibaba can apply its huge experience in the advertising business to help eBay succeed.Also, eBay's take-rate is 7.7%, which is nearly 2.5x that of Alibaba. This means that if Alibaba succeeds in increasing eBay's GMV, the revenues would increase substantially.E-commerce expansion is based on acquisitionsThe only way for huge e-commerce companies to expand in an effective way globally is to acquire other companies. That's why Alibaba acquired Lazada, a Southeast Asian e-commerce platform, which also bought Singapore's online grocer RedMart. Also, last week Amazon bought Souq.com, a Dubai-based e-commerce platform, for nearly $800 million.And for Alibaba to compete in the US without acquisitions, it needs to compete with Amazon, eBay, and Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) Jet.com, which makes it very hard for the company to succeed. Alibaba needs to acquire one of those platforms in order to move the needle for the $270 billion company.Last but not least, if Alibaba bought eBay for $50 billion (30% premium) through a combination of stock and debt (let's say a 50-50 split), eBay's adjusted FCF of $2.651 will be sufficient to pay for the vast majority of the assumed debt.If Alibaba offers a deal, will Trump prevent this deal from happening?It is well known that President Trump is anti-Chinese, and will see such a deal as a threat to America's corporate heritage. However, the president seems to have a good relation with Jack Ma, who was one of the firsts to visit President Trump and congratulate him on his victory. He also promised the president to create 1 million US jobs. And we all know, there is no better music to Trump's ears than a jobs creation promise. Add to all of that, Jack Ma's Ant Financial, a Chinese payment company, is acquiring the US payment transfer mogul MoneyGram International (NASDAQ:MGI) for $880 million. If approved by regulators, Jack Ma will be ensured that a deal with eBay will likely be passed by US regulators.ConclusionEventually, Alibaba will enter Europe and the US. And entering these markets under the ""Alibaba"" brand name is risky. The brand name is not preferred by American and European customers, and it's facing growing pressures from American trade officials as a result of the high number of counterfeited goods.Buying eBay is the easiest way for Alibaba to enter those markets that Alibaba needs. After all, this is where the real money lies. The Asian market is nowhere near the US and European markets in terms of profitability. For example, take a look at the difference between Alibaba and Amazon in terms of GMV/EBITDA over the years.To generate $1 in EBITDA, Alibaba needs 2.8x more GMV than Amazon. And that was the case even before AWS became profitable. In addition, US customers spend nearly 2x that of their Chinese counterparts (that can be seen in our chart above) on shopping online. This means that entering the US and European markets will provide Alibaba with a major source of revenues and profits, which will increase the company's valuation significantly.Alibaba should have acquired eBay in mid-2015, when eBay's EV was nearly 25% less. Will Alibaba make the same mistake again and miss the bus? We'll see. But for now, we are holding a stock with high cash flow yield, immunity from political risks, huge buyback program, and a high gross margin (77.5% for eBay vs. 64% for Alibaba).Happy investing to All."
4045549,58721,2017-02-13T19:19:51-05:00,eBay discloses a material weakness in internal controls related to tax accounting - its second tax-related deficiency in three years.The market reaction so far has been muted.Tax deficiencies are the second most common cause of ineffective internal controls.,"Last week on February 6, in its Fiscal 2016 10-K, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) disclosed a material weakness in its Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (""ICFR""). The deficiency related to a failure to properly apply tax accounting, and affected the Deferred Tax Asset and Income Tax Benefit accounts.As we reported in a recent study, tax deficiencies were the second most common accounting issue to cause ineffective ICFR reports. Among companies that are required to have an auditor inspect their internal controls, 36 reports (17.82% of all ineffective attestations) cited tax accounting as one of the reasons for ineffectiveness.Interestingly, there was very little market reaction to eBay's disclosure. One possible explanation is that the control deficiency affected only a relatively narrow area of accounting. A clear remediation plan discussed in Item 9A of the 10-K might also have reduced the impact of the ineffective controls on eBay's stock price.We normally think about accounting-related weaknesses in the context of financial restatements. Yet, Auditing Standard No. 5 states that ""the severity of a deficiency does not depend on whether a misstatement actually has occurred but rather on whether there is a reasonable possibility that the company's controls will fail to prevent or detect a misstatement."" (par. 64) eBay did not identify any significant errors, but did note that the deficiency resulted in an adjustment during the period-end close process.Could the opposite also be true? In other words, would an accounting error always trigger a non-effective attestation report? Well, not necessarily. In February 2015, the company had to adjust previously reported Q4 2014 and full-year earnings to correct an $88 million tax error.In April 2015, the SEC issued a comment letter to eBay, requesting additional information about the materiality of the error and its impact on ICFR. In response, the company confirmed that the error was identified by the auditor during the period-end closing process, and that the error was caused by an immaterial control deficiency:After additional analysis, the company concluded that the deficiency did not rise to the level of a material weakness, and therefore, its Internal Controls over Financial Reporting were effective.In response to a follow-up letter from the SEC, eBay provided additional details about the specific controls that failed in this circumstance, further described its planned remediation efforts, and concluded that no additional disclosure would be required, since expected improvements to controls are unlikely to have a material impact on internal controls.Based on the analysis provided by eBay, the proposed disclosure (or rather, the lack thereof) is aligned with regulatory requirements. The AS 5 requirement to disclose control issues extends only to deficiencies that rise to the level of a material weakness, and only changes in internal controls that are likely to have a material impact on ICFR need to be disclosed in Item 9A.The remediation efforts needed to rectify material weakness identified in February 2017 appear to be more significant:Interestingly, we saw a very similar scenario last September, when Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) disclosed a material weakness in lease accounting. Similar to eBay, in 2014, it discovered a control deficiency and recorded an immaterial error correction. Wal-Mart also received a subsequent SEC comment letter requesting the retailer to provide an SAB 99 materiality analysis and clarify the impact of the errors on ICFR. Subsequently, in September 2016, Wal-Mart identified a material weakness in ICFR related to lease accounting.To summarize, eBay's tax control deficiencies appear to be unrelated to each other. In 2014, the deficiency was related to controls over valuation allowance, while the 2017 weakness is related to intercompany accounting. None of the errors affected previously filed financial statements. Still, adjustments were required in both cases. Just another example of why investors should pay close attention to even immaterial adjustments and control deficiencies."
4044935,33291,2017-02-10T13:45:01-05:00,I have opined this name is a trading vehicle but a lousy investment.Q4 earnings are out.Momentum is there but wait for the timing.,"It has been well over a year since I initiated coverage eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY). As I told you in the past I used the site to sell a ton of old sports cards and memorabilia, as well as some random items including printer cartridges, video games, unopened posters and more. PayPal, its once subsidiary has now been separated into its own standalone company. As a stock, to me, it's never been reliable as an investment, however, you can always cherry pick a time frame to argue against this assessment. I personally view it as a trading vehicle. That said, when I last reiterated how much of a trading vehicle this was the stock proceeded to drop 12-13%, only to rebound to new 52 week highs, all in a matter of a few months. Hence the trading power. From a longer-term investing perspective, the stock has mostly traded sideways since I opened coverage. But now the name seems to have momentum following just reported earnings. In short, you make quick profits in this one, when timed properly.There was nothing overly impressive about the quarter although the company did deliver better than anticipated results in some areas, while mostly meeting analyst estimates for performance. eBay's fourth quarter revenue increased 3.4% year-over-year to $2.4 billion, and this essentially matched estimates. GAAP earnings came in at $5.9 billion or $5.31 per share. Whoa. That is way higher than normal right? Yes, but this is driven by a $4.6 billion income tax benefit and an $800 million dollar gain from the sale of its equity position in MercadoLibre. If we look at adjusted earnings we see these rolled in at $601 million, or $0.54 per share. This is up nicely year-over-year and was another record for the company.Of course the headlines only tell us so much. I think a good place to check the health of the company is eBay's gross merchandise volume. This metric saw growth on a constant dollar basis. If we exclude the negative impact of currency related issues which are plaguing all domestic companies, the gross merchandise volume increased 5% year-over-year. Of course absolute year-over-year comparisons are complicated because foreign currency movements continued to have a negative effect, impacting the revenue growth rate of the eBay Marketplaces and of course StubHub.One place of year-over-year disappointment was the operating margin. Operating margin dropped precipitously to 26.6% versus 28.5% last year. However, this is a rise from last quarter's 24.4%. Another negative was taxes which came in at 24.4% versus 23.8% last year (this excludes the $4.6 billion benefit I mentioned above boosting GAAP earnings). They were also up from last quarter. Cash flow was higher, coming in at $620 million of operating cash flow and $484 million in free cash flow. What is important to also point out, and this is good for long-term investors, the company bought back $1 billion in stock or 34.6 million shares in the quarter. David Wenig, President and CEO of eBay said:The stock is getting a bit of momentum as the outlook was rather positive. For 2017, the company expects net revenue between $9.3 billion and $9.5 billion, representing constant dollar growth of 6% to 8%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations is expected to ring in at $1.98 to $2.03. This is rather strong growth from the adjusted earnings of $1.88, although the price of the stock from a multiple perspective appears fairly valued relative to most standard retailers. That said, I still prefer you to trade this one. Let the stock fall back then do some buying. This one is good for 5-10% swings up and down quite frequently.Note from the author: Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

4040275,20521,2017-01-27T15:59:20-05:00,eBay finally appears to be taking a turn for the better.But its outlook still continued to disappoint the market.Potential moves are expected to help eBay beat some of the rising competition from the likes of Facebook and Alphabet.,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) finally appears to be taking a turn for the better. Not only did eBay deliver better-than-expected results during the holiday quarter, it also improved some of its operational metrics. But its outlook still continued to disappoint the market.FinancialsQ4 revenues grew 3% over the year to $2.59 billion, ahead of the Street's expectations of $2.4 billion. EPS of $0.54 was also ahead of the market's forecast of $0.53 for the quarter.During the quarter, eBay added 2 million active buyers across its platforms, ending the year with 167 million global active buyers. The Marketplace segment saw $21.1 billion in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) of goods sold to deliver $1.9 billion of revenues. Marketplace revenues grew 4% on an Fx neutral basis. StubHub also saw a strong quarter with GMV growing 5% to $1.2 billion and revenues increasing 20% to $279 million. The Classifieds segment reported revenues of $201 million, growing 13% over the year on a constant-currency basis.eBay ended the year with revenues growing 5% to $8.98 billion and EPS growing 3% to $1.88.For the current quarter, eBay forecast revenues of $2.17-2.21 billion with an EPS of $0.46-0.48. The Street was looking for revenues of $2.2 billion for the quarter with an EPS of $0.50. eBay expects to end the current year with revenues of $9.3-9.5 billion with an EPS of $1.98-2.03. The Street was looking for revenues of $9.36 billion and EPS of $2.07.InitiativesDuring the quarter, eBay benefited from several initiatives across its platforms. Mobile within Marketplace is beginning to become a big contributor. For the first time ever, sales on mobile platform crossed the $10 billion GMV milestone. It continues to expand inventory and leverage other businesses for its growth. Recently it integrated inventory for Marketplace with Gumtree in the United Kingdom and eBay Kleinanzeigen in Germany. eBay had bought Gumtree, a UK-based Classifieds website back in 2005, and Kleinanzeigen, a German classified site, in 2015.Additionally, to drive sales of higher value products, eBay recently launched Authenticate. eBay Authenticate is a program that will leverage a network of professional authenticators to ensure that customers get what they are expecting from a sale for higher priced products. The service will add to the confidence level of buyers shopping through eBay for the high-end inventory. The program will allow both sellers and buyers to opt in to its service. For a fee, on sale of an item, the authenticators will inspect the product before shipping it to the buyer. The program is being launched for high-end fashion products initially and, if successful, will be expanded to other categories.eBay can take a few lessons from Auctionata on this topic. In 2014, I had met with Auctionata's founder Alexander Zacke, who has built an online art auction house that is supported by art experts who evaluate art for sale on the website. Users are able to upload the image of the piece of art that they would like to have evaluated along with some basic information. Its talent pool of experts charges a fixed fee for the valuation and provides it to the requester.The moves are expected to help eBay beat some of the rising competition from the likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Facebook’s forays into e-commerce are expanding as it allows users to order food, movie tickets, get quotes from local businesses, and make appointments.eBay's stock is currently trading at $31.74 with a market capitalization of $35.8 billion. It touched 52-week high of $33.19 in September last year and had fallen to a low of $21.52 in February a year ago.Photo Credit: Mike Knell/Flickr.com"
4040274,91145,2017-01-27T15:55:25-05:00,"eBay continues its structured data initiative at a steady pace.Although growth is healthy, a faster pace is required.Acquisitions are an option, but the question is in what field and what size.","It's already some time ago that eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) started its structured data initiative (June 2015). After the Q3-2016 earnings release, I outlined that investors should be a bit more patient with expecting a pick-up in growth rates. Now that the e-retailer published its fourth-quarter (Q4) and full-year (FY) 2016 figures, we can conclude that the company shows some progress, but a more aggressive growth tactic (i.e. acquisitions) appears as an option.The journey to higher growth rates is certainly not a brisk-paced walk in the park. This is illustrated by the key metric sold items growth. As indicated previously, this metric is our main indicator to see if eBay is on track with its journey. During the fourth quarter, the growth rate stagnated at 5% YoY. Although a tad disappointing, luckily eBay didn't slip back, and we got a guidance that leads to believe that sold items growth may indeed stay healthy.In the accompanying financial highlights during the Q4/FY2016 earnings call, the company guides an organic FX-neutral revenue growth of 6-8% in 2017. Total revenue should reach $9.3-9.5 billion. This is actually in line with analyst estimates, where the range is $9.1-9.6bn with consensus at $9.36bn.To be fair, these numbers are hardly convincing, which leads us to say that eBay's journey is hitting a roadblock. eBay is aware of this. As the company's CEO, Devin Wenig, stated in the earnings call:Nevertheless, there are signs that the journey is progressing. Obviously, the most important number is how many pages are processed within the structured data initiative. This number rose to 55% from 48%, and the total page count jumped to 180 million in Q4. Per CEO Wenig, these pages take an increasing share in traffic, underlining that eBay is on the right track with its initiative.But since the company isn't being aggressive with its initiative, more is needed if it doesn't want to lose its position in the market. Competition doesn't stand still either. Mobile traffic is key, and the company seems to have overcome its earlier problems and can show reaccelerating mobile growth. In the earnings call, eBay's management stated that marketplace mobile growth accelerated 3 points. It also stated that app reviews for its newest version ""are the highest ever"". However, reviews for its non-US Classifieds apps are far less flattering. For example, users of the Marktplaats application complain that they can't find many of the listings. So, there's still work to do to improve the customer experience at a company-wide level.Improving customer experience is also key to keep buyers inside eBay's marketplace. An interesting development is eBay's shift from third-party ads to first-party ads. These internal ads from eBay sellers keep users browsing within the marketplace, and CFO Scott Schenkel sees it as a great new stream of monetization. In 2017, there should be a big shift in this direction and first-party ads should bring acceleration in advertising growth.A key factor that drives investors into eBay is its excellent reputation of generating cash flows and its willingness to return this to its shareholders. The company generated another $484m free cash flow in Q4, which was even negatively impacted by a $272 tax paid from the sale of its MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) stake. Overall, eBay generated $2.2bn free cash flow in 2016. The company currently holds a net cash position of $2.0bn. For now, it intends to return cash flow to shareholders through buybacks. Actually $1.3bn in buybacks are currently pending. But between the lines of the earnings call, the company seems to be far more willing to spend money on acquisitions than it was in the past. In the previous call, there was a much more cautious tone.Some commentators, such as Shelly Banjo on Bloomberg, believe it is time for a significant acquisition. Ms. Banjo thinks of a takeover of Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY), Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) or Wayfair (NYSE:W) would be successful. I don't think this is what eBay is looking for, although I agree with Ms. Banjo that there might be a fit with Wayfair. It seems to me that the company is far more dedicated to complete its structured data initiative and create a flywheel for organic growth of its current activities. Modest acquisitions that could further enhance growth of its StubHub and Classifieds platform sound more plausible at the moment.Investment through acquisition to enhance customer experience is another possibility, and although Shopify could fill that bill, with a current market cap of $4.6bn, this would be a tough pill to swallow. Also, the recently announced deepening relationship between Shopify and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) makes an eBay takeover less likely. However, the fact that CEO Wenig underlined the importance of AI and that ""VR and AR are not a toy"", an acquisition in the field of virtual or augmented reality wouldn't be surprising. Nevertheless, with many eyes on this type of players, the question arises if there are any financially attractive targets from a prudent investment point of view.In conclusion, investors can be assured that eBay is on the right track with its restructuring process. Once again, the e-retailer showed that it's great value for many, considering its current undervaluation compared to peers (see table below).An interesting takeaway is that there seems to be more willingness to look at acquisitions to bolster growth. The e-retailer looks for faster expansion, but doesn't want to force its restructuring journey. That makes buying growth an option to look at. But without an upward bending of the sold items growth in the next few quarters, investors may not be content."

4062060,22675,2017-04-12T14:49:20-04:00,,"While looking at different pieces of news about the stocks that I follow, I ended up on this piece of analysis done by Barclays where Ross Sandler explains that he expects 2017 to be a turnaround year for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Really? I had strong doubts but I did decide to do additional research. He blames EBAY’s struggles on 2 main reasons:- Losing market share to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).- Customer security concerns following a 2014 data breach.He also explains that EBAY is better positioned now that it puts more focus on fixed pricing sales and also compares the struggle to what Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) experienced when they made significant technology models. Finally, they also declare Stubhub to be a significant source of revenue with potential contributions of up to $1B in 2018.Data Breach Impact Is OverblownI personally consider the 2014 breach impact to be overblown at this point. It did have an impact, of course, but I’d argue that many others have had similar issues and that it’s been over 2 years. Customers that are still not comfortable with EBAY will likely not become so anytime soon. I personally don’t buy it.It’s All About AmazonThe other main point, Amazon is the overwhelming factor that will determine EBAY’s success in my opinion. As I wrote in my most recent piece about Amazon, I am a skeptical that EBAY even has a shot at competing. Yes, the ecommerce pie is growing quickly but so is Amazon’s share of that pie. Why? Because its business model is unlike any other competitor.One benefit that EBAY has compared to Amazon is that given its business model is based off of being a true middle man. When EBAY clients buy items, they end up paying the seller and receiving the item directly from the seller. That means EBAY has very little true fixed costs. EBAY collects a fee from the seller, and if the volume increases 5-10% or much more, EBAY will collect that much more.The downside though is that EBAY has much smaller control on the overall customer experience. A big part of that is shipping, of course, and that makes a world of difference. Take a look at this chart of where consumers now start their shopping searches:Amazon is increasingly dominant and that is because not only does it have incredible customer service but its shipping service is heads and shoulders above everyone else. As eBay announced it was working on getting guaranteed 3-day delivery on 20 million of its items, Amazon continues to work on expanding its same day and even 1-hour delivery. They’re obviously operating at completely different speeds and that makes a world of difference for customers.Another critical space where Amazon is gaining an advantage is through its Prime service, one of its booming sources of revenues. Yes, Amazon is incurring costs for the services it offers to those customers such as cloud storage and video offerings. That being said, it is also a big part of the reason why tens of millions of the more valuable consumers shop with Amazon as a default.All of that market share is adding up in terms of overall shipping costs but it's helping Amazon get closer to its customers through new warehouses, scale in operating its own fleet of planes and freight ships and will in theory mean that its shipping costs/unit should decline over time as it gains more scale.eBay on the other hand does not have such ambitions or plans to get there. The other benefit of course is gaining leverage over suppliers in trying to dictate terms and products offered but also gaining more data than anyone else about its customers to offer a more tailored experience when they do visit the website.eBay Can Survive But Not ThriveIn the end, my opinion is that while eBay will obviously continue to exist and will do well with some segments such as Stubhub, I do expect the company to continue losing ecommerce market share for the foreseeable future as will be the case for most of Amazon’s competitors given the current positioning. That makes eBay a tough buy at these levels.Disclaimer: Currently hold a short position on EBAY"
4020645,20262,2016-11-07T15:19:46-05:00,"eBay was a cool, very cool, first-generation internet retailer.For the current era, however, it seems a bit primitive.The main issue lies in the difference between ""unstructured"" vs. ""structured"" data.eBay is in the process of converting to the good, ""structured,"" approach.Expect better results from the company as the impact of the transition takes hold.","This is a reprint of a post that initially appeared on Forbes.comI'm bullish on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) pretty much for the same reasons why I published Sell recommendations on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in recent days. It's all about the combination of growth and sentiment, and the Street's tendency to mess up quite often when it comes to this approach.The Logic Behind My PositionI believe objective rules-based strategies are far superior overall to seat-of-the-pants genius. This approach will periodically steer me wrong on individual stocks, but my long experience shows that it points me in the right direction far more often than not, and that even where it does go wrong, it tends to do so in ways other than what I anticipate at times when I try to second-guess the model. So like my recent Sell recommendations for AMZN and FB, this Buy recommendation on EBAY is based on probabilities.The probabilities in both instances involve the investment community's tendency to make a mess of things when it gets particularly bullish on shares of rapidly growing companies, so much so, that it can pay to simply bet naively on the Street's ability to misjudge growth stocks. Hence, my bearish stances on AMZN and FB. Switching gears, the Buy screen that now calls EBAY to my attention was created as a flip-side version of my earlier Sell screen. I'm now looking for situations in which the Street is likely to also miss the boat when dealing with companies that have had some struggles, as has been the case with EBAY. The model is further described below, after the discussion of EBAY.A Bullish Case for eBayEBAY has not been hot lately. In May 2014, it was plagued by a security breach - a sadly not unique experience in the online world and one that casts dark clouds over businesses for a long time. And on top of that, the online flea-market aura it has traditionally had, while cool in the early days of the internet, when the thrill of doing anything online predominated, is not so wonderful in this generation, where e-activities are taken for granted and users are more interested in finding what they want to find and doing what they want to do without pausing to experience a sense of circa 2000 newbie amazement. That Amazon.com has been getting bigger and better in EBAY's e-commerce neighborhood all along doesn't help. And as if that were weren't enough, the major search engines, in their quest to continue to provide users with the most relevant search results possible, upgraded their algorithms in ways that wound up giving less prominent placement to eBay's old-school presentations.We must, however, maintain some perspective. It's not as if the company is in trouble.With 2014 in the rear-view mirror, along with that year's big deficit-producing write-off, the company's return on assets over the trailing 12 months was 9.58% versus a 4.84% S&P 500 median. The company has a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.32, versus an S&P 500 median of 0.84. But it can well afford its borrowings, as indicated by its 10.35 interest coverage ratio (versus 7.74 for the S&P 500). Also, EBAY's high return on equity, 27.95% versus 14.28% for the S&P 500, suggests the debt is being deployed productively.The problem, so to speak, is that good, or even very good, isn't good enough when investors have been expecting more. And when a company is seen as being in a business similar to that of a firm like Amazon.com, which has been on a tear, investors expect a lot. Sales growth rates that may be more in line with what we think of as struggling brick and mortar (3.64% in the trailing 12 months and a minus 1.26% rate over the past five years, and even the improved 5.62% rate of the latest quarter) absolutely does not cut it for a company like eBay. The P/E ratio is OK at 13.67 times estimated results for the next fiscal year (versus 16.62 for the S&P 500). But the price/sales ratio, 3.65 versus 2.31 for the S&P 500, raises too many eyebrows.With bullish cases like what I've shown to this point, who needs bears!Actually, the lackluster results can make for a bullish case given the way the Street tends to extrapolate recent trends into the indefinite future, and given that such assumptions often turn out to be incorrect. In last week's Sell article, we saw tendencies to over-rate future prospects for hot growth companies. Now, we're dealing with tendencies to under-rate prospects for companies that have hit rough patches. This contrarian type of investment case could be less likely to succeed if company fundamentals were weak. But as noted above, that's not so with EBAY.We have good reason to expect substantial improvement in sales growth going forward, if not in the next quarter or two, at least down the road. The key here is the company's ongoing ""structured data"" initiative. To get a sense of what this is all about, imagine an index card containing the following information:John Doe1234 First AvenueSomeplace, USA 11111999-111-4444That's all on one card. It's fine if you're content to file everything in one place, alphabetically under ""D"" for example, and let those who need to find it shuffle from one card to the next until they do. This is an example of what we refer to nowadays as ""unstructured data."" With this setup, we'd be able to look up John Doe and find all the information we have on him. But we would not be able to look up folks living in zip code 1111 and find John Doe. Nor could see him on a list of all people named John living in Someplace. Unstructured data is limited in terms of what we can get from it.This is pretty much how the traditional eBay offering was posted. A seller would type in a bunch of information on the electronic equivalent of an index card. That's why finding things for sale on eBay had such a hit-and-miss quality. It was fine for the early days of internet, when folks were dazzled by the concepts of anything and everything about life online. And let's face it; what eBay had even on day one was a heck of a lot better than index cardsWe've come a long way since then. Electronic index cards simply don't cut it anymore. Buyers don't have the patience to scroll through them. And even worse, when an item is sold, the record is killed, thus reducing the number of available records involving eBay offerings of products in that category, which has the impact of making eBay listings look less important to major search-engine algorithms, thus causing them to decline in positioning.Enter structured data. Now, imagine a whole bunch of separate index cards like this:Phew. That's a mouthful. Seems like a lot of trouble relative to index cards. But it's worth the effort and is increasingly becoming the way things are done nowadays. That's because we can do so much more with this sort of thing. Now, for example, we can create a presentation for zip code 1111 and list, in alphabetical order by last name, everybody who lives there, and drill down to find more on each person.This is huge for eBay. Now, for example, the company can organize all its offerings, create product pages, enable users to see offerings under each product presented various ways; by user rating, by user review, by price, in the context of feature comparisons, etc. And since the sale of a single item doesn't kill the product page, it's easier for it to accumulate the sort of visitation and web ""authority"" that search-engine algorithms cherish.(NOTE to readers who are database or SEO professionals: Please don't laugh. I'm trying.)This is nothing new. You've seen it before in many contexts, including major e-commerce sites. That eBay is implementing it does not put it ahead of the curve. Instead, the implementation enables eBay to remove a major drawback. It's not a compliment that the company is finally doing it now, at long last. But it is an investment issue; specifically, a reason to expect sales and profits to advance much more quickly as the project is completed.The bad news is that this sort of thing takes a long time. Just compare the simple unstructured John Doe record with the much fancier structured version, and consider how much had to be done to get from the former to the latter. Now imagine what it takes to program all that with a major e-commerce database, and then do things that make use of the new database.The good news is that eBay is marching steadily forward. At the end of the third quarter, 48% of its offerings had become structured and the company is already creating new pages with what it has so far. At present, though, only a small portion of it is visible to users.Some might be discouraged by CEO Devin Wenig's latest conference call comments to the effect that ""while we're moving at an urgent pace, you can expect us to take an intelligent approach to this transition to ensure that we don't disrupt our customers along the way."" That's not likely to please the ""I want it yesterday"" sentiments of many in the investment community. But my time in the dot-com world, including a several-year stint at Reuters during the time when Wenig was COO there, I know enough to take the phrase ""disrupt our customers along the way"" very, very seriously. So shareholders should be rooting for eBay to do it right, rather than too-fast.There are other things going on at eBay. For example, it's been working on its mobile app, and it has Stub Hub. Ultimately, though, I see the eventual fruits of the structured data initiative as the most likely catalyst for the sort of returns that can make the stock worth buying, or at least worthwhile for those who don't use stocks as betting chips on whether the company will meet, beat or miss the next quarter's guidance.And now, for those who are interested, what follow is more on the model I used.The Semi-Contrarian Buy ModelThe Buy model I created using Portfolio123 that I'm using here is not an exact mirror image of last week's Sell screen. It would be more accurate to describe it as something that leans generally in the opposite direction. Here are its features:Testing this Buy ScreenFigure 1 shows the result of a conventional 10-year backtest of the screen.Figure 1Rolling backtests (which examine a lot of independent 3-month holding periods each of which begins on successive Mondays) show that like the Sell screen, this is a better model for up markets. But the balance between up-market versus down-market performance is far superior to what we saw last time for the Sell screen.Table 1: Last 10 YearsTable 2: Last YearObviously, anybody would prefer a model that suggested above-market performance under all conditions. But in real life, that can be easier said than done. In this case, what we're looking for is a potentially decent tradeoff between what we might expect in up markets versus down periods, and the screen that produced EBAY, while it can't assure anything about the future, is at least aligning probabilities in a desirable manner."
4014120,91145,2016-10-24T02:44:48-04:00,"The market seems to have lost patience with eBay and its structured data initiative.However, investors should realize that comparable transitions at other companies took at least 18-24 months before results were visible.For those who stick with eBay, current price level offers a great value for money.","A lot has been said about the recent earnings release and guidance by eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY). In case you've missed it, here's a short recap. Bottom line is that investors' hope for a swift progress in eBay's transformation process was shot down. We all saw the consequences by the sharp 10%+ drop in its share price. But investors shouldn't be too quick in giving up on the stock. There are a couple of good reasons to remain patient.1. Effects of transformation process may finally be loomingBack in June 2015, eBay entered the transformation process, called the structured data initiative. That's quite a while ago, and although CEO Devin Wenig repeatedly said that it will be a ""long, steady march,"" investors are desperately waiting for the results of this process. Reporting in-line earnings and a somewhat cautious guidance for Q4 gives the impression that eBay is far from there, or even that the initiative is less rewarding than initially thought.That's a premature conclusion. As analysts at Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) noted, online companies that underwent a drastic transformation needed over 18-24 months before a turnaround really started to kick in. MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) are used as examples, and if we compare the durations, it becomes clear that there isn't an indication that eBay is off track. On the contrary, the online retailer should be very close to the moment that the effects of the transformation become visible. That is, in the next few quarters, eBay should deliver a meaningful pick-up in growth rates.Truth be told, eBay has a long way to go in the transformation process. As at the end of Q3, structured data listings stood at 48% of relevant live listings. And although the expected range of 2-5% revenue growth for 2016 has increased to 6-7%, this is still well behind growth rates for rival Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). In fact, analysts don't seem to believe eBay is able to achieve much higher growth rates, as the table below shows.Having said that, the recent sell-off offers an opportunity for investors who do believe eBay can achieve much higher growth rates once the structured data initiative is completed. After all, the transformation process is initiated to drastically improve its business in multiple fields. The user experience should improve, especially by means of better on-site navigation. Transforming the business with machine-readable code means much more possibilities for data processing. That leads to better recommendations and a more sophisticated user experience. It should offer more and better data analysis options for sellers. Also, traffic from organic searches will improve. Currently, eBay listings are often on the second or third page. I tried finding a golf trolley and found an eBay listing no sooner than at the top of the third page. On the other end, eBay is often the top 3-listing when searching for used products.On the topic of improving user experience, eBay struggled in the past with its mobile app. Version 4.0 of late 2015 killed a lot of growth. Version 5.0, released in May was much better received and mobile growth picked up in Q2, but unfortunately the company didn't provide numbers for Q3. A few percent less than 50% of total GMV (gross merchandise value) comes from mobile, so a well appreciated mobile app is key in driving GMV higher.In my opinion, the user experience when browsing eBay on a desktop has much improved. I've always avoided eBay due to its outdated look, but the recent more product-centric approach feels much more comfortable when shopping. I shop regularly on Amazon, but for long-tail goods, eBay still seems (or better said: is again) the best option. The addition of eBay Collective, that brings a selection of unique furniture, décor and art, underlines this aspect. Although the concept rivals with Wayfair (NYSE:W), it seems a natural category for eBay. However, I personally experienced problems finding Collective through the eBay search (but not via Google Search), indicating that eBay has plenty of issues to solve…2. Great value for moneyAn optimist would say: issues to solve means that there's potential left. Certainly after the recent drop in share price, one could be tempted to refresh the risk/reward profile. Well, even without vast amounts of potential, at current prices eBay looks good value for money. A couple of days ago, contributor Nigel Kelly wrote a great article pointing to the steady cash flows. This should ensure that eBay is able to return money to its shareholders. The company said that it continues to buy back $500m more in Q4 (same as in Q3). eBay sits on $10.2bn cash and management commented that it will not rush to spend vast amounts. Thus, it's not looking for acquisitions for the near term, but bring its business in better shape first.Next to great cash flows, with a 2017e price/earnings ratio of 13.9, eBay is by no means expensive. Compared to peers, it holds the lowest valuation.True, without PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) it misses a 'second' trick as Amazon with AWS, but compared to peers MercadoLibre and Wayfair, eBay is trading at a hefty discount. This holds as well for a comparison based on price to cash flow.ConclusionInvestors may have been a bit too premature in writing off eBay's structured data efforts. Comparable transformations at peers took a bit longer and were exceptionally rewarding. If eBay is able to deliver a bit better growth rates in the next quarters, it could beat most expectations. Therefore, its current share price offers great value for money."
4013374,80085,2016-10-20T08:19:14-04:00,eBay trades at a 25% discount.eBay Free Cashflows Yield should be 7% this year or $2.7B.eBay is returning nearly all of this FCF to shareholders via buybacks.eBay expects a further $1.5B in Q4 from its sale of Mercado Libre.eBay's market cap is about $35B.,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) results were out last night. Overall the results were solid and progressive.But shares were down 8% in After-Hours trading... Why?eBay shares have had a big run up this year. The shares traded at $25 for the first half of the year and then jumped nearly 30% to $32. The market became over optimistic on eBay's strategy. The company is currently trying to shape itself into a more ""Amazon-like"" market and sharpen up its online image but progress is very slow. The market obviously loves this story, particularly since eBay trades at good value on a fundamental basis and because eBay has a credible shot of living with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the online market space.But whilst the story and aspiration are great, evidence of execution is far less so. If you listen to the earnings call, there is lots of talk about small, incremental user testing of its new site using ""structured data"" but little of substance on a launch date and results of said tests. Managing change can be risky particularly when it involves changing well-established daily routines that buyers and sellers are fluent in. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.The impatient money has decided to book a great gain and leave the table but that doesn't mean they won't come back.eBay is Still Great ValueeBay trades at a discount to its market price. Prior to last night's news, I pegged eBay Free Cashflow (FCF) at $2.2B. Assuming a perpetual 3% growth rate and 8% discount rate I was getting a Discounted Cashflow Value of $42B. eBay has a solid balance sheet with Total Liabilities as of June 30th $4B more than Current Assets. My fair value estimate was $38B and the market cap was $36B. About a 5% discount. Not a wide enough margin of safety given my valuation is quite rough and ready.My obsession is Free Cashflow and eBay is delivering on this front. Q3 2016 FCF was up 34% to $617B on Q3 2015 Free Cashflow. Over Q1-Q3 of 2016 eBay has booked $1.7B in just 9 months. In Q4 2015, eBay booked nearly $1B in FCF and this seems likely to recur since eBay management guided that Q4 2016 Sales will be in the same range as Q4 2015. As such a very credible bet exists that eBay will hit FCF of $2.7B for 2016. My discounted cashflow estimate of $2.7B to grow perpetually at 3% on a hurdle rate of 8% is $51.5B.On the balance sheet side (my second obsession), Current Assets are again $4B in deficit to Total Liabilities.So my fair value estimate is $47.5B. Given eBay's closing market cap of $36B I believe the stock is 25-30% undervalued. I like this margin of safety. My valuation could well be wrong but at least it can afford to be 25-30% wrong. I like those odds.Rationalizing the eBay FCF resilienceMy valuation is very much built on sustainability of the Free Cashflows into the future and growing those Free Cashflows. I believe a DCF model is very appropriate for eBay because it has a massive moat. It is very difficult for competitors to emulate the eBay buyer-seller network. It has taken eBay nearly 2 decades of graft to get where it is. And an upstart would have to spend massive marketing on not just attracting buyers but also sellers. Creating a marketplace is not a normal business. You don't just spend marketing on attracting customers (or buyers) like normal businesses. You need to also attract the sellers to make the market place work.Some may point to Amazon as a potential disruptor to eBay, but Amazon has always been a competitor and this hasn't stopped eBay. I just cannot see what will disrupt eBay's FCF into the future. I believe its revenue base is very sticky and highly diversified.As a relative comparison, it's worth thinking about the Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) business which also has a big Free Cashflow yield. Intel had a big fall yesterday on its earnings but I had limited interest in buying. Intel is engaged in a continuous battle of ""creative destruction capex"" to keep relevant. eBay doesn't have that problem in my opinion. Its business will continue chugging out FCFs with very little capex. The Intel Capex to Operational Cashflow ratio is about 50%, whereas eBay's is about 25%. I'd need to see Intel fall further to buy it.Finally eBay's Free Cashflows are not going to be dramatically unhinged by a big move in interest rates, currencies or oil prices. Sure there will be some impact but it will be immaterial to the eBay business. The Free Cashflows of eBay are not a temporary mirage or subject to major cyclical volatility (in fact, I believe more people shop on eBay in a recession). Sure the market may get over or under excited from time to time about future prospects but just keep an eye to the cashflow to derive value.Other ConsiderationsIt's one thing having lots of FCF but not much use to the investor if the company doesn't return it to me or invest it better than I can. eBay is buying back stock at a massive rate. It has repurchased $2B worth of shares YTD. $2.5B worth of buyback seems reasonable for 2016. Looking at estimated FCF of $2.7B for 2016, we can see eBay is returning most of its Free Cashflow to shareholders. The buyback yield stands at a very respectable 7%.eBay has also signed an agreement to sell its stake in MercadoLibre (MELI ... the ""eBay"" of Latin America). Here's more from the earnings call on the sale:So investors can expect at least another $1.2B of cash in Q4 net of taxes. eBay will continue to hold a small residual stake in MercadoLibre but at the option of Mercado. The CEO made it clear that a dividend will not be initiated from this windfall.Given its history of success with Paypal, Mercado Libre, StubHub, Classifieds and its return of Free Cashflow to shareholders via buybacks, I believe eBay is an excellent partner to invest with and an excellent steward of capital.And let's not forget that if eBay can pull off its structured data strategy then there could be a lot of organic upside in the next year or two. If it doesn't so what. eBay will still generate lots of Free Cashflow. Downside is limited. This is the type of investment I like.ConclusionI have been following eBay for a while now and have been kicking myself that I didn't invest around Brexit time. The exercise of writing on Seeking Alpha about eBay has been a real pleasure for me because I now realize eBay is a far better prospect than I was giving it credit for. A rarity. I suspect I will open up a position soon. I love sustainable, high yielding FCF businesses like eBay. I am even more impressed by the high level of FCF return to shareholders. My only decision is do I wait for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) to report tonight. I am big fan of both these names too."
4014262,33291,2016-10-24T11:46:16-04:00,It has been over a year since I initiated coverage on eBay.Stock has traded up to sideways.Q3 earnings are out.Better to trade than invest this name.,"It has been over a year since I initiated coverage on a little company that I used to do a bit of business with called eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY). I used the site to sell a ton of old sports cards and memorabilia, as well as some random items including printer cartridges, video games, unopened posters and more. PayPal, its once subsidiary has now been separated into its own stand alone company. As a stock, to me, it's never been reliable as an investment, however, you can always cherry pick a time frame to argue against this assessment. I personally view it as a trading vehicle. That said, the stock has pulled back from its near 52 week high after reporting earnings. Still, the stock has mostly traded sideways since I opened coverage, reiterating my thesis that the name is a strong one to trade, but not the best investment at the time.When I last discussed the stock I thought it could move higher and surpass the $30 mark based on the momentum it was seeing. It did indeed but now we are back under this mark. The just reported quarter was decent, but not incredible by any means. eBay's third quarter revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $2.22 billion, and this beat analyst estimates by $30 million. GAAP earnings came in at $418 million or $0.36 per share while adjusted earnings rolled in at $509 million, or $0.45 per share. This is up nicely year-over-year and was a $0.01 bottom line beat. All in all, it was a solid quarter. But we need to dig a little deeper.I think a god place to check the health of the company is eBay's gross merchandise volume. This metric saw growth on an constant dollar basis. If we exclude the negative impact of currency related issues which are plaguing all domestic companies, the gross merchandise volume increased 5% year-over-year. Of course absolute year-over-year comparisons are complicated because foreign currency movements continued to have a negative effect, impacting the revenue growth rate of the eBay Marketplaces and of course StubHub.One place of year-over-year disappointment was the operating margin. Operating margin dropped precipitously to 24.4% versus 27.5% last year. However, this is a rise from last quarter's 23.8. Another negative was taxes which came in at 21.6% versus 18% last year. They were also up from the 18.2% last quarter. Cash flow was higher, coming in at $802 million of operating cash flow and $617 million in free cash flow. What is important to also point out, and this is good for long-term investors, the company bought back $500 million in stock or 16.5 million shares in the quarter. David Wenig, President and CEO of eBay said:So why is the stock getting slammed the last day or two? Well I think it had to do with guidance that was just so-so. Looking ahead, the company is growing steadily, though the stock is a touch pricey here, based current share price on current and future earnings in my opinion. For Q2 the company sees revenues of $2.36 to $2.41 billion. Adjusted earnings will be in the range of $0.52 to $0.54. Even with this pullback the stock is pricey. That said, I don't think it is necessarily grossly overvalued. Let it pull back more and then do some buying. You should make a good profit on a trade in the name so long as the company delivers or surpasses on its Q4 expectations, which are indeed underimpressive.Note from the author: Christopher F.

Will it happen again in Q3?Among the strategic imperatives on the EBAY site that interests some analysts is its structured-data initiative.The stock has been in a narrow trading range since late July, and volatility appears to be at a high level going into the earnings release.","Does the future of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) lie in its efforts to transform itself from a classified-ads platform to an online marketplace or in its ticket reseller subsidiary StubHub?Both divisions have been growing in the aftermath of EBAY's spinoff of powerhouse subsidiary PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), and analysts say they will be looking for more information on how the two are set up for the future when the company reports Q3 results after the bell Wednesday. EBAY reported double-digit revenue gains for StubHub in the previous quarter, as well as its best gain since 2014 in U.S. merchandise volume on the eBay platform.

Success in this initiative would speed up user buys and improve the shopping experience, as well as reduce the costs of stepping up traffic to the site. Might better structured data become a bigger revenue driver in 2017?Those questions and more may be answered when EBAY releases its Q3 earnings after the bell Wednesday and executives speak to analysts on a post-release conference call.Analysts reporting to Thomson Reuters are pegging year-over-year gains in per-share profit at $0.44, and top-line sales are expected to come in at $2.18 billion.Though the stock has been in a narrow trading range since late July, except for a brief rally up to a fresh peak in September, volatility appears to be at a high level going into the earnings release.

This is reflected in the stock price. The large spikes up and down indicate earnings releases.Fourth quarter 2015 results were particularly poorly received as the stock fell more than 15%. However, second quarter results this year were solid, and the company raised guidance for 2016 as a result. That shot the stock up by 25% post earnings. I believe the company's growth initiatives are finally starting to bear fruit, and the stock represents one of the few, true value Internet/e-commerce plays in the market today. Investors should be buyers of the stock at this level for a long-term hold. The rest of this article will defend my thesis.The PayPal SplitBefore the PayPal split, eBay's marketplace business under former CEO John Donahoe floundered. It relied heavily on search traffic for growth and misallocated resources toward dead-end projects like a same-day delivery service and the homepage lens project that was never very relevant or successful. The split with PayPal was necessary if eBay was to turn around the marketplace and grow at a much higher rate. The company also needed a great leader who could execute the turnaround.Fortunately, Mr. Donahoe and the board were good at identifying leadership talent within the company. Both eBay and PayPal got excellent CEOs to lead each independent company. Devin Wenig spent several years at eBay prior to taking over the CEO role post-PayPal split. He identified several areas of deficiency and went to work right away allocating resources to initiatives with the highest return on investment. The largest such program is the company's structured data initiative.In a nutshell, it will allow for better product discovery. In the past, eBay's listings were penalized in Google search results because listings are typically not static. When a product sells out, the listing is no longer relevant to a shopper. So Google punished eBay listings by putting them lower in the search results. Previously, eBay would complain about this but not make any real effort to address the problem.eBay's approach under Mr. Wenig is different. The company is in the midst of a multi-quarter effort to structure listings on its site by creating product pages. Instead of searching for a specific product and just getting listings that are difficult to sort through, there will now be product pages, like this one.eBay will highlight the best priced/most relevant items at the top. Users also can now submit reviews for products. Product pages are a tremendous improvement that will improve the shopping experience for customers. It also will eventually allow for better search engine marketing/optimization as Google's and Bing's algorithms start to reward eBay product pages with higher listings once these pages become established for two to three months.To date most of the improvements made under eBay's structured data initiative are not yet visible to consumers (mostly back-end work has been done so far). But more and more product pages will continue to roll out. On its Q2 earnings call, eBay noted that product pages convert to sales at 10% higher rates than the listings pages.Another aspect of the structured data initiative is better comparison shopping. I recently bought two windbreakers for my children on eBay. With sellers now entering stock-keeping units (SKUs) for each product, eBay can sort listings by brand, size, color, type and material. This is a vast improvement, and I was impressed with the relevant selection eBay was able to show me.While I was browsing specific items, the site suggested other potential options, similar to what you see below. I found the options to be highly relevant. They were the same type of jacket I was searching for as well as the same size and color that I wanted. This is a major improvement to the shopping experience for eBay users and will undoubtedly lead to higher sales conversions.These initiatives, accompanied by targeted marketing, are starting to bear fruit. While eBay's growth rate is still below the rate of e-commerce growth and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) in particular, it is showing signs of improvement.SourceHere is ChannelAdvisor's estimate of same store sales growth on the eBay marketplace in the U.S. It appears that growth bottomed in March and April of this year, with steady overall improvement through last month. ChannelAdvisor estimates that e-commerce is growing at 15% annually. eBay does not have a specific growth goal that it is targeting.The CEO has just said that the company wants to grow faster than it currently is. I take that to mean 8%-12% annually, which is a vast improvement from recent growth rates of 2%-4%.As a result of its structured data and machine learning initiatives to improve the shopping experience in the marketplace, I believe the company is planting the seeds for vastly improved growth. As I stated before, much of the improvements in listings made to-date are not yet visible to the customer.Growth improved in Q2 even without the benefit of an acceleration in customer acquisition. On the Q2 earnings call, the CFO acknowledged that while search engine optimization (SEO) traffic increased by 10% in the quarter, it did not yet translate into a material increase in new buyer acquisition.Accelerating new customer growth is key to eBay returning to double-digit top line growth. eBay needs to go after millennials who only have a fleeting knowledge of eBay. It is experimenting with targeted advertising in many different online and offline channels, including television.ValuationeBay is a cash flow monster. It has a 24% operating margin and is on pace to generate $2.5B in free cash flow this year. Based on the current enterprise value of $36.9B, the FCF yield is a very healthy 7.8%. It trades at an earnings multiple of 16.9x. I put together some projections that assume modest improvement in revenues (foreign currency could still be an issue for eBay going forward) and modest degradation in margins.Recall that eBay's StubHub and Classifieds businesses, which together represent ~20% of total sales, are growing at a significantly higher rate (15-20%+ annually) than the marketplace business. If eBay is able to steadily increase revenues to 8%-10% or more annually, I believe the multiple should expand nicely. I project the yield on free cash flow will drop to 6% by 2018 as investors grow more confident in eBay's ability to maintain market share by growing at or near the rate of e-commerce overall.Also of note is eBay's stock repurchase program. I assume continued repurchases net of stock issuances for employee compensation of ~$2B annually.My projections imply over 20% stock price appreciation in both 2017 and 2018, indicating that shares are massively undervalued today if the company can hit its growth goals. The trading multiple could expand to 20x, which I believe is fair based on these projections and today's market environment. If I'm wrong about eBay and higher growth never pans out, I still think shares are supported at this level by the massive free cash flow the company generates.I'm confident that the structured data initiative currently underway, given the rate of e-commerce growth overall, will at least support low-to-mid single-digit growth, which in turn should support shares at the current level or higher.ConclusionI believe that Mr. Wenig and his team are making great strides in their efforts to reinvigorate growth in the core marketplace business. The improvements coming to the marketplace via the structured data initiative are game changers and will increase the relevancy of the shopping experience on eBay versus competitors. I believe it will enable higher rates of growth in the core marketplace business, which represents 80% of total company revenues. Competition in e-commerce has been and will continue to be intense.But eBay has a great brand and the results of the structured data initiative to date are very promising. At the very least, it should stabilize marketplace growth in the low-to-mid single-digit range. Again, I believe the current valuation is supportive of that level of performance. As such, the risk versus reward is skewed to the upside. I'm a buyer at these levels for a long-term hold. eBay is a value play in the sustainable, high-growth e-commerce sector. Patient long-term investors should be rewarded handsomely."
3991371,25265,2016-07-26T03:59:48-04:00,"eBay has a sizable online classifieds business that is growing at a healthy 15% annual rate.Yet this business is currently monetized entirely outside the US, with eBay's Close5 app still in its infancy here in the US.Domestically, there is a battle taking place to replace Craigslist, which has failed to adapt to today's mobile first world.eBay needs to make a bold move in this space in order to compete effectively. It has the resources and capabilities to do so.Look for eBay to make a sizable acquisition as it seeks to win online classifieds in the US.","Some investors may not be aware of eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) small but growing online classifieds business. The classifieds business operates around the world and provides online listings to connect buyers and sellers at a local level. Think of it as Craigslist updated for modern times. eBay conducts the Classifieds business outside the US under a number of brand names, including Gumtree in the UK, Ireland, Australia and South Africa, Mobile.de in Germany, Kijiji and eBay Classifieds in Canada, Italy, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and Marktplaats in the Netherlands. The full list can be found here. Classifieds generates revenues through advertising and listing fees (most but not all product categories are free). The business has been a winner for eBay and has generated consistent double-digit constant currency revenue growth in recent quarters. However, it is still a relatively small piece of eBay's overall business at just 8.6% of total revenues over the last twelve months.Even though it is a small part of eBay's business today, it is experiencing growth well in excess of the core marketplace growth rate. So the company should and will continue to allocate sufficient resources toward it to nurture its growth. Again, the revenue derived from the Classifieds business comes entirely from outside the US. In the US, Craigslist dominates the market for local trade of goods and services. It has enjoyed this market leading status for the past 15 years. However, with the proliferation of mobile internet and apps, cracks are beginning to show in Craigslist's armor. This is all self-inflicted, principally due to the company's refusal to adapt to a mobile first world. Craigslist has no official mobile apps. It has never meaningfully upgraded the platform since it first went live across the country in 2000 - preferring to keep expenses low and milk the platform for every last dollar for as long as possible. Craigslist could be so much more if it invested for the future, however the company refuses to invest meaningfully in platform upgrades and the development of first party apps with added features consumers are asking for. That has left the door open to competitors in this new mobile first world. There are several apps that have garnered market share on mobile, including Close5, letgo, wallapop, offerup, and saily. All of these apps act like a modern day, mobile first version of Craigslist. They also have added features, like user verification and in-app chat functions. Here is a look at Google search interest in the apps since 2014.Wallapop and offerup are the clear leaders. Comparing just letgo and Close5, you can see that letgo has pulled ahead in 2016 - no doubt due to its aggressive marketing campaign.I'm not sure how much one can read into the market from this information - as it is just one data point. For instance, letgo is the only app showing up in the top 100 free apps in the app store. It is also the one that is most heavily advertised. None of these apps are monetizing their platforms in any meaningful way today. The strategy is to first build an audience, then grow revenue through advertising and certain listing fees. All of these platforms are a long way from profitability.eBay owns Close5 and has put some capital to work in this market. Here is what the CEO said about the app when asked about it on the Q3 2015 earnings call.eBay's management recognizes the potential if they can win in this market. There are also opportunities for synergies and cross-selling between classifieds and the core marketplace business, which the company is just beginning to exploit outside the US. If eBay is going to win in the US classifieds market, it needs to start by making a bold move. letgo and Wallapop have fired the first shot across the bow at competitors, announcing a merger and a $100M capital raise. Clearly the majority of the capital will be used to continue the marketing campaign designed to build a large audience. The companies themselves run pretty lean in terms of headcount and technology. I see multiple commercials for letgo on cable television each night. This is not a cheap way to build an audience, but clearly it is working with letgo the only one of these apps in the top 100 in the app store.The combination of letgo and Wallapop and its significant marketing budget is a threat to eBay's close5. It is time for eBay to make a bold move in its US classifieds business if it wants to be a part of the new wave that displaces Craigslist. The most logical move to counter the letgo, Wallapop merger would be to purchase offerup and then put some of eBay's significant resources behind the new efforts to continue to grow the audience. Any purchase would likely not come at a low price tag, however, considering the capital being raised in this space currently and the big name investors already in the company. However, eBay has plenty of cash, and I believe the market would view the purchase as a long-term positive. Absent a bold move like this, I do not see how the company can win with just Close5 if it is not going to invest significantly more to drive adoption.ConclusionsClearly Craigslist still holds a dominate position in the market for local goods and services.As you can see the others barely show up on this chart. But interest in Craigslist is on the decline (it peaked in 2013). As these apps gain popularity and Craigslist continues to ignore the mobile user experience, I expect its dominate will continue to wane. Now is the time to capitalize on this situation and invest for the future, as others are already doing. eBay needs to be especially careful as local, mobile trading of goods could also begin to erode sales on its marketplace business. By making a move today, eBay would send a strong signal to this market that it is here and willing to invest heavily to win. By combining with offerup, it would garner a much stronger position in the new wave of mobile first online classifieds and have a fighting chance of beating the competition in this market. While investing more in this business would be a near-term drag on the company's overall performance, there is clearly an established revenue model for it - one that eBay has massaged and enhanced over time. It has the experience its rivals do not. In time, monetization would occur and value would accrete to shareholders. Buying a rival soon and increasing marketing spend to grow the audience would be a solid, long-term strategic move for eBay."
3998840,31101,2016-08-11T14:10:23-04:00,"eBay has invested heavily, and talked a lot about, its Artificial Intelligence research as part of its Structured Data Initiative.The Structured Data Initiative aims to understand the products that people sell on eBay and how different products relate to each other.Understanding products sold on eBay is critical for Big Data, which is becoming one of the hottest topics in e-Commerce and other industries.This enables e-commerce must-haves such as personalization and product recommendation.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has announced in several of its recent stockholder reports (e.g., here, here and here) that it is investing heavily in artificial intelligence technology for understanding related products, which it calls its Structured Data Initiative. The basic idea is simple: When two people (or 2,000 people, or 2 million people) use eBay to sell the same thing, each in different condition and each with minor variations, eBay wants to know that they are the same product or related products.Until now, however, eBay and other marketplace sites have struggled with having identical or related products given very different names and descriptions by different sellers. This is inherent to marketplace sites - while retailers have precise names and product codes for each product, people that are selling their old things online will give them a wide variety of names.While this certainly makes sense for eBay to research, it seems somewhat mundane for stockholder reports. It is like a car company reporting to stockholders that it is investing in a new alloy for door handles. The e-commerce giants invest heavily in technology research, in artificial intelligence and dozens of other areas. Why is Structured Data worthy of mention to shareholders?The answer is that connecting identical or related products is critical for Big Data, customer analytics and product recommendation. Big Data, and all of its applications, are key areas not only for e-commerce but the entire technology sector these days. Without Structured Data, eBay is risking falling behind in the Big Data revolution.Understanding why eBay needs Structured Data to leverage Big Data requires understanding how most Big Data systems in the e-commerce industry operate. Online stores such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) profile customers and recommend products by comparing the products that each person purchased (or browsed, or liked…) with those that other people purchased. Suppose a group of people, either two or 2,000, all purchased the same 20 products, with each of them buying other products also. Since everyone in the group shares the interest in those 20 products, the odds are good that the other products that each person bought will be of interest to the others in the group. And if two products have often been bought by the same people, there is likely some relationship between the products, even if they are very different.Correlations between customers and products are at the core of today's Big Data for e-commerce. Customers see this directly when they are told that ""people who browsed the item you are browsing ended up purchasing"" a set of products that the store recommends to you, or that ""people who purchased the items in your shopping cart also bought"" another set of products that the store is recommending.But here is the problem: Big Data analyses of these sorts require that the store knows when different people have purchased the same product. This is easy for a regular on-line store, which sells many of the same products from its catalog and has each sale associated with a product code. But for a marketplace like eBay, it is very difficult to know that the coffee maker that John bought from Bill is the same as the coffee maker that Jane bought from Sally. Knowing that John and Jane purchased the same coffee maker requires knowing that the coffee maker that Bill sold and the coffee maker that Sally sold are the same. This is not possible if Bill and Sally uploaded their own pictures and described the products in their own words, as is common on auction and marketplace sites.This is the challenge that eBay's Structured Data Initiative is trying to solve. By using Artificial Intelligence to identify the connection between Bill's and Sally's coffee makers, eBay will be enabling itself to see the similarity of interests of John and Jane. Without Structured Data, John and Jane are just two people that bought things from Bill and Sally.This is why Structured Data is worthy of mention in an investor report. As Big Data grows, personalization becomes the buzzword of the day in e-commerce, and recommendation engines drive higher percentages of sales, eBay needs to stay at the forefront.This challenge is not only for auction sites and marketplaces like eBay. This same challenge is faced by all on-line stores when it comes to promoting new products. If a product is new, and has not been bought yet by many people, there are no statistics available to be used to recommend the new product to customers. This is why new products in stores tend to be promoted heavily on store home pages but are not seen often in recommendation bars.In parallel with initiatives on Structured Data, new approaches to e-commerce Big Data and product recommendation are reaching market, that solve the problem in other ways. Cognilyze's psychology-based product recommendation engine analyzes customers and recommends products without using any correlations between people or products. Instead, Cognilyze's solution analyzes every product individually, analyzes every customer individually based on the products they like, and matches products to customers on a one-to-one basis. Because Cognilyze's analysis is not based on correlations, it can analyze and recommend products without any connection to other products. This is ideal for marketplaces as well as for on-line stores.In addition to the ability to promote new products without data structuring, Cognilyze's engine delivered a higher conversion rate than a leading product recommendation engine, in the first week it was deployed in May, 2016.What we see from this is that not all e-commerce companies are equally-well positioned when it comes to Big Data, personalization and product recommendations. eBay's Structured Data Initiative is strategically critical to enable the company to compete with Amazon and others in Big Data. Keep an eye on eBay's Structured Data work, as well as on start-ups like Cognilyze, to see how marketplaces and on-line auctions can stay at the forefront of Big Data analytics and product recommendations."
3999828,101831,2016-08-16T04:43:16-04:00,EBay witnessed a 33% gain in July.Quarter two earnings beat estimates.They have diversified into other areas and no longer rely solely on the marketplace business.,"Shares of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), the online e-commerce marketplace pioneer, have witnessed a 15% rise in the first part of 2016. This substantial gain is a reversal from the six months prior to July, which saw the company post nearly a 20% decline. However, July was good to eBay, as the company was able to jump 33% for the month and more than eliminate the earlier drop in price. This spike came primarily from their second quarter earnings which surprised analysts by outperforming by a significant margin.Now after a notable run-up, investors are wondering if eBay still has room to advance. This article will detail the company's current business, discuss future opportunities, and examine any hurdles they may encounter in the future.Current BusinessBeginning with the impressive Q2 earnings report responsible for eBay's success this year, we see the company outperformed its own expectations to a large degree. The company had projected revenue to be between $2.14 and $2.19 billion but saw them beat with a revenue of $2.23 billion. They also beat estimates with earnings per share (EPS) of $0.38. On top of the successful quarter, eBay raised their full-year outlook from a range of $8.6 to $8.8 billion to a new range of $8.85 to $8.95 billion.The stellar results can be attributed to growth in both eBay's core business as well as its StubHub platform. Total revenue grew 6% to $2.2 billion for the core business, while gross merchandise volume (GVM) shot up 4% to $20.9 billion. As for the StubHub business, its revenue increased a massive 40% to $225 million. Finally, the company had a net income of $435 million and a net profit margin of nearly 20%. CEO Devin Wenig spoke to the strong performance, saying that the company is now ""one year into executing our strategy to provide the best choice, the most relevance, and the most powerful selling platform, and there are signs of momentum in our business. We continue to invest in our platforms to ensure eBay is a global commerce leader for years to come"". It seems the company's strategy has been paying off. In the past eBay has lagged behind the growth rates of competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but their new strategy has them looking to remedy these issues. As for their current valuation, the company is trading at a PE of 18.3, which is below the industry average of 25 and has a PB of 5.4 again slightly below the industry average. However, when it comes to forecasted growth eBay doesn't stand up nearly as well trading at a PEG of 19.1.Moving forwardThe plan for eBay moving forward is all about continuing the growth momentum they have established recently. The company is working on multiple areas in order to do so. They are improving product inventory and emphasizing unique items on the site. The company is also requiring sellers to provide additional information on products in an attempt to make the shopping experience better for its customers. They are collecting as much data as possible in order to make it easy for customers to find what they are looking for. One method they are using to do this, is educating sellers on gaps in inventory and opportunities that these sellers may be able to fill.It has been over a year since PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and eBay split. The move seems to be paying off for both companies as PayPal has seen revenue jump 15% in the past quarter. Worries over eBay's ability to succeed without the payment side of its business were rampant at the time of the split but have cooled with the recent success of both companies. Now without the safety net of its payment arm, eBay has put extra emphasis on its non-marketplace services. Although the marketplace is still far and away the largest aspect of the business in terms of total revenue, the other two major revenue streams-StubHub and marketing services-have been gaining traction at impressive rates. StubHub accounted for 10% of total net revenue while marketing services was up to 22% of revenue this past quarter. Both arms of the business do a good job of diversifying eBay's revenue streams and with the extra attention they are receiving as of late, expect them to continue to grow as a percentage of total revenue for the next several years.With the success of StubHub, eBay is doubling down with two acquisitions of online ticket businesses. First, they acquired TicketBis, a Spanish online ticket marketplace for $165 million. Next, they bought Ticket Utils, a ticket inventory specialist for an undisclosed amount. However, eBay's not relying solely on the ticket business in terms of acquisitions. They also have acquired two tech companies, Expertmaker and SalesPredict, with the goal of strengthening their AI and machine learning initiatives along with their structured data to improve listings.It seems since the PayPal spin-off, the diverse avenues eBay has been able to traverse has created much more growth potential than was possible previously.Bottom lineAn investment in eBay does not come without its risks. First, after a sudden run up like the one witnessed in July, there is often some reversion to the mean. Second, eBay's non-core revenue streams have seen great growth recently but questions remain about how sustainable that growth is, especially when considering the relative size of a market like online tickets. Despite these concerns, eBay has shown it's on the correct path and making the right moves to drive growth forward. With the run it's been on, I may wait for a slight pullback to enter but over the next few years, I believe the stock will return great value to its shareholders."
3988492,25047,2016-07-14T14:38:10-04:00,"eBay presently seems cheap, especially considering the whole market and its brand recognition.However, the reasons why eBay mostly lost share on the e-commerce market remain.At the same time, new reasons have emerged for eBay to lose more share still.The new reasons directly impact a segment where previously eBay had a large competitive advantage.","Not on eBay. But easier to find, safer, cheaper and with free shippingFirst of all, let me say straight out that eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) isn't particularly expensive. Indeed, in today's market it might even be cheap as it trades for just ~14x its 2016 earnings consensus. As such, take what I'm going to say next with that in mind. Said another way, the stock is cheap, but there are reasons for it.The reason, generically, can be said to be low growth. eBay, clear of the PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) spin-off effects, is expected to grow revenues just 2.7% during 2016. Obviously, with companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) growing much faster (not just now, but for years running), the market has given eBay the cold shoulder.This low growth, also generically, can be said to happen because it's simply much:Overall, eBay has had many more reasons to lose than to win. eBay has initiated the process to cure some of these deficits, namely regarding product discovery, but seemingly the process has been incredibly slow. I wrote on the subject more than one year ago, and there's been very little visible action.eBay does have one large advantage over Amazon.com and other online retailers. The advantage is most apparent when buying from Chinese suppliers. Basically, due to special mail shipping arrangements, Chinese eBay sellers are able to deliver low priced items straight from China with free shipping. Amazon.com isn't able to match this.Therein Lies The ProblemIt is precisely because of that advantage that I'm writing this article. That advantage is being chipped away. By whom? By Chinese websites geared towards serving international customers. Such websites include:What do these sites have in common? Well:Putting it together, it's a better experience to buy from these emerging websites than from eBay itself for the product categories where eBay used to have an advantage (other than used items, flea-market type).ConclusionNot only was eBay growth already challenged by all the prior disadvantages, but now this emerging competition is outclassing it even where it still had an advantage. eBay is likely to lose from both sides. At the same time it has taken too long to adapt itself, even after having taken the initial steps to do so more than one year ago.As a result, I don't think the stock is an obvious bargain no matter it being seemingly so cheap. I don't think so on account of these dynamics, which I expect to steal eBay business from all sides.I know most of my buying for Chinese stuff shifted from eBay to these new sellers, and I expect the same to happen to a lot of other eBay customers. Even the low growth expected of eBay going forward might be too optimistic."

It delivered a solid quarter and the market has finally recognized the positive momentum at EBAY and pushed the stock higher past our previous price target of $30. This is a solid 25% return in four months. In light of these developments we take another look at EBAY.In our last article we mentioned that Share repurchases and Product Optimization will be the biggest drivers for the value creation.Structured Data ( Product Optimization)In Q2, EBAY crossed one billion live listing mark for the first time. Of these listings 90% can be optimized for better user experience. Currently EBAY's mandate covers 60% these listings and they have processed 42% of them as of Q2. The revenue and earnings growth in the last two quarters reflects the positive effect of the product optimization. We believe this will continue to be a positive surprise to the investors as the coverage under structured data increases.AcquisitionsEBAY has been busy making strategic acquisitions in line with its product optimization strategy. It is making investments into both its core and growth categories. Expertmaker and SalesPredict are expected to dramatically strengthen product optimization and improve user experience. TicketBis and TicketUtils will increase StubHub's offering both in scale and breadth.Expertmaker, specializes in providing intelligent solutions powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data analyticsSalesPredict,an Israel-based company that leverages advanced analytics to predict customer buying behavior and sales conversionTicketBis, International ticket marketplace with presence in 47 countries.TicketUtils,a leading independent provider of software that helps large ticket sellers manage inventory and distributionShare RepurchasesI like companies that produce FCF and return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. EBAY produces in excess of $2B in FCF each year and is committing to repurchase shares. EBAY bought $500M of shares in the last quarter and the board approved a new $2.5B authorization. We believe at this pace EBAY can retire 5-7% of outstanding shares per year, increasing per share value of the company.ValuationMarket today values EBAY at approximately 16x 2016 EPS guidance provided by the company. We are of the opinion that (I) Actual EPS numbers would be better than the guidance and (ii) P/E multiple will expand further as market takes note of the positive developments and steady share buyback. As a result we are revising our price target to $40/share, approximately 30% higher than where we are today within the next 12-18 months.ConclusionWe continue to be long EBAY.Disclaimer: This article is for educational and informational purposes only.

Current valuation is attractive.","eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) Q2 surprised the market on the upside with revenue and EPS ahead of analyst expectations. More important, guidance also beat, suggesting some stabilization in the core ecommerce platform as it compete against the bigger giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Additionally, ongoing share buyback remains an attractive proposition for value investors and the board approved an additional $2.5b stock repurchase after completing $500m share repurchase this quarterOften times it is difficult for an old dog to learn new tricks but new tricks are necessary for survival. eBay is certainly evolving with their structural data initiative that is aimed to improve product search and categorization to regain sales growth. The business model shift towards fixed pricing is necessary given the structural decline of its auction business in that it could potentially help eBay to reshape its image of an auction-based and second-hand product site into a more legitimate ecommerce platform. Of course, the downside to this would be in direct competition with AMZN but given that ecommerce is still a growing segment in retail with only 10% penetration I believe that the market is big enough for both AMZN and eBay.Revenue of $2.23b was ahead of consensus $2.17b while EPS of $0.43 beat consensus by a penny. Guidance of $8.85-$8.95b was ahead of consensus for the year. GMV growth of +6% showed stability in the marketplace while active buyer growth of +4% showed that eBay remains a relevant ecommerce platform despite competition from AMZN. Impressively, eBay achieve 1b live listings for the first time on its marketplace and the company has been leveraging its structured data to facilitate listings and refine user experience through better search, browsing, merchandising and ranking in search results. As such, user engagement has been strong judging by the doubling of product reviews in the quarter to 3.1m for a total of 12m reviews on the platform. This increase in engagement is ultimately accretive to improving sales and repeat customers, in my view.On mobile, eBay continues to differentiate by improving its mobile app efficiency that is leading to marketplace mobile volume growth of +19% in the quarter. Although ecommerce has been growing quite strong in recent years, mobile ecommerce or mcommerce will be a bigger growth driver and it is important for eBay to be part of it. While it seems that eBay has an established mobile platform, a bigger catalyst could be partnership with FB Messenger (NASDAQ:FB) where eBay becomes a mcommerce channel for FBM users. This could allow eBay to leverage FBM's 1b+ users and drive medium-term revenue and user growth. So why eBay and not AMZN? AMZN competes against FB on multiple areas in media and online ecosystem so a tie-up is not likely. EBay is a less serious threat to FB and it is ultimately a net benefit for FB to have eBay on its platform given that ecommerce is a critical channel for mobile messenger experience.Finally, stability in eBay's results will enhance its M&A value in the long-term as larger players such as Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) look to expand its presence in North America. Although eBay could be competitive and relevant in the near-term, I am skeptical of its competitiveness against AMZN in the long-run so I continue to see a take-out to be the best possible outcome for eBay. The likely buyer would be BABA that has failed to establish its own ecommerce site in the US, is looking to expand internationally and wants to scale its ecommerce platform on an existing site that already has the merchant relationships and the customer base. eBay fits this profile and I continue to see BABA's acquisition of eBay to be a good possibility in the long-run."
3987826,25265,2016-07-12T10:20:26-04:00,"Since the spin-off of PayPal was completed a year ago, eBay's core marketplace has shown performance that is lackluster at best.StubHub, one of two shining stars under the eBay umbrella, is gaining investors' attention due to its rapid growth.Despite calls to spin off StubHub to shareholders, eBay should hold on to it for the foreseeable future and nurture its growth in-house.","After initially rejecting investor calls to spin off PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) in early 2014, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) quickly bowed to investor pressure and agreed to the spin. Activist investor Carl Icahn led the charge to separate the low-growth marketplace business from the high-growth payments business. The tax-free spin-off was completed in early July of last year.Since the separation, eBay's performance has been lackluster, to say the least. The marketplace has stagnated, with growth well below that of e-commerce overall.The take rate has declined as well, putting additional pressure on the top line. The company has a plan in place to revive growth — mainly its structured data initiative. The goal of this initiative is to improve discoverability (particularly in Google search), the user experience, and, ultimately, sales. eBay has made solid progress on this strategy, but so far most of the progress is not yet visible to the end-user (the back-end improvements need to be made first). It will take time for these efforts to show up in the company's financial results. The CEO won't pin down a rate of growth he is aiming for - just that he wants to grow faster than the business is currently. I am looking for a return to high-single-digit gross merchandise value (""GMV"") growth in the next 3 to 6 quarters. That may prove too optimistic or too pessimistic - only time will tell.StubHub!So while eBay's largest business is stagnating and a return to meaningful growth remains elusive, its two smaller divisions (StubHub and Classifieds) are enjoying solid growth at the moment. Let's focus on StubHub. eBay bought StubHub in 2007 for $310M. The company is performing very well and has generated a lot of media buzz lately. Last year eBay hired a new executive to run the business: Scott Cutler, who had previously spent nine years at NYSE Euronext as co-head of listings and the cash execution business.On the surface, that doesn't sound like a background that would be a good fit for StubHub. Like eBay's CEO, Devin Wenig, Cutler has a law degree and background not seemingly directly related to e-commerce. However, to date, the company has performed well under his tutelage.He moved quickly to reverse the disastrous pricing policy that the previous StubHub president had implemented, unified the technology stack to allow for more frequent app updates, introduced innovative new features, signed exclusive deals with professional teams, and expanded overseas through acquisition. So far, so good for Cutler's tenure at StubHub. The business is lapping some easy comparable thanks to the previously mentioned pricing change, but the growth is still very impressive.eBay has prioritized resources for this business, and it is moving aggressively to expand both in the US and abroad. Mr. Cutler seems to be the right person to lead StubHub in its next phase of growth. Analysts and the press have taken notice. Many are now talking about the possibility of eBay spinning off StubHub to shareholders, just like it did with PayPal. For now, StubHub is a small part of eBay's overall revenues - just 8 percent in Q1. But clearly it is growing faster than the core marketplace business and enjoys a significantly higher take rate of ~20%.Time to Spin Off StubHub?Might this impressive growth trapped inside the much larger eBay lead to a growing investor chorus calling for a spin-off? Maybe, but investors should not expect eBay to bow to the pressure anytime soon. There are several reasons for this. First, StubHub remains small relative to eBay's overall business. Even if StubHub can manage to grow 20-30 percent annually for the next 12-18 months, it will take several more years until it is even 20 percent of eBay's overall business. PayPal grew to near 50 percent of total revenues before it was spun off. Spinning off StubHub now will not meaningfully add to shareholder value, even in an optimistic scenario.Second, eBay needs to keep its growth engines. Right now the marketplaces business is stagnating, with low-single-digit growth at best. While the company is putting forth a lot of effort to accelerate that growth, it will take time for its efforts to result in higher revenues and ultimately higher profits.There are, of course, no guarantees that what eBay is doing to revive the marketplace will even work. If eBay spins off its growth engines, it could do a large disservice to shareholders. There are already many reasons to not own eBay stock (Amazon's dominance being the principal one). The company does not need to give investors any more reasons to avoid the stock.It is just too early on in eBay's turnaround efforts to be spinning off its growth divisions. If eBay does spin-off StubHub and its efforts to revive the marketplace fall flat, the company will look very foolish for having consummated the spin. I suspect the value lost at eBay will likely exceed the value gained from the spin-off in this scenario given StubHub's small size. The company should continue to nurture and grow StubHub from within eBay for the foreseeable future. It can continue to use its significant financial, technological, and operational resources to cheaply fund StubHub's growth.What About Classifieds?The same can be said for eBay's Classifieds business. It, too, is growing nicely, though it is monetized entirely outside the US and has been hurt by the strong dollar of late.However, I believe that classifieds should stay with the marketplace business permanently as the two are more closely aligned and have the potential to accelerate growth for each in the future through more effective targeting of local buyers and sellers.ActivistsIt is possible one or more activist investors once again take a meaningful stake in eBay and attempt to force change. The longer the stock underperforms the more likely an activist enters the fray. The company is still an asset light cash cow that is expected to generate $2.2B-$2.4B in free-cash-flow this year. It trades at a low 13.3x this year's earnings and has a net cash position of $1.3B on its balance sheet ($10.3B in cash offset by $9.0B in debt). Certainly an activist could call for the company to increase leverage and use the proceeds to buyback even more stock. Of note, the company is limited to repurchasing no more than 20% of its stock within the first two years post PayPal spin-off in order to protect the tax free nature of the spin-off. I believe the company is likely to repurchase approximately 15% of the shares outstanding by the second anniversary date of the spin-off under its current program, so there is room to do more and potentially significantly ramp up buybacks next July once the two-year anniversary lapses.An activist could of course echo the chorus of analysts talking about monetizing StubHub and put more pressure on the company to spin it off. However, I think that is an easy battle for eBay to win at this point. It is only 8% of the company's revenues today. If StubHub could earn a 4x revenue equity valuation (similar to PayPal at separation), it will only be 10% of eBay's current market cap. Again, I think the company can pretty easily make the argument that StubHub is better incubated within eBay for the time being. StubHub is taking advantage of eBay's cash, infrastructure, and cheap funding to accelerate its growth, and we know eBay is committed to allocating growing resources toward the business as evidenced by recent investments. Operating within eBay is not holding back StubHub's growth prospects at this point.ConclusionStubHub is one of two growth engines at eBay and appears to have a bright future ahead of itself even as competition within the ticket space intensifies. This impressive growth has led to calls for eBay to spin-off the business. Now is not the time for StubHub to separate itself from eBay. It is better served growing inside of eBay for the foreseeable future - it is not yet large enough to stand on its own and still be able to self-fund its growth. I would urge patience for anyone pounding the table for a separation. If eBay is ever able to get the marketplace growth back up to the 8-12% range, I believe the calls for a StubHub separation will fade as that level of growth in the marketplace business will drive more value for shareholders than StubHub likely ever will. For now, eBay remains a cheap, cash cow megacap business with two small but fast growing subsidiaries that have the potential to add significant value in the next 2 to 4 years. Investors would be better served focusing on ways to return the marketplace to growth and increasing buybacks rather than a near-term spin-off of StubHub."
3984689,101429,2016-06-27T15:31:38-04:00,Facebook sales groups pose a serious threat to eBay's very business model.Groups on the site offer sellers/buyers a cheaper alternative that is more convenient and quicker than eBay.The increased competition from Facebook and Amazon will make it increasingly difficult for eBay to grow in the future.,"When looking at eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) competition, most will point out Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as its biggest threat. Amazon has grown at an incredible rate and has stolen a significant amount of eBay's revenues. However, there is a relatively new player in the field that is making eBay obsolete. With competition from Amazon, eBay at least retained its identity as the premier Peer-to-Peer (P2P) platform. But its more recent competitor, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), has redefined the P2P marketplace and is making eBay more and more obsolete every day. Facebook groups are forming and becoming extremely successful marketplaces that present a fast growing problem for eBay. There are numerous sales groups for specific items as well as groups based on geography. Here are the three main reasons Facebook is beating out eBay as the best P2P marketplace solution.Users Can Buy LocallyFacebook has witnessed a boon of ""digital yard sales"". Essentially, geographic areas have been creating FB communities where members can buy and sell products. With all buyers and sellers located in the same geographic area, you can say goodbye to shipping costs. Not only that, but same day delivery/pickup is always an option depending on the flexibility of the participating parties. To realize that Facebook created a worldwide, same-day shipping infrastructure without lifting a finger is something to marvel at. Additionally, users can communicate and arrange to view the item in person before purchasing, thus improving confidence in each purchase.Shipping speeds don't appear to be a priority at eBay, as CEO Devin Wenig noted that ""I'd rather have a billion unique items that arrive in three days than a billion commodity items that arrive in an hour."" While I appreciate his intention to differentiate eBay, today's consumers value and expect quick shipping. Nearly half of U.S. households have Amazon Prime memberships, which offers 2 day shipping on most items. Out of eBay's user base, over half of its members reside outside of the United States. As a result, shipping in many cases will be expensive and time-consuming.No FeesHere's the simplest reason Facebook is superior to eBay; it doesn't charge sellers or buyers a penny. Add this to the potential of zero shipping costs and the savings begin to stack up. Not only can eBay take up to 9% of each sale, its fee guidelines are unnecessarily complicated and confusing. The guidelines are so complex that eBay actually offers a ""fee calculator"" on its site so you can see how much you will have to pay to list your item. Here's a screenshot of what it looks like:If you need to create a fee calculator on your site, it's probably a sign that your fee policy is too complicated and frustrates sellers. Facebook derives its revenues from advertising and therefore is not forced to charge its sellers hefty fees. Sellers appreciate this because there is no hassle and they can list their item for less while making the same amount of money as they would on eBay. Buyers obviously appreciate this because sellers can offer lower prices.Ease of Use and Wider Audience ReachThe process of posting a sale on Facebook is lightning fast, especially for the first time. Let's compare the two processes of posting an item for sale on each platform for the first time. On eBay; Create profile, add payment details, upload photo(s), write description, research fees to see whether auction or fixed price is better option, customize auction or fixed price options, post sale. Now let's take a look at Facebook (I will assume that you already have a user profile) - Upload photo(s), write description, set price, post sale. From this it should be clear to see that Facebook is a much more simplified process. The current generation focuses on speed (think Snapchat (CHAT) and other platforms) and will be value Facebook's quicker process.Facebook not only has the better process, but its reach dwarfs that of eBay. Facebook boasts 1.65 billion Monthly Active Users, whereas eBay only has 162 million active users. Sellers will increasingly opt for the platform that holds over 10x potential buyers than the other option. Besides these reasons, there are a few ancillary features that make Facebook the better marketplace option. Facebook doesn't make money on transactions, so it is much more flexible to customize your deal with your counterpart. (eBay is rather rigid so it doesn't get cheated on its take) Buyers and sellers are connected to their profiles, which adds a layer of transparency to the process that Craigslist was never able to offer as a competitor. Lastly, Facebook has its developed Messenger platform which makes it exceptionally easy to communicate with the other party while on the go.By now it should be clear that Facebook is beating eBay at its own game. eBay will not vanish overnight, but I see its growth potential to be severely limited. Although not entirely caused by Facebook, the effects have already taken shape. Gross merchandise volume in the most recent quarter has remained stagnant from the same point two years ago. Revenue during the same time frame has actually slightly decreased in accordance. I predict that eBay will find it increasingly difficult to grow during the next five years. Past that point, eBay's concerns may even become focused on merely surviving as it falls behind its competitors.I encourage you to follow me as I cover a wide variety of current topics, with a special interest in the technology and entertainment industries."
3987196,23757,2016-07-08T15:12:36-04:00,eBay's competitive advantage is its network effect.Amazon is one company with an existing user base that could challenge eBay.Our research shows a real possibility that sellers will continue to migrate to Amazon.,"We took a look at eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) as a possible investment but ultimately decided to pass due to concerns over the strength of eBay's economic moat. We thought we'd share some of our research so other investors can better analyze eBay and understand the risks we believe the company is facing.At first glance eBay seems like it could be a good investment. The company trades at a P/E below 15 and sales are projected to grow a little over 4% next year. eBay also has a hidden high growth gem in its StubHub business which saw revenue growth 34% quarter over quarter. However, what concerns us are some signs we see of eBay's competitive advantage or economic moat in the form of its network effect becoming weaker.Analyzing eBay's Network EffectsThe key to eBay's dominance is the network effect. The network effect is a type of competitive advantage where a product or service becomes more valuable the more people use it. People list items for sale on eBay because a large number or people go to eBay to look for things to buy. People go to eBay to buy things because there are a large number of sellers. It's a virtuous circle and provides a very high barrier of entry to competitors. Imagine trying to start an auction site today, it'd be virtually impossible. You couldn't attract large numbers of buyers and sellers without investment huge sums of money. So the competitors eBay has now are pretty much the only competitors it should have for a very long time.Those three main competitors are Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), and craigslist. Etsy is more of a niche marketplace focusing on custom crafts and artwork. It's more of an online version of your local art fair so we don't consider Etsy to be a big threat to eBay. Likewise, we don't view craigslist as a huge threat either. Craigslist has simply replaced the local classifieds. The main competitive threat is Amazon's marketplace.We're a big believer in using what Philip Fischer called ""scuttlebutt"" when researching companies. We browsed various online seller forums to see how eBay and Amazon are viewed from a seller prospective.Amazon's StrengthsAccording to our research Amazon has some advantages over eBay for many sellers. Many merchants preferred Amazon for selling new items due to its larger customer base. Additionally, larger companies seemed to prefer listing items on Amazon rather than eBay and have experienced faster sales growth on Amazon compared to eBay. For example Vivo Technologies which does millions of dollars in sales per year has seen Amazon take over from eBay as their largest sales portal. Larger, high volume merchants also prefer using Amazon's FBA (Fulfilled By Amazon) service which takes care of the logistics of warehousing and shipping items. Sellers also liked Amazon because of its different feedback system for buyers and sellers. One common complaint we saw was that the eBay feedback system was being abused by customers. For example customers would demand refunds they were not eligible for by threatening to leave poor feedback for the seller.eBay's StrengthsAccording to our research eBay seems to be the consensus choice among sellers for unique lots such as vintage items, used items, and handmade items. Sellers said that these types of items tended to sell for the highest prices on eBay (not surprising given the auction aspect of the site). They also reported they got more repeat business when using eBay due to the more community type feel of the site compared to Amazon. Users on eBay can open up storefronts and repeat customers can use that as a way to keep up to date on sellers' new offerings. There have also been rumors that Amazon uses data from third party sales to help it undercut those same third party sellers on price. It has also been speculated that Amazon uses that same data on third party sales to help it decide which items it will sell on its own. I've read account of several sellers reporting that not long after they began listing and selling an item Amazon itself added that item for sale and undercut them on price. eBay also generally came out ahead in terms of fees charged to sellers for listing items.What the Future Holds for eBayOur research basically turned up no clear advantages for either eBay or Amazon. Both platforms had their strengths and weaknesses. This is what alarmed us. Most sellers seemed perfectly willing to use up to two platforms for their stores. A minority of sellers were only willing to use one platform but most large sellers ran eBay and Amazon stores simultaneously. So, things are not a winner take all situation and it seems that we may see the market split between eBay and Amazon.eBay has around 25M sellers and about 175M active buyers. In 2014 Amazon claimed about 2M active sellers and currently has 270M active buyers. What happens if the market does indeed eventually become an even split for sellers? eBay stands to lose out substantially if there is any significant migration of sellers towards Amazon. We can also see that with about 50% more active buyers than eBay, Amazon already has the ingredients for half of a very strong network effect. In fact, it may even be able to construct a better network effect barrier to entry given its larger base of buyers.We may be starting to see some of the effects of eBay losing ground to Amazon in eBay's latest results. We can see that revenue for eBay's Marketplace division has basically been flat.Perhaps more alarming is the take rate has been steadily declining. This could be a sign that eBay is under pressure to retain its seller base and is lower fees for sellers to avoid losing them to Amazon.All of this leads us to believe that eBay's once impenetrable network effect barrier to entry may have been breached by Amazon. We decided to pass on investing in eBay despite the attractive price because of our concerns that eBay has a lot to lose if Amazon is able to continue to gain traction with third party sellers."
3990198,33291,2016-07-21T10:39:08-04:00,One year ago I initiated coverage on eBay.The stock has mostly traded flat since that time.Earnings are out and I discuss the results and where the stock may be heading.,"One year ago I initiated coverage on a little company that I used to do a bit of business with called eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY). I told you that I used the site to sell a ton of old sports cards and memorabilia, as well as some random items including printer cartridges, video games, unopened posters and more. As we know however, PayPal, its once subsidiary has now been separated into its own stand alone company. As a stock, to me, it's never been reliable as an investment, however, you can always cherry pick a time frame to argue against this assessment. That said, is it changing now? Well the stock looks poised to hit new 52 week high after reporting earnings. Still, the stock has mostly traded sideways since I opened coverage, reiterating my thesis that the name is a strong one to trade, but not the best investment at the time. Despite this reality, the company is doing quite well. But forget the past, where is this stock going next.I'll be honest. I think the stock can move higher and surpass the $30 mark based on the momentum it is seeing and the results it just delivered. The just reported quarter was decent, but not incredible by any means. eBay's second quarter revenue increased 5.7% year-over-year to $2.23 billion, and this beat analyst estimates by $110 million. GAAP earnings came in at $437 million or $0.38 per share up 7% over last year. A better measure is the adjusted earnings. Adjusted earnings rolled in at $496 million, or $0.43 per share. This is up nicely year-over-year and was a $0.01 bottom line beat. All in all, it was a solid quarter. But we need to dig a little deeper.For the first time the company surpassed the one billion live listings mark. That is incredibly impressive. eBay's gross merchandise volume saw growth on an constant dollar basis. If we exclude the negative impact of currency related issues which are plaguing all domestic companies, the gross merchandise volume increased 4% year-over-year. Of course absolute year-over-year comparisons are complicated because foreign currency movements continued to have a negative effect, impacting the revenue growth rate of the eBay Marketplaces and of course StubHub.What was really impressive was the operating margin improvement. Operating margin improved to 23.8%, compared to 20.3% last year on a GAAP basis, while taxes were also lower, coming in at 18.2% versus 19.5%. Cash flow was higher, coming in at $764 million of operating cash flow and $617 million in free cash flow. What is important to also point out, and this is good for long-term investors, the company bought back $500 million in stock or 20.8 million shares in the quarter. David Wenig, President and CEO of eBay said:""Q2 was another good quarter where we delivered strong results and had acceleration in growth. We are now one year into executing our strategy to provide the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform, and there are signs of momentum in our business. We continue to invest in our platforms to ensure eBay is a global commerce leader for years to come.""Looking ahead, the company is growing steadily, though the stock is a touch pricey here, based current share price on current and future earnings in my opinion. That said, the company raised its guidance. 2016 earnings are projected to be about $1.85-$1.90 on a GAAP basis. That said, I don't think it is necessarily grossly overvalued, but I still can't recommend a buy here. I would wait for a pullback. The good news is that as a whole, the stock is definitely looking more reliable over the last year as an investment, and not a trading stock. Still, despite all of the positives, you need to time your buys in this name. There is momentum here, but I would not be a buyer at a 52 week high, even with the new $2.5 billion stock repurchase program.Note from the author: Christopher F.

I love them even more when they are backed by fundamental factors and not for the mere sake of hedging market risk. And I love them super even more when they're done with options.As we move into 2016, we have seen big-name tech stocks with clearly innovated products and reasonable valuation, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), hurt by earnings, while stocks with no real products and nosebleed valuations, such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), fly on earnings. In light of this, I want to direct your attention to two stocks in the same sector and considered by many to be running the same business: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). I am often asked by my students why I recommend trades on AMZN, but not the other big online superstore, eBay.The short of it is that AMZN is more volatile and trades at a higher price than EBAY. But what about investing? Are both stocks equally worth your capital?Notice that in the most recent earnings reports of both companies, both beat on earnings, the stocks rising in response. While I often run fancy codes on fundamental ratios and the like for the analysis of an individual stock, I prefer to open Zero to One, Peter Thiel's book, when comparing companies. In this article, I will apply the Zero to One reasoning in determining which one of AMZN or EBAY you should hold, if any, and whether a pairs trade makes sense.While Mr. Thiel's book is mainly aimed at analyzing startups, I often find that I can bring the philosophies forward in analyzing a pair of companies. Let's do this point by point.TechnologyDoes either eBay or Amazon offer breakthrough technology that cannot be matched through incremental improvements on existing technology?eBay: Now that eBay has split from PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), I believe the answer is ""no."" eBay is an online auction site not much different from any other online auction site, including Yahoo (YHOO) auctions or Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) Taobao. Other than a tall barrier to entry, no company is prevented from creating an auction site that mimics and possibly engages in incremental improvements upon eBay.Amazon: With cloud technology now quite common and competitors such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) closing in on Amazon's AWS market share, it is hard to say that Amazon is still innovating in the cloud. Amazon's tech overlaps with that of too many companies, from the Fire TV Stick versus Apple TV and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) versus Amazon Prime. However, Amazon does have Mechanical Turk, which is a streamlined outsourcing technology platform that seems irreplaceable at the moment. However, this service seems to be dying on its own - not that it contributed much to revenue anyhow:Answer: No, neither company excels in this area.TimingIs now the right time to invest in either of these companies?Looking at Google Trends, we get an idea of the trends in these companies' respective popularity, which makes for a good starting point. We see a pivotal point in late 2014, when Amazon overtook eBay in popularity:But more interesting is the actual shape of Amazon's chart. Clearly, we have a seasonal trend which peaks in the holiday season. My seasonal investigations into Amazon show this to have a significant impact on the stock.In this respect, EBAY makes for a better ""buy and hold"" than AMZN, which is a better seasonal trade. Still, other aspects of timing must be considered. For example, because of Amazon having multiple revenue sources, one of which being cloud services, we must ask ourselves whether these industries are growing.With cloud, the answer is ""yes,"" supporting a bullish long-term thesis for AMZN, the current leader in cloud. But also, if you believe a market crash is overdue and could happen this year, you might consider what will happen to AMZN and EBAY during this period. While it is easy to compare prices on the two sites and conclude that one might be cheaper than the other, a more rigorous investigation is warranted.By observing how both stocks acted during the last market crash, we should get a better idea as to which is the safer hold:Here, AMZN was the clear winner, rebounding rather quickly. Although the maximum drawdown for both stocks was similar, AMZN recovered prior to the end of the market crash period, implying that investors had faith that the company would do well in spite of a recession. EBAY was not so lucky.Answer: The timing seems better for AMZN.MonopolyDoes either company have a monopoly?In a way, both Amazon and eBay have monopolies. However, both companies have changed significantly since their inception. As an early adaptor of eBay, back in high school, I remember that all sales were performed by way of auction.Now, this is not so. My purchases on eBay today are all ""buy now"" purchases. I believe both bidders and sellers have caught onto the psychological phenomenon of bidding going higher than the market price in an auction. With the introduction of sites such as Amazon, non-unique items are often cheaper on the one-price-fits-all sites.Likewise, Amazon's hold on distinguishing retail customers is slipping as a result of many specialty online retailers. Many online retailers are strengthening their online marketing and social media game plans to build communities around their online stores. Much as how a fashionista wouldn't settle for buying her clothing at Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), niche retailers such as Birchbox, Fab.com, and Zulily (NASDAQ:ZU) have reeled in customers from the more generic Amazon.In addition to this change, Amazon sees much of its revenue coming from cloud services, which is also a slipping monopoly. Spread out on too many fronts, the company will inevitably lose at least one of its monopoly wars. Still, at present, it is the king of online retail in the Western world.Answer: The auction monopoly that eBay holds is becoming a smaller monopoly; the monopolies that Amazon holds are slipping away as a result of competition.DurabilityWill these companies have defensible market positions in the future?Auction lovers will likely still be using eBay ten years down the line. Even if we see niche auction sites pop up, they will probably not steal many of eBay's customers. In addition, the status that it attaches to seller accounts will keep many sellers using the platform because of the sunken cost bias, and as long as eBay has a wealth of sellers, buyers will continue to come looking for deals.eBay is a people business and much more of a community than Amazon. In addition, it comes with fewer rules and regulations than Amazon. This allows for the sale of more unique items and good deals on brand new items, which brings in a consistent audience.Amazon also has staying power, for reasons already stated (monopolies and market leadership). The company also managed to make it unscathed during the dot com boom, despite a -10 P/E at the time. People believe in Amazon because of its trustworthiness, in addition to its name recognition.In other words, Amazon has the people's trust - everyone, including my grandmother. eBay is a bit of a different story, as many still steer clear of it because of the rare threats of scams and because of a mistrust of PayPal. Many people, including myself, have had bad experiences with eBay, and some of those people refuse to get back on the horse - especially now that we have a car (in the form of Amazon).Amazon has the buyer's trust AND his credit card, which lowers the threshold for sales and increases the customer base willing to do business through the platform. As long as the company can keep that trust, its retail business will remain safe. The same goes for Amazon Web Services, but of course, that trust must be at a business-to-business level.Answer: Both companies have staying power, which implies that your investment should be made on other factors.Pairs Trade OpportunityOverall, I don't see much negative in either company. Clearly, we did pass an important pivot point in late 2014, at which point Amazon would have been the better buy for investors who must choose between AMZN and EBAY. Amazon continues to gain momentum, while eBay falls in popularity and in EPS.That said, a logical pairs trade on these two stocks would be to long AMZN and short EBAY. The short side of the trade is not necessarily a speculative trade against eBay as a company (though it can be, as revenue and earnings are falling). The short leg could just be seen as both an industry hedge and a market hedge.Honestly, I would feel safer in 2016 were I long AMZN and short EBAY, as opposed to being just long on AMZN.

Targeting convenience and customer service via a site redesign has resonated with users.Investors can expect revenue growth in the low-single digits and operating margins comfortably above the 30% mark. Low capital intensity and predictable cash flows speak to high business quality.Let's take a look at the firm's investment highlights as we walk through the valuation process and derive a fair value estimate for shares.","By The Valuentum TeamGlobal commerce and payments company eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) low capital intensity and predictable cash flow generation speak highly about its business quality. The company has performed well in mobile as of late, a strong sign for the future of the business as the world continues to be ""on the go."" Geographic expansion could offer meaningful growth opportunities moving forward as well; more than 40% of total gross merchandise volume (GMV) was still generated in the US as of 2015.Though we like eBay's fundamental prospects by itself, we maintain our view that a tie-up of Yahoo! (NASDAQ:YHOO) and eBay may be the best long-term picture for the two Internet-based firms. eBay's expected traditional free cash flow generation alone can pave the way for significant economic value creation as debt of the combined transaction is repaid. eBay also ""firmed up"" its full-year revenue outlook, and it is targeting traditional free cash flow of $2.2-$2.4 billion in fiscal 2016, in-line with the marks of each of the past three years. At the high end of the free cash flow guidance range for 2016, that's a free cash flow yield of ~8.5%. Can you imagine the revenue and cost synergies to be extracted in a Yahoo-eBay tie-up?eBay was once a core holding in our Best Ideas Newsletter portfolio, but we removed our position shortly after the split with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). eBay currently registers a 7 on the Valuentum Buying Index. We don't think eBay will remain by itself for long, particularly as suitors look at its free cash flow generation as a potential funding source for bigger and better things.eBay's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• eBay is a global commerce and payments company. The firm spun off PayPal into a separate publicly-traded company, and this report reflects the value of eBay on a standalone basis. Carl Icahn no longer holds shares in this security.• eBay is still a powerhouse even after letting go of its prized PayPal. During 2015, the firm processed $82 billion in gross merchandise value from ~162 million active buyers and over 25 million active sellers. It had 800 million listings. eBay's standalone revenue in 2015 was $8.6 billion.• The company's business continues its resurgence, with active user growth recently reaching levels not seen since 2007. Targeting convenience and customer service via a site redesign has resonated with users. Mobile performance has also been fantastic, with the company processing ~$35 billion in mobile gross merchandise value in 2015.• Investors can expect revenue growth in the low single digits and an operating margins comfortably above the 30% mark. Free cash flow is targeted in the range of $2.2-$2.4 billion in 2016, which could be a solid increase over 2015 levels. Low capital intensity and predictable cash flows speak to high business quality.• In fiscal 2016, eBay is expecting FX-neutral revenue growth of 2%-5%, or total revenue of $8.5-$8.8 billion. Strong operating margin between 31%-33% is expected to drive non-GAAP earnings per share to $1.82-$1.87.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital.The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. eBay's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 77.6%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.7%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.The concept of an economic moat - or sustainable competitive advantages - focuses purely on the sustainability and the duration of the competitive advantages that a firm possesses. The concept of an economic moat does notconsider the cumulative sum of a firm's potential future economic profit creation, but only that at some point in time in the future, a moaty company will continue to have an economic profit spread and a no-moat firm will not.Let's examine the problem that arises by focusing exclusively on companies that have economic moats, or sustainable and durable competitive advantages.Image Source: Valuentum; EVA is trademarked by Stern Stewart & CoIn the chart below, we show the probable path of eBay's ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. eBay's free cash flow margin has averaged about 27.6% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generationis relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At eBay, cash flow from operations decreased about 2% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 1% over the same time period.In the first three months of 2016, eBay reported cash flow from operations of ~$641 million and capital expenditures of ~$158 million, resulting in free cash flow of ~$483 million, less than half of free cash flow in the first quarter of 2015.Valuation AnalysisThis is the most important portion of our analysis. Below we outline our fair value assumptions as well as derive a fair value estimate for shares.Our discounted cash flow model indicates that eBay's shares are worth between $26-$40 each. Shares are currently trading at ~$24 per share, below the low end of our fair value range. This indicates that we feel there is more upside potential than downside risk associated with shares at this time.Both our top and bottom-line forecasts for 2016 and 2017 are in line with consensus estimates for eBay. We are expecting low to mid-single digit growth in revenue in the coming years, while operating efficiencies should help earnings growth outpace top-line growth. The low capital intensity of the firm's business is one of the drivers of its strong free cash flow generation, a large factor in our high opinion of the company, and we are expecting capital expenditures to remain near 8% of total revenue moving forward.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $33 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 20.7 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 12.9 times last year's EBITDA.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 3.4% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 1.3%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 39.8%, which is above eBay's trailing 3-year average.Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 1.8% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For eBay, we use a 9.7% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $33 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for eBay. We think the firm is attractive below $26 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $40 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate eBay's fair value at this point in time to be about $33 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of eBay's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $45 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $33 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

Turnarounds are usually associated with complicated adjustments. Here we think it is as simple as a shift in viewpoint.Historically eBay focused on listings and now by adjusting its perspective to fit listings into key product categories they are about to finally align with Google and the rest of the internet and correct its main reason for its decline.eBay identified the SEO issue as the main reason for the company's weakness and its fix should re-accelerate its active users (the company's key metric measuring the number of people who actually did something recently). The change is basic but can, potentially immediately, re-accelerate revenue growth. If topline re-accelerates, earnings will re-accelerate thanks to 20-30% margins that should move back up with faster topline.We think this is the type of turnaround situation that we look back on and say 'that was easy enough.'eBay does not have any serious operational issues. The need to show up in Google searches is forcing eBay to make the change. The shift has been stubbornly slow trying to be overly sensitive not to dislocate their core user listings. However, their sellers have been hurt, as we know, by reduced appearances on search engines.eBay, and its size should be an advantage for their sellers but instead their listing culture held them back from moving with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and the industry.2016 Should See SEO's Benefit To Sales2016 should be the first full year of a meaningful change to the company's 'product' and SEO focus. The company said 60% of its listings will be classified into product categories as of February to enhance showing up in SEO searches, doubling the number in a span of two quarters.Anybody who has any contact with the web knows how important is SEO and Google. eBay may be late but now that they are making the change, we think results can improve, potentially meaningfully.The company said that results will not turn quickly which we appreciate. We'd prefer the company to be conservative until we actually see it in the numbers. By investing in eBay, you have to believe that now that they finally decided on the switch, that their $2B in cash and $2B in free cash flow should be enough to help them figure out to how to fix their issues with Google.Last quarter active user growth was up 5% and stopped decelerating for the first time in many quarters. We think it is due in part to the SEO redirect.Low Hanging Fruit ChangesNot only does aligning the listings by product category help them with Google, but it helps people find products easier on eBay itself. This will make eBay easier to shop. This is a basic change that helps customers find eBay and find what they want on eBay. The company is now consistently talking about basic internet 101 fixes like adding product reviews, customer comments, and other basics that are found everywhere. Companies that migrate to industry standards, even when playing catching, tend to see benefits immediately. We call it 'low hanging fruit.'If the company had serious secular issues, we'd understand that this is a tough investment. But we think the fix is one of mindset and not a secular or competitive issue.Growth Rates May Accelerate Near TermeBay's largest quarter is Q4 and so the growth rates are the toughest to enhance. Now that we go into smaller quarters we think that the growth rates have a chance to pick up. That pick up would be meaningful because it would be the first time eBay saw a meaningful re-acceleration in some time. eBay has been stuck in a mid-single digit growth rate x-Fx for some time.We also think that the Holiday period was extremely competitive and that Q1 discounting could subside allowing topline to lift.The economy and the SEO changes coming in unison could allow for the numbers to look better.The dollar turning back down will also be another benefit for eBay. 60% of their sales come internationally and Fx cut 5% off of topline last quarter. With the dollar reversing, eBay's topline has another wind in the sails.ROE A Management FocusOne reason for the company's lower multiple is their 12% ROE. Back in F12-F13 the ROE was about 22%. If topline picks up there will be a disproportionate flow through to earnings also helping ROE. As the company puts the catch up spending behind them over the next year or two returns should also pick up.The company has also told the street that they are focused on buying back equity in place of debt which should also help the ROE calculation. They have already issued debt. They said they are limited in what they can do over the next two years to keep the PayPal split non-taxable but it's clear that the company's intention thereafter is to raise the return metrics. In the meantime the company seems to be hinting publicly that they will lean up to the PayPal limits pushing their Debt/Equity to the boundary in the meantime.Earnings Upside This YearThe company said that FX and spending will drag earnings. FX is now starting to turn in their favor. Spending and higher expenses will drag more early in the year. Q4 saw EBIT margin (non-GAAP) flattish for the year and down 230bp in Q4. The company is guiding to EBIT of 31-33% for F16 or down 150bp for the full year. We think that this can prove conservative. F15 saw a big change exiting PayPal and focusing spending on figuring out their issues. We think, starting in the second half they will begin to lap the uptick in spending. If topline performs above expectations in the first half, they should also better leverage earnings.ValuationGenerally investors decide valuation based on a combination of growth rates, margins, and ROE with fundamentals and positioning feeding into these key numbers. We think there is a chance for valuation to pick up as some of these metrics improve if they fix the SEO issue.The company expects earnings for F16 of $1.82-1.87 (non-GAAP) giving eBay a PE of 13x. Their peers are higher and we know that internet valuations can change quickly.ConclusionIf eBay can manage to recapture growth through their SEO focus, we think that investors will have to redirect attention to this key player. Investors will remember when eBay was a core holding and, on any report of re-acceleration, we believe, investors will quickly start to do the math of what the company is worth if they get back on a growth trajectory.Elazar Advisors, LLC specializes in earnings and predicts, analyzes and reacts to earnings and earnings events as well as developing current company and macro stories with a hedge fund perspective.If you want Elazar's analysis on Seeking Alpha, scroll to the top of the article and hit ""Follow.""

From that time on, I have continued using eBay to both buy and sell items. Yes, eBay is a popular platform and the competition it faces is fierce, specifically from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Though Amazon is another public company with huge investor interest, I leave it to growth investors due to its sky high valuation. For now, let's focus on eBay.eBay has been a lucrative investment for those who bought in its IPO or took a position when the company's shares have plunged (i.e. 2001 and 2009).Currently, eBay's shares are not cheap on a historical basis, but in the last three years, the share price has stayed mostly flat. Given this situation, further research was done to verify if investing in eBay is an opportunity.When a company's share price stays flat or worse it goes down in price, investors can interpret the situation unfavorably, leading to continued share decline or a stagnation. To combat this, fundamental research can lead to the conclusion that the stock is currently underpriced.eBay's MarginsAs with any business, margins are key to obtaining profitability. Fortunately, eBay has an impressive gross margin of almost 80%. Also, this gross margin has been stable for the last 10 years ranging from 68% to 79%. Going further down the income statement, eBay sports a decent operating margin of 26%, ranging from 8% to 26% in the last 10 years. Clearly, eBay is profitable and stable in its business operations.eBay's GrowthLast year, eBay did a spinoff of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). PayPal was known as eBay's crown jewel by many. This lead to an unfavorable opinion in eBay's shares ever since the spinoff as this has led to a decrease in revenue growth for eBay.Having a reduction in growth would mean a reduction in value for eBay. This arises since the company's future profits will not increase at the same pace as previously contemplated.For 2016, eBay expects to grow between 2-5%. Going forward, it is my opinion that growth can be sustained at the rate notified by management for the foreseeable future. This opinion arises from the following philosophy:Free Cash FloweBay thankfully makes cash and in a big amount. In the last three years, eBay made over $2 billion free cash flow per year. For a company valued at $28 billion with a decent future outlook, this leads to a price to free cash flow of ~12.72. A ratio of 12.72 is not a bargain figure but neither is it overpriced.eBay's Financial PositionOn the graph beneath ""eBay's Margins,"" interest coverage currently stands at 17.7. Per Investopedia.com (and my opinion), an interest coverage above 3 is seen as safe. At 17.7, eBay can pay its interest expense without raising doubts. Also, eBay currently has ~$6.7 billion in debt outstanding with another $2.25 billion about to be issued, leading to a total debt load of ~$10 billion. On the other side, eBay has ~$6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Clearly, eBay is in a very healthy financial position and more share buybacks could just be around the corner.ConclusionInvesting in eBay doesn't seem in my opinion as a high-risk investment. Rather, it looks as a rewarding and stable investment. To boost share performance, eBay could implement a dividend and/or continue doing share buybacks. Either-or, those actions will result in a favorable outcome for eBay shareholders.Source: All images and information were obtained from Morningstar and eBay's investor site (including 10-K).Additional Disclaimer: This post is solely my opinion and data and information contained is not intended to be investment or tax advice.

3958391,25265,2016-03-14T21:30:50-04:00,"eBay had a dismal Q4, and investors punished the stock as a result.However, the company's initiatives to reinvigorate growth in the marketplace are beginning to show signs of success.Even under a pessimistic scenario shares are too cheap today - the risk vs. reward is skewed to the upside.","eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) marketplace finished the year off in 2015 on a disappointing note. During the all-important holiday quarter, fx-neutral gross merchandise value (GMV) growth fell to paltry 4% - a very poor showing given the rate of e-commerce growth in the U.S. is 15%. ChannelAdvisor estimated that eBay's same-store sales growth in the U.S. slowed to a paltry 0.8% in December.Coupled with a lower take rate due to strong sales of electronics (the category has a lower take rate), fx-neutral revenue growth in the marketplace fell to just 1%. Marketplace accounted for nearly 84% of total revenues in 2015, so it was not surprising to see shares fall nearly 15% after the disappointing Q4 results were released.However, eBay is not giving up. The split from Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) last July has allowed the company to focus solely on its own priorities and what is best for it. eBay launched multiple initiatives in its marketplace business that it believes will jumpstart its growth rate. Let's briefly review each.Structured DataHistorically, a search on eBay has not worked well as results were disorderly. Today, eBay is rolling out tools to simplify its vast inventory and improve discoverability. For example, a search for Xbox One console will soon take the user to a product page, prioritizing quality results as opposed to quantity and variety.Product pages will enhance the user experience by simplifying search and improving discoverability. When Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) changed its search algorithms in May of 2014, it penalized eBay with lower placement in its search results because it decided not to prioritize listings that were likely to be out of stock in the near-term.The hope is that by structuring the data in a manner that creates product pages with many sellers versus just one seller, eBay will once again return to the top of search results. This remains to be seen, but eBay is doing what it can to work within the parameters of Google's algorithms. In the past, eBay management criticized Google's changes. That did not help the situation. It is best to do what this management team is doing now, which is embracing the changes and finding a way to work within the parameters of the search algorithms.In addition, eBay is now making use of product reviews and barcodes. Product reviews are a key feature on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Incorporating them into eBay is crucial and long overdue. This will certainly improve the buying experience. In addition, barcodes will become an important feature for both buyers and sellers. Sellers across the site will soon be able to scan a barcode and eBay will read the scan and automatically list the item's specifications.This makes selling much more seamless. Before this, all the details had to be entered manually. In addition, barcode scanning will become important for buyers. It can be used to call up product pages with all the purchase options as well as to see product reviews. These changes should also help with search engine optimization on Google and Bing.New Seller ToolsIt goes without saying that sellers are crucial to eBay's success. Addressing their concerns and keeping them happy is obviously extremely important. Many are already selling on Amazon as well and could close up shop on eBay if they get fed up. eBay is rolling out its first major upgrade to seller tools since the split from PayPal. Sellers can no longer be dinged with negative feedback from a customer if a package is delayed due to issues beyond the seller's control.In addition, the seller dashboard is getting a makeover, with enhanced analytics that leverages transaction data to help sellers better evaluate how well their business is performing on eBay (such as page views, click-through rates and conversion rates) as well as offering solutions designed to better target customers. If the new tools are well received, this will benefit both buyers and sellers… and ultimately shareholders.Early Signs of Progress EmergingAs I referenced earlier, ChannelAdvisor tracks sales on Amazon, eBay, Google Shopping and others in the U.S. and publicly reports the numbers each month. The data has been proven reliable in the past, at least based on my checks with eBay. 2016 is off to a good start after a dismal December for eBay. ChannelAdvisor estimates that sales grew 4.0% in January and 5.3% in February. If you include February 29th (leap year) in the year-over-year comparisons, sales grew by 9.5%. SourceWhile this growth is still below the rate of growth experienced in the first half of 2016, the trend is improving. If this can continue, it will show investors that the company's efforts around structured data and a renewed focus on sellers are paying off. However, eBay is still growing at a rate below that of e-commerce (15% according to ChannelAdvisor).Therefore, it is still ceding market share to Amazon and others, and so it has a long way to go to return to greatness. CEO Devin Wenig recently shares his thoughts on what eBay's rate of growth should be going forward. Here is an excerpt from the Goldman Sachs technology conference in February:Valuation, Capital Structure, and Possible AcquisitionsWhile 5% growth does not sound impressive for an e-commerce behemoth that should at least be maintaining its market share by growing at the overall market rate, it is enough for the company to easily hit the top of its fx-neutral revenue guidance for 2016.Since the initiatives underway at eBay are being rolled out globally, I would expect the rate of growth in the U.S. to approximate that in its other markets, as it did in Q4. Approximately 60% of revenues are generated outside the U.S. We also know that eBay's other major businesses (classifieds and StubHub) are growing at a significantly higher rate.StubHub's growth in Q4 was impressive, though not likely to be repeated. Still the trend is nicely positive. Classifieds have experienced steady growth, but it is monetized entirely outside to the U.S. so the strong U.S. dollar kept reported revenues essentially flat in 2015. Comparisons should ease in the second half of 2016, possibly sooner if the USD weakens against the British pound, euro, Korean won and Aussie dollar - eBay's major foreign markets.If you put it all together, fx-neutral top line growth of 5% should be easily attainable in 2016 if sales in marketplace average 5% growth over the course of the year. At 12.9x this year's earnings, the market is too pessimistic on the company's prospects. I believe that if eBay can deliver fx-neutral top line growth of 5-6%, coupled with a low 30s operating margin, the stock will trade back to a 15x P/E multiple in short order. The multiple was at 15x last fall after it reported encouraging Q3 results. If the company can return to 6-9% sales growth, which would exceed guidance, I suspect the stock will trade at an even higher multiple.The top end of guidance implies $2.4B in free-cash-flow generation in 2016 - a fantastic sum for a $28B market cap company. The company has already guided to ~$2.2B in stock buybacks in 2016 plus buybacks to offset dilution from stock-based compensation. At the current price, this level of buybacks would reduce shares outstanding by a very healthy 8%. If the company experiences any growth at all in 2016, it should have no trouble growing EPS by at least 10%.While the company is restricted in the amount of stock it can buyback in 2016 due to tax rules that govern the tax-free nature of the PayPal spin-off, those restrictions will roll-off beginning in 2017. The company has already discussed the possibility of adding a turn or more of leverage (a turn of debt is equal to 1x EBITDA) in order to buyback even more stock. This is what the CFO had to say about this on the Q4 earnings call.To that end, the company recently completed two debt offerings totaling $2.25B. If you subtract $850M that was really just replacing what was repaid in 2015, the company has $1.4B in net new debt. I believe it is safe to assume the majority of this new debt will be used for buybacks considering eBay has stated its intention to repurchase ~$2.2B in stock this year and as of December 31, it only had $1.5B in onshore cash with which to do so.It is also possible eBay uses some of its cash to make acquisitions. eBay has also stated its intention to continue to be an acquisitive company. I expect any acquisitions would focus on the fast growing ticketing and classifieds businesses. In StubHub, the CEO has stated eBay's intention to grow that business internationally. Acquisitions outside the U.S. would help accelerate growth and could potentially be a good use of off-shore cash.eBay could also look to make an acquisition in the U.S. classifieds space. eBay's Close5 app is gaining market share but there are several solid competitors in the space. eBay could look to acquire a competitor in an effort to more quickly dominate in the mobile marketplace. Craigslist opened the floodgates to competitors by not creating a mobile app. Acquiring one of Close5's competitors could potentially speed-up monetization efforts for classifieds in the U.S. eBay could also look to add to its classifieds success outside the U.S. by making targeted acquisitions. I do not expect the company will make a large acquisition in its marketplace business. That business is already dominant and highly profitable - it just needs some refining to reinvigorate growth.ConclusionsWhile eBay has certainly lost e-commerce market share, most notably to Amazon in recent years, it remains a dominant online portal with very high brand awareness. I do not believe the business is broken. This management team is now freed from PayPal and no longer needs to compete for investment dollars. The initiatives being put in place now should help the company return to 5-10% GMV growth in the next few quarters.If you assume a fairly stable take-rate, I fail to see how I can lose money buying the stock at this level. The company generates tremendous free-cash-flow, nearly all of which will be used to buyback stock. This should allow eBay to retire ~8% of shares outstanding in 2016 at the current stock price - meaning that eBay only needs to grow profits slightly during the year to generate double-digit growth in EPS.If the initiatives eBay is putting in place for the marketplace business work and the company continues to buy back similar levels of stock, I can easily see EPS growing 10% a year for the next several years. In that scenario, the stock should trade at a significantly higher multiple, in the 15x-17x range. If you assume $2 in EPS in 2017 (the Street is assuming $2.05), that puts the stock in the $30-$34/share range. There is upside to EPS should the dollar weaken. Even still, I think my downside is limited here.The bear scenario, as I see it, is that the structured data and seller initiatives do not work and the marketplace business continues to stagnate. Maybe the share price can drop to the low $20s, but given the balance sheet capacity, ongoing share buybacks, and strong free-cash-flow, I see shares supported in that range. There is also the possibility of an activist stepping in or a take-over/go-private transaction that will support shares. The cash flow is just too attractive to ignore with the stock in the low-$20s.So in conclusion, eBay is off to a solid start in 2016 according to the historically accurate sales data provided by ChannelAdvisor. It appears the initiates outlined earlier in this article to drive higher sales are beginning to bear fruit. The risk versus reward is favorable at this price. I'm a buyer of the stock at these levels."
3963302,67113,2016-04-05T13:45:42-04:00,"If SEO efforts bear fruit, they will make a sizable difference to the top line. Remember that no SEO improvements have been priced into the stock.I cannot see the dollar rallying alongside a rising stock-market. A weaker dollar is bullish for eBay's international markets.I believe the 200 week moving average of 23.14 offers good support here. Risk/Reward definitely to the upside.","There are just too many positives in my view to ignore eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) as an investment for the long term. Nevertheless, there is still a great deal of negativity among sellers who have got stung in the past and it is understandable because we are talking about people's livelihoods here. However, I feel eBay's risk to the downside is small for a variety of reasons.First of all, the stock is down over 12% year to date and is currently hovering around $24 a share. The stock has a present earnings multiple of just over 15 and forward earnings multiple of just under 12. This seems really cheap especially when you compare the stock to the current industry average of 31.7. Bears may state that eBay's price to sales ratio is currently too high (3.4) compared to the industry average (1.8) but one has to remember that this e-commerce company reported gross margins of almost 80% last year along with operating margins of 25.6% which were much higher than 5 and 10-year averages.Net income came in at $1.725 billion last year and free cash flow amounted to $3.37 billion. These are all excellent numbers for a company with a market cap of only $15 billion irrespective of how one ""feels"" about the company. The other important area to look at is the balance sheet. The cash balance of almost $2 billion and equity of $6 billion+ illustrates to me that long-term debt is not an issue. eBay is not a value trap and I believe future quarters will confirm this with its numbers.Speaking of earnings, the company announces its next set of numbers on the 27th of this month where the EPS forecasted is $0.45. This figure has been the main reason for the slide in the stock since the end of November, but the weakness in the dollar since then should act as a tailwind in the company's next set of earnings. Why? Well, the company derives 60% of its income from international markets, so a weak dollar would definitely decrease the cost of goods from US sellers (huge export market) for international buyers.If we enter a bubble phase in the stock market (NYSEARCA:SPY), I believe it will take place with a sustained dovish stance from the Fed which should result in a weaker dollar over time. This will benefit eBay but also in the sense that despite all the negativity surrounding this company, it still accounts for almost 10% of all online global retail sales which are expected to keep increasing meaningfully every year (see chart).Also, although active buyer growth has slowed, eBay's trailing 12-month number after the fourth quarter still came in at $162 million (5% rolling year growth) which again brings stability to the table. Why? Well, we all know how Google's Panda update seriously affected eBay's listings which decelerated growth but with last quarter's 5% number, that negative growth trend has come to an end. Furthermore, if eBay can get its SEO (Search Engine Optimization) efforts in gear, it would do wonders for the share price as I'm sure the market would price the stock much more favorably. Inflection points is what it is all about and we should know in the next few quarters whether the new listings now classified in the product categories since February will make a meaningful impact to sales or not. Mastering SEO is all about listings differentiation which is difficult for a company like eBay, but the difference between more first-page listings and second place listings would be substantial for eBay and its sellers alike.Source : eBay FillingsOn the technical chart, the 200-week average is acting as support (around the $23 level) and we may take another trip down there in the near future as the stock market is still in its timing band for a daily cycle low. In fact, futures are down 15 points as I write, so we may have some selling pressure over the next week or so, but as I have said in previous articles, I expect the market to charge higher. Wait for the 5-day RSI indicator on the S&P 500 to get oversold before pulling the trigger on eBay. If the stock gets crushed before it announces earnings later this month, it would be a good time to buy in my opinion. I will update here if or when we start scaling into this stock.To sum up, eBay is on my watchlist as it has sound fundamentals, an attractive valuation, and is operating in an industry that continues to grow. It recently penned an agreement with the Tianjin government in China to help Chinese enterprises export their products abroad. The market just needs to see new growth avenues and this may be one of them. I believe they will come which is why we may want to be in before the market wakes up to the fact.I'm going to be adding a few good dividend and growth stocks to the elevation portfolio over the next several weeks when I see value. It's imperative that they are not correlated and all don't have similar valuations to ensure that income is brought in every month, which, over time, will increase our share count.

3936766,98366,2016-02-27T08:00:11-05:00,We expect eBay to beat its own full year guidance this year.StubHub has the potential to be a major revenue driver in the future. We feel its revenue contribution now is a fraction of what it will become.Its move into being a primary ticket seller means it will fight for market share with Live Nation.At present we anticipate upside of 18% this year.,"When you think of e-commerce there are generally two companies that spring to mind. For us at least, these two companies are the behemoth that is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and online marketplace eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). In this article, our focus is on eBay and a number of reasons we believe it will produce earnings ahead of guidance this fiscal year.Shares of eBay have had a wild ride in the last twelve months. After settling on the low side, we see the shares as being a great buy currently, primed for strong shareholder returns this year. We believe the catalyst for these strong shareholder returns will be a full year earnings beat.We think the company will achieve this in a number of ways, which include user experience improvements, improved discoverability, the continued growth of StubHub and eBay Classifieds and a strong operating margin.Looking at the operating margin first. Although management narrowed its guidance range from 31% to 35% to 31% to 33%, we think it will hit the high end of the new guidance. The downward pressure that led to the revision comes from currency headwinds, which are here to stay unfortunately. But we feel management's desire to drive productivity will help it hit the high side.Source: StubHubStubHub is a place to buy and sell sports, music, theatre and live entertainment tickets. If we were Live Nations (NYSE:LYV) we would be worried by its rise. We absolutely love StubHub and can fully understand why it has grown at such a high rate. Revenue has grown 34% year-over-year, according to eBay's most recent earnings call.We think StubHub has much better functionality than Ticketmaster, and enjoy the way the local events are laid out. Although not unique to StubHub, as you can see on the image above, we do enjoy the feature that allows you to see the view from the seat you have chosen prior to purchase. There is nothing worse than purchasing a ticket only to arrive at the venue and be thoroughly underwhelmed by where you are sitting.But aside from this little feature, one key thing we really like is the ability to sell your tickets through StubHub. As the site actually gives you the option to sell the ticket immediately after buying, it is not inconceivable for the very same ticket to be recycled multiple times through the site with the company benefiting from a booking fee each time. Much like shares on the stock market, an opportunistic person might buy a relisted pair of tickets for a Beyonce show because they think they will go up in value closer to the time and sell them then. Within this scenario the same pair of tickets could bring four separate booking fees through to StubHub.Since management recently announced its move into being a primary ticket seller, we feel StubHub will be gunning for Live Nation. Although Live Nation has exclusive agreements with some events and venues, a decent portion of its $7.4 billion annual revenue, or 160.5 million ticket sales in 2015, will be up for grabs. We do feel StubHub has a great chance of eating into this revenue in the next few years as it competes for exclusive agreements.The company's first such agreement has been made with the Philadelphia 76ers for the 2016-17 NBA season. We would imagine plenty more agreements will be made during the quarter as the company grows its portfolio.In the last fiscal year StubHub contributed $725 million to eBay's total revenue of $8.6 billion, with 1.2 ticket sales per second. With the company expanding overseas, and now boasting a strong presence in the UK and Germany, we see the $725 million revenue this year as just a fraction of the potential revenue in store for the segment in the future.Improvements to the user experience and discoverability will be key to getting eBay's core segment growing. We like the design of eBay's homepage now. We find it to be actually quite interesting to browse around with a curated content feel to it. It definitely improved our experience and admittedly put us in front of a few items that were of interest to us, which we would never have thought of searching for. If our experience is indicative of the average consumer experience then we can see the top line growth getting a boost because of it.All in all, we see eBay's future as very promising. Its market-leading position and mobile app sets it apart from the rest in our opinion. Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) may attempt to steal some of its B2C business, but we, like many, are not in the habit of heading to Alibaba for our shopping needs at present. So, for the medium-term at least, we don't see Alibaba as a huge threat.In the last few years, excluding extraordinary items, the shares have traded at around 14 to 15 times earnings. We feel more than comfortable paying 15 times earnings for eBay's stock. This is slightly higher than the median price to earnings ratio for the S&P 500, which sits at 14.62, but we expect its earnings growth to exceed that of the market average, so feel this to be more than reasonable.For the full year we expect earnings to come in above the guidance offered by management in its recent presentation. At that point management guided to earnings per share of $1.82 to $1.87, but we feel quite bullish and forecast for earnings to come in at $1.90 per share.At 15 times earnings this gives us a price target of $28.50, which is upside in the region of 18%. Incidentally, this price target puts it close to its 52-week high of $29.83."

Source: Earnings slides.Micron jumps after SK Hynix forecasts strong Q2 growth, 2016 capex declineApple suppliers sell off after Apple and Cirrus Logic's earningsNotable Tech NewseBay higher after Q1 beat, mixed Q2/2016 guidance - eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is still losing share to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others, but it did deliver 4% Y/Y sales growth in Q1 after posting roughly flat sales growth in Q4. Q2 revenue guidance of $2.14B-2.19B (4-6% growth in constant currency) is favorable to a $2.14B consensus, while EPS guidance of $0.40-0.42 is below the $0.44 consensus. Full-year sales guidance of $8.6B-8.8B (3-5% growth in CC) is in line with an $8.73B consensus.eBay's GMV rose just 1% Y/Y to $20.5B (compares with ~15% e-commerce industry growth), and its Marketplace transaction revenue fell 2% to $1.5B. However, StubHub revenue rose 34% to $177M, classifieds revenue (driven by Europe, where Craigslist isn't dominant) rose 15% to $186M, and non-transaction Marketplace revenue (e.g., ads) rose 17% to $274M. $1B worth of buybacks gave a boost to EPS.Corning sells off after Q1 sales miss, Gorilla Glass guidance cut - Corning's (NYSE:GLW) Q1 sales missed estimates due to the $100M impact of ""manufacturing software implementation issues"" on its Optical Communications (optical fiber and related products) business. That led Optical revenue to drop 13% Y/Y to $609M. However, the company expects the division's sales to rise over 20% Q/Q in Q2 and be up over 10% Y/Y in 2H16.Likely bothering investors more: Corning now expects Specialty Materials (the Gorilla Glass division) revenue to grow by a mid- to high-single digit % in 2016, below prior guidance for a low-teens growth rate for 2016. Specialty Materials revenue was down 17% Y/Y in Q1 to $227M, but that was only a little worse than guidance for a mid-teens decline. The division's sales are expected to be up by a low-single digit % in Q2. Slowing smartphone growth - Gorilla Glass is used by Apple, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), and many other mobile OEMs - is clearly weighing, and a weak tablet market doesn't help either. Apple's earnings (released after Corning's) drive home the challenge.Elsewhere, Corning's core Display Technologies (LCD glass) business remained pressured by weak PC/TV demand, with sales declining 13% to $705M on a dollar basis and 17% in constant currency. However, high-single digit Q/Q glass volume growth and modest price declines are expected in Q2, and Corning still sees demand for larger TVs driving an 8-10% 2016 increase in retail glass volume. LCD glass isn't anyone's idea of a high-growth business, but sales appear set to bottom.Nokia spending $191M to buy French wearables/fitness gadget maker Withings - Withings' products include fitness trackers, watches with integrated fitness trackers, home cameras, and ""smart"" thermometers, scales, alarm clocks, and blood pressure monitors. Nokia (NYSE:NOK) talks up Withings' exposure to a growing IoT/wearables market, and suggests the Nokia brand will be used by future Withings hardware. The deal could spell a little more competition for Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), but Fitbit is already squaring off against plenty of rivals.Withings' Activité Steel watch/fitness trackerGradually, Nokia is making its way back into consumer hardware. The company has already said it's looking to license Android phone designs (along with the Nokia brand) to third-party manufacturers, and is selling its $60K OZO VR camera array to video pros. Disney (NYSE:DIS) announced yesterday it's using the OZO to produce 360° content.YouTube rolls out new iOS/Android home page with improved recommendations - YouTube's tiny thumbnails and multiple lists for recommended videos are replaced with much larger thumbnails in a single list. The company seems to be channeling Facebook's news feed here. Perhaps more importantly, YouTube has overhauled its recommendation algorithm, which relies on AI/machine learning, to provide fresher and more relevant content. ""Our experiments show that users really like this design,"" says a YouTube executive.YouTube's new iOS/Android home page. Simpler than what preceded it.YouTube testing unskippable 6-second ""Bumper"" ads - Bumper ads are very different from YouTube's standard TrueView ads, which (along with mobile search) have fueled much of Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) paid click growth. TrueView ads can run much longer than six seconds, but often give users the option to skip following a short amount of time (YouTube records a ""paid click"" if a user watches the ad in full).The Bumper format could do well on mobile (now responsible for over half of YouTube's video views), where attention spans can be shorter and patience for longer ads limited, and appeal to brand advertisers looking to quickly make an impression. A Google executive states: ""In early tests, Bumpers drove strong lift in upper funnel metrics like recall, awareness and consideration-complementing TrueView's strength in driving middle and lower funnel metrics like favorability and purchase intent.""Google, Ford, and Uber take part in self-driving car lobbying coalition - The coalition says it will ""work with lawmakers, regulators and the public to realize the safety and societal benefits of self-driving vehicles."" The effort comes ahead of NHTSA self-driving car guidelines expected in July. With autonomous driving a potential regulatory minefield - questions about local/state traffic laws, insurance payments, and automaker/driver liability all come into play here - there's a clear motivation for those leading the charge to push for unambiguous federal guidelines on how to proceed. Especially with Chinese autonomous driving efforts receiving strong government support.Google steps up efforts to win over mid-sized businesses using Microsoft Office - In October, Google announced it won't charge enterprise customers adopting Google Apps for Business until their enterprise agreements for Microsoft Office (NASDAQ:MSFT) or another rival solution runs out, and that it'll help cover Apps deployment costs (up to $25 per user). It's now offering similar incentives to mid-sized businesses, and also offering to pay for an Apps ""security workshop"" (provided by partners).Google says nearly 200K business users have adopted Apps since the October incentives were unveiled. That's not a massive number relative to the size of the global Office base - Office 365 claims 22.2M paid consumer subscribers alone. Though Apps has certainly seen some traction thanks to its aggressive pricing and real-time collaboration features, Office still has some major advantages - strong familiarity among office workers and IT pros, a large ecosystem of apps and plugins that integrate with the Office suite, and the fact Office 365 supports both on-premise PC apps to go with cloud and mobile apps.WSJ: FTC extends Android-related Google probe - The news comes a week after the EU formally charged Google with violating antitrust law through its required bundling of various apps/services with Android. Google has countered by arguing it provides Android for free, and the revenue produced by bundled apps/services allows it to recover the costs of developing and supporting the OS. The WSJ reports the FTC (which hasn't yet charged Google over Android) has met with multiple companies, and is ""hoping to access some of the evidence behind European regulators' case.""Fortinet jumps on Q1 beat, strong billings/guidance - The security appliance vendor beat Q1 estimates and reported billings of $330.5M, up 30% Y/Y and above guidance of $315M-322M. It also guided in its earnings slides (.pdf) for Q2 revenue of $301M-306M and 2016 revenue of $1.262B-1.272B, above consensus estimates of $300.8M and $1.25B. Q2 EPS guidance is slightly below consensus, but full-year guidance above. Full-year billings guidance has been hiked to $1.52B-1.53B and implies 24% growth.There could be some positive read-through for Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) rivals Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and Check Point (NASDAQ:CHKP). The high performance of Fortinet's hardware (enabled by proprietary ASICs) has helped it take share in a very competitive firewall/security appliance market, and the company is also benefiting from a healthy security IT spending environment. Ahead of its Q1 report, Fortinet unveiled a security architecture in which the company's products and third-party hardware/software share intelligence and feed data into a common security policy engine.Accenture partners with machine data analytics leader Splunk - Accenture's (NYSE:ACN) IT consultants will help clients use Splunk's (NASDAQ:SPLK) machine data analytics software to ""improve business outcomes by mining vast amounts of application and operational data to identify trends and improvement opportunities that were previously difficult to detect."" They'll also provide packaged solutions, such as one that pairs Splunk's software with Accenture's managed security services. The deal gives Splunk a major reseller partner, and could help it drive more use cases outside of its mainstay IT operational intelligence market.AMD officially launches $1,500, VR-friendly, Radeon Pro Duo graphics cards - The Pro Duo, first announced in March, contains two high-end GPUs based on AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) Fiji architecture (launched last year). With the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive having just launched, AMD is going to great lengths to talk up its efforts to optimize the Pro Duo's VR performance (both for using VR headsets and creating VR content).AMD's Radeon Pro Duo, liquid cooling and allBenchmarks show the Pro Duo soundly outperforming cards based on AMD's Fury X GPU (the company's former top-of-the-line solution, launched in mid-2015), and AMD claims a 50% performance advantage over cards based on Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Titan X GPU (officially priced at $999). Cards based on AMD and Nvidia's next-gen architectures (Polaris and Pascal, respectively) are due in the coming months.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3876276,25228,2016-02-08T18:39:16-05:00,"eBay has previously been known as a fast growing business with a high valuation multiple.Recently, that has changed significantly, as the growth prospects and valuation are quite different.Still, many income investors avoid the security due to its lack of a dividend.This article details how you can generate income by ""Buying It Now"" or ""Bidding"" on shares.","For a long time, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) showed exceptional growth to go along with a very high valuation to match. Back around the turn of century, the company was earning around a penny per share on a split-adjusted basis, as compared to well over $2 per share during the last few years. During the tech bubble, the P/E ratio was easily in the triple digits. And even in the last decade, the average earnings multiple had been in the low-to-mid 20s.A lot has changed since then. The company spun off PayPal in July of 2015 and the growth prospects certainly are not as robust as they once were. Yet, today you still have a company trading at a low double-digit multiple with a sturdy balance sheet. Moreover, eBay continues to generate substantial profits and is still expected to churn out more earnings through the years.In other words, the lower share price recently could simultaneously indicate a lower ""investment bar"" should the company begin growing again. You can make a case that it's a company that you could be interested in partnering with.Of course, the seeming problem for an income investor is that eBay does not currently pay a dividend. The company has been active on the share repurchase front and an eventual dividend payment has been speculated, but at present the dividend yield equals zero. Thus, income investors routinely take a pass, never considering the security as a potential investment.Yet, this doesn't have to be the case. You can both own (or agree to own) shares and derive cash flow from doing so. Let's explore two ways that you could accomplish this.""Buy It Now""eBay is known as a bidding site, but the business has a feature where you don't have to mess around with this. It's called ""Buy It Now."" Instead of bidding and waiting, thinking about reserves, bidding again, etc., often you can select ""Buy It Now"" at a given price and be on your way.The stock market also has this feature; it's called a market order. You could mess around with inputting bids (limits) and hoping your price is met, or you could agree to transact at whatever the going rate happens to be at the time.Presently, the ""Buy It Now"" price or closing market price for eBay is $23.20. So it would cost you $2,330 or so to purchase 100 shares of the company, using round numbers including transaction costs. You now have a small underlying earnings claim on the business. Of course, we haven't yet derived cash flow from owning the security.In order to generate income, you could sell a covered call on your 100 shares - agreeing to sell at a given price some time in the future. Here's a look at some available call options for eBay:I used the January 20th, 2017 expiration date for the premiums noted above. I have no affinity for this expiration, but it gives you an idea of what is available on an annual basis. The ""net"" premium uses the most recent bid less $0.25 for transaction costs and fluctuations.As an example, if you owned 100 shares of eBay and agreed to sell them at a price of $25 in the next year, you would receive $185 upfront for doing so. Here's a look at the same information presented in a slightly different manner:With this table, you have the same strike prices and premium from above being used. The ""premium yield"" column details the amount of upfront cash flow that you could receive by making the agreement. The ""max gain"" column details the maximum gain that you could receive, including the strike price and premium.This table puts to rest the notion that you cannot own shares of a company like eBay and simultaneously generate cash flow. You could receive a 7.9% upfront yield for agreeing to a maximum 15% gain or a 2.1% yield for agreeing to a maximum 30%+ gain in less than a year, as examples. Moreover, the cash flow would be immediate for agreement that may never play out. (Premiums can be taxed at different rates than dividends, but it nonetheless is cash available to you.)Selling a covered call does not prevent against loss, but it does help boost lower returns. Should shares stagnate, decline or even increase up to your strike price, you would have preferred to sold the call. You still keep your shares, but you also received upfront cash.The true risk involved relates to the potential opportunity cost of ""capping"" your gains. Should you agree to sell at $25 and shares jump to $30, you're stuck selling at $25. This is a very real risk and underlines the idea that you need to be happy with either outcome of the agreement.""Bid""Of course, eBay isn't eBay without bidding. Just as you could bid for a new set of silverware, you can do the same thing with shares of eBay (and get paid for doing so to boot). Here's a look at available put options, using the same expiration and ""net"" methodology as described above:In this case, the strike prices represent the price at which you would be agreeing to buy shares within the next year. The premium represents the upfront cash flow that you would receive for making this agreement. So as an example, you could get paid ~$119 for agreeing to buy someone else's 100 shares at a price of $20 in the next year.Here's a look at that same information with some additional metrics:This table shows the same strike prices as above, using the same ""net"" premiums for selling a put option. The ""premium yield"" column details the amount of upfront cash you would receive based on the amount of capital you need to set aside. So as an example, if you agree to buy at $20 you need $2,000 (plus transaction costs) set aside. If you receive ~$119 for doing so, that equates to a 6% yield on your capital.The cost basis column illustrates the price you are agreeing to after you take out the upfront premium. The final column shows you the discount that this would represent based on the current price. As the discount increases, the likelihood of shares reaching this mark decreases, and thus, the premium other investors are willing to pay you becomes less and less.The important thing to keep in mind is that you are agreeing to buy shares in this scenario. It works a lot like bidding. If you believe the current price is fair, you could sell a put option near the current price. If you would like to own shares at a lower price, you could sell a put option at a strike price below the current market bids.The risks are similar here in that a negative return is not prevented and there's nothing requiring the agreement to transact. Should you agree to buy shares at a price of $22.50 and shares jump to $30, your option would go unexercised and you might be kicking yourself for not just buying shares.Once more it should be clear that you could derive income from this arrangement. In this case, you would be setting aside funds to potentially buy shares and get paid upfront for doing so. With the put options, you could agree to buy at a 12% to 36% discount and also collect a 1% to 10% yield on that capital you set aside.In short, for the income investor I'd imagine that you wouldn't have given eBay more than a few minutes of thought. You likely know the business, remember that the share price was quite volatile/lofty around the turn of the century and found out that the security doesn't pay a dividend. What's next? Yet, that doesn't have to be the case.By using the ""Buy It Now"" feature in the market and selling a covered call, you can both own shares and receive cash flow for doing so. In this particular case, you could generate a 2% to 8% yield by agreeing to sell at a 15% to 30% higher price. Alternatively, by ""bidding"" on shares - selling a put option - you could generate a 1% to 10% yield for agreeing to buy shares at a lower price. Naturally, there are many more possibilities, but the idea is that you can both own or bid on non-dividend paying stocks and still generate sizable cash flows."
3921686,20521,2016-02-23T15:35:00-05:00,"eBay's recent results were unimpressive, and concerns about its ability to deliver loom large again.Right now, the market is not happy with the results, and the stock fell 14% post the results announcement.EBAY would need to do a lot more to convince the market that it has strong growth potential.","After spinning off PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) last year, the market was worried about eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) ability to sustain sound performance. After a couple of quarters of impressive results, the market's worries appear to have caught up with eBay. The recent results were unimpressive, and concerns about its ability to deliver loom large again.eBay's FinancialseBay's Q4 revenues were flat for the year at $2.32 billion, in line with the Street's expectations. EPS of $0.50 also was in line with the market's forecast for the quarter.During the quarter, the gross merchandise volume (GMV) of goods sold came in at $20.7 billion, translating to $1.9 billion in revenues. Its active buyer base grew 5% over the year to a total of 162 million at the end of the year.eBay ended the year with revenues falling 2% over the year to $8.6 billion. Transaction revenues brought in $6.83 billion and marketing services and other revenues contributed $1.76 billion to the year. eBay's full-year 2015 earnings came in at $1.83 per share. One silver lining was StubHub's growth. It reported a growth of 30% in GMV last year to more than $1 billion and brought in $725 million in revenues.The year's performance was hurt due to a security breach that forced nearly 112 million customers to change their passwords. Changes in the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) algorithm also resulted in eBay's results being ranked lower in search result rankings during the year.For the current quarter, the company forecast revenues of $2.05-2.1 billion with an EPS of $0.43-0.45. The Street was looking for revenues of $2.16 billion for the quarter with an EPS of $0.48.eBay's WorriesBesides the outlook, the market is not happy with eBay's competition. It has not just the constant shadow of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but several other worries. One big concern is eBay's consumer dissatisfaction over sales fees. The company charges a 10% fee whereas niche sites such as Reverb.com, a musical instrument sales site, charges a 3.5% flat fee per item sold. Amazon's selling fee ranges from 6% to 15% depending on the product sold through its site.eBay also is lagging in its social connection. Smaller players like Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) and Poshmark allow users to share purchases and comments on social platforms - something that eBay doesn't allow. Then, there is Alphabet. Not only does eBay get hurt by Alphabet's algorithm changes, but Alphabet's Buy Now button released last year makes those search result rankings count even more. Google's mobile search results now show a buy button that simplifies the process of purchasing directly through a search result.eBay's Marketplace ImprovementsTo counter these pressures, eBay has been investing in its marketplace site. One big move has been in the form of data structuring where products are organized in catalogs. As of December last year, the company announced that 37% of relevant listings had been migrated to this Structured Data set-up. A quarter ago, that number stood at 28%. By the end of this month, EBAY expects it to grow up to 60%. It believes that the data structuring is helping it in improving conversions and drive higher organic traffic from searches.eBay also is improving the user experience for its seller community. It recently launched Sellers Hub, an analytic tool that provides a detailed analysis on sellers' listing performance along with tools for product management. eBay released the product in October last year to mixed reactions. While the Sellers Hub does offer a better mobile experience and detailed statistics, some believe that it also adds to the workload of the seller because of the number of steps needed to reach the right place.eBay would need to do a lot more to convince the market that it has strong growth potential. Right now, the market is not happy with its results, and the stock fell 14% post the result announcement. It is currently trading at $24.24 with a market capitalization of $28.6 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $29.83 in December last year and a 52-week low of $21.52 earlier this month."
3599766,20521,2015-10-23T17:40:28-04:00,,"Earlier this week, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) announced their first ever quarterly results post spinning off PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Any concerns about there being life for eBay after PayPal were put to rest by the announcement of the latest quarterly results, which surpassed market expectations.eBay's FinancialseBay's third quarter revenues fell 2% over the year to $2.1 billion, ahead of the Street's expectations of $2.09 billion. EPS of $0.43 was also ahead of the market's forecast of $0.40 for the quarter.During the quarter, the gross merchandise volume (GMV) of goods sold fell 2% over the year to $19.6 billion. The drop in the GMV was attributed to foreign currency fluctuations. eBay added net 8 million active users to end with 159 million active buyers.For the current quarter, eBay forecast revenues of $2.28 billion - $2.33 billion with an EPS of $0.47-$0.49. The Street was looking for revenues of $2.33 billion for the quarter with an EPS of $0.48. eBay expects to end the year with a growth of 3%-5% on an FX-neutral basis and an EPS of $1.80-$1.82.eBay's Marketplace ImprovementsOf late, eBay has been making several improvements to their marketplace site. Inspired by the success of Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime offering, eBay is now experimenting with a similar service for their users. Currently, they are testing a same day delivery service in Germany under the program eBay+. Consumers who wish to opt for this service will be charged $17-$22 per year. They also have tied up with Argos in the UK to offer same day pick up services to their UK customers. Through their tie-up, goods sold through eBay's merchants online will be available for customers to pick up immediately at Argos stores. According to a BI Intelligence research report, the US same-day delivery market is projected to grow from $0.10 billion in 2014 to $4.03 billion in 2018, translating to an annual growth rate of 150%. eBay is looking to tap into this high growth market through these innovative services. Despite their measures, eBay will find it difficult to make an impression in the market. Amazon already is a front-runner in the market with Amazon Prime and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) making their presence felt with Google Express.Earlier last quarter, eBay also announced the acquisition of Twice, an online consignment store for women's clothing, for an undisclosed sum. Financial performance for Twice is not known. Prior to the acquisition, they had raised $23 million to set up an online portal to sell used clothes and accessories from leading brands such as Zara, Ann Taylor and Gap. The company had failed to build a strong customer base and was looking for an acquirer. The acquisition is expected to help eBay expand their Valet offering. eBay Valet is an assisted selling service that allows buyers to use eBay's services to sell used goods. Currently, eBay's Valet has nearly 100,000 customers.eBay's stock is trading at $27.58 with a market capitalization of $33.6 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $29.35 in July this year."
3918346,22989,2016-02-23T01:38:12-05:00,eBay tapped the bond market with $750 million of $25 par bonds.The bonds have a forty year maturity and is callable after five years and have a 6% coupon.This is the only retail focused income security from eBay and therefore worth a look.,"On February 23rd, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) tapped the debt market, raising $750 million in forty year bonds. What was interesting about this sale is that eBay issued ""baby bonds"", or bonds with a $25 par value.Why is this unique? Typically, a company with the size and ratings of eBay would issue $1000 par bonds and larger institutional investors would come in and scoop up the bonds. Selling $25 par bonds typically requires more time to get the deal done. This is, I presume, the reason the issue was only $750 million instead of a billion or more.The details of the issue are:The prospectus can be found here, the term sheet here.In order to determine if the new issue has any value, we have to look at the outstanding debt of eBay:As the above table shows, the new issue is approximately 43 basis points cheaper than the $1000 par 2042 bonds. Keep in mind that the duration is nearly equal as the 2042 bonds have a 4% coupon and the 2056 have a 6% coupon. This is why the 2042's trade at a $78 dollar price.A view of the credit curve (yield/years) of eBay:As the chart above shows, the various issues price right on the curve, meaning there is no issues cheap to the eBay complex.Next, a look at the new issue versus not only the other bonds of the issuer, but of online Goliath Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), mega-retailer Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and similarly rated AT&T (NYSE:T):As the above table shows, the new eBay bonds trade cheap to these peers which, in my opinion, is appropriate given the business model and resources of the peers relative to eBay.The peer credit curve shows that eBay trades cheap to this peer group:If the yield is measured on a interest rate risk relative basis (basis points per unit of duration), eBay looks even cheaper. It is important to realize that with the shorter maturities, the compensation per unit of risk is greater, which is merely a function of the tenor:Bottom Line: If an investor would like to diversify their income portfolio into the retail sector, these new eBay bonds might appear interesting. The discounted dollar price of the 2042's might also be attractive for the ""par sensitive"", although they are more institutional focused. It is important to realize that these are not preferred stock, they pay interest instead of a dividend and therefore have a different tax consequence. While I believe that these could help diversify an income portfolio, I also believe that there are other sources of income available that may offer an investor greater upside."
3815986,67313,2016-01-18T11:15:50-05:00,"eBay will report on January 27 with consensus expecting $0.50 in EPS and $2.33b in revenue.Recent data from ChannelAdvisor continues to highlight revenue growth challenge due to competition from AMZN. Additionally, brand re-positioning is unlikely to be successful due to inconsistent user experience.Prefer AMZN in North American ecommerce. Like BABA on a global basis.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) will report its 4Q15 results on January 27. Consensus expects $2.32b in revenue and $0.50 in EPS. Management guided a soft Q4 with $2.27-$2.32b in revenue that was below the consensus $2.33b, suggesting no material rebound in operating metrics. Similar to the prior quarters, analyst estimates have been largely conservative, which gives the company some room to deliver an earnings surprise. Recall that last quarter the stock was up +9% on the earnings beat. However, let us not forget that most of the beat was driven by a large cut in sales and marketing and I do not believe that this trend is sustainable given the investment eBay has to undertake to improve its brand perception among consumers to more than just a marketplace for used or discounted goods. More importantly, GMV remained stagnant, suggesting that the competitive environment remains challenged given the momentum seen by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and offline retailers shifting to an online model. Finally, there is always the long-term risk from the potential entry into North America by Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). That said, I remain cautious on eBay ahead of the results. My preferred e-commerce pick in North America remains AMZN but have a bias on BABA for the longer-term outlook.The issue with eBay is that the segment continues to face unrelenting competitive pressure from AMZN that continues to command a superior brand and perception than eBay among consumers. Additionally, offline retailers such as including Wal-Mart and Target are expected to increase focus on ramping up e-commerce, adding further pressure to eBay's growth outlook. I often believe that without additional investment in its core business or pursuing M&A, eBay could continue to face headwinds in 2016.Recent data from ChannelAdvisor showed that eBay's Cyber Monday y/y growth of +3% was considerably weaker than the +26% that AMZN reported. While I acknowledge that a single data point is not representative of the entire quarter, Cyber Monday's sale is more or less on track with the company guidance of low digit and flattish growth. In the near term competitive pressure will continue to compress eBay's growth profile that will be lower than that of the market average. More important, eBay's inconsistency in product search and fulfillment relative to that of AMZN's will continue to drive its user base to competing sites. Long-term speaking, eBay's repositioning to become a B2C destination will be challenged.What will make me change my long-term view on the stock? Despite facing multiple challenges, I believe that eBay commands some M&A value as companies such as Alibaba and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) look to expand in North America. Note that both BABA and JD are interested in North American expansion. BABA's intention of expanding in the US is evident from its prior establishment of 11 Main (which was later shut down) and its expansion of cloud services for the US and potentially Chinese merchants. JD recently invested in Wish, further highlighting its interest in gaining US exposure.eBay offers a solid e-commerce platform for BABA or JD to operate on and compete against AMZN once the public has a better perception of the company and its products. However, such an M&A catalyst may not be worthwhile for investors to wait for and as such I recommend investors put their money into the more stable names such as BABA and AMZN. Between the two, my preference is on BABA given that it's pursuing an ecosystem-oriented e-commerce model similar to that of AMZN, and I view this model to be highly sustainable and scalable."
3794886,98366,2016-01-07T00:22:36-05:00,"eBay was taken off the Goldman Sachs Conviction Buy list due to only offering 14% upside, now that it offers 25% upside it could find its way back onto the list.eBay continues to see increases in active buyers, which should support sustained earnings growth.The company's repurchase plan still has $2.4 billion remaining.","Since eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) was taken off the Conviction Buy list by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), due to only offering 14% upside compared with the 31% upside other stocks had, market volatility has taken the share price down to $26.41. So now, ceteris paribus, with a price target of $33 and upside of 25% could we soon see it back on the list?Background:One of the world's largest online trading communities and most recognizable brands, eBay creates a powerful marketplace for the sale of goods and services by a passionate community of individuals and small businesses locally, nationally and internationally.Our thoughts:We think eBay is a great company with prospects to match. Right now we believe it is just waiting for a trigger to send it higher and being added back onto the Conviction Buy list, which often has the effect of sending a stock higher, could be just the ticket. But then there's also a lot more to the stock than just waiting to be added to a list.Being a multinational company at this time is difficult though with the strong US dollar, as eBay found out in Q3. Like many other multinational companies, eBay's revenue was down 2% year-over-year, but up on a constant-currency basis by 4%.Moving forward:Whilst the top line is vitally important, due to currency fluctuations, we don't feel it is the good measure to evaluate the company's performance at the moment. Currently we like to look at the Active Buyers metric as part of our analysis, because being a customer-based number it isn't subject to currency changes that inflate or deflate it year over year.Source: Company presentationAs you can see above there has been continuous steady growth in active buyers since Q2 in 2014. On the Q3 call management explained that it has invested in the growing India market and believes it has started to pay off. We see the emerging middle class in India as being a highly rewarding market in the future for the company.The company has been collecting product data from sellers as inventory is listed, and has used machine learning to process it into a form that can be leveraged to improve user experiences. We are encouraged by this and see any improvement to user experience as a huge positive. The CEO, Devin N. Wenig added that:""A robust commerce platform also means diversified sources of traffic and user acquisition. Along these lines, we continue to expand our use of social channels, and traffic from these channels saw significant growth in Q3. We're now consistently leveraging 10 unique social channels on a regular basis."" A great improvement we think.The second key strategic priority that eBay has is to create a vibrant marketplace. Changes to its seller policy will reward sellers who provide great service to buyers. This is a win-win situation for us. We believe sellers providing high levels of customer service will create great experiences for buyers that encourage repeat visits.A new product called Sellers Hub should prove popular with sellers due to the deep data insights and selling recommendations it provides. Early indications point to a good response from sellers, according to the Q3 call.Source: eBayFinally, though it is by no means new in the market, we do like the new improved mobile app and feel it does exactly what it needs to do without being at all complex. This should encourage strong adoption by both buyers and those new to eBay. We see notifications as an invaluable way of boosting sales and keeping people engaged and informed.The company has strong levels of free cash flow, a current ratio of 1.86, and a quick ratio 1.329, giving it a very robust position which supports the remaining $2.4 billion stock repurchase plan.Overall, we see a lot of positivity emanating from eBay and expect it to still be the case in the years ahead. For us it seems like a low risk investment with high reward potential.Valuation:Due to eBay's high level of liquidity and growth prospects we are prepared to pay a slight premium to the market median price to earnings ratio of 14.61 times earnings, and would venture as high as 15.5 times earnings.Based on analyst estimates of diluted earnings per share of $1.83 for fiscal 2015, we believe the fair value of the stock right now is $28.37. Looking ahead to fiscal 2016 we believe the company will beat the average consensus of $1.97, and hit the $2.05 mark, giving us a one-year price target of $31.78. This equates to a return of 20% from the last price of $26.41.Whether or not Goldman Sachs adds the stock back onto the Conviction Buy list, we still believe the stock will appreciate by 20% in 2016. It just might get there a little bit quicker if it does make the list."
3893536,92296,2016-02-12T18:57:10-05:00,"EBay's two segments StubHub ticket resale and Classifieds have the potential to continue to grow at double digit rate in the near future.Despite the slow growth of its core Marketplace, EBay is seeing strong growth in its Classifieds and Stubhub ticket sales business.Strong positive free cash flow with high operating margins and a stock repurchase plan offer long-term investors certain value opportunities.","While eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) Marketplace has continued to see stalled growth, two other segments that eBay operates show impressive potential moving forward. eBay's mobile classifieds business with mobile app Close5 and Stubhub, eBay's ticket sales marketplace. After a split with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Enterprise last year, eBay stock has plummeted 24% to $22.eBay reported its annual earnings for 2015 this month. Sales revenue declined 2%, which includes its core business Marketplace sliding 3.6%, StubHub increased 15%, and Classifieds dropped 2%. However, excluding a negative impact due to the strong US dollar, all of its three segments revenues grew at a FX neutral basis. The three segments: Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds grew at 5%, 15% and 15% rate, respectively, year-over-year. Although StubHub and Classifieds each accounted for only 8% of eBay's total revenue, both segments have strong potential to grow at a double-digit rate for the long term.Two Potential SegmentsStubHub is now the world's largest ticket marketplace with revenue of $725 million, with more than 50% of the ticket-resale market share last year, way ahead of Ticketmaster, which has only 11% of ticket-resale market share. StubHub is adding some new features to streamline the ticket buying process, including ""best value offering"" and ""instant relisting"" functionalities to enable fans to find the best deal immediately. And if they cannot attend events, sellers can relist their tickets directly to the market. StubHub is expected to continue to grow strongly at 20-30% for the next few years.eBay's Classifieds segment provides local classified advertisements and a forum similar to that of Craigslist. eBay previously held a 25% share of Craigslist from 2008 until 2015. Craigslist still has the highest traffic of any classifieds, but eBay's new Classifieds business has more user friendly reviews. eBay's Classifieds business has enhanced the user experience with its new mobile app Close5, which has attracted 6 million users to sell their items locally last quarter. Close5 allows users to list their items much faster than Craigslist, and also allows for a seamless transaction to take place where the seller can directly communicate with buyers through the app. On Craigslist, transactions are generally completed through email or by phone. Excluding currency headwinds due to the strong dollar, eBay Classifieds grew at 15% last year and is expected to continue to grow as the future of the classifieds business shifts more toward mobile apps and away from Craigslist.Key to TurnaroundeBay has strong free cash flow and a $1.8 billion stock repurchase plan in place. Since eBay has no inventory itself, the company has successfully managed its gross profit margin to levels as high as 25.6% compared Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) gross profit margin of 2.1%. Amazon sales have grown at an astounding rate of 25% annually, while eBay has declined 1.2% annually for the last five years.eBay's strong free cash flow with high profit margins but declining sales revenue for the last three to five years may alert the company that it has reached its peak and more than likely its tipping point.For the core business Marketplace, eBay is innovating from e-commerce to m-commerce and has added social media exposure, upgraded mobile apps and an enhanced user interface. eBay has followed Amazon in adding complex algorithm analysis tools to help sellers move products more efficiently based on historical transactions analysis and traffic monitoring. However, it is hard to anticipate it could compete against Amazon, ten times the size of eBay, in the near future.The key for an eBay turnaround may depend on if it can boost StubHub ticket resale and Classifieds revenues at significant higher growth rate in the near future to offset intense competition from Amazon and Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), because neither of these giants has as unique segments as eBay. If eBay continues to grow at a single-digit rate without significant changes, it may expect to be a takeover target by the two giants.eBay is a solid business. It has strong free cash flow with a high operating margin and stock repurchase plan in place. From a valuation point of view, eBay's value is close to 2008 levels with a P/E of 14, P/S 3.2 and P/Cash Flow 6.8 with medium leverage risk, and a debt/equity ratio 1.03. Long-term investors need to pay more attention to eBay's StubHub and Classifieds business in the near future. If both segments can continue to grow at high double digits and generate strong cash flow, eBay can either use cash to repurchase stock or split off high profitable segments to pay back to shareholders. Thus it may offer an appealing bargain opportunity.Jenny Liu, Brett Hershman - LeverageEquityResearch.com"
3714106,67113,2015-11-25T14:53:00-05:00,"The company seems cheap considering there are other large caps in the US with weaker growth levels and much higher P/E ratios.eBay can't compete with the likes of Amazon and Alibaba on a company-wide scale, but it can in specific markets and categories.I'm sure that eBay's relentless SEO efforts will bear fruit sooner rather than later. Current updates are only around 30% completed.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has surprised many since its split from PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) in the summer of this year. The break-up led to many analysts turning bearish on the company, but the stock is up almost 20% over the last five weeks, primarily as a result of the company's positive set of earnings numbers for the third quarter of 2015. Bears will point to the fact that total revenue still dropped by 2% and active buyer growth continues to slow (5% in Q3 compared to 8% and 6% in Q1 and Q2). However, in forex neutral terms, this company is still growing its volumes and revenues and internal initiatives are underway at the company to get revenue back growing despite the current strong currency headwinds. Furthermore, the company raised its profitability outlook for the entire year, but I'm betting it never envisaged the relentless rally the US dollar has undertaken since increasing its earnings guidance last month (see chart).Therefore, I expect earnings for the year to come in around the low end of its guidance, despite the bumper sales the company will do in the fourth quarter. Valuations and fundamentals are very important when researching companies, especially now with an extremely strong dollar. The stock is selling at two times its sales and under 15 times its forward earnings which is cheap when you compare it to other companies which also have negative revenue growth on a forex neutral basis. Look at Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) for example, which is similar to eBay in that it's growing its volumes, but its revenue growth in strict dollar terms is negative due to the strong dollar. Coke is trading for over four times its revenues and over 20 times its forward earnings. But because it dominates the market it operates in, its share price continues to command a premium for investors. Furthermore, if you look at both these markets objectively, you would say that the carbonated drinks industry could be on the decline (which is 70%-plus of Coke's business) and e-commerce is growing.eBay, on the other hand, is small fry compared to some of the competitors in its market, but this can open opportunity for astute investors. Whereas Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) are going for world domination, eBay can go into specific markets and niches to gain specific market share from its rivals, among other things.Secondly, and to give a good example to what I mentioned above, the market for selling collectible sneakers is huge. The second-hand sneaker market is roughly valued at $1.2 billion and eBay (from 2014 figures) sells $334 million of merchandise in this market, giving it almost a 28% market share. Well, I see this percentage going up over time due to the increase in partnerships eBay is doing with respective sellers. By partnering with companies or by acquisitions, I still think eBay can grow its market share in certain markets going forward. What this means is that the company over time will limit its deal categories and concentrate more on key customers and growth markets. Yes, the company will lose market share over time in other categories, but this, I believe, is inevitable, especially when you see the growth rates of its competitors. Therefore, new initiatives such as ""Seller Hub,"" ""eBay Valet"" and ""eBay+"" are a necessity to get the best sellers in growth markets selling on the platform. Sellers nowadays have ample choice online when choosing where they want to sell their goods, but eBay's new targeted approach may attract power sellers in respective markets which would be bullish for the stock going forward.Third, this company is still in the process of organizing its products into catalogs which is still only 28% complete. Few e-commerce companies have done more work regarding SEO than eBay in the last 18 months, and I believe the uniqueness of its listings will bear fruit with organic traffic sooner or later. eBay got hit badly in 2014 when Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google altered its search algorithm which resulted in huge numbers of eBay's listings disappearing from the search engine. eBay responded appropriately by making its listings unique but also by demanding sellers use product identifiers so that buyers could find listings easier.eBay also has diversified its SEO efforts outside Google by focusing traffic efforts on sites such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Pinterest which should increase organic traffic over time. Investors should remember that another Google algorithm change could easily propel eBay's listings forward on its search engine and drive competitors one's back (because they haven't done the same work eBay has in the last 18 months). eBay is only 28% complete in updating its listings for SEO optimization, but early signs are good that Google traffic is coming back. Combine this extra traffic with more streamlined mobile listings (which the company is presently working on) and you have a recipe for strong revenue growth in the years to come.To sum up, eBay is still operating in a market that is expected to grow to $2.5 trillion by 2018 (see chart).Source : E-MarketerThe company is working hard to improve conversions, which at the end of the day is the bread and butter of this business. Whereas I see small third-party sellers drifting to the likes of Amazon, I see eBay focusing more on power sellers and conversions which should enable the company gain market share in specific markets. The company seems cheap for an established e-commerce player. Whether the company grows by acquiring partners to grow its strong markets or it's acquired by a bigger player, the risk/reward play here, in my opinion, is definitely to the upside."
3580906,67313,2015-10-20T03:43:14-04:00,EBAY to report 3Q15 earnings on Wednesday with consensus looking for $2.1b in revenue and $0.40 in EPS.Marketplace could see ongoing GMV challenges due to competitive pressure from both online and offline retailers.Prefer higher quality ecommerce names such as BABA and AMZN.,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) will report its 3Q15 results on Wednesday. Consensus expects $2.1b in revenue and $0.40 in EPS. This will be the first quarter eBay will report post PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) split. The issue with eBay is that the segment continues to face unrelenting competitive pressure from rivals including Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), whose changes in its search engines continue to impact traffic to eBay, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), that continues to command a superior brand and perception than eBay among the consumers. Additionally, offline retailers such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) are also expected to increase focus on ramping up ecommerce, adding further pressure to eBay's growth outlook. I often believe that without additional investment in its core business or pursuing M&A, eBay could continue to face headwinds in 2016. That said, I would stick with the more established player such as Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and AMZN.What will make me change my long-term view on the stock? Despite facing multiple challenges, I believe that eBay commands some M&A value as companies such as Alibaba looks to expand in North America. BABA's intention of expanding in the US is evident from its prior establishment of 11 Main (which was later shut down), and its expansion of cloud services for the US and potentially Chinese merchants. eBay offers a solid ecommerce platform for BABA to operate on and compete against AMZN once the public have a better perception of the company and its products.Thoughts before the quarterThe street will be looking for further signs of GMV stabilization after it reported a mixed Q2. However, recent stats from ChannelAdvisor suggest near-term revenue challenges remain with eBay SSSg +1% in September vs. +3.4% in August, which is a stark contrast to Amazon that continues to see solid sales growth of +19% in the month.We could see a potential update or reiteration of guidance for 2016. It is worth noting that the 2016 guidance for the marketplace was below street consensus as it continues to feel the impact from the SEO changes and password reset that was done in 2014. One way to address this weakness is to improve the selection in the marketplace and build a more engaging product/brand to generate repeat sales. The renewed focus on small business is a good start and shows that eBay is taking a different path from its prior strategy of focusing on large, full-price retailers and it is necessary to rejuvenate growth.Finally, eBay's recent introduction of eBay Plus in Germany mirrors that of Amazon's Prime services that provides free two-day delivery for select goods for an annual fee of $22. While this is a good start, it could potentially be too late for eBay to create a competing ecosystem vs. that of AMZN's given by how well-entrenched AMZN is with the Prime Membership (estimated to be over 40m strong).Conclusion, I remain cautious on eBay and recommend investors to own higher quality names."
3526466,67113,2015-09-23T12:08:55-04:00,It will be interesting to see if eBay Plus rolled out in Germany will be a hit for the company. eBay knows it needs to improve shipping times to compete.This company is sitting on plenty of cash with cash and cash equivalents expected to surpass $10 billion this year.India holds huge potential for e-commerce websites. It will be interesting to see if the proceeds of the Snapdeal stake will be used for further investment in India.,"Many investors are doubting whether eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) can recover after its recent PayPal spin-off of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL). PayPal is a thriving business which was evident in eBay's Q2 earnings when the payment provider revenue grew by 16% year over year. eBay's revenue also grew to $4.4 billion; although, it fell short of analyst estimates of $4.49 billion. The reason for the shortfall was its marketplaces unit which reported revenues of $2.1 billion which was a 3% year-over-year decline. Growth in its marketplaces has been tepid since last year primarily because of two reasons.As a result, sentiment was very bearish at the back end of last year, but things may be on the up. Let's discuss.First, the company announced a new initiative in Germany recently that will provide free two-day shipping through a new premium program called eBay Plus. The premium loyalty program also will offer free returns within a month of purchase. This program seems to be a direct response to Amazon's premium program ""Amazon Prime"" which costs $99 a year. Amazon Prime (one day of huge sales only open to premium members) reported huge sales in July of this year. eBay's offering is different and it has to be as it doesn't have the fulfillment centers that Amazon utilizes to ship its products. Therefore, eBay needs to incentivize its sellers by cutting selling fees and by giving them higher positions for their listings on its platform.eBay has a real possibility here to gain market share if it works this endeavor properly. Over the last 20 years, eBay has become more and more regulated and stringent with its sellers. Its policy has always supported the buyers which has alienated some sellers over time. The company has a chance here to change its ways to some degree with respect to its sellers. Here's what I mean.eBay Plus is only going to work if the sellers that are signed up to the program are professional and are making good money. The more sellers we have of this category the better it will be for eBay as more buyers will come to the marketplace. I hope that the company is ruthless with sellers who are not professional and reward handsomely the ones who are. This is the way forward in this industry. It needs to take a hard line here as opening up programs like this definitely gives up some control to third parties. Nevertheless, shorter shipping times is the road ahead for e-commerce businesses. Just take a look at the chart below which shows the market forecast for US same-day delivery on online products.Source: BI Intelligence EstimatesSellers who are well compensated will flock to this platform which in turn will attract buyers who want fast service. The German experiment will hopefully be rolled out after a successful launch.The stock also looks cheap here when you look at its free cash flow figures. The stock trading for less than nine times free cash flow reported free cash figures of $758 million in the second quarter of this year. In the final quarter of 2011, free cash flow was $690 million but the share price was trading in the thirties. Furthermore, it's projected cash and equivalents balance has never been higher (see chart) which means the company can either invest in other markets or return cash to shareholders.Source: Macroaxis.comIndia is an obvious country to invest in especially after the company sold a piece of its Snapdeal stake for an undisclosed sum. Snapdeal, Flipkart (FPKT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) hold the biggest market share, so eBay will want to gain some ground there especially considering the growth potential of the country. A rollout of some type of variation of eBay Plus you would think would be suitable in this market when you consider the entrepreneurship of India. All things being equal, this country's online spending is predicted to grow rapidly in the next few years and with eBay still having its ""house money"" in Snapdeal plus its own platform which will undoubtedly be updated - revenues should only grow there.eBay has been in India for the past 10 years but has been unable to gain ground on the big three - Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon. Amazon entered in 2013 and its growth has been exceptional so it therefore decided to invest another $5 billion into the country. I just hope eBay invests back a big portion of its Snapdeal into India because of the market's potential. The next 5 years will decide where Indians will do their online purchasing and eBay should strive to increase market share, because in the future it will be far more difficult once the respective market shares of its competitors will be more fixed.To sum up, there is no getting away from the fact that eBay is still in a growth sector. Over time e-commerce websites like eBay and Amazon will consistently take market share away from offline merchants such as Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY). Furthermore, if the company can get back the Google traffic (which could be on the way back), it will attract more sellers to the platform once more. This stock definitely has the potential to return to $30-plus per share."
3592276,67313,2015-10-23T07:07:39-04:00,eBay's Q3 highlights ongoing weakness in the marketplace.Higher marketing spend is necessary to change consumer perception of the marketplace.Remain cautious on eBay. The only value exists is the potential takeover by BABA.,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported Q3 results with an in-line revenue and a slight beat on EPS off an already low expectation. Shares were higher +9% post earnings as the market were encouraged by the beat, but a couple things worth noting. First, the bottom line beat was mostly driven by a larger-than-expected cut in sales and marketing, a trend that I do not believe to be sustainable given the investment eBay has to undertake to improve its brand perception of the consumers to more than just a marketplace for used or discounted goods. Second, GMV continues to stagnate, suggesting that competitive pressure remains from the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Longer-term competitive risk could come from Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) whose C2C platform is multiples to that of eBay. Finally, soft Q4 guidance of $2.27-$2.32b in revenue were below the consensus $2.33b, suggesting no material rebound in operating metrics.Given that PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is no longer part of eBay, the pure ecommerce business model does not appear to be competitive against its peers and the real value lies in its potential acquisition (possibly by BABA as it looks to scale its US ecommerce platform). In my view, such M&A catalyst may not be worthwhile for investors to wait for and as such I recommend investors to put their money into the more stable names such as BABA and AMZN. Between the two, my preference is on BABA given that it is pursuing an ecosystem-oriented ecommerce model similar to that of AMZN, and I view this model to be highly sustainable and scalable.eBay's ecommerce revenue of $2.1b, -2.3% headline growth and +6% constant currency growth was largely in line with consensus while EPS of $0.43 beat by $0.03. The consensus already had a low expectation heading into the print given the competitive pressures from GOOG and AMZN and the read-throughs from the recent stats from ChannelAdvisor that showed flattish SSSg relative to the +20% growth exhibited by AMZN. US GMV was up +3% while international GMV declined by -5% (or +7% excluding FX impact). The +5% growth in active buyers to 159m highlights the near-term challenge for eBay to gain traction on the customer front given that it is still widely perceived as a platform for discount/used goods. This perception requires a significant amount of marketing spend to address, but I do not believe that eBay is likely to pursue this given its focus on cost cutting, particularly on sales and marketing. Unless eBay invests heavily on changing consumer perception, I believe that operating metrics will likely to continue to erode and that multiples could be under pressure.Conclusion, I remain bearish on eBay. After the PYPL spin-off, the focus is really on PYPL rather than marketplace. The real value behind marketplace is if it gets a bid from BABA, a scenario that I view to be highly likely given the current consumer base and the similar marketplace model both companies share. BABA's US ambition is clear and it is just a matter of time before it enters the US, and eBay is a logical platform given its scale and brand awareness."
3339325,86776,2015-07-20T13:21:44-04:00,"Back in 2007, PayPal was about 25 percent of eBay’s total revenues.Last week — and the last time that both would report as a single company – PayPal was just about half of eBay’s reported revenues.The competitors that I’d pop to the top of PayPal’s worry list aren’t Apple and Google and their “Pay” schemes, but Amazon and Alipay.","Much has been made of the merchant-friendliness (or unfriendliness) of all of the payments schemes in market today – plastic or digital, PayPal included. Merchants have been said to push back on new payments schemes because they cost too much or they don’t deliver access to enough of the right data or they cede control of the consumer relationship. At the end of the day, the payments scheme that merchants find most merchant-friendly is the one that brings customers through their doors because it’s how consumers want to pay them.Of course, merchants push back when presented with new ways to pay. It’s often non-trivial to enable something new – big merchants have lot of things to integrate with and small merchants have constrained resources.Today, when merchants push back on new things, it’s often because they’re not convinced that there’s enough consumer demand if they go to the trouble of changing their systems to accommodate it.That’s why, today, offline, the dominant payments scheme is still the network-branded plastic card.Of course, Apple Pay and Android Pay are betting that there will be enough EMV and NFC terminal refreshes to drive usage of their payment schemes longer term. And if that was all that had to happen, maybe in a couple of years, they might be right. But, there’d also have to be enough consumers with enough of the right devices using them at those stores to tip the engagement and frequency scales.That’s where one has to step back and map the next three to five years carefully to see how the consumer’s use of the device that every single one of them have all over the world – mobile phones and apps and access to the Internet – can enable a different offline experience – by doing it via an online experience.Will the economics of how these schemes come together influence that? On some level, but only because it will have to support and incent consumers to use it and use it consistently. Access to data will enable a variety of new business models that can better link the economics of the experience to the likelihood of conversion.And completion among all of these players will likely intensify as new initiatives emerge to embed payments in a host of financial services and commerce experiences, loyalty and incentive schemes are designed and launched, new merchant relationships are formed and more retail acceptance is pursued. And as a more consistent payments experience is designed that helps consumers move with ease across all of the channels they use to shop and buy today.And as I hinted at earlier, some interesting mashups form that could turn the notion of merchant-friendly as we are thinking of it today, on its head.Of course, payments is a highly competitive space these days and aside from the card networks (for now) no one really has it made in the shade. Payments and financial services is a scale business that takes time – and money – to develop. And change that requires consumers and merchants to buy in. And while mobile and the cloud have given innovators more opportunities to create options that could change merchant and consumer behavior, most of them won’t since they’ll never get to scale.So, that’s why — the harsh reality of being a public company and reporting results to Wall Street every 90 days notwithstanding — I don’t think that “Day 1” of PayPal as an independent payments company has them starting off behind the proverbial payments eight ball. In fact, the issue is whether they can use their newfound independence to increase their lead and keep everyone else way back as it has so far.You’ve heard my views on PayPal. Now here’s how a few executives — including one executive who used to run strategy for PayPal, the CEO of a partner company and a couple of competitors — in the payments business see it.And, of course, we’ll have PayPal at our Retail Reinvention summit in Chicago in two weeks to talk about all of this and more in one of their first public appearances since becoming a public company."
3566266,35911,2015-10-13T13:35:47-04:00,eBay is a great business that is being neglected after the Paypal spinoff.eBay has similar characteristics to Uber and Airbnb and justifies a higher valuation.eBay's shares could double in 3-5 years due to current low valuation.,"eBay's (EBAY) shares currently represent a great business at a great price and they could double in 3-5 years, representing a compound gain from 15-25% per year. eBay completed its spinoff of Paypal in July and has been trading on a standalone basis since then. eBay's spinoff of its ""exciting"" sibling company has left the ""boring"" business of legacy eBay trading at an unduly cheap valuation. What investors are forgetting is that legacy eBay itself is one of the best businesses in the world and has important similarities to the great ""sharing economy"" businesses that are in the headlines today.eBay Is The Original ""Sharing Economy"" BusinessThe rise of the sharing economy is well-documented, and the businesses that are currently riding the wave include Airbnb (AIRB) ($24 billion valuation on $900 million in revenues) and Uber (NYSE:UBER) ($50 billion valuation on $2 billion in revenues) (WSJ links require subscription). Both are valued highly in the private equity markets due to their attractive economics. eBay pioneered the sharing economy business model 20 years ago and has become one of the most trusted marketplaces where buyers and sellers all over the world meet and exchange goods. Just as Airbnb does not own any rental properties and Uber does not own any cars, eBay does not own any of the inventory it sells. This model of taking a cut of each transaction on a global scale over the internet is very powerful and profitable for the middle man. The following chart from eBay's recent investor presentation shows the long-term upward trend in the volume of goods sold on eBay's marketplaces. Currently, $83 billion of goods are bought and sold each year and the market for e-commerce transactions continues to expand. From this $83 billion in goods sold, eBay received revenues of $8.8 billion for facilitating the transactions between buyers and sellers.Even after 20 years of continuous growth, eBay is still growing its user base, revenues and free cash flow at respectable rates (see table below). eBay has been dealing with a few hiccups in the last year due to a new Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search algorithm that has led to fewer eBay page views and a data breach that resulted in users having to change their passwords. However, these issues are fixable and relatively short term compared to the long-term sustainable growth eBay has exhibited since inception.Why eBay Is Cheap And Can Double On Valuation AloneAs of October 11, eBay has a standalone market cap of $29.6 billion and an enterprise value of $26.67 billion. eBay had $2.7 billion in free cash flow in 2014, although management is currently projecting lower free cash flow in 2015 and 2016 (see chart below for management projections).eBay is currently trading at an enterprise value-to-free cash flow multiple of 10X based on 2014 free cash flow. For such a high-quality business with a long-term track record of success, this is a very attractive price. For reference, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) trades at 29X free cash flow, Target (NYSE:TGT) trades at 20X, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) trades at 80X. eBay should be trading at higher multiples than retail companies like Wal-Mart and Target that are much more capital intensive, have slow revenue growth rates, and much slimmer margins. Amazon is a tough comparison as Amazon invests much more heavily in businesses such as Amazon Web Services and does not generate much free cash flow. At a minimum, eBay should trade between 20 to 30 times free cash flow to be valued similarly to Wal-Mart and Target. If eBay's free cash flow stays steady and the valuation increases to a reasonable 20X as the market understands eBay's standalone cash flow generation ability, then eBay's shares should double on sentiment change alone in the next 3-5 years. If eBay grows its revenues and free cash flow faster than expected by the market, an even higher multiple would be justified.As a thought exercise, if eBay traded in line with Airbnb and Uber's market valuation based on revenues (25 times revenues), eBay would have a market cap of $220 billion (compared to about $30 billion today). Even at half of the valuation of Airbnb and Uber, eBay would be worth more than three times its current market cap. Of course, Airbnb and Uber have much higher projected growth rates (and these valuations seem bubbly), but eBay is an established business with stable, growing revenues, huge margins and free cash flow ready to be returned to shareholders. The reasons that the investment community is impressed with Uber and Airbnb (asset-light, high margins, highly scalable) are present and proven in eBay. I would argue that eBay is more comparable to a mature Uber and Airbnb than a mature Wal-Mart and Target. If this is the case, then eBay could justify an enterprise valuation much higher than its current 10 times free cash flow and 3 times revenues. In my view, eBay could double its share price based on valuation alone and still be considered reasonable at 20 times free cash flow and 6 times revenues.Share Repurchases As A CatalystThe key factor that should speed up eBay's share price movement towards fair value is the large share repurchase program that eBay is pursuing. Management has already indicated that it intends to buy back shares and eBay has a current authorization of $3 billion (enough to buy back 10% of current float). With free cash flow generation of between $2-3 billion a year, eBay can buy back between 5-10% of its market cap each year. Now that Paypal is gone and eBay's reinvestment needs are minimal, eBay may even get more aggressive with share repurchases using additional debt. These buybacks should support the stock price going forward and increase free cash flow per share substantially. In 5 years, eBay could reduce its shares outstanding by 20-40%, resulting in additional pressure for the shares to move toward fair valuation. Investors should take advantage of this opportunity to buy eBay - a great company at a great price."
3495386,32711,2015-09-08T11:51:59-04:00,"As one of the first major players, eBay pioneered an industry.However, its business model is becoming increasingly irrelevant, which is reflected in its results.Currently unable to compete with Amazon, there seem to be few upside catalysts aside from its low valuation.","Last week eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), one of the world's first and best-known e-commerce names, celebrated its 20th birthday. In the age of the internet, this is quite a venerable age, and the passing of the mark offers a suitable opportunity to review the company's prospects. At 20, the company is starting to show its age, as it lags growth in the broader market and increasingly cedes market share to players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). By now more or less a legacy business, it is hard to see upside catalysts aside from its relatively low valuation.Laggard of the bunchEven before the PayPal spinoff, it was fairly clear that eBay's marketplace segment was simply not keeping up with the broader industry. According to Forrester US e-commerce sales grew by an average of about 9.4% per year between 2011 and 2014. In 2015, the growth rate is projected at roughly the same number. How does eBay stack up?Increasingly badly. In 2013, eBay marketplace still outpaced matched the overall industry growth rate, US sales up 14% versus an 11.5% increase for the industry overall. Not bad at all. By the end of 2014, things weren't looking quite as good. Overall marketplace revenue increased by only 6%, versus the 10.3% growth recorded in US e-commerce sales.This year, things are looking even worse. A recent report highlights eBay's main problem, which is that its traditional business model isn't really working any more. Consumers today prefer buying a product instantly, rather than risking a sniper picking off the highly prized baseball card or comic book they have been waiting to buy for weeks.A report released in March shows just how much consumers have gone off the auction model. In February, eBay's auction sales fell by a whopping 26%, while its fixed-price sales rose by 8.6%. Overall, comp store sales growth clocked in at 5.5%, well below the 15% industry average used by comScore and ChannelAdvisor. The number is barely comparable to the 22.7% growth recorded by Amazon over the same period. In January, Amazon's growth rate was at 27% versus overall eBay marketplace growth of 8.6%.Upside catalysts?eBay has proven itself reluctant to let go of its auction business model, which was initially wildly successful, but now feels more like a relic of another time. To remain relevant, it must move more of its sales to a fixed-price model, but even in this sphere, it doesn't come anywhere near Amazon in terms of growth.eBay's expected earnings growth rates aren't particularly convincing either. This year, annual EPS is expected to drop by around 6.4%. Between 2015 and 2016, things are expected to recover, with earnings growth projected at 10.1%. This isn't bad, but it also isn't great.As far as I can tell, the only tangible benefit eBay has over Amazon right now is its valuation. The stock currently trades at 13.7 times trailing earnings, which is certainly lower than the 21.5 industry average as well as Amazon's negative P/E. It is also well below the company's historical average. However, valuation alone does not an investment thesis make.ConclusioneBay pioneered the world of e-commerce with its auction-based business model, helping create an industry that is now booming. However, as its business model became increasingly irrelevant, replaced by a faster fixed-price model, the company is starting to show its age. Even its fixed-price segment cannot compete with Amazon in terms of sales growth, and sales in its auction segment continue to plummet. Without a near-term catalyst in terms of fixed-price sales growth, and without PayPal to pad its results, it's hard to make a case for upside in the near future."
3347555,25120,2015-07-23T17:09:13-04:00,"Following the separation of PayPal from eBay, most of the attention has been focused on the payments business.The former ""core"" marketplace business has become a slowly growing cash cow.The modest growth and decent cash flows allow for cash to be returned to investors going forward.These cash returns are likely to support the current valuation at 17 times non-GAAP earnings.Despite this ""fair"" valuation, I am not a buyer, as I expect intensifying competition in the years ahead.","After PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been separated from its former parent company eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), most of the attention has been focused on the prospects of the payments business.Strong growth rates and healthy future prospects have created quite some buzz around PayPal. Investors and analysts have paid a lot less attention to the traditional eBay marketplace business which now becomes a stand-alone business again.eBay Becomes A Cash CoweBay's core marketplace business was once the growth driver of the company. Its growth rates have come down over time as the company grew in size. Growth has furthermore come under pressure amidst competition from the likes of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), corporate websites and the emergence of niche players.Despite the ruthless competition from Amazon.com, the marketplace business continues to do relatively well, although growth rates are not that inspiring. The marketplace business generates $8.7 billion in sales on a trailing basis, of which 80% relates to transactions directly.The marketplace business grew sales at a rate of 5% in constant-currency terms in the second quarter of this year. This growth pace has been consistent with growth rates the company has reported last year. The reported sales numbers have been worse, as eBay generates 60% of its sales from overseas markets, notably from Europe. This created severe currency headwinds given the strong dollar, as reported sales fell by 3%.A Deeper Look Into The Marketplace BusinesseBay's marketplace business consists of a group of 157 million active buyers. This group has grown by roughly 6% compared to last year, although sequential growth has been flat. These buyers spend roughly $82 billion to buy new and used merchandise through eBay's marketplace websites. This ""gross merchandise value"" was up by 6% as well, indicating that spending per buyer has been flattish around $520 per buyer.While the user base and average spending per user determine the gross merchandise value, this is not necessarily equivalent to the revenue growth of the marketplace.The connection between merchandise volumes and reported revenues is driven by the ""take"" rate, which shows how large eBay's cut is in relation to the merchandise value. The $8.7 billion in eBay's marketplace business suggests that this rate comes in around 10.6% of the gross merchandise value, a sizable cut.This rate has actually been increasing in recent years, after the ""take"" rate still averaged just 8-9% in 2006 and 2007. The increase in the ""cut"" has been driven by eBay's focus on providing marketing and other related services to sellers.The Pro-Forma ValuationThe company originally guided for segment margins of 37-39% for the marketplace business. The separation of the company is expected to hurt margins by 4-5%. This implies that operating margins are seen at 32-34% going forward, translating into operating profits of roughly $2.9 billion. After subtracting interest expenses and an anticipated tax rate of 21-22%, non-GAAP earnings are seen around $2.2 billion.These expectations are fairly consistent with the company's own earnings per share guidance. eBay sees non-GAAP earnings coming in at $1.72 to $1.77 per share, with GAAP earnings seen at $1.40 to $1.45 per share.Following the separation, eBay has handed out $3.8 billion in cash to PayPal while the ""parent"" company continues to assume all the debt. This results in cash and equivalent holdings of roughly $8.5 billion for eBay going forward while debt stands at roughly $7.6 billion. The definitive numbers will be known when the company announces its first quarterly results as a stand-alone business. A full reconciliation of the pro-forma balance sheet can be found on page 6 of eBay's earnings presentation.Given that the company continues to have roughly 1.22 billion shares outstanding, equity of the marketplace business is valued at $35 billion with shares trading at $29 per share. Given the large cash holdings and the cash flow capacity to operate with a net debt position, eBay will be able to return quite some cash to investors.With the company is guiding for non-GAAP earnings of around $1.75 per share, it trades at 17 times non-GAAP earnings. In this case, I find GAAP earnings a bit more reliable given the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation. Based on this profit metric, shares trade at roughly 20 times earnings.Gauging The Future PotentialeBay is one of the most established e-commerce businesses across the globe. While the company benefits from the prospects for further e-commerce growth across the globe, the reality is that competition is intensifying as well.With constant-currency growth coming in at just 3-5%, I see few reasons why I would want to assume a higher growth rate for the business in the coming years. This is certainly the case as competition from Amazon as well as Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is only expected to intensify going forward. For these reasons, eBay has already announced a streamlining effort of the organization ahead of the separation.In my eyes, the company has been turned into a cash cow given the modest growth prospects and strong margins. While cash cows are typically quite attractive, I do see elevated risks in the eBay business model based on intensifying competition. This makes the 20 times GAAP earnings multiple, which is more or less in line with the market, not very attractive in my opinion.Final RemarkseBay's marketplace revenue growth has been coming down in recent years and quarters. A large portion of the slower growth is of structural nature and can be attributed to the law of large numbers and increasing competition.Some of the recent slowdown can be the result of some ""incidentals"" and these could fade away over time. The company has been hurt by a change in search optimization algorithms as well as a major password reset issue. As time passes, the impact of these items becomes less pronounced of course. It is important to realize that these sales numbers are based on constant currencies, as actual sales in dollar terms are falling in the low-single digits.I view eBay in essence as a cash cow which trades at market-equivalent multiples. While current growth rates of 3-5% in constant currencies are still solid, I see increased potential for competition to impact this pace of growth in the coming years. In my eyes, eBay really has harsh competition, which could potentially disrupt its business model going forward.These long-term concerns outweigh the observation that shares are fairly valued. As a matter of fact, I see potential for shares to gain ground in the near to medium term based on the capacity of the company to return a lot of cash to investors, as the company is able to support a net debt position.To put it bluntly, there are many alternative businesses which grow sales at 3-5% per year and trade at 20 times earnings while their business model is less exposed to competition."
3336985,80285,2015-07-20T01:43:52-04:00,"Three reasons to sell eBay and buy PayPal.EBAY's growth in recent years has primarily been driven by PayPal's growth.EBAY taken alone is a mature company relying on 'legacy' assets.PayPal is a leader in its field, EBAY is no longer a top online marketplace.PayPal has far more potential on its own, EBAY is likely to face a slow decline.","While numerous analysts have chimed in on PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) spinoff from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), we look at some simple, straightforward statistics to deduce why investors should avoid holding eBay shares and to accumulate PayPal.Disparity In Growth Rates(Source: SEC Filings)Comparing revenue growth between the Marketplaces and Payments segments, the latter's growth has been consistently higher, and surpassed Marketplaces revenue in the previous quarter. We observe a similar trend in terms of segment operating income.As observed, the gap has been rapidly narrowing over the years, reflecting PayPal's stronger potential.This disparity is significant when you consider the compounding effect over a longer period of time. It becomes clear that PayPal has far more potential for growth, and thus has contributed far more to the value of the combined company. However, the guidance from Ebay has said PayPal shares would start trading at 55% of the value of the combined company, which seems like a low estimate when we consider these figures.PayPal Has Superior Market PositionThe disparity in growth can be attributed to the fact that PayPal is a market leader in the online payments industry, while EBAY is no longer a market leader in E-commerce.Over the years, PayPal has actively pursued horizontal integration through acquiring smaller, fast-growing companies such as Braintree, and more recently, Xoom (NASDAQ:XOOM). Back in 2013, Braintree handled payments processing for an array of well-known start-ups such as Airbnb, Uber, Github and many others. Acquisitions such as these have enabled PayPal to establish lucrative relationships and continue their dominance in the online payments space. Similarly, their acquisition of Uber added more functionality to their platform, allowing users to make quick, easy and cheap remittances.A quick glance at this graphic here reveals that despite smaller and more flexible competitors such as Square and Stripe, PayPal still maintains its dominance in terms of reach, volume and its suite of features. Although Apple Pay presents a headwind for PayPal, they are in a strong position to withstand the challenge given the ubiquity of their platform and large user/enterprise base.eBay Lacks Competitive AdvantageOn the other hand, EBAY has become too reliant on its legacy assets. Amazon's onslaught in the US e-commerce market, along with the growth of smaller niche competitors like Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) makes eBay's platform seem increasingly outdated. Over a decade ago, eBay was the place for online shopping, with a wide array of both commercial goods as well as personalised, niche listings. Currently, Amazon is far ahead in terms of sales of general commercial goods, with higher traffic, more volume and more listings. As this infographic shows, Amazon dominates eBay with far more active users (244M vs 155M), higher traffic in terms of unique and recurring visits, as well as a greater number of listings. In that context, eBay's status slowly shifted in consumer's minds toward becoming more of a marketplace for personalized, used, vintage or niche hobby goods. However, with the tremendous growth of Etsy, sellers and buyers looking to transact for creative, vintage and artistic products.Essentially, eBay has been forced to retreat from several categories as competitors have taken market share and stumped its growth. This is well reflected in its stagnating revenues and income. Soon, eBay may become the ""backyard sales"" site, with its only foothold being in the auctions market for collectibles and unusual goods. This would undoubtedly shrink sales, with other competitors gaining a greater advantage over time.ConclusionA simply breakdown shows that eBay's shares should be assigned a far lower multiple after trading begins tomorrow. The prevailing trends suggest PayPal will continue to grow and prosper while eBay will face a slow decline. Hence, shareholders should consider divesting their remaining eBay shares to buy PayPal, if they wish to be invested in either. There is little doubt that PayPal will have greater flexibility and freedom to innovate as a standalone company, which will boost its growth prospects, whereas eBay would continue its slow-motion downward spiral.A final word of caution: at $44 Billion, PayPal seems a tad pricey for conservative value investors - the margin of safety is thin if any. SA Contributor Mike Gordon wrote an article detailing a valuation of PayPal. It's worth a read just to get a sense of the final values produced by the inputs used."
3331975,33291,2015-07-16T15:17:21-04:00,"A long time ago I used to do a little business with eBay Inc.I never found eBay to be a reliable investment but used to trade it long and short; this mentality may no longer be justified.I think the stock can move higher, but I am not sure if investors are sold on the PayPal spinoff.Buybacks are nice but I still would like to see a regular dividend.","A long time ago I used to do a little business with eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY). I used the site to sell a ton of old sports cards and memorabilia, as well as some random items including printer cartridges, video games, unopened posters and more. The reason? I was starting graduate school and needed to pay for books. Just about anyone who shops online has at least heard of eBay, if not having actually done business with it directly. It is the largest online auction site in the world and runs a successful financing section via PayPal. As we know however, PayPal is about to be separated into its own stand alone company soon (July 17th). Now, I haven't actually bought or sold much on eBay in the last five years, but I have been both long this company and short this company in the past. It has had more than its fair share of ups and downs. To me, it's never been reliable as an investment, however, you can always cherry pick a time frame to argue against this assessment. That said, I do think that is really changing now. The company is doing quite well. In fact, it has just hit a 52 week high today, despite the company's historical reports which speak for themselves. But forget the past, where is this stock going next? To answer this question, a review of the company's recent performance is justified.I'll be honest. I think the stock can move higher, but I am not sure if investors are sold on the PayPal spinoff. The success or failure of this move remains to be seen. On that note, I will discuss the quarter which really caught my eye this morning. Well, the quarter was decent, but not incredible by any means. eBay's second quarter revenue increased 6.8% year-over-year to $4.38 billion, but this missed analyst estimates by $110 million. GAAP earnings came in at $682 million or $0.56 per share versus $676 million or $0.53 per diluted share last year. A better measure is the adjusted earnings. Adjusted earnings rolled in at $931 million, or $0.76 per share. This is up nicely year-over-year from the $868 million or $0.69 per diluted share last year. This was a $0.03 bottom line beat. All in all, it was a solid quarter. But we need to dig a little deeper.eBay' gross merchandise volume saw growth on an constant dollar basis. If we exclude the negative impact of currency related issues which are plaguing all domestic companies, the gross merchandise volume increased 6% and net total payment volume growth rose 28%. Of course absolute year-over-year comparisons are complicated because foreign currency movements continued to have a negative effect, impacting the revenue growth rate of the eBay Marketplaces and the revenue growth rate of PayPal. What is important to note is that PayPal hedges to protect itself from currency fluctuation and so this offset the impact at PayPal.PayPal continues to be a huge source of revenues. PayPal's net total payment volume grew by a whopping 20% in Q2 to $66 billion. Interestingly the merchant services volume was up 27% but the associated with eBay volume was down 1%. If we consider payment volumes on a constant dollar basis the then PayPal net total payment volume was up 28%. On the same token the merchant services volume was up 36% and eBay volume up 6%. An important trend is that more and more PayPal revenues over the years are coming from other sources than eBay.This quarter, payment volume through eBay and its marketplaces was $14.5 billion, representing 22% of total payment volumes. Revenue as a whole grew to $2.3 billion. The growth is clear. PayPal grew new active accounts 11% to 169 million year-over-year and processed nearly 1.1 billion transactions. In Q2 transactions per active account increased to 24 per year, compared to 21 transaction year ago. This has been an ongoing trend over the years. PayPal has shown choppy but steady growth of its customer base along with more frequent transactions per user. PayPal also agreed to acquire Xoom Corporation for approximately $890 million net of cash. The company believes that this will ""help accelerate PayPal's entry into the $600 billion global remittance market, and that adding additional services to our technology platform will allow PayPal to amplify its consumer flywheel, creating a more powerful network effect"". Commenting on the quarter as a whole, President of eBay Devin Wenig said:Dan Schulman the PayPal President stated:Looking ahead, the company is growing steadily, but the stock is a touch pricey here, based current share price on current and future earnings in my opinion. 2015 earnings are projected to be about $1.75 on an adjusted basis. That said, I don't think it is necessarily grossly overvalued, but I can't recommend a buy here. I would wait for a pullback. The good news is that as a whole, the stock is definitely looking more reliable in the last year as an investment, and not a trading stock. I also like the continued repurchases. This month, eBay Inc.'s board of directors authorized an additional $1 billion stock repurchase program. Together with the approximately $2 billion remaining under eBay's prior stock repurchase program authorized in January 2014, eBay's total repurchase authorization as of July 16, 2015, is approximately $3 billion. Personally, I would like to see a dividend, particularly since the company is making money here. The PayPal spinoff will happen on July 17th. I think it will be interesting to see how the stock trades over the next few weeks. Ultimately, I think my long standing position that this is simply a trading stock no longer holds water."
3319405,67313,2015-07-13T21:33:20-04:00,"eBay will report its Q2 numbers on Thursday.Marketplace appears to be challenged due to competitive pressures.PayPal remains an attractive story, but O2O expansion is necessary to attract merchants and users.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) will report its Q2 numbers on Thursday. While the investment community prepares for the PayPal and Marketplace separation scheduled for next Friday, the bottom line is that both eBay and PayPal continue to face severe competitive pressure from well-funded platforms in their respective verticals. On the Marketplace side, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) have taken their respective shares, and consumers still associate eBay with a used/auctioned products site, which does not bode well for the platform's image. On the payments side, PayPal faces the obvious competition from Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google Wallet in the developed market, and from global payment systems such as Alipay (NYSE:BABA) and M-Pesa. The recent Xoom acquisition addresses some of these weaknesses, but it remains to be seen whether PayPal can execute and stay competitive against its rivals in the other markets. As such, I remain cautious on eBay. PayPal remains a more attractive investment, but its growth could be capped by competition. On the other hand, Marketplace downside may be limited on M&A prospects. For Marketplace, I will be focusing on take-rate improvement and GMV growth. As for PayPal, merchant expansion and consumer adoption will be critical to this segment's long-term growth.eBay ventured into a new product listing ad format starting late May, and is conducting this experiment with select merchants. The details of this experiment are limited, but it appears that this is similar to those used in Korean auction and shopping website Gmarket, where sellers can bid for placement in search and display ad results. This development is certainly interesting and could potentially be a game changer for eBay as it tries to rejuvenate its marketplace and improve the take-rate. The incremental revenue generated from this new feature will more likely flow through the P&L, thereby improving the bottom line. During the quarterly call, it was highlighted that this is an area where investors should have a particular focus.As for GMV growth, the new CEO, Devin Wenig, highlighted the importance of accelerating GMV growth through structured catalog data. This concept has been documented two years ago, but has surfaced and taken on greater importance, as it could potentially deliver two key benefits: 1) improve eBay's profile within Google's search ranking; and 2) improve recommendation and consumer shopping experience with more relevant information. Similar to the new ad format, the investment community still needs to see the potential impact from this decision.Merchant adoption will be critical for PayPal's near-term growth. Given the slower-than-expected ramp-up on Apple Pay and Google Wallet, and that PayPal has a longer operating history, it is important for the platform to broaden its merchant base. On the other hand, driving consumer adoption will be also significant to driving greater usage.For PayPal, the company could look at Alibaba's Alipay as an example, incorporating commonly used merchant services, such as travel booking, restaurant booking, ecommerce, group buy and entertainment (i.e., movie tickets) into its mobile app to build a comprehensive O2O tool. This could result in higher merchant and consumer adoption, making PayPal a competitive mobile payment platform. At an even more ambitious level, it could partner with asset managers to provide certificates of deposits, where interests are earned on a daily basis. The increased wealth effect via PayPal could encourage higher platform usage, a long-term positive in my view."

        Introducing four investment strategies for different levels of risk tolerance.
        The PayPal spin-off investment scenario reflects an expected return of 2% to 11%.","The long waiting period is finally coming to an end as PayPal (Pending:PYPL) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) are getting closer to the first spin-off milestone - July 8th, the spin-off record date. The record date has some significant meanings in this context:After the previous article published about the PayPal spin-off arb strategy, I received many questions about how to create an optimized position that would benefit from this spin-off arb opportunity in a hedged environment. I answered some of this questions, and I want to present some scenarios that will assist readers and potential investors to tailor the best position to meet their unique characteristics.At the beginning, I wish to address two primary issues that are fundamental to this investment strategy: risk aversion and outflow theory. Before investing in the PayPal spin-off (if investing at all), investors should know exactly what their risk appetite is. Some investors take high risks in anticipation of higher returns than usual, and other investors take small risks and expect moderate gains. Both approaches are perfectly fine, but an individual investor should think of that before engaging with a spin-off arbitrage strategy and create an investment strategy that fits his or her risk aversion preferences (institutional investors assess their risk appetite regularly). Investors looking to gain from a short-long position should accept the outflow theory that I presented in a May article. An investor who believes that both eBay and PayPal will soar after the split should engage in a different strategy, which I will not cover here, and hold both equities long.To create a trading scenario for the spin-off, I will assume that most readers will receive the distributed shares between a week after the record date and the distribution date. At this point, EBAY.wi and PYPL.wi shares already reflect a 10% price fluctuation. Let's discuss the four possible scenarios:I also assume that the PYPL.wi price will increase by 5% during the period I described above, 3% during the weekend between the distribution date and PYPL's first trading day, and an additional 10% on the first trading day. All figures are within the reasonable spin-off fluctuations that were presented in the previous article. I also assume that the positive changes in PayPal's stock price equal the adverse changes in eBay's stock price. I calculated the return and volatility based on a distributed share price of $32 for a PayPal share and $28 for an eBay share, assuming cash from selling the EBAY stock was not reinvested.The four scenarios presented above yielded the following return and volatility figures:Investors highly averse to risk can choose to take action and get an estimated return of 2% of scenario A or just sell all units of the EBAY stock once received and gain 7% from a PYPL long-only position as presented in scenario B in the period between the moment the distributed shares are received until the end of the first day of trading in PYPL shares. Investors who have some tolerance for risk can choose a long-short strategy that maximizes return from the spin-off but is accompanied with a slightly higher risk. Scenario C, which suggests to sell 50% of eBay's distributed shares and short the other 50%, offers a lower risk for investors than scenario D. Investors who are somewhere in the middle between complete risk aversion and total risk taking could choose a larger/smaller quantity of EBAY shares to sell in order to hedge PYPL fluctuations.Investors who hold options of eBay pre-distribution can add an additional hedging layer with post-distribution options and protect their positions better from any downside. However, since the outflow of cash that is expected from PYPL and EBAY will trigger a possible movement in prices, it might be easier to hedge the position by playing with the ratio between the long and short positions."
3284855,25047,2015-06-26T18:15:11-04:00,"eBay had a severe flaw when compared to Amazon.com. A flaw I had already highlighted in a previous article.However, an incoming change is bound to eliminate this flaw.This article covers the change, the expected results, and why this is a positive for eBay.","Five months ago, I wrote an article titled ""Why Does Amazon.com Keep Cleaning eBay's Clock?"". In this article, I explained one of the reasons why eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) kept on losing to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).The reason I identified was that Amazon.com listed its wares starting from a product page paradigm, whereas eBay listed them on an offer paradigm, perhaps due to its roots in auctions.The obvious problem with eBay's approach was that each different offer by each different seller was a different listing. So while Amazon.com might have 100 sellers selling the same product in a single product page, eBay would have 100 different pages with offers on that same product.Obviously, this made specific product offers difficult to find. If you searched for a given product and ordered the results by price, for instance, you'd see tens of pages of similar products by different sellers. This created a never-ending chore to find the right offer which made buying less agreeable. On top of that, of course, it also made it harder to cleanly compare different offers on the same product by different sellers. If you missed a term in the description, you'd simply not get all available offers, perhaps even hiding the best bargains for that product.Also importantly, since there were no product pages, it became hard for eBay to carry reviews on those same products. And thus reviews become an Amazon.com advantage. People want to see reviews, people flock to Amazon. This created the risk that upon seeing the reviews, lazy as consumers are, they'd simply buy the product there. Which in turn led to it being easier to sell at more expensive prices on Amazon.com. Which in turn attracted the sellers wanting to access those higher selling prices.That is, while many times it was cheaper to buy on eBay, since it was harder to find the bargains, many consumers didn't even try. And eBay threw away a possible competitive advantage.My Suggestion At The TimeSeeing what I described above, I said that eBay could do something about it - it could substitute its ""offer-based"" paradigm with a product-page paradigm similar to Amazon.com's.I also said that it shouldn't be too hard, that sellers used to also selling on Amazon.com would quickly get used to it.Why Am I Bringing This Up Today?As it were, eBay is taking a step in doing exactly what I said it ought to do. As per ChannelAdvisor, from June 29 (Monday next week) eBay will be requiring product identifiers. The relevant quote from ChannelAdvisor is this:It might seem a small change, but this is all that eBay needs to create product pages just like Amazon.com's. And I am certain such will happen right after the listings carry the relevant information.In quick succession, this will help product discovery. It will also quickly enable a decent review system, which should rapidly be populated by eBay's large customer base. And finally, it will be a boon to consumers trying to find the best bargains.ConclusioneBay has done what I said it ought to do, and this is a positive for eBay. I expect the June 29 change to bring about product pages, better search and a better review system. As a result, I expect eBay's competitiveness to increase versus Amazon.com (all other things being equal).Indeed, this should also allow eBay's greater price competitiveness (cheaper goods) to shine through, whereas those were previously hidden below thousands of similar offers. In short, this is a positive for eBay."
3297535,83436,2015-07-01T13:46:22-04:00,"IPO are notoriously rough and unpredictable times for a stock, and separating these two behemoth companies in the coming spinoff could add similar problematic conditions for investors.Removing PayPal from eBay will present tumult for eBay, due to low growth projections made by eBay recently.High perception of PayPal growth can lead to a bubble-like surge in PayPal stock fresh into the IPO - this can be problematic.The greatest source of tumult for eBay stock will come from the cross-section of investors who liked eBay before, but who will transfer a larger chunk of that investment into.","Be Careful of the SplitNo IPO/Spin-off is worth walking towards blindly. We must create an outline of price activity for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) as the coming split takes place. I admit a relative/conservative take on IPOs in general, and believe a safe window of investment considerations can be made for each investor to ponder.PayPal has been granted a very high 17% company growth rate for next year. For this reason, PayPal's spinoff will possibly share some resemblance to post-IPO price surge - just like Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) IPO.PayPal's introductory stock charts could possibly provide a series of massive green candlesticks that will inevitably reach exhaustion and a radical downturn, due to day trader sell-off. The technical environment in this break-out period will yield great trades, or great devastation for late buyers.Long-term investors, with no intention of flipping their trades, will probably do best to buy PayPal immediately on spinoff morning - or to wait past the introductory period altogether. Buying later, after surge confirmation takes root, could lead to buying just as the turnaround starts to happen.IPO ConundrumThe fact is, IPO frequently have a high plateau at the beginning, which then collapses for a while, hits a bottom, remains there, and finally begins to build again. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was a prime example how a prized IPO faltered.However, PayPal makes money today, and Facebook's revenue during IPO was still in question overall. This is why I would brace for an Alibaba-style opening for PayPal. Over-excitement will lead to tumult. For longer term investors, great pain comes from buying a position that goes deeply upside down multiple times over a month. If the PayPal ticker skyrockets, investors who are in-the-money will start dumping shares.eBay's Stock: Not as Good as PayPal?eBay has just recently released growth projections for both eBay and PayPal. eBay gave itself a 0% to 5% growth projection for both of the next two years, 2016 and 2017. Comparatively, PayPal was given a 17% growth projection.Those who invest in eBay today have been invested in PayPal all along. When the golden goose that is PayPal is removed from eBay, even huge eBay fans will have to decide where their money should go.eBay's stock has performed well, but in 2013, the company was declaring 13% growth. It was also denying a PayPal spin off. Today, eBay is declaring its growth to be 0% to 5% - so the old stock motion does not translate to eBay, post spin-off.As investors, we must ask ourselves one simple question:Anyone who answers that question directly sees the potential for a sizeable cross-section of eBay investors to possibly dump its stock in favor of PayPal. This is not to negate eBay - it just follows the most likely route of attention.For this reason, I project that while PayPal's stock will possibly bubble upward for a while, eBay's stock might suffer a period of unnatural setback - as 7% to 10% of eBay stockholders transfer the majority of their shares to PayPal exclusively (I feel this is a conservative estimate). Simply put, long-term buyers, and mega-investors buy stocks they are comfortable with. The comfort here goes to PayPal, in terms of future growth.This situation might create an opportunity for any initial eBay inflation period to provide decent short opportunities. I don't really recommend it, though. eBay is still a great buying environment in many ways, and the market isn't going to spontaneously forget that. Also, valid pricing of these stocks could buttress eBay stock for a smoother-than-expected introduction into its solo careereBay's Stock Won't DieeBay's stock won't die, possibly far from it. Its stock will just begin to catch some retail price motion, removed from the benefits of the financial-style growth that came from PayPal. It's possible that eBay will become a player's stock, with more volatility introduced. PayPal may carry the reliable upward growth that its stock carries today.IPO Trauma WarningLet's look at a very recent example of IPO whiplash, from the company called Box (NYSE:BOX).This IPO was praised widely, and bellowed by Jim Cramer as an excellent buy. The way the IPO played out was actually quite treacherous to many. BOX wasn't necessarily a bad investment at face value, but the price action could have whipped someone's head off.As the future of BOX stock played out after IPO, we see that questions of growth through profit walls can cause stagnation of the stock.However, eBay has profits, makes sales, and money is there. So, a comparison to BOX is unfair. However, seeing the BOX IPO can help in two ways:Again, BOX's trajectories are not going to be identical to either eBay or PayPal. These comparisons just offer weights placed upon linear projections - based on market dynamics. I don't think eBay's stock will plummet, or sag forever by today's measure. I do think that compared to PayPal, eBay will look like the lesser half.For the reasons mentioned, for conservative medium-term or long-term investors, it might be best to avoid eBay's stock for the spinoff phase this month. I suggest taking smart positions in PayPal, and if extreme runaway candlesticks form, then you might have waited too long to step in, until price action settles.IPOs or spin-offs like this are huge baiting grounds for very active daily traders. A fortune could be made by playing the momentary surges and crashes that surround the introductory period. A fortune could also be easily lost. For investors who can't resist getting into one of these stocks on the split, PayPal is the obvious winner.The Fundamental IssueFor traders who investigate company valuation vs. stock price carefully, it all comes down to valuation. If the right valuations are assigned, then both eBay and PayPal could be great plays, theoretically. I think for this instance, raw valuations are out the window, and that crowd hype over PayPal will play the dominate role, and this will create a partial vacuum for eBay to be temporarily lost within. Play at your own risk!(This article is based on technical observations and fair judgment of IPO/spinoff volatility considerations. This advice is for investors who want some loose technical insight. These are not absolutions, or declared predictions. I believe these are fair-minded conservative projections)."
3249745,67313,2015-06-11T12:29:43-04:00,eBay's marketplace will remain challenged due to competitive pressure.The near-term outlook for PayPal is constructive but long-term risks remain.The marketplace is a good platform for BABA to move into the US.,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) recently delivered a presentation in which management stated that it remains focused on turning its marketplace operations around. However, I am not convinced by the story because eBay faces a key challenge in changing consumer perception of it as a second-hand/used item auction platform. In the near term, competitive pressure from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will persist. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is also pushing into e-commerce to compete directly against AMZN. In the long term, the potential entry of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) into the US to compete against eBay is even more concerning. I do not expect eBay to turn around. Even if it does, it will be at least two years before we could see any meaningful results. I remain bearish on eBay. The best possible outcome is for BABA to acquire eBay to gain instant access to the US market.The 2016 guidance for the marketplace was below street consensus. On the other hand, PayPal was in line with consensus. The marketplace continues to face headwinds from the SEO changes and password reset we witnessed in 2014, and this has compounded the shift of consumers away from eBay. Post the PayPal spinoff, it is necessary for management to improve the selection in the marketplace and build a more engaging product/brand to generate repeat sales. With a renewed focus on small businesses, the company is taking a different path from its prior strategy of focusing on large, full-price retailers and it is necessary to rejuvenate growth. As for any potential M&As, investors should not expect much given that the company is looking to expand geographies and upgrade its talent/tech assets. In order to keep investors happy, returning capital with a $2 billion buyback is a good start, in my view.Unlike the marketplace that will face multiple competitive headwinds, PayPal should be relatively okay as Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Android Pay slowly ramp up. Guidance of a 15% revenue growth with flat operating margin is reasonable and in line with consensus. However, the free cash guidance was reduced by $100 million to reflect the greater clarity post separation. Finally, it is worth highlighting that the long-term risk to PayPal cannot be ignored because it is not fully embedded in any mobile OS ecosystem which is becoming an increasingly important part of users' everyday life.ConclusionThe headwinds that the marketplace faces make it difficult for investors to be attracted to eBay's stock. As I have mentioned in the past, the marketplace will be driven mostly on M&A speculations and the only likely candidate to buy eBay is BABA which is looking to be a truly global platform."
3250065,69965,2015-06-10T14:44:35-04:00,eBay's Marketplaces business is getting crushed by the competition on revenue growth.eBay's has somehow lost its way when it comes to cash flow growth as well.There are 3 changes eBay must make to revive this business or risk falling further behind.,"The fact that eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) will shortly be splitting its Marketplaces and PayPal divisions is no secret. In fact, this upcoming split has been talked and written about so much, that it feels like the Geico commercial saying, ""everybody knows that."" The bigger question is, what will eBay look like after PayPal is spun off? With eBay suggesting 0% to 5% revenue growth for both 2015 and 2016, clearly the Marketplaces business needs an overhaul. There are three changes that must be made, and eBay doesn't need to wait for the PayPal split to implement these ideas.Nothing to write home aboutIn eBay's current quarter, the Marketplaces business results were just plain ugly. This division reported a revenue decline of just over 3%, and gross merchandise volume was down 2%. While it's true that merchandise volume was up 5% excluding currency fluctuations, this is certainly nothing to write home about.It's obvious that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a natural competitor to eBay's Marketplaces business. Given that Amazon reported annual revenue growth last quarter of 22% excluding currency, to say Amazon is crushing eBay is an understatement. That being said, a competitor that has emerged seemingly in just the last year is Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN).Many investors still think of Groupon as a ""deals"" company, but looking at the composition of the company's revenue, Groupon is more a retailer. In the past year, Groupon's Deals business has shrunk to just under 50% of the company's overall revenue, while Groupon Goods represents 52%. With Goods revenue up 18%, Groupon's retail offerings are a very real threat to eBay Marketplaces as well.What happened to eBay's cash flow growth?Many eBay investors have been willing to accept slower revenue growth, as long as the company's cash flow growth stayed intact. Given that eBay doesn't carry inventory, or have to deal with huge warehouses like Amazon or Groupon, it seems reasonable to expect eBay to outperform by this measure.However, eBay actually reported negative 9% core operating cash flow (net income + depreciation) growth on a year-over-year basis last quarter. By comparison, Amazon grew its core operating cash flow by more than 24% annually. Groupon virtually destroyed its competition by producing core operating cash flow growth of more than 280%.Slower revenue growth is one thing, but when two of your online competitors leave you in the dust in cash flow growth, something needs to be done.Three changeseBay's Marketplaces decline seems relatively easy to fix believe it or not, it's just a question of if management is ready for real change? The first thing eBay must do to turn Marketplaces around is give sellers a better reason to offer free shipping and returns.A big part of why Groupon Goods and Amazon have grown quickly is because they offer simplified free shipping and returns. eBay offers better placement if free shipping or easy returns are available, but this means very little when a buyer can sort listings by price or ending time.eBay needs to offer more free listings, cheaper final value fees, or both, for sellers who choose these buyer friendly options. These changes would encourage buyers to check out eBay instead of going to Amazon or Groupon Goods first.The second change Marketplaces must make is buyers and sellers must both be able to leave real feedback. eBay's feedback policy change regarding buyers has been one of the most consistent complaints by eBay sellers. Essentially eBay eliminated negative feedback for buyers. In addition, eBay will remove negative feedback for sellers depending on the circumstances.Sellers on eBay want to know they can trust buyers, just as much as buyers want to deal with trustworthy sellers. Real feedback would allow buyers to avoid sellers who are bad for eBay's reputation. eBay could also eliminate buyers who are unscrupulous, which is part of why sellers go elsewhere.The third change eBay Marketplaces must make is the company needs an Amazon Prime competitor. The company will run a test beginning in Germany called eBay+. This offering will give sellers better product placement, discounts on selling fees, and a subsidy to cut the cost of shipping and returns. At a price of $17 to $22 a year, this would seem like a step in the right direction.However, this offering is totally dependent on sellers' willingness to participate. eBay needs a Prime competitor where the buyer subscribes for free shipping and easy returns, no matter what seller they choose. The company could use part of this additional revenue to incent the sellers in question, or just make free shipping and easy returns the site standard.The point is, eBay's Marketplaces business is falling behind its competition. Without some major changes, owning eBay after the PayPal split may be like losing an auction bid … a big disappointment."
3302275,70385,2015-07-04T10:44:55-04:00,"The XOOM remittance company takeover will expand PayPal's reach internationally.PayPal could take market share from the $53 billion US remittance sending business by being a ""one-stop shop"" for mobile payments.After PayPal spins off, investors should own PayPal rather than eBay for better growth potential.","Online auction and e-commerce leader eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is putting some final additions into PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) just before the online payment system business spins off and lists separately. PayPal already is widely used for online transactions and transfers, but eBay's acquisition of XOOM Corp (NASDAQ:XOOM) will expand PayPal's reach internationally.After the announcement, XOOM stock shot up 21% to $25.05, slightly above the deal's $25 a share, or $890 million buyout price. eBay closed that day up 2.36% at $61.85.Money remittance volumes in developing countries are still quite large, estimated to be about $440 billion in 2015 by the World Bank, and when high-income countries are included, the total estimate rises to $586 billion.With the takeover, PayPal, which will split from eBay on July 17, will be going up against industry leader Western Union (NYSE:WU), holding about 15% of the world market. Second-place Moneygram has 5% and third-place Ria Money Transfer is about the same.XOOM has around 1% market share, transferring about $6.9 billion during the 12 months ending December 2014. XOOM's 1.3 million-customer base is much smaller than PayPal's current 68 million active users. However, XOOM opens PayPal up to its 37-nation network that services the major remittance markets such as China, India, The Philippines and Mexico.Source: trak.inXOOM recent performanceXOOM listed on Nasdaq in February 2013 at $21 a share and the day before the takeover announcement was at $20.70. In the first quarter, XOOM revenues grew 14%. It reported a net loss of $1.3 million and adjusted EBITDA was $3.7 million. For full-year fiscal 2015, the company is projecting a GAAP diluted EPS of $0.01-$0.11XOOM is an online service by which customers can make transfers on any device and in some countries pay utility bills. Transfer recipients don't need a bank account or internet access to receive funds. XOOM also works with other remittance partners to extend its geographical coverage.Benefits to PayPalMost US online purchasers will have either used or heard of PayPal. It dominates US online payments and is a default payment system after credit cards on many websites. It's well ahead of the second closest rival Amazon Payments and third place Google Wallet.Barring any major technical problem or cyberattack on PayPal, I don't think that hierarchy will change much. Even after the split from eBay, the e-commerce site will still continue to use PayPal, so PayPal shouldn't lose any eBay volume.I imagine that with XOOM, PayPal could possibly pull market share from other remittance companies as US money senders could choose to use PayPal directly without having to use a third-party service. The ""one-stop shop"" aspect of doing all online transactions through one service may be appealing to some customers.The US is the biggest remittance market, sending over $53 billion internationally a year. Investors who are interested in buying PayPal shares after the split will want to keep on top of how this opportunity develops.Mobile PaymentsThe biggest opportunity for PayPal is the biggest challenge. The rise of mobile payments has expanded PayPal's world far beyond eBay and the PC. XOOM's mobile payment platform will extend PayPal even further into new countries and among new demographic groups that may not regularly use or even have credit cards but can now transfer funds through PayPal. PayPal can benefit from the service and currency exchange fees from each transaction.In the US market, mobile wallet users still prefer PayPal. A recent survey of about 1,700 adults showed PayPal was the number one selected provider, beating out even Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), 71% to 55%, respectively. That said, it is possible that the popular Apple Pay service could take some market share as more Apple devices are purchased. To counteract that, PayPal has a partnership with Samsung to operate on the manufacturer's devices and in general PayPal has mobile apps for both Android and Microsoft OS devices.Source: businessinsiderOther small and start-up mobile payment businesses have popped up, such as Square, so the mobile payment market space is getting crowded. PayPal's scale will give it a good start when it re-lists, Recent quarterly transaction value saw double-digit growth, while revenue was up 14% to $2.1 billion.Back in February, I wrote investors should consider buying eBay well before the split to take advantage of any share price gain between then and the split-up date as investor interest rose. Since then, eBay stock is up 9.5%.With a quality spin-off company, from the start you get good performance that drives earnings, and on top of that there can be some market momentum lift as institutional investors build up stakes.As for which to stock you should own, eBay, PayPal or both, I still consider PayPal to be the one to own when everything's done. Not only do I think PayPal has better growth prospects compared to eBay, in general spin-off companies usually can outperform the original company over the following 1-2 years."
3267975,39551,2015-06-18T12:41:10-04:00,"EBAY’s take rate is expected to continue to fall.Despite EBIT growth, the company has spent less on sales and marketing in the last 5 years.Investors seem cautious prior to the split.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is caught up between a tough competition and a separation process. As long as separation is not complete I do not expect a meaningful appreciation in share price. However, I do expect some event driven fluctuations in the share price and short term speculations and profit taking. These are the reasons why I think this is not a time to take a long-term position in EBAY. In addition, following are a few other reasons which I believe do not make EBAY an attractive investment at the moment.EBAY's ChallengesAs you know eBay's take rate is the commission the company charges on the goods and services sold through its platforms (eBay Marketplaces, Payment system, and Enterprise). EBAY's take rate continues to decline due to increasing competition. In the most recent quarter, the take rate for marketplaces transactions decreased by 0.13% to 8.28%. Similarly, payments take rate decreased by 0.12% to 3.43%, while the enterprise transactions' take rate decreased by 0.13% to 22.09%.The two main reasons contributing to this decline are growing competition and increased volumes in merchant services. Merchandise volumes include a higher concentration of net Total Payment Volume [TPV] from larger merchants who generate higher volume at lower take rates. Now with Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) entry into the U.S. markets the volume of Gross Merchandise Volume [GMV] is further expected to rise. This will put further downward pressure on EBAY's take rate.Underinvestment In MarketingThe company was also forced to reduce its take rate on its StubHub platform recently, as its competitors reduced their prices. While the company's daily deals business is gaining more traction, it doesn't help much as it has a lower take rate. I believe all these factors are impacting the company's overall average take rate and are adversely impacting its profits. EBAY's investments failed to keep pace with opportunities. Over the past five years, eBay underinvested in marketing on the back of decreasing incremental gross profits and the need to step up spend on the Marketplaces technology platform. The company needs to re-focus its branding efforts to help elevate awareness of the company's fixed-price platform, particularly with millennials where the company underperforms peers.However, There Are Some PositivesDespite these challenges there are a few areas where the company is likely to expand its profitability and its user base.Adaptability of the CompanyI believe that eBay has the ability to understand and change its products and services according to the demand in the market. As the company's CIO, Scott Seese, once said, the company knows that its customers behavior is transformed by digital, social, location based and mobile tech. The company starts by asking what its customers need and then how to help its employees meet those demands. While the company has been slow to market its fixed-price platform to millennials, EBAY's adaptability is one of its strength. There is significant room for marketing investments, particularly to capture the important millennials population and build brand awareness around fixed price offerings. However, this will likely reduce margins in the near-term.Revolutionizing the Retail IndustryI believe that the overall e-commerce industry still has a huge margin of expansion. Along with its existing competitors, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba , eBay manages to add new e-commerce users in the market daily. These three e-commerce giants have revolutionized the way retail businesses work. According to estimates, more than one billion active users currently use e-commerce while there are over 155 million active users for eBay. I believe these e-commerce companies are far from their potential. So far, they have captured a retail market of over $1 trillion while the universal retail market (online & offline) volume is around $14.4 trillion. Based on these numbers, I believe the market will keep on expanding until at least 50% of total retail is done through e-commerce. This expansion should continue to reflect in EBAY's earnings.FinancialsEBAY reported decent 1Q15 Marketplace segment revenue of $2.1 billion. Despite continued headwinds from currency movements, the reported GMV of $20 billion came in stronger than expected. But this was more than offset by weakness in marketing services following reclassification to its Enterprise segment. Payments segment also reported decent revenue of $2.11 billion, as reported TPV of$61.4 billion and segment take-rate of 3.2% came in stronger than expected. Going forward, for 2Q15 analysts (Credit Suisse) expect Marketplaces Non-Vehicle GMV to be $19.4 billion and Payments TPV to be $61.5 billion.After its pending divorce with PayPal in third quarter, EBAY will be able to focus more on its core business and I expect the company to regain momentum in 2016. According to Credit Suisse, the company is expected to have around 10.8% Y/Y growth in GMV, as opposed to 9.7% in 2014. It will further enable the company to invest in more revenue generating segments, such as 'structuring data' and 'multiscreen product experience', etc.ConclusionAs I said before I do not think this is a right time to take a position in EBAY due to its pending separation with PayPal. Post this divorce, the rationale for owning EBAY shares will depend on specific catalysts to drive growth of GMV and TPV. In the long-run, I believe the company has the potential to improve both GMV and take rate. Going forward, the focus will be on 1) take rate improvements through the release of new ad product ""Promoted Listings"" and 2) GMV reacceleration through structured catalog data. Faster-than-expected operating leverage as eBay begins to realize the benefits of its marketing spend can also turn investors more positive on EBAY."
3247236,32711,2015-06-09T14:45:55-04:00,"eBay's marketplace business has been experiencing sluggish revenue growth for some time now, as a result of tough competition and slowing demand for online auctions.Projections of how the standalone company will perform showed that this weak growth is expected to continue.Investors looking to profit from PayPal's impressive growth may be better off waiting till after the split.","As the PayPal spinoff draws nearer, it is becoming increasingly clear that eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) two businesses, marketplaces and payments, are on very divergent growth trajectories. The company just released its projections for the two businesses post-spinoff, which confirmed that the core business is still expected to deliver lackluster growth. Is it a good idea to own EBay going into the separation?Weak marketplace growthEBay was once the go-to destination for online shopping, partly because it didn't have very much competition in the space as one of the earlier entrants. This situation has changed dramatically. It is now beset by competition from every possible direction due to the explosion of e-commerce in America and abroad. At the same time, consumers are less willing to put up with eBay's auction system, preferring to buy their products immediately. One could in fact view it as a legacy company.This has translated into fairly weak top line growth over the last few years. In the company's latest report, revenue for the segment in fact fell for the first time since 2009. Its forward projections aren't particularly encouraging either. In 2015 and 2016, constant currency revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 0%-5%, trailing projections for overall e-commerce growth of 15.6% in 2015 and 13.1% in 2016, according to eMarketer, a market research firm.The bottom line is expected to do better, at the very least outpacing revenue growth from 2016 on according to the company's forecast. However, if revenue comes in flat, this could be a very low growth figure indeed.PayPal's numbersThe weakness in marketplaces was probably anticipated by many investors, as expectations for the segment weren't particularly high-strung following the latest earnings report. What was not expected, and what in all likelihood caused the selloff of nearly 4% following the report, was a cut in PayPal's free cash flow forecast.The figure is now expected to be in the range of $1.6-$1.8 billion, or roughly $100 million lower than was previously anticipated, as the company now has more visibility on how much the separation will cost. Revenue growth expectations were more or less in line with estimates, at around 15%-18% in constant currency for 2015 and around 15% for the medium term.Around the same time, a Piper Jaffray analyst warned that the standalone payments company will be facing increased competition as investor interest in the space picks up. Still, its prospects look much, much better than the marketplace business, with very solid revenue growth and free cash flow expected to grow in line with revenue.In before the split?PayPal clearly looks like the better performer of the two standalone companies. The question is whether it is a good idea to own the combined stock going into the separation. While it allows investors to profit from what could be a nice initial pop for PayPal, the opposite may be true for the marketplace segment.At the moment, the marketplace segment simply doesn't look like a very attractive company to own due to its lackluster growth prospects. As such, investors may be better off waiting till after the split to avoid owning a company that at the moment seems to be underperforming.ConclusionEBay released its growth projections for the post spinoff marketplaces and payments companies, and as expected, the marketplace segment doesn't look too good. Revenue growth looks very weak indeed, and although the bottom line is expected to perform better, a long term investment thesis would need sustainable top line expansion as well. Investors looking to profit from PayPal's growth without being exposed to weakness in the marketplace business might be better off waiting till after the separation."
3300345,61281,2015-07-02T14:13:02-04:00,"PayPal spin-off record date set for next week; investors should get ready to execute their strategy.In an earlier article, I presented my spin-off arbitrage investment thesis that is based on the expected outflow of cash from EBAY to PYPL.In this article, I show that sharp swings in the ‘when-issued’ market can materialize in this case and could yield significant returns.","Last week, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) set the official dates for the PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) spin-off in an announcement that caught some investors unprepared when the company set the record date for two weeks after the announcement, on July 8. In an earlier article, I described a spin-off arbitrage investment strategy to the PayPal spin-off that could yield substantial gains for investors. That article was published at the end of May, and, since then, we had some spin-offs that took place in June that could indicate how the market treats spin-offs these days. Of course, none of the recent spin-offs have the same unique characteristics of the long-awaited PayPal spin-off, but they can serve as a good indicator of the market reaction to the spin-off wave.Before I present previous examples and explain how I believe the PYPL spin-off will react, I want to present my views on spin-off investment/trading strategies. Investors should remember spin-offs differ from one another in a number of ways:The examples I want to present are three examples from June of Baxter International (NYSE:BAX), Masco (NYSE:MAS) and Integra LifeSciences (NASDAQ:IART) as well as two older examples of Agilent and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE):As I mentioned above, the June spin-offs might not be comparable to a PayPal spin-off, but they can serve as a good indicator to see how the 'when-issued' market reacted to spin-offs lately. Each spin-off had a different length of 'when-issued' market, a different distribution ratio, and a different spin-off reason; however, all of them yielded a double digit return for one side of the spin-off and a negative return for the other end of the spin-off.As shown in chart 1 below, BAX.wi (BAX 'when-issued') yielded a 14% return in the 'when-issued' market while the stock spun-off division BXLT.wi yielded a negative 7% return. An investor holding 100 units pre-distribution and choosing a long-short strategy could have produced a 10% upside from the 'when-issued' market in only two weeks. A leveraged position could have yielded a much higher return.In the June spin-offs of Masco and Integra, the position should have been different. Had investors shorted the mother company and held the spun-off shares long, they would have yielded 19% and 26% of the long positions respectively and 5% and 1% in the short position. Of course, leveraged positions would have increased the returns significantly.As shown in Chart 2 below, in the Agilent/Keystone case, both stocks rose in the ""when-issued"" market and yielded a 6% return each for a long position during a two-week period.Expedia/TripAdvisor was a case similar to MAS and IART, where the mother company declined in the ""when-issued"" market while the spun-off share rose, and long/short holders could have optimized their return with spin-off arbitrage.PayPal Spin-OffIn the examples above, I present potential spin-off investment strategies that could be translated into impressive returns in a relatively short amount of time. However, the most important thing when investing in spin-offs is choosing the correct long leg and short leg for the trading, which will maximize the return before any additional trading happens and any leverage is used. I believe that a significant number of investors held EBAY solely for the PYPL exposure over the years and, once the spin-off was announced, they even increased their EBAY position to receive more PYPL shares after the spin-off. I believe that once distribution starts, the first (and probably the largest) shareholders will receive the distributed shares and sell some of their EBAY shares in the 'when-issued' market to pressure down the EBAY.wi share price. At the same time, the same investors will look to increase their PayPal position and try to buy additional PYPL.wi shares on top of the quantity they already have. This action will pressure PYPL.wi share prices up.Both of the processes described above (declining EBAY.wi price and rising PYPL.wi price) will continue along the 'when-issued' market lifetime until PYPL's first day of trading on July 20. There is good reason to believe that the large swings presented above will appear in different companies from different sectors and different spin-off specifics. I believe that the market will add a premium to the PYPL.wi shares once PayPal is a stand-alone company, and the long wait for this spin-off may increase the demand for PYPL.wi shares even further.Current eBay shareholders who decide to use the spin-off arbitrage strategy could gain a 10% to 35% return based on the timing of receiving the distributed shares. Investors who receive the first batch from eBay and short EBAY.wi will gain the most from the short and long PYPL.wi and, as we get closer to July 20, most of the short potential in EBAY.wi will be exhausted.ConclusionsIn an earlier article, I presented an investment strategy that enables investors to maximize their returns from the PayPal spin-off. The two primary elements in this thesis are choosing the correct short leg and long leg and assuming the market will price the long leg at a premium and the short leg below its current value. I presented some cases where choosing the correct legs could have yielded substantial returns from a long/short position throughout the ""when-issued"" market lifetime. I believe that in the PayPal spin-off case, EBAY.wi should be the short leg, and PYPL.wi should be the long leg. Historical swings suggest that this strategy could yield a substantial return."
3232856,83436,2015-06-03T09:36:52-04:00,"In 2014, Google stripped eBay of all unnaturally earned search ranking – a serious blow, since Google still captures almost 70% of the world’s search.Internally, sellers are having issues with eBay that might be peaking.eBay revenue continues on the expected trajectory, almost as though these issues don’t exist, yet, undoubtedly, true profits must be affected, so the injury is possibly being hidden somehow.","Last year, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) took a serious blow when Google (GOOG, GOOGL) released algorithm update Panda 4.0 in May 2014. Google's update exposed additional web developer spam-loopholes used to boost search rankings. It turned out that eBay was one of the most excessive users of such subterfuge, exposed by Google for using countless ""back-door"" websites filled with spam links that drive eBay listings high into Google search ranks. eBay lost around 80% of its Google search exposure overnight, and has not regained old exposure percentages - not even close.Until April 2014, Google put eBay listings into almost every product search. That exposure likely translated to a comparatively high purchase rate, for the simple reason that eBay's product listings often deliver very low prices comparatively, due to eBay's large offering of second-hand goods.With Google's Panda 4.0 release, eBay disappeared from Google searches, and after a year, has remained at 5-7% exposure rate compared to April 2014 (citing fair-handed personal observation throughout the year).This drastic decrease in exposure would translate to a sizable loss of sales, in addition to a few other issues eBay is having internally with sellers. Before we look at seller issues, let's look at one interesting shift in eBay's balance/income sheets from last year that display another sizeable cost to note:By comparing the red and orange number, you can see the shift between 2014 and 2013 income tax and net income above. Income tax has multiplied by 5, compared to previous years. Net income has dropped by 98%. I've checked these numbers with two sources just to ensure it was not a typo; Nasdaq sheets and Yahoo sheets. The reasons for those huge shifts might have been disclosed and are just out of my reach today. Any input on this matter would be appreciated by all investors most likely (please leave comments below this article).The Seller ProblemeBay undoubtedly has plenty of value as a company, but there are some internal issues that could be turning foul this year. It's true that today, many would call eBay a buyer's market, because prices have been on a continuous path of reduction since eBay's conception. As lower prices open up eBay to the world, seller incentive is disappearing to many degrees. Half a decade ago, sellers showed up already within the 'greener pasture,' but now many sellers seem certain they have been pushed onto the other side of the fence, and maybe into another zip code altogether.eBay has experienced six major problems that began chipping away at their seller base:The first problem is that eBay opened up widely to cheap generic overseas products. In many product categories, American sellers are finding their own products unreachable in eBay searches, and cheap generic products (among other such variations) are ranking higher in search, at a much lower price. Price wars for cheap products serve a purpose, but the market for generics is different than eBay's original success strata, for better or worse.The second problem is that popularity led to seller overcrowding. The draw for sellers came from making sales at decent prices, but more sellers led to decreased profits. The loss of substantial sales profits caused many sellers to leave. When margins are shaved bare enough, new sellers have a briefer stay. Over the last decade, a dozen such cycles has led to a total change in the way eBay sellers must operate. Long ago, any seller with decent items could develop a sustainable income. With every new wave of profit-crushing seller turnover, sellers must become higher-volume, lower-profit businesses. Today, many people list items on eBay and receive zero bids, or very few bids that lead to steal-away prices.The third seller problem is how eBay decided to transform product search. In the attempt to unclog the overcrowded search, eBay put the primary search algorithm into an attempted 'smart' search parameter called ""Best Match."" Best Match tries to weed out the junk, or the unrelated searches that used keywords to game the system. As eBay becomes more overcrowded with sellers, the Best Match has become perceived as a near-sinister tool loathed by sellers. The truth is, it's only partially sinister, because while eBay uses Best Match to increase the exposure of some listings (possibly good), eBay has also used Best Match to favor certain sellers at certain times (boxing other sellers out momentarily, the sinister part). This has led many sellers to experience eBay's painfully obvious traffic manipulation system that (poorly) attempts to give sellers a false illusion of natural search. In actuality, this manipulation leads to a fluttering effect on seller listing exposure, which has been noted to appear clearly manipulative regarding how many sales a seller can achieve each month:Seller discussions seem to correlate this manipulation to be true without a shadow of doubt, because they witness it daily (this wall-of-text posts spits out the whole suspicion). One of the deepest quips for this traffic issue is that, for overcrowded products, a seller's item might never show up in the Best Match search, or after even a year of listing an item, that item might be permitted only a handful of views in entirety.Problem four came last year when eBay and PayPal's relationship developed the deepest conflicting policy to date. eBay allows sellers to set their own window for return policies. Even if a seller chooses a 14-day return window, PayPal would enforce a 30-45 day return window regardless. Sellers coped with this problem decently, with much complaining, but as of last year, PayPal has extended the return window to a mandatory 180 days for items 'not as described' - yes, that's six months! While this number likely comforts buyers, for sellers this number is so bizarrely high (multiples longer than any market comparison, including credit card charge-backs) that sellers are afraid to sell many product types, such as used electronics. Some sellers have speculated that this new policy is a result of allowing generic Chinese electronics and auto parts to flood eBay; some such products are known to have a moderately short lifespan.Problem five is that eBay seller success stories clearly do not match up with reality. This includes eBay's own reports of individual success stories that often severely stretch the truth. One example was a claim that a college student was living off eBay income, and paying for college as well. A visit to that seller's store revealed under $200 a month in sales. While this report no longer exists and cannot be linked, this sort of peculiarity is a commonplace situation with eBay towards sellers.A lot of what drives eBay is the perception of success by sellers. For a long time, anyone knew a seller that worked hard could make a living. Today, the internet is filled with new eBay internet gurus who are financially motivated to simply sell people the eBay success story, usually highlighting specific product types to sell. These gurus are slinging thousands of new sellers toward eBay every month, using old success stories that do not apply today.The guru effect is amplifying the seller overpopulation problem to such a high degree that, for some products, a high percentage of sales have reached near-zero profit (see one of many waves of such profit reduction). In these categories, sellers show up, can't sell, and then liquidate their inventory. For these products, it's possible that most offerings are composed of thousands of sellers performing this rolling liquidation. These sales are actually non-sales, because they lead to a deep loss - a loss that is far deeper when a seller's time is calculated. Yet, these sales show up in eBay's revenue stream today.The effect of Google's eBay bust on sellers was unparalleled. The pain hasn't stopped; it has actually magnified. As mentioned, since Google has given eBay the slap heard around the world, eBay's exposure on Google was cut to (and remains) 5%-7% of 2013 exposure. Some eBay-preferred sellers are reporting 75% drop in sales. That number is often claimed as far, far worse for less-preferred sellers who stack up inventory, and experience drudgery of sales, due to what is perceived as the mentioned hidden seller limits, or traffic manipulation issues.Problem six is that eBay's state of seller deception has just possibly reached a new low. All retail business experiences shift in traffic, and for some retail such as eBay, summers can be slower than the holiday seasons. However, this year, the serious effect of Google's ejection of eBay is likely reaching a crescendo. Sellers were given a jaw-dropping announcement early last month, May 2015:Sellers are expected to transition from the current situation commonly described as near record-low sales and near record-low listing views, and now they are being forced to fly blind through the notoriously dry summer months without any form of traffic report, with no guarantee of new traffic reports in the Fall or Winter, and also into the holiday season, when sellers load up on inventory for a busier sales season. Seller chats assume this is eBay's way of hiding the internal bleeding I have been talking about through this entire article.eBay's ObscurationWhile eBay's revenue seems to be on track, something is going on, and that damage is being hidden somehow. Sellers have noted that eBay advertising has stopped, while just in 2012 eBay had 3 separate television commercial campaigns, possibly a cost saving measure. The past ability for eBay to remain above competitors is undeniably linked to eBay's multi-year bending of the Google search engine. The Google problem could cease to improve. Google's attention will likely lead to some degree of artificial suppression of eBay in search, while non-offending competitors will remain under less scrutiny. Sellers have felt the pain, but eBay stock has not, and in fact has skyrocketed over the last few weeks. Household names receive stock market favor, but something is going on here: Just like eBay sellers, investors might want to look out.(I am not asserting direct advice for short-sale investment, especially since eBay's revenue is on track; however, it's possible that eBay has been pushing some potential slowdown or losses under the rug for a later date.)"
3243316,25218,2015-06-08T12:19:05-04:00,"Currently investors have the opportunity to purchase shares of eBay to take advantage the upcoming PayPal spin-off.
        EBay shareholders will own shares of PayPal which has a significant presence in mobile payments and has significant capital appreciation potential.
        Western Union by my calculations has a very small mobile payments presence, which is the major reason why I believe PayPal will significantly outperform Western Union.","In this article, I will present a long-term pair trade opportunity for investors to consider. My potential trade opportunity features a long position in eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and a short position in Western Union (NYSE:WU). The long position in EBAY will enable investors to take advantage of the upcoming PayPal (Pending:PYPL) spin-off. The short position in WU will allow investors to take advantage of the trend of being able to send money digitally rather than physically. For a comparison metric to measure the performance of my pair trade, I will compare the performance to the returns of the iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (NYSEARCA:IYG).Long: EBAYThe reason that investors should consider a long position in EBAY is because the PayPal spin-off will be completed by the end of the third quarter and owning shares of EBAY prior to the distribution record date will allow investors to take advantage of the short-term pop that will most likely occur when PayPal starts trading. The short-term pop in shares of PayPal that will most likely occur is a clear catalyst for considering owning EBAY now. However, as I stated in my first sentence of this article, my pair trade is long-term in nature and there are a number of long-term catalysts that warrant buying EBAY now to capture future growth in shares of PayPal.Mobile PaymentsAs more and more transactions are conducted on mobile devices, PayPal is positioned perfectly for this transition from physical and traditional online payments to mobile payments. In the most recent earnings call, Dan Schulman - CEO Elect of PayPalnoted, ""We also continue to see an increase in mobile payments transactions, now reaching nearly 30% of our overall transactions with mobile payments transactions growing over 40% year-over-year."" [eBay Q1 2015 Earnings Transcript] The following chart from Alice Truong of Quartz shows that PayPal has seen the total percentage of payments that come from mobile significantly increase over the last five years.Revenue GrowthPayPal will have a premium valuation to that of EBAY because revenue growth is significantly higher eBay Marketplaces and will be less impacted by strength in the dollar. The chart below shows that over the last six quarters, revenues for PayPal have grown steadily while revenues for eBay marketplaces have declined steadily over that same period. Specifically when looking at the data from the recent earnings presentation, PayPal has revenues that have increased 14.81% over the last six quarters, while eBay marketplaces have had revenues that have declined 10%.In addition, PayPal will outperform eBay in a rising dollar environment because in the earnings presentation under the guidance for 2015 it was noted that the FX impact on revenues for PayPal would be around 3% and the FX impact on eBay marketplaces was estimated to be 8%.Potential AcquisitionThere have been numerous rumors that a number of technology companies or another financial company will eventually acquire PayPal. However, if I had to choose one company most likely acquire PayPal it would be Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The first reason why I believe that Facebook could potentially acquire PayPal is that they hired David Marcus who was the President of PayPal to be the head of its messaging products. Having this connection and knowledge of PayPal in my mind gives Facebook, if they were looking to acquire PayPal an advantage over most other suitors because they have someone who knows the inner workings of PayPal. Just hiring someone from PayPal by itself does not mean that Facebook could acquire PayPal, however when combined with the fact that Facebook recently added the option to send money to a friends via Facebook messenger, the chances of a potential acquisition have increased. Currently the service is in its initial phase and at this time only supports debit cards. However, PayPal and credit cards will eventually be an option because on the FAQ section it states ""Credit cards, prepaid bank cards and PayPal aren't supported right now.""Short: Western UnionI chose Western Union for the short end of my pair trade because they have been slow to adapt to digital & mobile payments from competitors and they a number of debt repayments over the next six years, which I believe will hinder dividend growth and share buybacks. Western Union and PayPal are connected because they are both major players in the consumer-to-consumer [C2C] money transfer market.CompetitionIn the most recent earnings report presentation, Western Union noted that 79% of their revenues come from C2C. The business is under attack from competitors like PayPal and now Facebook with its new send money feature over messenger. As I noted above Facebook is currently only offering its service to debit cardholders but will expand to credit cards and PayPal users. This is a huge opportunity for Facebook and a huge blow to Western Union because no Western Union digital product was mentioned. Facebook has a massive user base, and if the new send money feature becomes popular, it will most definitely take away business from Western Union.While Western Union does have a mobile app and an online presence, they are significantly behind PayPal. The following chart from the recent earnings presentation shows that revenues from Westernunion.com are only 5% of revenues. The revenues are growing significantly for Westernunion.com, however with the trend away from online to mobile payments, Western Union is falling even further behind the competition.In a presentation from March at the Barclays Emerging Payments Forum Western Union noted that electronic channels totaled only 6% of revenues. The electronic channels for Western Union consist of Westernunion.com and mobile money transfer. Therefore, doing some simple math, Western Union reported in its earnings presentation that 5% of revenues came from their website, which means only 1% of their revenues, is from mobile payments. This is miniscule compared to PayPal, which has 30% of their transaction volume from mobile sources and is the major reason why I chose Western Union for the short end of my pair trade.Debt RepaymentsWestern Union has a number of debt repayments over the next six years that I believe will cause Western Union to slow down its dividend growth and share repurchases. Over the next six years, Western Union has $2.96 billion in debt due and currently they have $1.76 billion in cash on hand. I constructed the following chart with data from the FINRA bonds center to show the payments that Western Union will have to make each of the next six years. As the chart shows, in 2015 Western Union has total payments of $500 million and nearly $1 billion in 2016. Data for each year can be found in the table below the chart. With these upcoming debt payments, I believe the Western Union dividend will stay flat for a long period and the pace of share repurchases will be reduced.Risk/RewardNow that I have covered why PayPal and Western Union were chosen for my pair trade and how they are related I will calculate the current risk and reward of this long-term pair trade. This pair trade is a bit different because I have to calculate the risk of PayPal, which currently is not trading and I have to calculate the risk of eBay post split because once the split occurs, shareholders will own both shares of PayPal & eBay.PayPal-eBay Risk/RewardThe first step I had to try to figure out was the number of PayPal shares that each eBay shareholder would receive. Over the last four quarters, PayPal has accounted for just over 45% of total revenues. Therefore, with each segment being nearly equal, I believe for the purposes of this article that each current eBay shareholder or future shareholder that buys eBay prior to the distribution record date will receive 1 share of PayPal stock for each share of eBay they own.PayPal Estimated ValueTo estimate the value of PayPal I will be using price/sales and applying it to an average of other companies in its industry. I looked at the holdings of the iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF because it owns financials and Western Union was included. I noticed as well that in addition to Western Union, Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) were included and those three were the only companies with the sector of information technology, therefore I used those three companies for my industry comparison.The following tables show my calculations for the estimated the potential upside and downside for PayPal post split, Western Union and eBay post split. For the purposes of this article, I will assume that shareholders will be selling their eBay stock post split because PayPal is the more attractive investment opportunity and the risk/reward of owning shares of eBay post split is not currently appealing.Closing ThoughtsIn closing, I believe a pair trade with a long position in eBay to access the upcoming PayPal spin-off and a short position in Western Union will be a major winning trade over the next five years. PayPal has a strong position in mobile payments with nearly 30% of its payment volume coming from mobile, which is light-years ahead of Western Union. Western Unions largest business is consumer-to-consumer money transfers and PayPal and other competitors are eating into that business and making it more efficient and cost effective to send money to someone. When you combine that with strong overall growth from PayPal, along with rumors of acquisitions that is why I believe PayPal will significantly outperform Western Union over the next five years.Disclaimer: See here."
3168716,23479,2015-05-11T10:58:16-04:00,"In our $60.39 price estimate for eBay, we have forecast net transaction revenues in the marketplaces segment to rise at 5.4% annually over our forecast period.In our valuation model, we expect the high growth rates to persist in the PayPal segment, due to its strong brand image and leading position in the online payments market.While our $60.39 price estimate for eBay’s stock represents near-5% premium to the market, we think there are certain probable scenarios that can impact the stock considerably over the coming years, assuming the market prices in these triggers correctly.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is one of the leading players in the online commerce and payments industry. While our $60.39 price estimate for eBay’s stock represents near-5% premium to the market, we think there are certain probable scenarios that can impact the stock considerably over the coming years, assuming the market prices in these triggers correctly. Specifically, the possibility of accelerated growth in the marketplaces segment (at-par with the overall e-commerce market), and increased competition in the payments business are plausible events that could influence stock price movements for better or worse.Accelerated Growth In The Marketplaces Segment (+10%):Although net transaction revenues in the marketplaces segment rose by 12% in 2012 and 2013, respectively, it increased by only 3% in 2014, owing to various traffic-related headwinds. Last year, eBay faced a security breach due to which it asked all its users to change their passwords. This caused friction as many users avoided the site out of caution. Additionally, changes in Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) SEO algorithm impacted eBay unfavorably, as the latter was penalized for factors such as content quality issues and mismanagement of paid search strategies. The company forecasts that business in the marketplaces segment will worsen in the near term, before showing recovery during the second-half of the year. In Q1 2015, marketplaces’ net transaction revenues fell by 3% annually.In our $60.39 price estimate for eBay, we have forecast net transaction revenues in the marketplaces segment to rise at 5.4% annually over our forecast period. Noting that the global retail e-commerce market (excluding China) is forecast to rise at over 12% during 2014 to 2018, according to eMarketer, we expect eBay to lose some market share in the global e-commerce market. [1] This is mainly due to increased competition, as we expect Amazon and Alibaba to gain market share over our forecast period. Additionally, the entry of newer players and traditional brick-and-mortar players, including Wal-Mart and Target, will further intensify competition for eBay in the future.In the event net transaction revenues in the marketplaces segment increase at about 11% CAGR over our forecast period (at par with the overall market), it would represent a 10% increase in our price estimate. A number of factors make this scenario plausible including: 1) renewed management focus on marketplaces segment post the spin-off of other businesses that lifts innovation within the segment; 2) putting in-place stable and long-term SEO strategies, and improving security features on the platform; and, 3) accelerated push into high-growth markets such as Russia, Brazil, India, etc. eBay’s network effect, which encompasses tens of millions of sellers and more than 155 million active buyers, represents a significant competitive advantage that can be leveraged for future growth.Slower Growth In The PayPal Segment (-10%): PayPal is the bright spot in eBay’s business, as payments net transaction revenues rose by 25%, 18% and 18%, respectively, over the last three years. In our valuation model, we expect the high growth rates to persist in the PayPal segment, due to its strong brand image and leading position in the online payments market. Thus, we have estimated net transaction revenues for PayPal to expand at an annual rate of over 14% over our forecast period. The mobile payments market is expected to see rapid growth in the coming years, and together with PayPal’s innovations, we expect the company to capitalize on these growth opportunities.However, under a scenario wherein payments net transaction revenues rise at a slower pace of 9% CAGR over our forecast period, it would lead to a 10% decrease in our price estimate to $54.60. We believe this scenario is plausible considering the growing threat from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay, Google Wallet, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) Pay, etc. Since Apple Pay is fast gaining traction and that it allows easier and secure transactions, it could eat into PayPal’s mobile payment market share. Moreover, the integration of payments in mobile apps by players such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) could further increase competition for PayPal in the long run. Another factor that could weigh on revenue growth is the expected reduction in take rates due to the addition of larger merchants and high growth at Braintree business (which has lower take rates).Disclosure: None"
3095386,32711,2015-04-23T12:50:49-04:00,"eBay came out with some encouraging numbers for its latest earnings report.However, Paypal again did the heavy lifting, for the first time eclipsing marketplace revenue.With the impending spinoff and disappointing numbers from the marketplace segment, eBay's future is unclear.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) was one of the first companies to get in on the boom in online shopping, and it was initially a very profitable endeavor. The environment, however, has changed. Increased competition from rivals and shifts in consumer preference towards faster alternatives is putting pressure on the company's core business. Although eBay delivered a healthy beat for its most recent report, most of this growth was attributable to its soon to be spun-off payments division, PayPal. As such, its post-spinoff future looks murky to say the least.Payments growthAll in all, it was a strong first-quarter report from eBay. Adjusted EPS of $0.77 rose 10% year-over-year, easily beating the $0.70 analyst consensus. Meanwhile, revenue rose 4.4% to $4.45 billion, also coming in ahead of estimates. Shares rose around 6% in after-hours trade, as investors cheered the beat. However, digging a little further into the report, it becomes clear that all is not well with eBay's underlying business.For the first time in the company's history, PayPal sales surpassed those of the core marketplace division. The payments segment has for a long time been growing faster than its sister company, and the Q1 report once again highlights to what degree the momentum behind both businesses is diverging. While PayPal saw revenue surge 14% for the quarter, the marketplace segment saw sales fall by around 4%.The revenue decline in the segment is the first since 2009, as results were partly impacted by a stronger dollar. Gross merchandise volume also declined, down by around 2%, and international volume was down by some 4%.EBay will, in the short term at least, not have to worry about competition from PayPal. Under the terms of the deal, both have agreed not to develop competing product offerings. However, it has plenty of other problems to worry about.Marketplace weaknessEBay, like many of its peers, is facing increased competition from the 800-pound gorilla of e-commerce, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), as well as a host of other online channels. While global e-commerce sales are projected to rise by 21% this year, EBay's marketplace has so far lagged this growth, averaging around 6.4% for the first three months of the year.To prop up the bottom line, the company has slashed around 7% of its workforce, which was one of the factors driving the earnings beat. Additionally, the company is recovering from a data breach as well as a change in Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search algorithms which drove down traffic to the site. Still, without a means of rebooting the sluggish growth in marketplace sales, the prospects of the standalone company look fairly dim at the moment.According to management, the marketplace business looks to be stabilizing, but it remains to be seen in the coming quarters to what degree the segment can return to sustainable growth. Even with the PayPal business still on board, revenue guidance for the coming quarter looked a little weak, Q2 sales of $4.4-$4.5 billion coming in below a $4.6 billion consensus.ConclusionPayPal has been the main driver behind eBay's growth over the last few years, and with the impending spinoff, the future looks uncertain for eBay. Its marketplace division posted a decline in revenue for the quarter, its first since 2009, and although this is partly due to the stronger dollar, the segment is facing continued challenges and increased competition. While an increased focus on its core operations may boost sales in the long term, it remains to be seen how well the company will perform without PayPal."
3105276,67313,2015-04-28T10:26:36-04:00,eBay's 1Q15 impressed on all metrics and divisions.Long-term challenge on both marketplace and payment remains.One-time beat is no guarantee of long-term trend. Remain cautious on eBay.,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported 1Q15 that was better than expected. Nonetheless, long-term structural and competitive challenges remain for both marketplace and PayPal. While I applaud eBay's management focusing on near-term shareholder value through stock buybacks and maintaining a working relationship between the two divisions, long-term competitive challenges for both business may require additional spending. While some within the investment community continue to be optimistic on a V-shape recovery in the second half, I am more cautious due to competitive reasons.One-time surprise or a beginning of a trend?Total revenue of $4.45b, +5% y/y and EPS of $0.77 beat by 7 cents. Both segments performed above expectations with payment revenue up 14% y/y and marketplace revenue declined 3% y/y. At the marketplace level, GMV growth of +26% suggests a potential stabilization of the segment while at PayPal, active transaction reached a billion, +24% y/y, driven by higher active accounts, +11% to 165m. In short, a good quarter for both segments.Long-term question remainsBefore the bulls start to pound the table on eBay, I would caution that long-term challenges on both PayPal and marketplace remains. On the marketplace side, competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been ramping up and eBay continues to refine its image as an online auction house to lure consumers back onto its site. Additionally, offline retailers such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) have been making pushes online and have been somewhat successful, adding another competitive layer for eBay. Long-term risk remains the potential of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) moving into the US to drive cross-border ecommerce and challenge the North American ecommerce incumbents with lower prices and comparable product quality.As for PayPal, the continued roll-out of Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the resurgence of Google Pay will challenge PayPal. However, PayPal has recently taken the initiative of pursuing M&A in the payment space with the acquisition of Paydiant. The move appears to be both defensive and offensive. Under a defensive scheme, it is evident that the competitive pressure from the large tech names are heating up and that PayPal needs to penetrate further into the mobile payment space to remain relevant. More importantly, Paydiant allows PayPal to get on the offensive as it addresses the key issue that merchants have and that's the inevitable capitulation toward one of the payment platforms, be it AAPL, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), or Google.ConclusionI would caution that a one-time beat does not necessarily mean a long-term trend and I would remain cautious on eBay for the rest of the year."
3059736,69965,2015-04-09T12:08:26-04:00,"Marketplaces' users are growing, but sales are slowing.The PayPal unit is a star.The $70 billion dollar question facing eBay investors is, how much is this whole thing worth?","At this point, most people know that eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is planning to split itself into two separate companies later this year. In theory, this should provide investors a better way to buy into either eBay or PayPal's future growth. In addition, many investors believe by splitting the company there will be additional value unlocked for shareholders. However, if we look at the potential value of each company inside of eBay, it's possible investors are expecting too much.Lots of window shoppersThe first piece of eBay is the company's Marketplaces business. The company's Marketplaces business has been a consistent performer and has over 150 million registered users. The good news is, Marketplaces posted 11% growth in these registered users on a year-over-year basis in the last quarter. The bad news is, the division's gross merchandise volume only increased by 2%.Given that user growth increased at a rate five times that of merchandise volume, apparently eBay is becoming a window shopping destination. Users are interested in signing up for the ability to buy and sell, but less are following through.There are a few reasons that eBay's Marketplaces business is seeing sluggish sales growth. First, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) appears to be gaining traction in taking sellers and volume from eBay. According to ComScore Inc. the reason behind this move is clear, Amazon is attracting more visitors. In fact, in February alone, Amazon attracted 46% more unique visitors than eBay.A secondary pull from eBay's Marketplaces business is the growth of other sites offerings. Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) for instance has witnessed its Goods business go from 25% of revenue in 2012 to 57% of revenue in the company's most recent quarter. With more visitors going to Amazon, and much faster growth from Groupon, it's no surprise that eBay's Marketplaces business is showing slow growth.The star of the showJust as eBay's Marketplaces business is slowing, PayPal is reporting excellent growth by nearly every metric. Investors looking for fast revenue growth need look no further than the payments division of eBay. Overall revenue growth came in at 18%, which ironically matched Amazon's overall revenue growth.PayPal's net payment volume jumped by 24%, and the company's merchant services volume increased by an impressive 33%. The company's merchant volume is critical to the company's future, as this speaks to the company's ability to gain traction into the physical retail space.PayPal hopes to become as synonymous with payments as the biggest players in the industry Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA). Though PayPal has a long way to go to reach this goal, the company's growth is significantly faster than either of these payment giants. In addition, PayPal's ""Pay with PayPal"" option has strong traction on thousands of websites. In fact, as of last year PayPal was an option on more than 300,000 websites.When you add it all up, investors may be expecting too muchThe big question facing eBay investors today is, how much is the stock worth? One way to value any company is based on a multiple of its sales. Though there are likely hundreds of other ways to generate a value, this is a standard measure that many investors feel comfortable with.The first piece of eBay is the Marketplaces business, and given it's relatively slow revenue growth, two companies that come to mind as comparables are Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and The TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX). Both of these companies are established names in the retail trade, and growing revenue at about the same rate as the Marketplaces business. If investors want to assign a more aggressive growth rate to the Marketplaces business, looking Groupon's valuation might be instructive as well.Wal-Mart is valued at about 0.6 times last year's annual sales, and both TJX and Groupon ironically trade at about 1.6 times sales. Based on Marketplaces most recent quarter, the business has an annualized sales run rate of about $9.2 billion. Using these comparables, eBay's Marketplaces value would be somewhere between $5.5 billion and 14.7 billion.Trying to value PayPal is a little more difficult, but let's give the upstart the benefit of being valued similarly to Visa and MasterCard. MasterCard is valued at 11 times last year's sales, and Visa is fetches 13 times sales. Using these figures, PayPal's annualized $8.8 billion in sales would generate a value of $96.8 bil. to $114 billion.This sounds very good considering eBay's current market value is about $69 billion. There are just a few issues. First, it's highly unlikely investors will value PayPal at 11 to 13 times sales. Visa and MasterCard have a significant lead in transactions, size, and scope of their operations.If investors are more conservative and value PayPal at say five to six times sales, the PayPal unit would bring a value of $48.4 billion to $57 billion. With Marketplaces coming in maybe halfway between Wal-Mart, TJX, and Groupon's values, this would add another $10 billion to the total. If we add another $1 billion for the Enterprise division, and roughly $3.3 billion in cash and investments, the total comes in between $62.7 billion and $71 billion.Given these figures, and the fact that eBay's current market cap is about $69 billion, investors may be in for a rude awakening. At best, this imputes an increase in value of about 3%. PayPal may end up being valued more highly than my estimates. However, It seems clear, that eBay investors may be expecting too much from this transaction."
2973446,67313,2015-03-05T14:00:27-05:00,"PayPal's purchase of Paydiant is both a defensive move and an offensive maneuver against AAPL, GOOG and Samsung.Paydiant allows merchants to develop their own payment system and loyalty program without capitulating to another platform.I would be a buyer of PayPal post spinoff.","RE/code reported that PayPal from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is acquiring payment startup Paydiant for approximately $280m to beef up its mobile payment ecosystem with Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has been gradually rolling out its payment platform (now at 2% of the estimated 12m point of purchase in the US) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) recently unveiling its Samsung Pay at Barcelona in conjunction with the Samsung Galaxy S6 launch. It appears that the Paydiant acquisition is both a defensive and an offensive measure against bigger rivals. Under a defensive scheme, it is evident that the competitive pressure from the large tech names are heating up and that PayPal needs to penetrate further into the mobile payment space in order to remain relevant. More importantly, Paydiant allows PayPal to get on the offensive as it addresses the key issue that merchants have and that's the inevitable capitulation toward one of the payment platforms, be it AAPL, Samsung, or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Every merchant understands that mobile payment is the way of the future but their biggest concern is to be tied to a particular platform under which they may lose negotiation power and subject to unfair terms with the mobile payment provider. With Paydiant, PayPal could allow merchants to build their own payment system within their mobile app. Additionally, Paydiant also allows merchants to embed loyalty functions into their app that could potentially create a self functioning mobile payment platform similar to that of Starbucks' (NASDAQ:SBUX) loyalty program that already boasts a fan base of 13m, an impressive figure in my view. It's worth noting that Paydiant is already working with Current-C, a rival payment platform created by the retail consortium that includes Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), 7-Eleven and Target (NYSE:TGT). If Paydiant is able to get a reasonable amount of traction among the big retailers, I expect the network effect could spill over to other retailers as they look to stay independent with their mobile payment services and create a unique loyalty program for customers to differentiate from rivals.Alternatively, a wider adoption of Paydiant could hinder the growth of competing payment systems, preventing GOOG or AAPL to become the dominant mobile payment platform. Given that PayPal is the only growth segment in eBay, and I would be bullish on PayPal shares post spinoff and negative on AAPL. Unlike the introduction of the smartphone back in 2007 when AAPL truly reinvented mobile computing and communication, it appears that competitors in the field of mobile payment are starting off on equal footing, making AAPL no more competitive than PayPal, GOOG or Samsung."
2966106,64913,2015-03-02T18:13:53-05:00,"eBay's revenues indicate that it can survive without PayPal.With its current business model, the company will not experience significant revenue growth without PayPal.Revenue figures indicate that eBay's marketplace business has lost its momentum.Fulfillment by Amazon is a better online retail solution for third-party sellers than eBay's new Valet service.eBay is facing intense competition in the lucrative third-party sales sector from Amazon, Wal-Mart, Staples and other online retailers.","The simple question of whether eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) can survive without PayPal has been on my mind a lot lately, because I'm both an eBay investor and an eBay retailer. The question also is a very reasonable one if you take a look at eBay and PayPal revenues.eBay reported TTM revenue of $17.9 billion on December 31, 2014. That revenue has been growing steadily for some time - it was $16.05 billion in December 2013. The problem is that PayPal's revenue makes up around 44% of eBay's revenue. My calculation is that PayPal's revenue for 2014 was around $7.786 billion. Subtract PayPal from eBay, and the auction site's TTM revenue would have been $10.114 billion in 2014.Can eBay Grow Without PayPal?Judging by revenue alone, eBay could survive without PayPal, but would it actually grow without PayPal? PayPal reported that its TTM revenue grew at a rate of 18% between fourth-quarter 2013 and fourth-quarter 2014. During the same period, eBay's TTM revenue grew at a rate of 8.63%. The question we need to ask is, how much of that growth was driven by eBay's marketplace?eBay reported that its marketplace revenue grew by 1% between fourth-quarter 2013 and fourth-quarter 2014 in this PDF. Although, it did report that marketplace revenues grew by 8% between the third and fourth quarter of 2014. The problem with that growth is that a lot of it was probably driven by holiday shopping.It looks as if eBay's core marketplace or auction business has lost its momentum. The company's growth is being driven by PayPal, where business is booming. PayPal reported that the total volume of transactions it processed in fourth-quarter 2014 was $64.3 billion, an increase of 24% over the same period in 2013. PayPal's Merchant Services, which make up 76% of its business, grew by 33% in the same time frame.eBay Needs to Restructure Its Markets, and FastIt looks as if eBay will need to do a radical restructuring if it wants to compete with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has made an aggressive push into eBay's realm of third-party sales. Third-party sales accounted for 40% of the merchandise that Amazon moved in 2014, according to The Wall Street Journal. The amount of stuff sold through Amazon's shipping and storage service, Fulfillment by Amazon, grew by 65% in the same period.Amazon also reported that third-party merchants sold two billion items through its ecosystem in 2014. or double what they had sold in 2013. VentureBeat estimated the value of Amazon's third-party sales for 2013 at $17 billion. That means the value of Amazon's third-party sales could now be in excess of $30 billion.These programs are certainly paying off for Amazon - the ""Everything Store's"" revenues have been growing at a staggering rate. Amazon's revenue grew from $74.45 billion December 2013 to $88.98 billion in December 2014, indicating that the company has successfully captured growth from eBay.eBay is trying to counter this threat with its Valet service and Global Shipping Program. The problem is that eBay's solution is not as flexible as Amazon's - you cannot sell items that are worth less than $40 through the Valet service. There also is a long list of items that cannot sell through eBay's Valet service, which is why I personally do not use it.I do use Fulfillment by Amazon, because it makes my life and business a lot easier. The truth is that Fulfillment by Amazon is the better solution for online retailers.Threats to eBay's Business MultiplyingIt is not just Amazon.com that eBay has to worry about. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS), the third- and fourth-largest online retailers, have launched their own third-party marketplaces. Wal-Mart operates Wal-Mart Marketplace, and Staples has rolled out Staples Exchange.Wal-Mart Marketplace, in particular, could be a threat to Amazon.com and eBay because of the retail giant's recent investment in online infrastructure. Wal-Mart plans to invest between $2.2 and $2.5 billion in online retail over the next two years. That investment includes two massive online fulfillment centers, each of which will be over one million square feet in size.Also on the horizon is Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which has been investing heavily in U.S. companies, but not in U.S. infrastructure. However, my guess is that Alibaba will concentrate on China for now and ignore the U.S. market, because the cost of a major foray into U.S. online retail would be too steep.A standalone eBay will face a tough battle to maintain market share in the years ahead. It faces larger and well-financed competitors willing to spend large sums to ramp up their business. My prediction is that eBay will survive, but remain a niche player in online retail with a falling share of the market."
3187436,23471,2015-05-15T11:52:51-04:00,"EBAY is suitable for the Enterprising Investor following the ModernGraham approach.According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is overvalued at the present time.The market is implying 11.65% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, but in recent years, the company's earnings growth has not been that strong.","A lot of investors and analysts considering eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) are focused primarily on the upcoming PayPal spinoff. For example, Seeking Alpha contributor Daniel James recently considered the effects the spinoff may have on the core eBay business and Alex Cho argued that investors should consider owning both companies. However, it is critical when analyzing eBay to consider the company's intrinsic value in relation to its price.In fact, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether a company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here's a look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.Defensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 3/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey DataBalance Sheet - March 2015Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryeBay does not pay a dividend.ConclusioneBay passes the initial requirements of the Enterprising Investor but not of the more conservative Defensive Investor. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the low current ratio, the lack of dividends, and the high PEmg and PB ratios. The Enterprising Investor is only concerned by the lack of dividends. As a result, all value investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, the company has seen its EPSmg (normalized earnings) rise from $1.75 in 2011 to only an estimated $1.89 for 2015. This is a weak level of earnings growth, and does not support the market's implied estimate for 11.65% annual growth over the next 7-10 years.In fact, the recent earnings growth has averaged only 1.6% per year, so the market is expecting a very significant shift in earnings in order to justify the current price. The ModernGraham valuation model returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling below the market's price, indicating that the company is overvalued at the present time."
3099636,39301,2015-04-24T10:55:49-04:00,"eBay reported a fairly solid quarter in which both top line and bottom line beat expectations.The two business units carry inherent strengths and weaknesses, but my bias is that PayPal will benefit most from the spinoff.While the marketplace unit will have more cash post-spinoff, the business is stagnant, and will require significant investment to generate higher user monetization rates and foreign user acquisition.PayPal, on the other hand, has three compelling opportunities: loan origination, offline payments, and international cash transfer.PayPal's high-growth areas can be funded without sacrificing capital returns in the form of dividends and share buybacks.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is undervalued with reasonable prospects for growth and operating efficiency gains going forward. While I'm not a huge fan of the spinoff that will separate eBay from PayPal, I do think it's a necessary evil, especially for the market to effectually value the separate business units.For Q1 FY 2015, eBay reported EPS of $0.77, which beat analyst consensus estimates set at $0.70. This represents a beat of around 10%, which is why the stock shot-up in the after-hours. Revenue also surprised, as it grew 4.5% year over year, beating consensus estimates by $30 million.eBay offered revenue guidance of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion for Q2 FY 2015, which fell short of analyst consensus estimates at $4.76 billion. Also, the full-year revenue range ($18.35 billion-$18.85 billion) fell slightly below the estimates set by analysts at $18.95 billion. eBay may be low-balling its figures a little, so it can report quarterly beats throughout the current fiscal year.Where does eBay go now?Interestingly, the management team was extremely upbeat on the quarterly earnings conference call. This is somewhat surprising, when taking into consideration how stagnant eBay's stock price has been.However, I anticipate this to change, as PayPal's payment margins are starting to improve. Also growth in credit lending and payment transfer services puts legs underneath the growth trajectory. However, the marketplace has started to stagnate and even reported a year-over-year sales decline, which was attributable to foreign exchange. The marketplace segment has room to improve operationally, and that investment into foreign markets could drive growth in the marketplace business model. Also, higher utilization of the eBay marketplace platform in developed markets through higher user engagement is another pathway to growth.Here are some of the more promising comments made by the management team throughout the earnings conference call:I'm going to temper my optimism a little on the eBay marketplace, as the business hasn't reported stellar growth rates, and much of the earnings growth was driven by cost reductions. Unfortunately, account growth both domestically and internationally has slowed considerably, which is something eBay needs to address if it wants to appeal to growth-oriented investors.However, eBay will have more cash than PayPal following the spin-off. In this case, eBay has room to buy out other e-commerce platforms, return cash to shareholders in the form of buybacks, or invest more aggressively internationally. The marketplace can also expand its range of services to improve its average revenue per user figure.On the other hand, the payment service, while having less cash following the spinoff, has a demonstrable track record of growing its business at torrid rates. The business has further room to expand its credit lending business without requiring a universal bank's balance sheet. Based on the comments of PayPal's CEO, PayPal will originate loans, package them and sell them to third-party investors. Since PayPal has such a large global footprint with merchants and consumers, the company's credit originations could grow into a large business.Let's say for example PayPal earns 1% for originating the loan, and is able to mark-up the principal loan value by 4%, before selling the pooled loan portfolio to an investment fund, bank, or other trust holding entity. Against a loan balance of $100 billion, PayPal could pocket $5 billion in revenue. Since its lending activity is done via the Internet with limited overhead, the cost of managing a loan portfolio or originating loans drops significantly. So not only does PayPal add efficiency to the process, but also the market potential is large.Also, PayPal's total payment volume continues to grow at pretty high rates (24% year over year in the most recent quarter). The market potential for offline payments paired and international money transfer is extremely promising. I anticipate that lending, offline payments, and international money transfer to be the primary drivers of growth going forward.ConclusionWhile eBay reported a solid quarter, what stood out was the strategic nature in which eBay and PayPal will be able to create value following a spinoff of both entities. The flexibility will allow eBay to invest more aggressively into its marketplace while optimizing the business for higher rates of profitability, thus translating into higher dividend payouts and share buybacks.PayPal, while already a cash cow, can utilize the value of its cash better by owning debt instruments that it originates via its lending unit. The lending unit doesn't have a ceiling on the amount of loans it can issue because it can package and sell its loan portfolio to financial institutions. The market potential for consumer loans and small business loans, paired with the growth potential for offline payments and international money transfer, puts PayPal in an envious situation. I anticipate that PayPal will return a lot of capital via dividends and share buybacks while also sustaining a high rate of sales and earnings growth in the foreseeable future.Both businesses are great, but I have to favor PayPal, as I'm growth oriented. On the other hand, eBay is extremely predictable, and will likely generate reasonable returns for risk-averse shareholders looking for a predictable income stream."
2845746,25120,2015-01-24T16:25:26-05:00,"eBay's results were solid, as the outlook is weak driven by the headwinds resulting from dollar strength and weakness at the marketplace business.PayPal continues to perform well, as the company is cutting costs and aiming to sell the enterprise business unit.I like the orientation on shareholder value creation, although I am uncertain how much value can really be created for shareholders.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) came out with a whole lot of news when it reported its fourth quarter results, some points being negative, some clearly positive.The company appears to prepare itself for a full break-up although a slowdown at its marketplace activities and a strong dollar resulted in a disappointing outlook. Given the fairly full valuation already and many uncertainties, I am cautious at current levels. This is despite the fact that the company appears to dismantle itself this year in an effort to create shareholder value.Fourth Quarter HighlightseBay reported a 9% increase in fourth quarter sales which totaled $4.92 billion. This growth was mostly supported by the PayPal unit as will be elaborated on next, allowing the firm to beat the consensus estimates of $4.90 billion.Earnings showed a modest improvement as well. GAAP earnings were up 10% to $936 million as share repurchases allowed for a 15% jump in earnings per share to $0.75 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings improved by 10% to $0.90 per share, thereby beating consensus estimates by a penny.CEO John Donahoe was pleased with the performance over the past year in what has been a very eventful year. Of course, activist investor Carl Icahn has targeted the company last year, urging the company to split itself up. After a public fight with CEO John Danahoe, the company is on track to be split up in 2015.Arguably to please Icahn, Donahoe announced plans to cut some 2,400 jobs which represents about 7% of the total workforce.PayPal Remains The Primary Growth Driver..eBay's payment business showed the most rapid growth with sales being up 18% to $2.16 billion. Total volumes processed by the network rose even faster, as they were up by 24% to $64.30 billion.The ""take rate"" defined as the revenues as a percentage of enabled payment volume fell to 3.36%. This rate was down 9 basis points on a sequential basis, and down 17 basis points compared to last year. The number of accounts has been up by 13% to 161.5 million, implying that an average user used PayPal to make payments of $398 on average during the quarter.The overall solid place of growth continues to be driven by the emergence and continued growth in mobile payments... As The Marketplace Business StrugglesThe continued momentum at PayPal is welcomed as marketplace revenues were up by just 1% to $2.33 billion. Total merchandise volumes on the network were up by just 2% to $21.85 billion with both growth metrics declining rapidly compared to the full-year results.Buyers on average have become less active as well. While merchandise value was up just 2% on an annual basis, the number of active buyers has increased by 11% to 155.2 million users. The average buyer now does $141 of business on eBay's marketplace websites on average.Disappointing 2015 GuidanceeBay anticipates sales of $4.35 billion to $4.45 billion for the current first quarter on which it anticipates to report non-GAAP earnings of $0.68 to $0.71 per share. GAAP earnings are seen at just $0.37 to $0.43 per share. The large gap between both earnings metrics mainly results from $210-$240 million in restructuring expenses as well as amortization and stock-based compensation expenses.Sales for the upcoming year are seen at $18.6 billion to $19.1 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are seen at $3.05 to $3.15 per share, with GAAP earnings seen at $2.17 to $2.32 per share.The outlook is a bit disappointing. Analysts anticipated non-GAAP earnings of $0.76 per share for the first quarter. At the midpoint of the guidance, first quarter sales are seen up by little over 3% on an annual basis while full-year sales growth is seen at 5%.One should remember that eBay generates roughly 50% of its sales abroad which creates real currency headwinds at current times and into 2015.Strong Balance Sheet, Fair ValuationOn the balance sheet, eBay shows $15.9 billion in cash, equivalent and long-term investments while the company itself reports these balances to be $14.6 billion after excluding equity-based investments. Total debt of the business is seen at $7.6 billion, for a very comfortable net cash position of around $7.0 billion.These strong cash balances are preferred as eBay is essentially becoming a bank with the continued growth of PayPal. The company does take on risk while enabling these kinds of payments, taking loan loss and transaction expensive provisions of a billion each year.The 1.24 billion shares value equity in the business at $68 billion with shares trading at $55 per share. Excluding the net cash holdings, the business is valued at $61 billion. This values the business at 3.4 times sales reported at $17.9 billion.In terms of earnings, the picture is more complicated. eBay reported a $41 million net loss in 2014, driven by the $3.05 billion cash repatriation charge taken in the first quarter last year. Adjusting for this, non-GAAP earnings came in at $3.7 billion, or $2.95 per share.This includes about $700 million in stock-based compensation which of course is a real dilutive expense for shareholders. Adjusting for this compensation, I see earnings around $3 billion per year, valuing the entire business at 20 times earnings.Update With IcahneBay has reached a further standstill agreement with Carl Icahn who is the largest shareholder of the company. Backed by Icahn, Jonathan Christodoro will be added to the board of directors of eBay. Of course, Icahn has already been ""promised"" a split of the business. On top of that, eBay announced that its enterprise business, which is a partner for retailers in critical components of their e-commerce initiatives, is contemplating a sale, divestment or IPO of the unit.This enterprise unit reported 9% growth in its quarterly revenues to $443 million on the back of a similar growth rate reported in its merchandise sales numbers which came in at $1.93 billion. eBay has bought eBay Enterprise, at the time called GSI Commerce, just four years ago for a sum of $2.4 billion.Concluding RemarkseBay flooded the market with a range of announcements. For starters, the performance in the final quarter was solid, taking into account the impact of a strong dollar. Other positive points include the standstill with Icahn, progress on the split of the business, a strong performance of PayPal, the announced job cuts to save costs and the potential sale of the enterprise business.This was offset by a weaker outlook as well as disappointing performance of the marketplace business which really shows the impact of competition from the likes of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT).By now, the vast majority of eBay's value is tied and pegged to its PayPal unit and it is hard to figure out its true profit contribution. While the company has a great market positioning, revenues are aided greatly by the still fat ""take rates"" at over 3% of average transaction values. This means that even the core and most promising business undoubtedly will see many challenges ahead, even after it has been split off. I foresee quite some competition in this field in the coming years.Amidst these concerns and an already 20 times multiple, I am cautious, although the company is now in full preparation to unlock or try to create value for its shareholders, something which appears attractive."
2841276,25047,2015-01-23T12:26:56-05:00,"While there's a lot to criticize about Amazon.com, there's a specific segment where it keeps on beating eBay.And amazingly, this is a very profitable segment to boot.I list some of the reasons why Amazon.com is winning there, and explain what eBay could do to negate the advantage.","There's something that can't be denied regarding Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY): Regarding their 3P (third-party) marketplaces, Amazon is winning. And winning consistently. That is, Amazon has been able to grow faster than eBay in this segment for a long time.This is important, because the 3P marketplace is the most profitable of Amazon.com's segments, as well as eBay's most profitable segment, offering operating margins of around 50%. It's also no coincidence that Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is so profitable - it, too, is basically just a 3P marketplace. Amazon.com isn't profitable in overall terms, but that's not because of its 3P marketplace - it is in spite of it (on this theme, see Amazon Trades For 370 Years Of Earnings, Jack Ma Thinks It Might Not Be Here In 20).For an illustration of how Amazon has been beating eBay consistently in this particular segment, we can turn to ChannelAdvisor's (NYSE:ECOM) same-store sales reports. Here's a chart from the latest one:See how Amazon's SSS line (in red) is consistently above eBay's (in darker blue)? That's Amazon winning in 3P marketplaces. ChannelAdvisor's data is sampled precisely from 3P sellers.Why Does This Happen?I've written quite a few negative articles on Amazon.com. But that's not to say I don't recognize where the company beats others, or where it is profitable (3P marketplaces, mostly).So why does Amazon keep winning versus eBay in this particularly important segment? There are several structural reasons for that (some of which eBay might correct over time, if it acts on them). Here they go:eBay isn't losing everywhere. eBay has a significant advantage in small items shipped from China (check my article A Major Reason For Alibaba To Acquire eBay, Beyond The Obvious Ones). But this is obviously not enough to compensate for the Amazon advantages listed above.What Can eBay Do?eBay could turn around most of the disadvantages listed (except perhaps the massive shipping subsidization). It would need to make a steep change in its marketplace, though, replacing its offer-based paradigm with product page-based selling. This would eliminate most of the search congestion and make buying products and comparing suppliers a much more agreeable experience.Many of its sellers are already used to selling on Amazon and eBay simultaneously, so it wouldn't be hard for them to adapt. And for customers I think most would welcome the change immediately.So this would be a radical change for eBay, but one that seems possible to implement without breaking its business model. Perhaps eBay is afraid of such a radical change, though. However, if eBay wants to regain competitiveness versus Amazon in its most important and profitable segment, there's no other way around it.ConclusionAmazon does a lot of things wrong and is presently an ugly business, but it has one segment where it has been beating eBay consistently. And amazingly, that's also its most profitable segment to boot.I find that Amazon has structural advantages in this segment at this point, tied to customer satisfaction while shopping at Amazon.com versus eBay. These advantages are not insurmountable, but they do require action by eBay to eliminate them.It stands to be seen whether eBay will ever take the plunge and make the necessary changes. If it doesn't, then I believe Amazon will keep on winning against eBay in this particular segment."
2844836,67313,2015-01-24T11:58:42-05:00,"EBAY's EPS missed on marketplace weakness and 2015 guidance suggest further decline in the marketplace business.M&A sentiment will likely drive the stock in the near-term - and I'm switching my view to buy from sell mainly based on a sentiment trade.Fundamentally speaking, my preference within the ecommerce place remains BABA.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported 4Q14 revenue of $4.92b, +8.6% y/y, which was largely in-line with consensus estimates while EPS of $0.90 was a penny ahead. For 2015, eBay expects revenue of $18.6b-$19.1b and EPS of $3.05-3.15, both of which are below consensus of $20b and $3.26. Worth noting is that first half guidance suggests further deterioration of fundamentals, which means that management expects a v-shape recovery in the second half, a rather bullish outlook in my view.ImplicationsMarketplace in trouble, PayPal the only growth engine. As expected, marketplace continues its downward trajectory and the current state is eroding faster than expected with +1% growth, the slowest in six years. Management expects growth to deteriorate further, or even in a decline before recovering in 2H15 but I am not too optimistic given the SEO changes and the competitive pressure from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have been creating an ecommerce ecosystem to full entrench themselves into people's lives and mobile devices. eBay is falling behind on this area and with the marketplace becoming a standalone later this year, more questions than answers will surround its viability heading into 2016. Alternatively, PayPal remains the star within this business but my concern lies in that growth was driven by Braintree that is of lower margin and is facing increasing competition from Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, at a 36% growth profile, this segment remains the only viable segment within eBay.Dare to fight the tide? Despite the weak fundamentals behind marketplace after the PayPal spinoff, I expect the stock to receive some support from the investment community as M&A would likely be the key theme driving the stock. Two potential scenarios are in play: the first is that eBay pursues acquisitions of smaller vertical ecommerce sites to diversify away from its image of an online auction house/second-hand item site and broaden its reach and product offerings to compete against AMZN; the second scenario is being acquired by Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and this is a scenario which I have highlighted before. Given eBay's current merchant relationship a web property could be attractive to BABA that is looking to penetrate the US market. By acquiring eBay, BABA immediately gains a foothold and the infrastructure to take shares away from AMZN. Regardless of the outcome, I expect the stock to find support in that it will be driven by M&A rather than fundamentals. Indeed, the stock's +7% post earnings reflects this sentiment.ConclusionI am changing my view on eBay from short to long mainly based on the sentiment that will likely drive the stock up higher. Note that from a fundamental perspective, I continue to view BABA favorably while I remain neutral on Amazon due to increased spending."
2949906,63353,2015-02-25T14:11:22-05:00,Many online retail companies including Amazon and eBay are investing heavily to expand their operations in fast growing retail markets like India.The harsh reality is that out of all the companies competing only one or two are likely to establish their presence in a meaningful way.Challenges for online retail companies in India.Is there any merit in investing in these companies at current valuations?,"Stocks of online retail companies have been touching all-time highs and the industry continues to be among the highest recipient of private equity funding. This outperformance is despite the recent below average financial performance of the world's biggest online retail companies.Increasing internet penetration coupled with the promise of unlimited growth opportunities in newer markets are primarily responsible for the recent rally in online retail sector stocks.Future Growth MarketsFor the year 2014, global ecommerce sales stood at U.S. $ 1.31 trillion which is likely to increase to U.S. $2.49 trillion by 2018. For companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), India remains the most attractive market outside of the United States. The ecommerce sector in India has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 34% since 2009 to reach U.S. $16.4 billion in 2014 and is expected to reach U.S. $22 billion by the end of 2015.The online retail segment which is a part of the ecommerce industry accounts for less than 1% of the total retail market in India and is estimated to reach U.S. $6 billion by the end of 2015. In India, Books, apparel, accessories and electronics are the largest selling products through online platforms and constitute around 80% of product distribution.Existing Competition and Promotional SpendingAmazon and eBay are likely to find it extremely difficult to match existing online retailers operating in India. The main players in the online retail segment in India are Flipkart, Snapdeal, Myntra and Jabong. All these players have established logistics and a loyal customer base.For the year 2014, Amazon India had an advertising budget of up to U.S. $32.16 million, of which ~ 45% was pegged for spending on digital, followed by TV (40 %), print (10 %), radio and outdoor (5 %). Similarly, Flipkart and Snapdeal had an estimated advertising and promotion budget of U.S. $19.30 million and U.S. $20.91 million, respectively.Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) has been trying to enter the Indian retail market for some time now. In November last year, just after Alibaba's listing on the NYSE, company founder Jack Ma was in India to discuss a potential investment in Snapdeal. While nothing further has been reported on this potential alliance, Snapdeal has started working on a high-end technology platform even as it continues to bleed cash.More recently, Alibaba made a U.S. $575 million investment to acquire a 25% stake in Paytm, India's largest mobile payment and ecommerce platform. Given the kind of resources which Alibaba has for acquisitions and expansion, its entry in India would intensify competition in a big way. That will put even more pressure on the margins of online retail companies operating in India.ChallengesMedium term viewI believe that stock prices/valuations of all these companies have already factored in that they will succeed at expanding in new found markets like India. However, not all companies will succeed. This will get reflected in stock prices over the next 12-24 months. I do not expect any more upside for either of the companies mentioned above. I would avoid buying anything in the e-commerce space at current valuations."
2923316,70385,2015-02-17T14:17:55-05:00,"eBay intends to spin-off PayPal later in 2015, but it may also separate its eBay Enterprise business as well.Current shareholders who get a proportion share of each business after separation could benefit on the PayPal side by a higher price multiple.Usually, the spin-off company performs better than the original company in the short-term.eBay shareholders could have a share price advantage going into a proposed PayPal IPO.","eBay Inc (eBay) is preparing for a radical restructuring of its business. A split-up of PayPal from eBay and a potential spin-off/sale of its eBay Enterprise - all possibly to happen in 2015.With that much change coming down the pipe, is it a good time to pick up or own eBay stock? Before the split-up, it would be good to see where eBay is in its current form.FundamentalsFourth quarter revenue was up 9% to $4.92 billion, capping off full year revenue growth of about 12% to $17.9 billion. That full year growth rate is still below the 10-year compound annual growth rate of 18.5% and even the 5-year median growth rate of 14%.Full year GAAP earnings were marred by the $2.3 billion net loss in the first quarter due to a tax charge on foreign earnings. Non-GAAP adjusted net income was up about 5% to $3.72 billion vs. $3.56 billion in fiscal 2013.Over the 10 years preceding fiscal 2014, full year GAAP earnings per share grew at an average annual 16%. Over the preceding five-year period which includes the GFC, the compound growth rate slowed to a little under 5%.Looking at stock price multiples, eBay trades at 21 times forward fiscal 2015 earnings estimates. The forecast 12-month forward PEG ratio stands at around 1.6, so it's not overly priced, yet isn't a big bargain.Earnings growth is forecast only for an unexciting 6.9% by analysts in FY2015, with FY2016 earnings forecast to reach around 11.5%. Both are below the 10-year compound growth rate mentioned above.FinancialseBay's net income margins are regularly in the high teens, showing relatively strong earning power. Based on fiscal 2014 full year adjusted earnings of $3.73 billion, net income margin came to 20.8%, in line with eBay's past trend.Looking further at key business performance, return on equity over the second to fourth quarters was between 13% - 18%. That compares well with the long-term average. However, over the past 4 - 5 years ROE has been trending down to low teens. Shareholder equity has been steadily increasing over the years, but earnings growth hasn't kept up. Financial performance is showing some deterioration.This goes as well for return on assets. What was once regularly in the low teens has now trailed lower to mid to high single digits. eBay's return on investment did stay stable through recent years, standing at 16% in fiscal 2013 and even reaching 21.8% in fourth quarter 2014. It shows better management skill in putting specific investments to work well. There is at least one good tick here.TechnicalseBay's share price has been a trading range since early 2013, range bound to about $60 at the top, similar to its December 2004 high. The slowdown in earnings growth and declining performance ratios like ROE in the recent past has made the investors wary of future growth. The low 5% non-GAAP net income growth for full year 2014 further keeps a cap on share price appreciation and investor sentiment.eBay 5-year stock chartSource: Google FinanceIf the stock were to break down below $50 strongly, it might fall to as low as $40 before hitting any substantial support. That said, with the upcoming announced split up of the eBay and PayPal business, price weakness is not so much in my mind before the break-up.It is possible that eBay's separately listed stock could get re-rated to a lower share price after the proposed split, based on continuing business earning power. Yet eBay shareholders before the break-up will get shares in both companies. Other technical price support could come from a potential takeover of PayPal once it is separated. Investors may want to stick around to see how this all plays out. There is even the proposed spin-off or sale of eBay's enterprise business which could open up more potential shareholder value.Extra value from a PayPal spin-off and IPOBusinesses and industries go thorough different phases of consolidation and separation over the decades. What made business sense for putting two companies together at one point of time loses the advantages and synergies under different business conditions and environments.Although eBay's management strongly resisted the proposed split-up of the company as advocated by investor activist Carl Icahn last year, now the logic of the idea has been accepted.eBay was beginning to slip in performance as it was, but now there are new market entrants like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay and other mobile payment systems [Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) ""buy"" button, for example] are about to transform the market starting in 2015. If a break-up can unlock the separate earnings capabilities of the two businesses, shareholders stand to gain.That is why I would say it is a time to hold onto the eBay shares you may have now and even add to your stake if you understand the company's prospects well.For new investors, starting a position before the proposed split has definite advantages as well. When the split-up between eBay and PayPal occurs, shareholders will get a proportional amount of shares in each business.It's quite possible that PayPal, the more popular and profitable of the two, could rise in share price by a higher multiple. Usually after a spin-off, the spun-off company sees better share price appreciation than the original company in the short-term. Also, the former company usually sets up the spin-off well financially so that it has a smooth and successful transition on its own.Earlier this month, eBay CFO Bob Swan said PayPal would need funds when it spins off. One article suggested the sum might be as much as $5 billion, so PayPal could be well capitalized upon separation.Holding eBay shares before the split-up and proposed PayPal IPO may give investors a way to start out at a lower share price and achieve a higher return on any post-IPO gain the new PayPal stock achieves."
2851726,20521,2015-01-26T20:13:19-05:00,,"According to a recent comScore report, the total online retail spending for the November–December period in 2014 was estimated to grow 16% to $61 billion. The researcher expected sales through mobile devices to see higher growth rates. Desktop generated e-tail sales were projected to grow 14% to $53.2 billion, and mobile commerce was expected to grow 25% to $7.9 billion. According to the ChannelAdvisor Same Store Sales (SSS) report, during the November-December period, holiday sales did report the expected 16% growth.eBay's FinancialseBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) fourth-quarter revenues grew 9% over the year to $4.92 billion, marginally shy of the market's projections of $4.93 billion. EPS of $0.90 was ahead of the Street's estimated $0.89 for the quarter.Revenue growth was driven by PayPal, which saw revenues grow 24% to $2.2. billion. During the quarter, PayPal added 4.6 million new active registered accounts, taking the total to 162 million. eBay Marketplaces' gross merchandise volume improved 2% overall. Revenues from the segment improved to $2.3 billion, as the company added 2.9 million new buyers to reach 155 million. The eBay Enterprise segment saw gross merchandise sales improve 9% to $443 million.For the current quarter, eBay projected revenues of $4.35 billion-$4.45 billion, with an EPS of $0.68-$0.71. The market had forecast revenues of $4.7 billion, with an EPS of $0.76 for the quarter. eBay expects to end the year with revenues of $18.6 billion-$19.1 billion, with an EPS of $3.05-$3.15. The market was looking for the year's revenues at $19.98 billion and EPS of $3.26.eBay’s WorriesDuring the quarter, eBay also announced plans to lay off 2,400 employees - nearly 7% of its headcount - to manage costs better. The move may have been triggered by the lackluster holiday sales for eBay. The ChannelAdvisor Same Store Sales report saw Amazon's sales grow 27% during the November-December period, compared with eBay's modest 7% growth.The company attributed some of the loss of this volume to traffic being impacted by decline in new users due to SEO changes, and the trouble that occasional buyers faced when returning to the site because the site wanted the password reset when they logged in.Last year, eBay had announced the spin-off of PayPal, and the company is now evaluating strategic options for exiting its Enterprise segment. It has not narrowed down on an option, but initial discussions suggest that it may either sell it or go for an IPO for eBay Enterprise. eBay Enterprise helps retailers manage their e-commerce offerings. It offers its retail customers services such as access to a scalable e-commerce platform, along with options of order fulfillment, freight, customer service and digital marketing capabilities. The Enterprise segment includes customer names such as Aeropostale, Timberland, Toys ""R"" Us, ESPN, Sony and Godiva, to name a few. During the last quarter, the GMV of goods sold through eBay enterprise grew to $1.9 billion. eBay has realized that while the business has potential, it has limited synergies with eBay's business, and a separation of the entity will allow the split organizations to focus on their core markets.Meanwhile, the PayPal spin-off is expected to be complete by this year, when both companies will become publicly traded companies.eBay's stock is trading at $56.01, with a market capitalization of $68.89 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $59.70 in February last year."
2847296,75075,2015-01-26T03:59:35-05:00,"While revenue continues to increase nicely, growth is estimated to slow next year.Margins remain under pressure, but backing out provisions for loan losses, cash flows are rising quickly.By laying off 7% of its workforce, eBay should see substantial savings.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported earnings Wednesday, and gave investors a clue to how it has been managing since the Google SEO change and hacking scandal that plagued it in the Spring of last year.Overall, it wasn't a spectacular report, but it wasn't that disheartening either. Revenue continued its steady march upwards, growing 12% yoy to almost $18B. Operating margins, however, remained under pressure, falling from 21% to 19.6%. The full income statement from these results is posted below for reference:In my last article on eBay, I suggested that over the next year, operating margins should slowly rebound as management trims spending dedicated to combating the effects of the SEO and hacking incidents of the past year. While there hasn't been enough time to judge whether or not this will be the case, the continued margin pressure this quarter seems to suggest it's safe to say management's elevated spending continues. However, there was a new development that I think should prove favorable for eBay's financial results over the next year - a 7% reduction in their workforce. Over the past few months rumors about this large layoff have been swirling, so this announcement simply seals the deal. While no one likes to cheer a mass layoff, as an investor of the company I think this is a good move. eBay's PayPal spin-off will undoubtedly require a restructuring of the labor force anyway, so this is just getting an early start to it. While it's hard to precisely quantify how large an impact these layoffs will have, I think there is enough information in eBay's filings to come up with a reasonable guess.According to eBay's 10Ks, their main costs (which can be seen in the exhibit above) are the following: General and Administrative (G&A), Product development, and Sales and Marketing. Below are the first sentences from each description,Right off the bat we can see that employee compensation comprises a part of each expense category. I wasn't able to find the exact percentages of employee compensation to total costs for these sections, so at first I was tempted to use the ""first ingredient approach"" (that is, the first ingredient on a nutrition label is the highest weight of that product). To err on the side of conservatism though, I assumed employee costs were only about 60% of the total costs (50% seemed to low, 80% seemed too high, so I went with a number towards the lower end of the middle).This past year eBay incurred about $7.43B in Sales, Product Development, and G&A. If we assume that only 60% of these costs are dedicated to employee compensation and that eBay will shave 7% of that expense, then next year eBay should save about $312m in employee costs ($7.43B x .6 x .07). Thus, even assuming no revenue growth, the company's net income should be at least $202m higher next year (312m x [1 - 35]% for taxes). To get an idea of what their income statement might look like, I took each of their major line items as a % of revenue from 2014 and applied this to next year's projected results (using the midpoint of management's revenue guidance).To account for the reduction in work force, I assumed that had eBay not laid anyone off their costs as a percentage of revenue would have remained in line with last year's. In other words, sales & marketing would have stayed at 20% of revenues. I then figured it would be reduced by 7% x 60% = 4.2%. For taxes I assumed a rate of 30%, and I explained some of my reasoning in my last article. While the company has been paying 18% by keeping cash overseas, it has recently begun repatriating billions back to the U.S. so 18% really isn't an accurate number to use. However, it still retains some benefit through research tax credits and by reinvesting some money abroad so I think 30% (vs. the 35% statutory rate) is more appropriate.If we then add back the provision for loan losses of roughly $1B (depreciation and capex basically net out), we get free cash flow of almost $4B, which is similar to the estimate I posted in my first article on eBay. Management adds back stock-based compensation to their FCF number, which is how they arrive at $4.4B this year (an 18% increase yoy), but since they buy back stock to offset this dilution it really isn't free cash. In any case, even without additional spending cuts on product development, marketing and other segments that management is targeting, eBay should still be able to generate record cash flow next year. In addition, all of this is assuming management's revenue guidance is correct and they only grow 5% next year, which in my mind is extremely conservative. Throw in the extra $2-3B in cash eBay is likely to add to the balance sheet (unless they buy back more shares), and you would have a company doing about $4B in FCF with roughly $8-9B in net cash (including taxes paid on overseas cash), selling for a $70B market cap currently. That works out to around a 15x EV/FCF multiple, which in my mind is too cheap for a company with the cash-generating abilities of eBay. Given the tough environment eBay finds itself in, it might be appropriate to reduce my estimated multiple to 18 vs. 20. Either way, that still represents a pretty safe 20% over the next year, with the possibility of additional upside due to the spin-off and conservative guidance.ConclusionWhile eBay's performance this past year was far from exceptional, it wasn't as terrible as some expected considering the headwinds of the SEO issue and hacking incident they faced. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the spin-off, management is guiding very conservatively, and I think their revenue estimates will prove low. In addition, with the estimated 7% cut in their workforce and other spending cuts eBay continues to make, they should easily be able to grow cash flow next year and will be on pace to have almost $10B in cash on the balance sheet. Overall, there exists attractive risk-adjusted upside of 20% or more from today's price, despite eBay having risen over 15% over the past few months. I recommend investors buy and hold eBay into the spin-off to realize these gains."
2844256,80996,2015-01-23T09:09:42-05:00,Investors have the chance of a lifetime to buy a quality business at a fair price.Investors can create a standalone PayPal at a cheap valuation.Price target: $75.00.,"What's the investment thesis?The investment thesis for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is very straightforward. At ~$54 per share, the PayPal spinoff will be created at a P/E multiple of 12x and an EV/EBITDA of 8x, while the investor gets legacy EBAY at a 6x EV/EBITDA multiple and a P/E of 11x.In our assumption, we assume that EBAY grows its FCF at approximately 15% per annum. EBAY has historically grown its FCF at approximately 25% CAGR over the last 5 years. We assumed mid to high single digit revenue growth, which is primarily fueled thanks to PayPal's competitive positioning.Along with this cheap valuation, super investors such as Jana, Icahn, and Loeb have all invested in EBAY. To take an excerpt from what Dan Loeb said in his third quarter letter about EBAY:Business Outlook:eBay:We think EBAY's core business is dull, it has seen lackluster growth over the last 7 years and that's either due to poor execution, or Amazon's reckless pricing that leads to zero profits. Regardless, eBay is entering a new chapter, and it needs to do everything it can to reinvigorate the business and ensure its future through capex investments.eBay as a standalone is just a maturing cash cow business. It derives 50% of its revenue from abroad, and in most of its markets, it has a saturated user base. eBay will likely see slower growth going forward. We project a 5-7% CAGR.PayPal:PayPal is the crown jewel of eBay; nuclear bombs and destructive landmines protect its castle moat. There's no competitor that's even remotely close to PayPal when it comes to online transaction volume.The investment community has PayPal's business confused with what Apple Pay is capable of. PayPal provides a secure infrastructure for vendors and consumers to transact with each other and reduces the chances of fraud. PayPal then charges an intermediary fee. It has been PayPal's goal to get into the POS transaction space, but it never had any traction.As Dan Loeb said in his Q3 letter, Apple Pay will compete with approximately 2-3% of PayPal's total volume transactions, which really is insignificant from a risk standpoint.PayPal's competitive advantage lies in its ability to scale with minimal capex and its brand. PayPal can expand internationally to various countries at a mere cost of building a secure database plant. We think that with more worldwide recognition, PayPal will expand rapidly across the globe to reach a scale that can compete with the likes of Visa and MasterCard more competitively. As of right now, Visa and MasterCard still dominate the intermediary transaction space, but with recent credit card frauds, a second intermediary is needed to ensure security. That's where PayPal comes into play.How will this investment play out?EBAY will rerate when the spinoff is just on the horizon, which is projected to be in the third quarter of 2015.Strategies:Shorting puts up to the spinoff date.Form 10 will serve as a catalyst. Sell-side analysts have no idea what PayPal's financials look like as a standalone. Call buying would be risky as the investor stands the risk of losing time premium.EBAY could trade sideways up until the spinoff, so the safest strategy is to take half the position in the stock and participate in the upside, while simultaneously short puts.Intrinsic Value:EBAY could compound at a 25% CAGR over the next 5 years. A more immediate PT would be $75 per share.A $75 PT would imply an 18x P/E for PayPal and an 11x P/E for eBay. This is reasonable to assume, but a fairer estimate suggest a PT of $85 per share.eBay is a steady cash flow business with very minimal capex. A private equity group could easily LBO eBay at a 15-17x P/E valuation.PayPal grew its revenue at 20% last quarter. To put this growth in perspective, MasterCard and Visa grew revenue at 10% and 12% respectively. While the two giants have better profitability metrics, we think that PayPal is just beginning its growth potentials. As more and more consumers shift online, online retailers want to ensure the safety of the consumers' info. If the online retailer chooses to input a security database of its own, it would be too costly. On the other hand, if the retailer chooses PayPal, everything on the backend would be handled.PayPal should be valued at 25x P/E.Risks:We don't think there's much risk in this investment. eBay is a steady cash flow business, and the LBO valuation for the legacy business would imply a $48 share price. This does not include PayPal or StubHub.There is always the risk of competition. Both PayPal and eBay aren't immune to competition, but that also doesn't mean the moat could be breached.We strongly believe eBay and PayPal have an impenetrable mindshare with consumers, and this should allow them to continue business as usual, given the time horizon of this investment."
2838996,24663,2015-01-21T22:26:33-05:00,"EBAY will soon be divesting PayPal, and there are a lot of questions investors should ask before owning the stock long-term.These include how EBAY will return capital to shareholders, how free cash flow will perform and whether PayPal can perform well despite Apple Pay's presence.Depending on the answer, eBay might just be a good investment.","There were a lot of questions I wanted eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) to answer in its fourth-quarter and full-year report. Those questions most certainly centered around PayPal's performance against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay in a full quarter, free cash flow growth and buyback allowances for the coming year. With these questions answered in dramatic form, eBay might actually be a stock to own long-term.How would PayPal perform?Regardless of whether you plan to invest in eBay's Marketplace, PayPal or neither for that matter, following the split, the performance of PayPal in Q4 and early 2015 will be imperative to its implied valuation. During the fourth quarter, PayPal had just about a full quarter going head-to-head against Apple Pay and its 1,000s of participating merchants, and PayPal delivered with a 24% increase in total payment volume (TPV).Further, with PayPal having 162 million global users who generated 3.6 billion transactions in 2014, it is quickly proving it is not a service that will be destroyed just because of a new competitor. This is an asset whose 25% transaction growth in the fourth quarter showed it's still growing fast, and that many merchants and consumers are deeply connected to the service as a part of everyday life. In essence, I was a bit concerned that transaction and TPV growth could slow significantly in Q4 because of Apple, perhaps barely double-digit growth. However, PayPal delivered, and that's something investors should be happy to see.What about free cash flow?eBay is not a company that's going to grow revenue over 20% year-over-year anymore. But unlike Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), it continues to grow at a rate that exceeds overall retail growth, while producing impressive free cash flow in the process.During 2014, eBay's free cash flow totaled $4.4 billion, an increase of 18% year-over-year. At just 15 times its trailing 12-month FCF, I'd take eBay's valuation and bottom line growth over Amazon's sub-20% top line growth any day of the week. Because ultimately, profits equal longevity and fuel future investments.Buybacks remain robustEarlier this month, eBay authorized a $2 billion buyback program, which was much smaller than the $5 billion it authorized last January. One big question was how much of that 2014 buyback allowance would be left for 2015, and whether management would buy back stock just as aggressively with a near-term spin-off of PayPal.eBay answered that question: Buying back $1.2 billion of stock in the fourth quarter, and having a remaining amount of $3 billion for buybacks moving forward. Further, one thing I really like about eBay as it prepares for an enormous spin-off of PayPal is that investors know exactly how the company will spend its money and return capital to shareholders - via buybacks.Up until this point, buybacks have been highly effective for eBay, creating a 4% differential in the stock and the company's market capitalization performance over the last year. With eBay about to divest a large chunk of its holdings in PayPal, investors can feel confident that it will use much of those proceeds for buybacks, which is certain to create shareholder value.ConclusionLast but not least, what I like about eBay's Marketplace business is that it carries particularly high margins. Back in 2013, the business had an operating margin over 40%. Therefore, with $8.8 billion in net revenue from Marketplace, it is very possible that eBay earned $3 billion of its $3.5 billion in operating income from Marketplace during 2014. This, of course, is unknown until the company's annual report, and is based on the discounting that's occurred in the PayPal business over the last year.Still, with a market capitalization of $66.5 billion, eBay trades at less than 25 times Marketplace's 2014 operating income. For me, that's a bit pricey, and is why the answers to the three noted questions above were so important. I wanted to see that PayPal was still growing fast, and that it would command a premium valuation from the market, thereby earning eBay a pretty penny with the divestment.I also wanted to see strong free cash flow growth because it signals to me that eBay's most profitable business, Marketplace, still has pricing power. Lastly, I wanted to see strong buyback activity, as it indicates what management sees as the best way to return capital, mainly from the PayPal divestment. When all these things are put together, 25 times Marketplace's 2014 operating income isn't too bad, especially given the fact that eBay will significantly reduce its shares with buybacks from the PayPal divestment. The bottom line: EBAY looks good for the long haul."
2840216,22775,2015-01-22T08:49:49-05:00,"New restructuring measures and $2bn buyback program grabbed the headlines yesterday.But fundamentals are worrying: Marketplaces grew only 1% in Q4 while PayPal’s main metrics deteriorated.This report confirms our view that PayPal’s volume growth, take rates and margins are at risk.We would continue to avoid the stock but would refrain from recommending a Short position due to eBay’s speculative appeal.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported Q4 results that were roughly in line with expectations but delivered a light 2015 guidance (revenue of $18.6-$19.1bn and EPS of $3.05-3.15, below a consensus of $19.97bn and $3.26). While restructuring measures (7% workforce reduction, sale or IPO of the Enterprise business) and a new $2bn buyback program grabbed the headlines yesterday, we would focus our attention on the weakness of Marketplaces (only 1% revenue growth in Q4 vs. +6% in Q3 and +9% in Q2) and on PayPal's deteriorating trends. Revenue growth and payment volume growth at PayPal slowed to 18% and 24% respectively in Q4 from 20% and 29% in Q3 while the take rate fell 30bps year-on-year (notably due to the rising weight of its mobile platform Braintree in the mix).Since our July article, we have been cautious on eBay's most valuable asset, PayPal, and this Q4 report clearly confirms our thoughts (even if part of the slowdown at PayPal can be attributed to the transaction weakness on the eBay website). We consider that PayPal's volume growth, take rates and margins are at risk due to rising competition as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay seems to be off to a strong start and as other initiatives from tech giants in the online and mobile payments space are likely to materialize soon. Notably, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been working on their own payment initiatives while Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is reportedly in talks to acquire mobile-payments company Softcard in order to give a boost to its own offering, Google Wallet.In conclusion, even if the new restructuring measures and stock buyback program are a strong positive, they will only help mitigate the pressure on earnings growth stemming from rising competition in Payments and declining momentum in e-commerce. Given these worrying fundamentals, we would remain on the sidelines on eBay. Note that we refrain from recommending a Short position on the stock as speculation is likely to surface about eBay's two main assets ahead of the split. Marketplaces could attract the attention of a large e-commerce peer such as Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) while PayPal could be a great addition for a tech giant such as Google or Facebook."
2889666,81756,2015-02-05T15:34:48-05:00,"eBay’s stock offers exposure, at a reasonable price, to two unique, capital-light businesses that are the most dominant in their spaces globally, ex-China. I believe eBay is worth $64/share.Amazon's seller platform, although half the size of eBay, poses a major threat, as it is growing 27% faster and has access to Amazon's customer base, which is 74% larger.Guidance for 2015 is very negative, and implies an abrupt slowdown for both eBay and PayPal.Supportive industry trends, strong user growth, more favorable FX-neutral growth, and a more focused strategy going forward indicate that guidance is too pessimistic to be sustained in the long term.eBay's low EV/EBIT compared to its peers, along with PayPal's spin-off in the second half of this year, point to an asymmetric payoff in investors' favor.","I became interested in eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) late last year after reading Joel Greenblatt's ""You Can be a Stock Market Genius,"" which is an excellent book about special situation investing. In his book, Greenblatt provides examples of how he obtained market-trouncing returns by investing in spin-offs. I wanted in, so I ran a screen looking for such opportunities and eBay popped up.After doing some initial research and noticing that eBay was one of Seth Klarman's top holdings, I found it worthwhile to dig deeper. eBay is comprised of 3 businesses: Marketplaces (47% of 2014 revenues), which allows individuals and businesses to sell products to customers through online platforms; PayPal (44% of 2014 revenues), which allows individuals and businesses to send money to each other digitally; and Enterprise (9% of 2014 revenues), which provides marketing, order fulfillment and e-commerce services to retailers. Pressure by activist investor Carl Icahn has led eBay's management to spin-off PayPal to shareholders in the second half of this year.The table below shows some of eBay's key figures, which will be elaborated upon throughout this report.I bought eBay shares in October to get exposure, at a reasonable price, to two hard to replicate, capital light businesses, which, despite slowing growth, are still dominant in their spaces. PayPal's spin-off sweetened the deal immensely as it should bring about an increase in management focus and a higher likelihood of a buyout offer.eBay's Advantage: Merchants and Avid ShopperseBay is the largest marketplace for merchants in the world outside of China and it is this scale that gives it a competitive advantage. As eBay's merchants hold inventory, rather than eBay itself, the company does not have to limit SKUs and can list more items (~800M listings) than most retailers. Its scale allows it to attract purchasers (155M buyers), which in turn attracts more merchants, which attracts more purchasers and so on. For a competitor to overtake eBay, it would have to steal its merchant base, a difficult task which is only possible if it has more purchasers in the regions that eBay operates in. Currently, with 74% more active buyers, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one such competitor.Amazon threatens eBay with an electronics and general merchandise GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume, which is the value of items sold though the company's platforms) of ~$104B in 2014 when both independent sellers and Amazon's own inventory sales are included (Amazon's GMV was estimated by dividing its electronic and general merchandise sales by the % of its unit sales that came from its own inventory). Although this is not an apples to apples comparison as Amazon primarily sells its own inventory, Amazon's greater overall scale does give its own independent seller business (~$44B GMV) an advantage over eBay's larger marketplace ($83B) in attracting purchasers for its merchants, and this is reflected in the strong 36% 2014 GMV growth of Amazon's marketplace versus the 8.5% GMV growth of eBay.Another competitor that cannot be ignored is the powerhouse from the east, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which had a 2014 GMV of ~$400B (Alibaba's GMV was estimated by applying Alibaba's Chinese take rates to its international revenue, then adding that figure to its Chinese GMV). But, Alibaba's ex-china business generates only ~$38B of GMV and although it has grown by 37% in 2014, this fast growth was partially due to a one-time bump as 2014 was the first year it was included in Alibaba's Singles Day promotion. Digging deeper, we also see that about 73% of Alibaba's international GMV is from wholesale purchases (via Alibaba.com) and the rest is from international buyers making retail purchases from Chinese merchants (via Aliexpress). Both of these models differ from eBay, which focuses on facilitating small purchases where the buyer and seller are in the same locality.This means that Alibaba may have difficulty in taking on eBay in the short term because of the following: a) most of Alibaba's international purchasers are of the wholesale type, which is very different than eBay's retail customer base; b) Alibaba's international retail business, Aliexpress, only allows merchants from China, so eBay's merchants cannot transfer; c) even if Aliexpress didn't have this restriction, eBay's GMV is 8 times larger, which allows eBay to give merchants a more active marketplace to participate in; and d) because Aliexpress has only Chinese merchants, eBay can offer shorter shipping times making it more attractive to customers. For now, it seems like the beast from the east is at bay.Overall, Amazon's fast growth poses an immediate threat and Alibaba's emergence, although not a short term threat, could intensify competition in the long term. eBay is aware of these threats and management's strategy to maintain its competitive advantage involves focusing on its core customer base and attracting more search engine traffic.During eBay's Q4 2014 conference call eBay's CEO, John Donahoe, categorized Marketplaces' customers into two types: 1) the ""convenience"" shopper, who is looking for something specific and wants it immediately and 2) the ""avid"" shopper, who is looking to browse for unique items, good deals and free shipping. The majority of eBay's customers fall into the latter category and eBay believes that 40% of the overall market is of this type. These findings are focusing eBay's post-spin-off CEO and current Marketplaces President, Devin Wenig, on investing less in same day delivery and more on eBay's Deals business, which offers discounts and free shipping. The Deals business is small at $2B, and whether or not eBay will be able to direct more customers to it is uncertain, but the key point here is that management is focusing on what makes eBay stand apart from big retailers like Amazon, who focus on the ""convenience"" type of shopper.In regards to traffic, search engines bring about 15% of the visitors that come to eBay's websites, but a change in Google's algorithm in Q2-Q3 dropped search engine traffic to 10%. Because eBay's merchants have flexibility in regards to how they list their merchandise, eBay's 800 million listings give it a vast amount of unstructured data. This makes eBay's content harder to pick up by search engines and makes eBay more vulnerable to search engine algorithm changes. To fix this issue, eBay has been focused on formatting its listings in a more structured manner, which would allow eBay to rank higher in search engine results and make it less susceptible to search engine algorithm changes.Management's strategy to focus on eBay's core customer base and to make merchant listings more searchable show that they understand the gravity of the threats they are facing and that they are taking action to maintain eBay's competitive advantage.PayPal: the Payment Method of Choice for Small MerchantsPayPal is used in 1 out of every 6 online transactions and it obtained this success because it was able to establish itself as a secure payment option when online transactions were less accepted. During the early 2000s, eBay's emergence as a centralized e-commerce marketplace served to accelerate the proliferation of PayPal because purchasers didn't trust eBay's smaller merchants and they required a safe payment option. Now, PayPal has also become widely accepted outside of eBay with 74% of its TPV (Total Payment Volume, the dollar value of payments conducted over the company's platforms) coming from other sources.The manner in which PayPal grew demonstrates just how difficult it is to replicate. If a new company were to overtake PayPal, it would require both top-of-the-line secure payment technology and an incubation period within a large marketplace full of small merchants. That being said, there is one company that has grown in a similar way: Alipay. Alipay, like PayPal, provides a secure payment option for purchasers who are looking to buy from small merchants with no established reputation. Alipay's incubation within Alibaba allowed it to transact $778B TPV TTM June 30 2014, which dominates PayPal's $203B in that same period. However, only $3B worth of sales from Alibaba's global consumer platform, Aliexpress, was settled through Alipay, indicating that Alipay hasn't made significant inroads outside of China. This shows that PayPal, like eBay, is still the major player in its space globally outside of China.To better understand how PayPal operates compared to a credit card company, let's go over a simplified example involving an online, non-PayPal, credit card purchase: 1) the purchaser gives their credit card information to the merchant via its website; 2) the information is sent to the merchant's bank (the ""Acquiring Bank"" in credit card speak); 3) the acquiring bank sends the transaction information to the relevant credit card network; 4) the credit card network sends the information to the customers bank (""Issuing Bank"") for approval; 5) the payment is approved or disapproved; and 6) if the payment is approved, the acquiring bank collects the money from the issuing bank via the credit card network and the merchant gets the money deposited into his account.In a PayPal transaction, all the same steps take place, except the ""merchant"" is actually PayPal, who then deposits money into the actual merchant's PayPal account. This structure serves to exclude the merchant from the sensitive information flow and protects the purchaser from fraud.This simple structure discourages Visa (NYSE:V) and/or MasterCard (NYSE:MA) from directly competing with PayPal. If Visa/MasterCard were to create a real secure ""middleman"" type structure, it would require them to be responsible for managing deposits, which would: a) make them competitors to their clients (the banks); b) push them into a whole new business model with a new type of client base; and c) expose them to banking regulation and additional merchant class action lawsuits. Visa and MasterCard do have digital wallets, which allow users to safely store their payment information and make payments to merchants that have Visa Checkout or MasterPass as a payment option, but the difference is that these options still require merchants to be approved for merchant accounts by their acquiring banks, whereas PayPal, as shown by its placement as a ""merchant"" in the figure above, does not.By using PayPal instead of a merchant account to accept credit cards, the merchant benefits from a much quicker application process (minutes vs. days or longer), he is much more likely to be approved, he avoids strict record keeping requirements, he can accept American Express and he pays less fees (I estimate that PayPal loses its cost advantage when monthly sales are above $6K. For some context, the average seller on eBay makes ~$300 in sales/month). More importantly, even if the merchant does have a merchant account, he will still want a PayPal account so he can attract the 162 million security conscious PayPal users who may not even consider giving him their sensitive credit card information.How does PayPal offer all of these benefits? 3 ways: 1) its larger scale and credit with the banks lowers its transaction fees when receiving a credit/debit payment, and it passes on some of these savings to its merchants; 2) it collects fees for transferring money between customers' and merchants' PayPal accounts, which cost nothing for PayPal because it bypasses the banks and credit card companies; and 3) PayPal generates interest from the float of customer deposits that it has on hand.As of December 31, 2014 the cash that PayPal was holding for customers was $10.5B, up 14% yoy and the interesting part of this is that PayPal collects interest on this growing balance and doesn't pay any! Another way that PayPal is earning revenue is by using its offshore cash to fund its PayPal Credit business, which is a credit card like option that customers can use. At the end of 2014, PayPal Credit had $3.6B of loans outstanding, up 29% yoy.Apple Pay is also worth addressing and activist investor Dan Loeb put it best:""Apple's entry into the payments space dampened investors' enthusiasm for PayPal, creating an interesting entry point. We think the market is missing the fact that Apple Pay is primarily an offline mobile solution focused on the point of sale opportunity which represents a small fraction of PayPal's current business. When we break down the applicability of Apple Pay to PayPal's business mix, we find that Apply Pay will compete directly with only 1.5‐2% of PayPal's total payment volume."" Mr. Loeb also went on to say that Apple Pay may actually help PayPal, because it will push forward digital payments in the physical world.To sum up, PayPal's success has been driven by the following factors: a) it gives customers a secure way to make purchases without sending their payment information to merchants; b) customers are protected against fraud/faulty product risk because PayPal has a good history of favoring purchasers in disagreements; c) merchants can accept more forms of payment than a traditional merchant account would allow; d) merchants can use PayPal without having a merchant account from their bank; e) PayPal is more cost effective than traditional merchant accounts for small businesses; f) it reduces record keeping burdens for merchants; g) its brand recognition is strong, which helps encourage its use; and h) it is a business that is hard to replicate because a competitor would require an e-commerce platform to incubate in.eBay & PayPal Benefit from Industry TailwindseBay and PayPal's short term destinies are intertwined with e-commerce. The chart below shows how they stack up against the global e-commerce industry.(The full chart is available here.)The 2015 and later figures for eBay and PayPal are the growth rates that are implied given my valuation of $64, which is itself impacted by management's 2015 guidance. This chart demonstrates 4 key points: 1) eBay is in a high growth industry; 2) the recent slow growth of eBay's GMV indicates that it is losing market share, which coincides with growth of Amazon and Alibaba; 3) the acceleration of PayPal's TPV growth in 2013 and 2014 indicates that it is strengthening its position; and 4) 2015 Guidance implies a steep decline that I believe is too pessimistic to be sustained in the long term (more on this below).The Implications of the Dismal 2015 GuidanceManagement's guidance for Q1 2015 and for the FY 2015 implies a very negative growth scenario, perhaps too much so. First, let's take a look at Q4 2014 performance: Q4's GMV grew at a very poor 2% yoy, much lower than the 2014 average of 9% and this was due to new customers not returning after Google's search engine algorithm change. The midpoint of Marketplace's 2015 revenue growth guidance of -2.5% implies, according to my model, that 2015 GMV growth will be -2%. For PayPal, Q4's TPV grew at 23.7%, also lower than the 26.9% average for 2014, and the midpoint of PayPal's revenue growth guidance of 15.5% implies a TPV growth of 17%, despite the fact that TPV growth has actually been accelerating since 2011.If growth prospects remain at the rates implied by 2015's guidance, then my model comes up with an intrinsic value per share of $49.52, but I believe that the guidance is simply too pessimistic to be sustained because of the following: 1) if FX rates stabilize, FX neutral growth rates, which are guided to be higher than the growth rates mentioned in the last paragraph, would be more likely going forward (in case forex sensitivity is a concern, I estimate that a 1% appreciation in the US dollar index, should lead to a $14M decrease in annual operating income); 2) eBay's active buyers grew at 11% yoy in Q4 2014, with an increasing user base, negative GMV growth in the long term is less likely; 3) eBay's search engine optimization efforts increase the likelihood that search engine traffic will get closer to historical levels; 4) after the spin-off, eBay's management will be more focused because their stock and option compensation will no longer enjoy a PayPal bump; 5) industry trends are supportive; and 6) PayPal's growth has actually been accelerating in the last 3 years, which makes a higher TPV growth scenario more likely going forward.In determining eBay's intrinsic value, I have assumed that 2015 growth remains the same as the $49.52 scenario, but, because of the reasons above, I assume that 2016 to 2019 GMV and TPV growth are 3.5% and 19%, respectively. The 3.5% GMV growth is the rate that would be implied by using the midpoint of Marketplaces FX neutral revenue guidance, and the 19% is the TPV growth that would be implied by the high end of PayPal's FX neutral revenue guidance. I used the high end figure because of point 6) above. These adjustments bring the valuation to $63.91.In addition to operational reasons, other forces could make the return profile skewed in the investors favor. For one, eBay's EV/EBIT of 16x (this figure is higher than the EV/EBIT in the table above because here amortization of intangibles is included as an expense) is much lower than Alibaba's 51x and Amazon's 756x. While applying BABA's and AMZN's multiples to eBay is inappropriate due to different growth rates and business exposures, the valuation gap indicates that eBay is less likely to be perceived as expensive, thereby decreasing the chances of a large drop in price. On the upside, the chances of an acquisition of either eBay or PayPal have increased due to the spin-off and Carl Icahn's influence on management to limit PayPal's anti-takeover provisions. It was also announced that eBay Enterprise will be up for sale, and if the sale is successful, it will make eBay a cheaper and leaner acquisition target.eBay's Post Spin-off Suitors: Amazon, AlibabaA post spin-off eBay could be a suitable acquisition target for Alibaba or Amazon because neither would like to see it in the other's hands. In my opinion, Amazon hasn't made a bid for eBay in the past because of 3 main reasons: 1) eBay's merchant-based model wasn't a major focus of Amazon's business; 2) eBay's market value was propped up because of PayPal and; 3) there wasn't another large global threat to Amazon if it were to crush eBay. All three of these factors have changed. Now, the units sold by Amazon's merchants make up 43% of Amazon's total unit sales, eBay's post spin-off enterprise value will likely be reduced by more than 35% (which would be the reduction in eBay's operating income once PayPal is spun-off) and the threat of Alibaba changes the competitive dynamics of the industry.Amazon's management may be thinking something like the following: ""If we don't buy eBay, sure we could continue to take their market share, but then Alibaba could sweep them up and take all their market share immediately and squeeze us down the road. Right now our valuation is higher than eBay's and we could make a stock offer and acquire the largest marketplace in the world outside of China."" Alibaba's management could be thinking something similar and it would be logical for them to do so.PayPal's Suitors: Banks, AmExIf a financial institution were to acquire PayPal it would get the following benefits: a) it would capture all of PayPal's merchant accounts and be able to market to a whole new class of clients; b) it would capture PayPal's interest free $10.5B deposit base; c) it would be able to extract more profit out of transactions because of its direct connection with credit card networks; d) it would be able to lower the cost of funds for PayPal Credit, which currently operates by requesting other banks to lend directly to the customer in exchange for purchasing the receivable; and e) it would acquire one of world's most trusted secure payment technologies. American Express (NYSE:AXP) is also another suitor who would largely acquire the same benefits as a bank with the added benefit of a lower culture clash as PayPal's new CEO, Dan Schulman, is a former employee of AmEx, where he led the expansion of their mobile and online payment services.Valuation AssumptionsA discounted NOPAT valuation was conducted, which excluded amortization of intangibles. I decided to use NOPAT over FCFF (which was 13% higher than NOPAT in 2014) because I wanted to account for loan loss provisions, non-cash compensation and CAPEX fluctuations. In both the $49.52 and $63.91 price scenarios, the assumptions below were used from 2015 to the end 2019 then an H-model was used to model a decline from short term growth to 3% growth 15 years thereafter. The short term NOPAT growth rates were 3.8% and 7.1% in the lower and higher priced scenarios, respectively.A sum-of-parts valuation was not conducted because eBay, PayPal and Enterprise share significant corporate expenses that are not divided by segment.I am long eBay."

After a reporting a disappointing Q3 where we saw unrelenting competitive pressure from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), investors should not expect Q4 to be any different from the prior quarters. The Marketplace continues to be impacted by Google's search engine changes and Amazon as well as the trend of offline retailers, such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) moving to online. Marketplace's Q3 revenue growth of +6% y/y and GMV growth of +9% were both a sharp deceleration prior the prior quarter and we could see growth coming in around mid-single digits for both units this quarter. PayPal is the only area that is holding up but it is worth noting that low margin units are driving most of the growth with increasing mobile payment and volume. In short eBay continues to face a weakening fundamentals. Without additional investment in its core business or pursuing M&A, the company could continue to face headwinds in 2015. I would avoid the name and buy into the more established ecommerce plays, and my pecking order is to buy Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), neutral on Amazon and short eBay.ImplicationsCore competencies waning. eBay's key issue remains competitive pressure on both of its marketplace and payment side. On the marketplace side, the company is facing AMZN, GOOG and offline retailers that are moving online. On the payment side, the resurgence of Google Wallet and Apple Pay, and the potential entry of Alipay into North America pose a long-term threat to future growth. Without additional investment in its core, (ie. rebrand eBay's image as a second-hand item platform) it will be necessary to reverse the tide. Additionally, investments in vertical ecommerce sites to broaden the product offering will be critical to differentiate eBay from rivals Amazon and Google. On the offline channels, emerging technologies, particularly in the O2O and LBS areas, will help offline channels to gain more share away from eBay. In short, the current pace of eBay is simply unsustainable and the company needs to either pursue reinvestment, or consider a strategic review as its merchant relationship will be valuable to BABA that looks to expand its presence in North America.Looking for details on the PayPal spinoff. The most important part in the upcoming call will be details regarding the PayPal spinoff. Figuring out current relationships, maintaining a level of synergy and strategic flexibility will be some of the key priorities along with allocation of capital post transaction (ie. splitting debt and cash between market place and PayPal). Investors expect this to be finalized in the filings in the first half of the year with the actual separation happening in the second half.ConclusionI would avoid eBay heading into the earnings and buy BABA instead, which will report on January 29, 2015Additional researchAlibaba Going Global Part III: Growth Starts At The Doorstep"

Though we expect its payments division PayPal to report strong growth, its marketplaces segment is likely to show sub-par growth. This, in all likelihood, could be due to the continued impact of the security breach and changes in the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) SEO (Search Engine Optimization) algorithm that hit eBay earlier this year and led to reduced traffic levels on eBay's sites. We also expect eBay to face profitability pressure during the fourth quarter due to a surge in sales and marketing expenses to curb the fall in traffic on eBay's marketplaces.Over the longer run, we believe eBay has a strong business model with high margins and cash flows and could gain from the rapid growth in the global e-commerce and online payments market. We expect the spin-off of PayPal to be beneficial for both the resulting companies as they are increasingly facing a unique set of challenges and opportunities. We will be closely tracking the earnings call to know more about the strategic direction each company could take post the spin-off later this year, and how their synergy is expected to persist in the long-run.Our $67 price estimate for eBay's stock represents near 20% upside to the current market price.Marketplaces Segment Will Continue To Under-PerformBeset by traffic-related challenges, growth in eBay's marketplaces segment subsided during 2014. Its sales growth slackened from 11% in Q1 2014 to 9% and 6% in Q2 and Q3, respectively. A security breach hit eBay's marketplace earlier this year, due to which the company had asked all its users to change their passwords as a safety measure. This led to a slowdown in buying activity as some users did not change their passwords and exercise caution. In addition, changes in Google's SEO (search engine optimization) algorithm also adversely affected traffic on eBay, as the company was punished for a lack of quality content on seller-generated listings. SEO management is tricky for eBay since there are millions of seller-generated listings on its platform, which leads to a large amount of unstructured data - overcoming this challenge involves manual processes, which could take a few more quarters to show results.Most likely, these challenges weighed on the segment's results in the fourth quarter as well. According to same store sales data compiled by ChannelAdvisor, eBay's sales under-performed the broader e-commerce market during the last three months, with same stores sales coming at 4.4%, 9.8% and 5.8% during October, November and December, respectively. This compared to Amazon's same stores sales of 32.4%, 35.7% and 21.8% during the same respective months. While the baseline year-over-year growth for the overall U.S. e-commerce sales during the recent holiday season (spanning November and December) was pegged at 16% by ChannelAdvisor, eBay's performance was recorded to be much lower at 7.3% during this period. The sales from auctions are declining year-over-year, and the rise in fixed-price sales also is lagging the overall e-commerce market by a large extent.With the expected spin-off of PayPal business later this year, investors will be wondering how eBay aims to accelerate its growth in the marketplaces segment going forward. Sales increase in this segment has remained sub-par for the past few quarters, and the company will have to take some concrete measures to show it can compete more effectively in the e-commerce market. eBay's management had reported that they will focus on certain key customer segments, the overhaul of their SEO strategy, and the enhancement of sales and marketing efforts, so as to mitigate the impact of these recent challenges. We will looking for updates regarding this strategy during the earnings call.PayPal Segment Will Show Strong GrowthWe expect PayPal to carry eBay's fourth quarter earnings, with solid growth in active account additions and total payment volume. Overriding the weakness in the marketplaces segment, payments segment's revenue and total payments volume (TPV) rose by 19% and 28%, respectively, during the nine months ended September 2014. We expect the high demand in this segment to persist in the fourth and upcoming quarters as the online payment market is seeing huge growth, with PayPal maintaining a leading position in this market. PayPal's advancements on the mobile platform will also help it gain share in the rapidly growing mobile payments market. Paypal's mobile payments volume surged by 72% during Q3 2014, accounting for around 20% of the total payment volume. Product innovations (such as One Touch payments), along with high growth within the recently acquired subsidiary ""Braintree"" (a leader in mobile payments space), also will drive results during the fourth quarter.We expect the payments business to gain significantly from the spin-off, as it will allow the standalone business to navigate the rapidly changing competitive environment. We think the separation from eBay also could throw open the opportunity of PayPal partnering with other leading giants such as Google, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), etc. The increasing proportion of merchant services in net TPV (as compared to on-eBay net TPV) is another positive that makes PayPal less reliant on eBay for its growth. It grew to 73% of the total during the nine months ended September 2014.Disclosure: No positions."
2825066,75265,2015-01-15T19:43:51-05:00,"After the PayPal spinoff, investors will have shares in both eBay - the parent company with key competitive advantages - and its high growth spinoff business.eBay provides a secure global marketplace, an essential competitive advantage in e-commerce, which provides a stable support for future growth.As a publicly traded company, PayPal will have greater flexibility to widen its economic moat and capitalize tailwinds.Certain elements to watch out for are moves from competition and the extent to which these could negatively affect revenue growth for both eBay and PayPal.","Since the announcement of PayPal's spinoff and weak Q3 2014 results for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), there has been mixed feelings in the market toward this stock. Despite the uncertainties that competition -- like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) -- might bring in this industry, investors can still benefit significantly from buying this stock before the spinoff. As management stated in the Q3 2014 earnings report, the company has faced near term challenges like a cyber attack and changes in Google SEO. Despite obstacles like these, eBay still maintains its main competitive advantages and certain long-term prospects. In that sense, eBay seems like a parent company well-suited for investment. Moreover, its spinoff business, PayPal, is one of the leading online payment services amid a large, burgeoning industry. Hence, once separated, both eBay and PayPal have potential to increase their capital gains significantly in the long-term.The Potential Of The Parent Company At the moment, one of the leading companies in the e-commerce industry is eBay, which provides an online marketplace to sellers and buyers around the world. By increasing its gross merchandise volume, the company is able to increase its revenue, as it charges users for every item they list in the marketplace. As a result of its ongoing global expansion, it continues to grow in revenue despite a relatively weak third quarter.In addition, its recognized global brand, considered as a wide economic moat, could allow the business to further propel its growth in the future. Currently, one of the most needed aspects of an e-commerce site is its ability to provide a secure platform for customer's payment information. eBay's experience in the market gives customers this sense of security. Moreover, the company has shown its resilience and contingency plans against cyber attacks, which ultimately help to protect its long-term reputation. This need for security will most likely persevere in the future as e-commerce continues to grow, which gives eBay a long-term competitive advantage. As a result, eBay's marketplace seems sustainable and suitable for long-term investors. Moreover, the spinoff could allow eBay to intensify its focus on customer satisfaction and support, which improves its economic goodwill and thus increases its value.In mobile platforms, eBay enjoys the tailwinds of a continuously growing market with much more upside potential in the future. Besides forecasts estimating significant growth in online retail in the next few years, a recently released study by Flurry shows how the mobile e-commerce market is currently growing at a very fast pace.The report states that mobile users have increased their overall use of apps by 76% in 2014. Moreover, shopping apps lead the way with an astounding 174% growth in iOS and Android, as users have increased their use of apps in retailers like Amazon and marketplaces like eBay. At the moment, eBay continues to grow its customer base, which reached over 152 million active buyers in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014.Possible Threats For eBay's Growth in E-commerce However, eBay still faces threats from large scale substitutes such as Amazon and China's giant, Alibaba. Currently, Amazon is growing significantly in third party sales, a field in which it directly competes with eBay. In 2014, sellers on Amazon set a new record, as they sold over 2 billion items around the world, doubling this number since 2013. Plus, Amazon's number of worldwide sellers using the Fulfillment By Amazon service - which stores and ships products from third-party sellers - grew by 65% year-over-year. During the 2014 holiday season, units shipped worldwide by third-party sellers grew more than 50% year-over-year. Amazon also grew 80% in international sales from China and Hong Kong-based sellers. However, the organization had its stock plummet more than 22% in 2014, its worst year since 2008, due to free spending on the Fire smartphone and a widening network of warehouses. Currently, there are concerns about its slowing growth and ability to turn a profit. Unlike Amazon, eBay does not incur heavy operation costs involving inventory control and management. Since it mainly acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, it maintains higher margins and profitability.On another note, Alibaba makes it particularly hard for both Amazon and eBay to grow in the Asian region, posing a threat to overall global expansion. Also, in the U.S., this China-based organization launched 11 Main, a shopping app available for Android and Apple devices. This application will provide the company with key initial experience in the U.S. market, which could later enable them to further expand in it. Nevertheless, some evident problems for the Chinese company could be a learning curve factor in regards to operations that propel growth in a new market, and the well-established brands of both eBay and Amazon - which increase costs and barriers of entry. But Alibaba may face greater problems in China, as the company faces constant competition from Tencent Holdings. This is China's second-biggest Internet company and owns a mobile app called WeChat, which enables a social e-commerce service. Moreover, the organization owns a 15% stake in Alibaba's top e-commerce competitor in China, JD.com. As Seeking Alpha contributor Peter Fuhrman notes here, Tencent may present a strong potential threat for Alibaba's growth in e-commerce.Taking the above factors into consideration, eBay seems well-positioned to outlast its competition, given that the organization counts with sustainable competitive advantages. This enables eBay to support its consistent growth amid competitors that are struggling with certain weaknesses and threats. So, at the moment, eBay's growth does not face worrisome threats from its top two competitors. Yet, investors must be aware of the actions that Amazon and Alibaba take in the future, and how these could affect the sustainability of eBay's moat.A Spinoff Business With High Growth Potential Since its launch in 1998, PayPal has built a solid brand as a secure payment service, and has led the market for several consecutive years. Moreover, it efficiently fulfills user's need for a safe online payment method. The business manages to generate revenue by charging fees in every transaction. In that manner, its Total Payment Volume metric reflects its overall growth, as the service also charges fees based on a percentage of transactions. As illustrated in the graph below, TPV has been growing consistently each quarter, going up 37% in Q3 of last year. Its revenue was also reported to increase by 21%. Additionally, eBay reached $12 billion in mobile payments volume in the last third quarter, growing by 72%, and accounting for 20% of TPV. Now, its large customer base - 157 million active registered accounts - and cross-border trading constitute a wide economic moat for this specific business. In fact, Paypal estimates that its international value will reach over $300 billion in 2018, showing considerable growth from $105 billion in 2013.For many consecutive years, PayPal has grown faster than eBay, acting as a major source of revenue for the company. Moreover, it is likely to benefit significantly from future tailwinds in the burgeoning mobile payment industry. Due to its strengths and opportunities, the business seems poised for high long-term growth. However, Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL) presents a key threat for PayPal's development in the mobile payments market. This novel payment service could garner considerable success as it offers a secure and simple way for iPhone 6 users to pay in stores. In that way, it is important to see how the upcoming publicly traded PayPal - no longer held back by eBay - will address this issue and improve its service so it benefits the most from the tailwinds.ConclusioneBay counts with two major business components with competitive advantages that can sustain growth and profitability in the long-term, which favors a long position in its stock. Both Marketplaces and PayPal satisfy the main need of security in transactions and payments. Also, both have global brand recognition and large cross-border operations, which form wide economic moats for each business. Even though Marketplaces faces two large competitors, Amazon and Alibaba, it is still able to grow due to its competitive advantages. Moreover, both competitors are struggling with certain weaknesses and threats, which currently alleviate the odds of them taking a worrisome portion of eBay's growing benefits. In regards to PayPal, this business is growing considerably fast in a burgeoning industry, yet faces a potential threat from Apple Pay. At the moment, it seems possible that both eBay and PayPal will be able to improve their operations after the spinoff, which would allow them to better face competition and capitalize opportunities."
2788085,79485,2014-12-30T11:13:38-05:00,"Post PayPal, eBay will still be an attractive company.Results from recent quarter show a growing business, even without PayPal.eBay minus PayPal brings company to Blue Chip status.","eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) 3Q14 results indicate the company is a stable business that guarantees safety of principal. The company enjoyed a 12% increase in revenue growth, a 6% increase in EPS to $0.68, and strong FCF of $941mm. These results buttress EBAY's strong financial position; 15bn of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments, coupled with only $4bn of debt. Aside from Apple, it's one of the most financially secure names in tech. The lowering of 4Q revenue and EPS guidance has depressed the stock, as have declining YoY growth figures: Q314 YoY EPS growth of 6% versus Q313 YoY EPS growth of 17%, Q314 revenue growth of 12% versus Q313 revenue growth of 14%, and Q314 FCF growth of -7% versus Q313 revenue growth of 28%. I disagree with broader market sentiment that EBAY's business is weakening, and interpret these results as a sign of maturity in EBAY's business. While we are not going to see the same explosive growth as before, EBAY's fundamentals are still quite strong.EBAY is tightly interwoven with macro trends (shift to e-commerce, growth in mobile payments), which coupled with micro growth factors (EBAY's own financials, initiatives to identify the target EBAY customer) guarantees an adequate return for shareholders. According to data by the US census bureau, e-commerce as a % of total sales is at 6% as of 2014, and has been increasing at a rate of roughly 70 bps a year over the past 8 years.As a pure online venue, EBAY will benefit from this secular shift. Mobile payments was an important part of the EBAY story prior to the announced PayPal spin-off. While PayPal will have EBAY as a partner, terminating the exclusivity of the relationship will cause a share of PayPal's attention to be shifted from EBAY to other partners. Coupled with these more macro trends are micro-related aspects that point to growth for EBAY. 4Q14 revenue of $4.85-$4.95bn and $0.88-$0.91 are expected, which represent year-over-year growth of 7-9% and 8-12% respectively. With YTD revenue of $12.981 billion, estimated FY14 revenue is at $17.831-17.931 billion, an 11-12% gain versus FY13.EBAY is close to the mature stage. After the PayPal spin-off wraps up, we'll be left with a well capitalized company. A company with a healthy operating margin (40% for Marketplace in FY13), a strong cash balance, and no real competitors (until, BABA becomes a threat domestically), EBAY's best and most likely option is to become a shareholder friendly blue-chip: paying out dividends and buying back stock.Furthermore, a ""mature"" company can devote its attention to satisfying their customer base, as opposed to growing it. A helpful angle in promoting such satisfaction is to learn more about the profile your typical customer fits, so that your product offering might reflect that. On the 3Q14 earnings call, CEO John Donahue spoke of increased interest on EBAY's part in identifying the ""EBAY target customer."" The process is ongoing, but some not too far fetched assumptions can be made about this target customer to get an idea about them. EBAY can be seen as an intercontinental thrift shop. The thrift shop customer can be seen as the type of profile that customer would fit, someone who isn't turned off by the idea of using a second hand product. EBAY would benefit from partnering with local thrift shops to gain access to an even larger clientele(and product) base.PayPal on the other hand is the high growth, ""sexy"" component to EBAY that will be a standalone company in 2H15. EBAY's payments business (which will become the standalone PayPal) reported a 20.4% year over year revenue increase. The company is projected to grow a double digit rates for the foreseeable future. PayPal's relationship with EBAY should be unaffected, even with the former now being ""third-party."" So, the same capabilities will be there. Furthermore, while PayPal is a significant component to EBAY's total revenue, spinning it off will leave most of EBAY's free cash flow intact. The spin off will also give EBAY a significant infusion of cash, which it can invest back into the business (like investing in data to better understand that ""target customer"") or devote to additional share buybacks and a dividend.On a DCF and P/B relative value basis, EBAY is quite attractive. Our DCF valuation yields a $61.30 price target. This represents 7.5% upside from the December 29th pre-market price of $57.04. The DCF assumes a 2% decline in YoY revenue growth rate, constant capital expenditures in FY14, FY15, and FY16 (FY14 capex is expected to come in around $1.4 billion). On a relative value basis (and especially with internet companies), we like looking at the price-book ratio. EBAY's is 3.12x, which represents the lowest price to book ratio of other major internet companies: AMZN, 14.56x; GOOGL, 4.17x, GRPN, 7.62x, YHOO, 3.95x. Given this, and the aforementioned reasons, we recommend investors buy EBAY."
2772745,69785,2014-12-22T11:00:28-05:00,PayPal holds more growth potential than the marketplace side of eBay.PayPal could see major growth if it gets access to upward trends in mobile payments and other emerging markets.PayPal will be challenged by Apple Pay and Google Wallet in mobile and will face other regulatory and legal barriers.PayPal should be fairly valuated at around $40-45 billion when it spins off.,"As I've suggested in another article, technology has systematically disrupted information-based industries and potentially the next industry that's in line is the more entrenched world of finance. One company that is uniquely poised in that disruption is PayPal. According to PayPal's next CEO Dan Schulman,Background: In late 1998 at Stanford, Peter Thiel introduced the idea of a digital wallet to Max Levchin and Luke Nosek. The three began working on the concept which later turned into the company they founded, Confinity. That service (after a brief stint with Elon Musk as CEO) evolved into PayPal in 1999 and was acquired by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) back in 2002.Although integrated with eBay at this point, it was still an unsustainable jumble of ideas kept alive by future Silicon Valley influentials. Its payment volumes mostly came from eBay, which made it a natural acquisition target. PayPal survived mainly because most of eBay's users were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards. After struggling to find a place within eBay's growing user-base, in the second half of 2004, PayPal Merchant Services began to enroll other online merchants outside eBay as well as reducing fees for online purchases and launching PayPal mobile. Since then, PayPal's contribution to eBay's earnings has continued to outpace the growth of the parent company and eBay may have even slowed PayPal's ability to expand its reach, specifically in hindering the launch of the PayPal App. PayPal has been able to acquire other related startups like Braintree, Venmo, card.io, fig, bill safe, and Bill me Later that have roughly fit into its lofty although vague mission statement (""Web's most convenient, secure, cost-effective payment solution""). Still, after the spin-off, will Paypal still thrive without eBay's backing? At this point PayPal seems to have more potential and more opportunity for growth than its parent and with its spin-off coming in early 2015, it's worth taking a look at where its potential lies, what lurking obstacles might hinder that potential and what a good price for the company would be when it does break away.UpsideThe biggest immediate challenge and opportunity for PayPal is racing against tech giants like Google and Apple in the sphere of mobile in- store payments. Mobile payments alone are predicted to have a 90 billion market by 2017. Along with these big tech companies, major credit card companies will also be vying for this space. PayPal has already preemptively produced an app although it has still fallen short of anything that is as efficient and as easy to use as traditional credit cards. Google Wallet and Apple Pay have a huge advantage in this area because they are backed by large established databases and services customers already trust. At the same time, the size and scope that these companies work under could slow down their ability and motivation to profit from this area of transformative growth.In PayPal's favor, its future CEO Dan Schulman seems to be suited almost specifically for this task. His experience came from telecom starting out as an AT&T executive then in 2001 growing Virgin mobile USA which was eventually acquired by Sprint in 2009. Most recently, he has been trying to expand the reach of American Express to people without access to traditional banking by using digital alternatives like mobile. Driven by a desire to give banking access to under-served populations, and undo the convention that ""it's expensive to be poor"" he says:And while I don't think we will see traditional banks disappear altogether, I do think he is on the right track for growth and how to reach youth and lower income segments. It also suggests that Schulman will do whatever is necessary to cut costs to the user while working to make the PayPal app more intuitive and user-friendly. I also think he may also try to make other relevant banking services accessible to PayPal users through the PayPal app. While he has the right direction and motivation I could see him struggling to adapt to a more startup innovative minded environment and pulling together the right team and working to get the technology right as his background is more from an executive and finance mindset.In addition to a CEO who will pursue his vision of bank alternatives, PayPal has already established agreements with retailers that it will try to expand into in-store purchases. Most likely Apple, Google and PayPal will grow with this trend, with Paypal getting the most traction if it is able to make a compelling app and partner effectively with banks or credit card companies in the process.In addition to replacing credit cards, there is also a growing market of peer-to-peer digital payments and mobile peer-to-peer and PayPal at this point is by far the most recognized and trusted service positioned for growth in this field. Along with direct peer-to-peer payments using Venmo, growth could come in this segment as services like Uber, Lyft, AirBNB, and other mobile transactions rely on its service to make their businesses work.As other small businesses and store fronts convert to using a computer checkout, they often favor this convenient device for credit card transactions. Although insert will become obsolete with implementation of mobile payments, it will likely continue to fill a necessary niche for a long while before payments go completely to smart phones. In a related application, Square has enabled transactions for small business and opened up a new market which can work with PayPal and which PayPal has countered with its own mobile transaction device to compete with Square.RisksSome obstacles that PayPal will continue to face are similar to ones that it has faced since it began:-Continuing to gain the willingness of customers to use PayPal without direct support from eBay- Still being an unproven method of handling money and continuing to get access to more retailers and users -Pressure from Visa and MasterCard which are older, established systems that have huge experience and databases and are are not going to give up their position willingly. For PayPal to compete with the credit card system, they would need instant transactions rather than waiting days for orders to process as they currently do with eBay- PayPal has many of the safety issues of a bank. As PayPal grows, it will continue to have to deal with regulation and how to interface with purchases in other countries etc.Along these lines, my own experience has been that when selling larger priced items on eBay there are offers from scammers in questionable locations offering to buy the item. I can only guess, but I imagine once they see the item being shipped they cancel the payment and take advantage of the time lapse in payment to take the merchandise and run. As with most new technology and the sharing economy, it assumes a certain level of intelligence and self reliance in its customers which is wonderful but only works if people actually live up to these ideals. If customers act like users in the old banking system and care more about fraud than getting things done better, the system will not move forward.ConclusionWhile about a third of PayPal's payment volume still comes from E-Bay, there seems to be little doubt that the more profitable of the two companies will ultimately be PayPal. Current E-bay CEO John Donahoe has indicated that,As seen in the chart below, PayPal has grown consistently along with eBay since 2002 -- it went from making up 18% of its revenue to 38% in 2011.So there's a lot of room to grow and a lot of potential, but what is it actually worth? Both eBay and PayPal have about 150 Million users. In 2012, eBay's revenues were about $16 Billion and will likely be around $19 Billion in 2014. As Donahoe points out, 40% of that is coming from PayPal so simply taking 40% of eBay's current revenue would give a rough valuation of $40-45 Billion not factoring in PayPal's more optimistic future. For me, anything below $40 Billion divided by the proposed number of shares would be enough margin of safety to get a stake in PayPal's growth. The growth will likely be a very bumpy ride but if you stick it out, there will quite possibly be solid upside that will continue to compound as it plays an integral part in financial transactions for a long time to come."
2811055,25047,2015-01-11T18:55:27-05:00,"There are many obvious reasons why Alibaba might be interested in acquiring eBay.However, there is an additional reason that is probably worth more than those obvious reasons, and could drive Alibaba even more toward such a deal.In fact, this additional reason guarantees a massive advantage for a combined eBay-Alibaba entity in the very area which affects eCommerce most - shipping costs.","There are several obvious reasons that could lead Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) to acquire eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). And beyond these obvious reasons, there's a reason most investors probably don't know about ... one that could tip the scales toward M&A. This article covers both the obvious reasons and the intriguing one.Obvious reason #1: A rather similar business modelOne of the obvious reasons that could compel Alibaba to buy eBay is the fact that eBay runs a very similar business model already. eBay is a marketplace open to third-party sellers much like Alibaba, along with a payments system (PayPal) that is also a parallel to Alibaba's participation in Alipay's future. eBay does not have its own fulfillment capacity, the way Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) does, and neither does Alibaba.This similarity means that eBay enjoys large margins much like Alibaba, particularly in its marketplace segment. Indeed, eBay posted an operating margin of 46.9% in its marketplace business in the nine months to September 2014.There are also differences, like eBay also relying on auctions, as well as it being more commission-heavy than Alibaba. But for the most part, the business model is very similar. Some of these differences could actually mean Alibaba has the option to be aggressive in bringing eBay's model closer to its own model and thus rapidly making eBay more competitive against Amazon.com.Furthermore, while Alibaba has interests both in marketplaces and Alipay, there's the chance that Alibaba could take the plunge and buy eBay only after it spins off PayPal. This would make an eBay acquisition even cheaper (though it would require the expansion of Alipay worldwide).Obvious reason #2: Quick entry into US/International marketsAnother obvious reason for Alibaba buying eBay would be that it would make for instant (and large) international expansion. eBay has a presence not just in the U.S., but also in many international markets. Indeed, eBay's international revenues account for around 53% of eBay's revenues, which is more than even what Amazon.com gets.Trying to grow organically into the U.S. market or internationally might prove much more difficult than simply making such an acquisition, especially if Alibaba can make it ""on the cheap"" by buying just the marketplaces component after eBay spins off PayPal.Obvious reason #3: Manageable sizeeBay, with or without PayPal, is significantly smaller than Alibaba in terms of market capitalization. Presently it carries a $69.1 billion market capitalization versus Alibaba's $256 billion. Thus, eBay's market capitalization represents just 27% of Alibaba's. Even if we apply a 30% acquisition premium, eBay's market capitalization would still be just a hair over a third of Alibaba's, at 35%.This size difference means such an acquisition would be easily digestible. And there would be two further scenarios making it easier still:Either way, eBay's size does not look like an insurmountable obstacle, given the size difference between the two companies as well as the options available to make such an acquisition easier still.Obvious reason #4: Rapidly accretiveThere is another angle which makes an Alibaba acquisition potentially attractive. That angle would be the fact that acquiring eBay stands a good chance of being immediately earnings-accretive to Alibaba, whether Alibaba pays in cash or stock.In cashIf Alibaba were to buy eBay at a 30% premium to today's market capitalization, it would be paying a 22.1 multiple on forward (2015) earnings. This is a 4.525% earnings yield.Even ignoring the effect of taxes, Alibaba recently financed itself by issuing debt, which included 10-year paper at a 3.6% yield. Thus, as long as Alibaba could replicate such issuance on a much larger scale at not much higher yields (and there would be further leeway from taxes), buying eBay for cash would be instantly earnings accretive.In stockIf buying with stock, Alibaba would basically be using its own stock trading for 34 times forward earnings to buy eBay's at 22.1 times forward earnings (including a 30% premium). Thus, from that angle it would also be earnings accretive in the sense that it would immediately lead to a lower earnings multiple for the combined entity.The not-so-obvious reason that might tip the scale: eBay has a tremendous advantage, particularly for the Chinese!Up to this point, we've seen several reasons why it could make sense for Alibaba to simply buy eBay. These are obvious reasons, and there's not much of a surprise in them.However, there is another reason that most investors don't know about, but those who are active eBay sellers might recognize. It's hard to imagine how this reason even came about, but it exists and does not seem to have a set time to expire.The ePacketI am talking about several deals between USPS, eBay and other countries' post offices, most notably China Post and, though less relevant, Hong Kong Post. These deals created the ePacket. The ePacket is a ""rather fast"" (7-10 days, typically) shipping solution geared toward shipping small packages weighing up to two kilograms (4.4 pounds). It includes tracking and delivery confirmation. And get this - it serves consumers in the United States from merchants … elsewhere. So, there's no full reciprocity.Furthermore, the ePacket is cheaper to ship than the cheapest USPS rates within the U.S. itself - notice this, it's cheaper to ship compared to U.S. rates, but already including the China shipping portion of the trip! 30-50% cheaper, as reckoned.Remember, the ePacket was born out of a deal between USPS, eBay and the foreign post offices. I bolded eBay because, alas, the ePacket is not available to other eCommerce sites! (though there are other misleading services also named ""ePacket"" in the U.S. and elsewhere). Thus, for as long as it exists, the ePacket is a powerful sustainable advantage both for Chinese eCommerce suppliers and eBay.No surprise, then ...It's no surprise that if you go to eBay and search for iPhone cases or USB charging cables or some other low-priced items, you'll find tons of Chinese suppliers selling sub-$1 items with … free shipping.Try the same at Amazon.com and what you'll find are items priced as low as $0.01, but with $3-$4-$5 shipping costs. For as long as this deal stands, Amazon.com has no chance of competing in this ""direct from China"" segment for small packages, which is likely to continue expanding.So, if Alibaba were to acquire eBay it would gain this advantage for itself - and for the giant troupe of Chinese suppliers it already has in its websites! Not surprisingly, these agreements offer tremendous value precisely for Alibaba, if it were ever to acquire eBay.Also not surprising ...Barely one year after the ePacket was created, already 40% of the eBay sellers in China were using it to ship to the U.S. And eBay reckons 80% of these items arrived within 5-to-10 days, so not exactly slow either.Some statistics from USPS showing the growth ...Digging deeper, it was possible to locate a few USPS statistics on ePackets. These came from the Office Of The Inspector General, which was auditing the ePacket costing methodology.Naturally, there's a fear that USPS might be subsidizing Chinese exporters (something funny here is that eBay is not mentioned). The report concludes that there's a need to isolate ePacket costs. Such a thing happening is not much of a worry because in the meantime USPS has created other products named ePacket, which will most surely be bundled with those in the agreements and muddle things up. Anyway, what matters is that USPS gave us some statistics in this report:We have two interesting facts here:Sure, you'd have to add a small fee on China's side, and there are limited collection centers for ePackets. But this explains how it's possible for so many Chinese sellers to offer their wares with ""free shipping"" - and how other eCommerce competitors including Amazon.com can't match this, as well as how U.S. sellers can't match it either.Under any condition, the existence of these agreements is a large positive for eBay, and a particularly large positive for the Chinese eCommerce leader, Alibaba, if it were to ever acquire eBay and thus get access to such interesting agreements.Shipping costs are one of the largest banes of eCommerce, and these agreements allow Chinese eBay sellers to offer goods coming from China at shipping costs that are inferior to shipping the same product directly from within the U.S. It's hard to find anything much more amazing than this.The eBay/PayPal spinoffThe eBay spin-off can be relevant for the timing of a potential Alibaba acquisition as well as the potential likelihood. There are the following things to consider:Anyway, what really matters is that eBay presents an interesting target for Alibaba, both because of obvious reasons, and for the very uncommon reason I stated.ConclusionThere are many obvious reasons why Alibaba might be interested in acquiring eBay. Such an acquisition would quickly further its international aspirations, would be manageable in size and accretive to earnings.However, one less well-known reason might trump all of those conventional reasons: The existence of eBay-exclusive shipping agreements that greatly favor Chinese eCommerce merchants when selling to the U.S. market. These agreements are particularly attractive to Alibaba - the largest eCommerce company in the world, based in China, and with a business model that relies exactly on those Chinese eCommerce merchants.An Alibaba/eBay merger would thus have access to an advantage no other eCommerce website - including Amazon.com - could match. At least not until either Amazon.com manages to create similar deals (unlikely) or USPS is forced to back out of them (might happen, though the USPS does not want to since it would eliminate a source of revenue growth).On the other side, we could say that Alibaba is not used to massive acquisitions like this. Also, the acquisition could face scrutiny from authorities in the U.S. Though competition would remain the same or increase, since Alibaba is not yet present in the market and thus the acquisition would not remove a competitor."
2757345,23479,2014-12-15T17:50:08-05:00,"We believe the rapidly growing payments business represents one the leading drivers for eBay's business.The marketplaces segment will gain significantly from the secular shift toward e-commerce being seen in the retail market.eBay has several competitive advantages which include a strong network effect and brand recognition, and this will magnify demand in the marketplaces segment.","eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) business has under-performed during the recent past, with revenue growth particularly stumbling in its marketplaces segment. This also has caused weakness in its stock price, which has barely appreciated during 2014 - after correcting to $48 post the third quarter earnings release, its stock price has now returned back to $55 levels. In this first part of a series of two notes we are publishing on eBay, we analyze the principal tailwinds in eBay's business and in the second part, we stack them against the key barriers to assess where the company could gain or lose going forward. We also call out our views against each of these factors, to underscore our $67 valuation for the company's stock.We believe the rapidly growing payments business represents one the leading drivers for eBay's business. We expect the over 20% growth rate in this segment to persist in the future driven by massive demand in the mobile commerce market, which is expected to be valued at $721 billion globally by 2017 (according to Gartner). PayPal's leading market position and product innovations will enable it to capture a large chunk of this opportunity. In addition, the marketplaces segment will gain significantly from the secular shift towards e-commerce being seen in the retail market. The global business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce market could surpass $2.3 trillion by 2017 (according to eMarketer). Notwithstanding the current headwinds being faced in this segment - eBay has several competitive advantages which include a strong network effect and brand recognition, and this will magnify demand in the marketplaces segment.eBay's asset-light business model delivers high cash flows and margins - its trailing twelve months free cash flow and operating margins were recorded at 26% and 20%, respectively. Moreover, the upcoming spin-off of PayPal next year will unlock additional shareholder value. Both segments face unique challenges and a separation will allow them to better align their strategies, capital allocation and cost structure.Payments Business Is Growing Rapidly: Despite the recent weakness being seen in the marketplaces segment, eBay's payments business is showing promising growth. The segment's revenue and total payment volume (TPV) rose by 20% and 29%, respectively, during the third quarter of 2014. And during the nine months ended September, 2014, the same metrics increased by 19% and 28%, respectively.We expect the high growth rates in this segment to persist in the future due to PayPal's strong brand image and leading position in the mobile payments market. Mobile payments volume increased by 72% during the last quarter, and accounted for 20% of the total payment volume. The mobile payment market is expected to see explosive growth in the future - global mobile transactions value is forecast to rise from $235.4 billion in 2013 to $721 billion by 2017, according to Gartner. [1] Increased demand, combined with continued product innovations and higher flexibility post the spin-off, will allow PayPal to capitalize heavily on this market opportunity. Another positive trend is increasing proportion of merchant services in net TPV (as compared to on-eBay net TPV). Merchant services comprised for around 73% of overall net TPV during the nine months ended September 2014, as compared to 69% in a similar period a year ago. This means PayPal is less reliant on eBay for its business and could continue to grow at a strong pace, upon becoming an independent entity.Robust Long-Term Growth Opportunity In The Marketplaces Segment: The global business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce market is forecast to expand from $1,251 billion in 2013 to $2,357 billion by 2017, according to eMarketer. And sales in the North American market is expected to surge from $431 billion to $660 billion, during the same period. (Global B2C Ecommerce Sales to Hit $1.5 Trillion This Year Driven by Growth in Emerging Markets, eMarketer, February 3, 2014) We expect eBay to gain from this secular shift toward e-commerce in the worldwide retail market. We believe the current weakness in the marketplaces segment is a short-term trend. eBay has a tremendous economic moat in its business due to its network effect, which encompasses tens of millions of sellers and over 150 million active buyers. It also possesses huge cash reserves and strong brand recognition - hence, we expect growth to accelerate in the marketplaces segment during 2015. In addition, the high growth in the e-commerce market also will result in incremental demand for PayPal.Business Model Is Asset-light Leading To High Cash Flows And Margins: In contrast to Amazon's inventory-owned model, eBay has a marketplace business model, which facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers. This model is asset-light, requiring fewer investments on warehousing, distribution, delivery centers, etc., which allows the company higher margins and cash flows. eBay's trailing twelve-month free cash flow and operating income as a percentage of revenue stood at 26% and 20%, respectively. In stark comparison, the same metrics for Amazon were seen at 1.3% and 0.1%, respectively. Hence, even while eBay is currently facing challenges in its marketplaces segment, it's not hard to see which company is more successful when it comes to generating return for shareholders.Spin-Off Could Unlock Shareholder Value For Both Businesses: In a previous note, we had highlighted that the recent decision to spin off PayPal will unlock significant shareholder value. We believe the valuation of the two companies independently will be higher than as a whole. While PayPal has significantly benefited from its integration with eBay in 2002, the competitive landscape has now changed considerably in both the segments. The competition in the payments business will intensify with the recent launch of Apple Pay, and the spin-off will allow PayPal's management to more closely tackle these risks. In addition, the separation from eBay also could throw open the opportunity of PayPal partnering with other leading giants such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), etc.The resulting eBay also will benefit from this development as the opportunities and risks are much different in the e-commerce business. The recent cyber attack in May, which impacted eBay's sales drastically, raised questions related to management's ability to identify and mitigate these risks. Hence, post the spin-off, we expect eBay to more effectively deploy its resources in managing operations in the marketplaces segment.In the second part of this series (soon to be published), we stack up these drivers against the barriers in the company's business model. We'd highly encourage you to go through this second part as well.Our $67 price estimate, represents near-20% premium to the current market price.Disclosure: No positions."

In this article, we assess how eBay stacks up along Porter's Five Forces to analyze where it could gain or lose going forward.According to our analysis - a competitive rivalry within the industry, bargaining power of customers and the threat of new entrants are the three key forces which can pose a threat to eBay's business. eBay faces huge competition from both online and offline sources, which restricts pricing increases on its marketplace. Due to relatively low barriers to entry, new companies continue to crop up in the global e-commerce market, further intensifying the competition.

2643765,24491,2014-11-05T13:46:48-05:00,eBay has been reborn as a powerhouse Marketplaces operation and a leading online payments processor. The sell side remains beholden to the past.A split between legacy eBay and PayPal could open the door for an agreement with Apple Pay.The market drastically discounts eBay's operations.eBay trades at market multiples reserved for firms with mature expansion.,"News hit several weeks ago that eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) would separate its Marketplaces PayPal operations into two publicly-traded companies, a move we think is a good idea to unlock shareholder value. We've liked eBay for some time (see our October 2011 note: eBay Looks Like a Slam Dunk Investment), long before Carl Icahn brought attention to the massive mispricing in shares. As such, we agree with the rationale the company provided when it announced the intention to split on its company blog: Unlike Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Symantec (SYMC), and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), which either have announced a decision to split operations or have activist investors encouraging such a move, eBay is significantly underpriced. Under a scenario where eBay splits into two separate and distinct companies, the market will be forced to value each part of eBay individually (removing any 'conglomerate' discount). When this happens, the two separate companies should get a combined market capitalization far greater than that of eBay today.We estimate eBay's shares are worth north of $70 each on a sum-of-the-parts basis, implying material upside from current levels in the low $50s. Our valuation breakdown of the company is shown below.Image Source: Valuentum's 16-page reportStill, not everything is rosy at eBay. The company's third-quarter results came in slightly below consensus expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue expansion came in at 12% during the quarter thanks to a 27% increase in enabled commerce volume (ECV). Mobile ECV spiked an impressive 67% during the period, to $14 billion (~21% of the total). eBay Marketplaces gross merchandise volume (GMV) also performed well, growing 9% thanks to a 7% increase in the US and 11% on an international basis.These top-line growth rates are great, but earnings only nudged higher by a few percentage points in the period. We would have expected better operating leverage across the firm's business model given the robust pace of top-line growth. Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis increased 16.8% (faster than the 12% sales expansion). Gross margin fell to 68.1% from 68.6% in the year-ago period, while sales & marketing and product development spending also ramped up on a year-over-year basis. We applaud management's decision to keep investing in the business, but we'd still like to see a better pace of earnings expansion. eBay's outlook for the fourth quarter of 2014 also came in slightly lower than expected, albeit modestly.We're not making any changes to our fair value estimate of the e-commerce and payments giant. Current market malaise could cause the price-to-fair value convergence to take longer than expected, but nonetheless, we think holders of eBay's stock will be rewarded over the long haul.Aside from the valuation thesis, it's probable that PayPal, as a separate company, could become a take-out target by a suitor looking to make inroads into a payment platform. PayPal and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) did not see eye-to-eye with Apple Pay, but a PayPal spin-off could change everything. A fresh new team at a spun-off PayPal could be more amenable to doing business with Apple and vice-versa. In the game of business, relationships are everything, and this may be why talks of a split have accelerated at eBay. The firm can't afford to do without Apple, which sports a culture of continuous innovation and is a threat across all verticals of consumer technology.Of course we're not banking on a deal, but a transaction with any suitor would be icing on the ""eBay valuation thesis"" cake. The mobile payments space has a long way to go before maturation sets in, and PayPal will be faced with both opportunities and challenges. Breaking up is the right thing to do. In our view, eBay is flat-out a cheap stock."
2730605,77955,2014-12-04T09:45:27-05:00,"Since eBay's acquisition of PayPal back in 2001, it has grown at an impressive pace and has not been showing signs of stopping.By enacting the right initiatives at the right time, PayPal has positioned itself to capitalize on the upcoming opportunities in the market.Splitting off PayPal from eBay would help to maximize shareholders' value. I believe that PayPal has a better future as an independent.","At the end of September 2014, eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) management announced it would operate eBay's e-retailing business and PayPal business segment separately. Most of the analysts and investors following eBay were already of the opinion that PayPal could operate better on its own.Over the years, PayPal has gained significant market share. The company has approximately 152 million registered accounts, strong ties with 15,000 financial institutions, and provides a localized payment experience by accepting payments in 26 different currencies. I think that its presence in 203 countries has allowed PayPal to successfully position itself as the largest and most trusted digital payment service on the back of its mass merchant acceptance, higher security -- contrary to revealing clients' personal information on a third-party platform -- and speedy completion of transactions via just a few clicks.In this article, I will analyze how PayPal can improve itself after separating from eBay.PayPal's Performance in the Recently Reported QuarterDuring the third quarter of the fiscal year 2014, eBay's payment business generated revenues of $1950 million, reflecting an increase of 20.4% YOY. During the same period, PayPal's total number of active users reached 156.9 million, reflecting an increase of 3% from the previous quarter and 14% YOY. The total number of payments processed was 894.6 million, reflecting an increase of 5% from the previous quarter and 23% YOY. Total payments volume in dollar terms were $56,576, representing an increase of 3% from the previous quarter and 29% YOY. The average takeaway rate (commission percentage on transactions) was 3.45%, reflecting a decline of 2.27%.Opportunities in the MarketplaceSource: emarketer.According to the research conducted by emarketer, business to consumer sales is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.4% and is expected to reach $2.357 trillion by 2017. As increasing numbers of people will shop online, online payment processors will be among the direct beneficiaries of this changing consumer shopping pattern. PayPal's management will be in a better position to concentrate on refining its technology, adding new features, and taking steps to further penetrate the international and domestic markets.The prospect of digital wallets is quite encouraging. The usage of digital wallets is growing as more and more consumers use their digital wallets to purchase almost everything in the developed word. According to a survey conducted by Statista, 35% of the respondents use digital wallets to purchase coffee, drinks, and snacks followed by retail apparels, groceries, and books.Source: Statista.Due to the global reach and inimitable payment experience for users, it seems as if any large market player would welcome an alliance with PayPal -- as can be seen in the case of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Soon after the management's announcement of eBay's split in 2015, Joseph Tsai -- vice chairman of the largest Chinese e-retailer, Alibaba -- intimated that they could partner with PayPal to expand their international operations. Therefore, it is safe to assume that there is a high probability that most of the companies trying to expand their businesses online will select PayPal as their digital payment processor because of its geographically widespread network, and the level of trust online shoppers place on the security and safety provided by PayPal.Statista predicts global mobile phone transactions will increase by an enormous rate. According to their research, mobile phone payments will reach $721.4 billion in 2017, increasing at a CAGR of 180.5%. Therefore, there is substantial potential in the market on which PayPal can capitalize.Source: Statista.The company is actively investing in refining existing features and adding new features to PayPal's iOS and Android applications, thus facilitating the user's ability to check in and pay at thousands of retail outlets in the domestic and international markets. Through the acquisition of Braintree and its one-touch mobile payment experience, enabling easy checkouts, PayPal continues to strengthen its position in the mobile payment processing market. During its most recent quarter, 20% of the total transactions processed were mobile payments.Moreover, another confirmation of PayPal's leading position is the result of a survey conducted by Thrive Analytics. The survey shows that 79% of the total respondents in the U.S. used PayPal to make payments through their mobile phones for online purchases, followed by Google Wallet, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), and Apple Passbook.Source: Statista.The company expects to entertain 1 billion mobile transactions in 2014, and it is safe to assume that in the coming periods this number will increase further due to the high penetration rate of smartphones, the increase in average time spent by users accessing the Internet through smartphones, the increasing number of online purchases, and the growing usage of handheld devices to settle payments.On the other hand, PayPal also faces the challenge of meeting the regulatory requirements in different parts of the world. Thus, it has to invest and update its transaction processing system to ensure financial security is not compromised.ConclusionThe increasing popularity of online purchases and growing usage of digital wallets to settle transactions is quite alluring, and there will be significant opportunities for companies processing digital transactions. PayPal is already prepared to capitalize on these developing trends and increase its market share on all fronts. Once PayPal becomes independent, it can form alliances with various other large companies like Alibaba, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and others to grow mutually.Currently, the stock price of eBay is depressed. The dip in the stock price provides an attractive entry point for both short-term gain seekers and those investors looking for long-term value. Short-term gains can be realized by selling off eBay stock during the anticipated price hike at the time of the split announcement, while holding both the companies following the split will provide an opportunity to enjoy capital gains on the account of a better-performing PayPal and eBay."

Gross revenue increased only 11.8% year over year, which missed most analyst estimates. Earnings per share of $0.68 were also reported, which was slightly better than analyst expectations, but largely a function of cost control rather than top line acceleration. From a segment perspective, eBay's marketplaces segment only grew gross merchandise volume by 9.3% year over year. PayPal's revenue result was fairly strong, with total payment volume growth of 29.1% year over year.It must be said that eBay's marketplace result was a fairly poor one, and must be a concern for the company with PayPal due to exist as an independent entity in 2015. With increasing competition in online commerce likely from Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), and with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) both making aggressive moves into social commerce, eBay's marketplaces division looks set to become more and more marginalized and become an increasingly niche player for unique collectibles, memorabilia and used goods.PayPal's strong revenue growth further supports my thesis that the unit will remain an important player in online payments for some time to come, and will likely prove an attractive asset once the company achieves independence from eBay. PayPal revenue growth of 20% suggests remote payments remains a growth market and as the incumbent, PayPal remains well poised to capitalize on that. Also encouraging for PayPal is that it is showing good progress in becoming a mobile first company, with close to 20% of payment volume now coming from mobile payments. This will be important if PayPal is to play a significant role in supporting social commerce, which is likely to be a major growth area.eBay's poor marketplaces result and decelerating growth suggests that giving PayPal independence was in fact the right move. Holding PayPal captive to eBay would have meant PayPal would have been beholden to a marketplaces platform that seems to be in decline. PayPal will be well served looking for alliances with other major players now such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook. I remain optimistic for the prospects for an independent PayPal based on the latest earnings result."

One can't turn on CNBC for a few minutes without hearing one of the news anchors discussing Apple Pay and how it will crush Paypal in a matter of months. What I realize more and more each day is that the news media frequently obsesses over things that make little to no sense. Let me start with an example. I just read this article a few days back that discussed the impending demise of cable companies due to the ""cord-cutting"" phenomenon that is sweeping the nation. Cord-cutting is another topic that seems to fascinate CNBC these days. The article mentions cable companies' net loss of a whopping 105,000 customers in the previous year. What they fail to mention is that a loss of 105,000 (out of a total of 50 million cable customers in the U.S.) is a loss of 0.2%. To put it more simply, cord-cutting isn't the epidemic the media claims it to be. To take it a step further, companies like Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR) have almost no direct competition from major broadband companies like AT&T due to the location of a vast majority of their subscribers being in a market that AT&T doesn't plan to enter for a variety of reasons.Turning our attention to eBay/Paypal, there's an interesting tidbit the media fails to report on, either due to ignorance or their preference for a great story. Here's what they fail to mention: Apple Pay is a completely different product than Paypal, and targets a completely different market. Apple Pay is an offline mobile POS system, and that type of transaction makes up a massive 1.5-2.0% of Paypal's business. So perhaps the sky isn't falling and Paypal will be ok? Another interesting thing they fail to mention is that several other major companies with very deep pockets have tried to compete with Paypal and failed miserably. Just the other day Google (GOOG,GOOGL) Wallet decided to ""pull the plug"" on digital purchases and it was the last in a long line of companies that had previously attempted to compete with Paypal. Keeping that in mind, let's take a look at the upcoming EBAY spin-off of the Paypal subsidiary and see if it may be a compelling investment opportunity.Spin-Offs - A Key to Unlock Shareholder Value""The Facts are overwhelming. Stocks of spinoff companies and even shares of the parent companies that do the spinning off, significantly and consistently outperform the market averages.""- Joel Greenblatt, Gotham CapitalA Penn State research study showed that over a 25 year period stocks of spin-off companies outperformed their industry peers and the S&P 500 by about 10% per year in their first three years of independence. The parent companies also did well, outperforming companies in their industry by more than 6% annually over the same period. In addition, there have been several studies done subsequent to the Penn State study that reported similar results.And if the academic research isn't proof enough, consider the Guggenheim spin-off exchange-traded fund (NYSEARCA:CSD). It has gained approximately 224.7% over the last five years, compared to 106.2% for the S&P 500 (see chart below). Over this time period the ETF's assets have increased from $7 million to $834 million.Another Spin-Off Example: Warren Buffett's ""Greatest Mistake""Let's look at one more example of a recent spin-off - the May 1, 2012 ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) spin-off of Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX). I love this example for the simple fact that of about a hundred news stories calling ConocoPhillips ""Buffett's greatest mistake"" and comparing his purchase price of COP to today's present stock price, none that I have found bothered to report that a massive chunk of the business was spun-off in 2012, so their comparisons make absolutely no sense. In any case, on May 1, 2012 shareholders of COP each received 0.5 shares of PSX for each COP share they held. Let's look at how the two companies have fared since the spin-off transaction in May 2012:As you can see, PSX shares have returned a massive 129% compared to 46.16% for the S&P 500 and 30.24% for COP. In total, your combined shares (1 share COP; 0.5 PSX) would've returned roughly 94%; and that's not including any dividends.eBay and Paypal: The Great Divorce""While eBay's sales growth may appear underwhelming when compared to Amazon or Alibaba, the company is growing sales 2-3x faster than the Home Shopping Network (which trades at 10x 2015E EBITDA) and Wal-Mart (which trades at 8x 2015E EBITDA) and enjoys a much more attractive margin and free cash flow profile.""-- Dan Loeb, Third Point LLC; Q3 2014 Letter to Investors""We envision this process ending up like most divorces - one party has a lifetime of shopping (eBay marketplace) and the other a lifetime of payments (Paypal).""-- Larry Robbins, Glenview Capital; 2014 Invest for Kids ConferenceAs you'll see in the chart below, eBay shares were driven up to ~$60 per share earlier in the year on anticipation that a spin-off would be announced. When this didn't take place, many interested in the merger arbitrage opportunity left, and the stock hasn't fully recovered yet, despite the merger being formally announced weeks ago.Source: Yahoo FinanceHere is a great picture of the combined entities' growth:Source: eBay shareholder presentationAnd one additional graphic showing compelling attributes of the separate companies:Source: eBay shareholder presentationAs the graphics above demonstrate, these are two extremely profitable entities that benefit from one of the significant drivers of a competitive advantage or ""moat"" - the network effect. Basically as more people use a product/service, it becomes more valuable. The network effect is a moat source for companies like American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Visa (NYSE:V) or MasterCard (NYSE:MA) as well.While some complain that the marketplace business is growing at a much slower rate - 10% per year revenue growth - when compared to a company like Amazon, I believe this isn't a fair comparison. As several prominent investors have already stated, a more accurate comparison would be a retail auction house, and the average retail auction house grows at roughly 5% per year; which is half the growth rate of eBay. In addition, both marketplace and Paypal are extremely profitable, and as I described in my previous article on IBM, profitability is the one business attribute that a) persists and b) is predictable into the future.The market is currently valuing Paypal at roughly 11.5x-14.5x 2015 EPS (assuming an 8-9x EBITDA multiple for eBay) and as Dan Loeb put it, this ""Seems to cheap for a company growing sales 20% with significant strategic optionality and a strong chance to shape the future of payments.""The combined company is still trading at $55; a 14.5% discount to Morningstar's estimate of intrinsic value -- $63 per share. Having said that, I believe the separated companies will be worth far more than $55 per share. To summarize, this is a rare opportunity to buy into a very profitable spin-off transaction at roughly half the intrinsic value of the two separate entities."

With growth rates of 11% and 9% in the first two quarters of the year, the company had been performing fairly well until the third quarter of the year 2014 during which earnings fell by 6%. The two primary reasons behind this decrease in earnings were a recent security breach that caused traffic on the company's website to decline and due to the fact that major changes were made to the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) algorithm by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Let's take a look at these two factors that have affected eBay's earnings in detail, see what damage they have caused to the company and what measures, if any, the company is taking in order to deal with these adverse affects.A few months ago, eBay became the victim of a huge cyber attack which resulted in the company's database and passwords to be compromised. The even more troublesome fact is that despite the fact that the database was compromised sometime during February and March, the breach was not detected until May. That eventually led to concerns among users as a result of which the company saw a major decline in the amount of traffic it gets.To make matters worse, Google's new algorithm update, Panda 4.0, led to massive losses of organic traffic for eBay. This further added to decreased traffic on the website and the third quarter financial performance of the company revealed exactly what the impact of this update was.Despite the fact that the company did report a positive growth rate of 6% in the third quarter of 2014, this growth rate was significantly slower than that of the previous two quarters of 2014. Due to the decrease in traffic, the company had to incur higher marketing expenses as a result of which the company's operating expenses increased and the company's operating margin fell to 17.9% by 260 basis points. The company was initially expecting to earn annual revenues ranging between $18-$18.3 billion. However, after these events took place, the company lowered its expected revenue range to $17.85-$17.95 billion. The company's expected revenue for the final quarter for 2014 is $5 billion which is less than the average analyst estimate of $5.2 billion. These lowered expectations can be troublesome for investors as this means that the company might not be able to remain attractive for investors in times to come.The company's marketplaces segment also failed to perform as expected primarily due to the security breach. Since eBay asked all its users to change their passwords, the overall buying activity slowed down thus leading to a decline in the performance of the marketplaces segment. For eBay to be able to completely overcome the issues caused by the security breach, the company will have to incur additional expenses. As a result of this, the short term does not look too bright for the company's investors.However, there is still hope for the company to recover from the losses that it has been facing primarily due to strong potential in its PayPal segment. The company's payments segment grew by 20% in the quarter as a result of which it can be expected that the segment will continue growing in the near and distant future. During the third quarter of 2014, the revenue generated from the Paypal increased to $2 billion as a result of 4.4 million new active registered accounts. It is also worth mentioning that PayPal enjoys a strong brand image in the world of mobile payments. Since the mobile payment segment also is increasing for eBay, PayPal will continue to be a beneficial source for eBay. The company's mobile payments increased by around 72% during the quarter and led to about 20% of the company's total payment volume.However, eBay has other plans for PayPalAt the end of September, eBay announced that it will be letting go of the PayPal segment that the company purchased for a total of $1.5 billion around 12 years ago. This split will result in both eBay and PayPal becoming separately traded companies. eBay's shareholders seem to be very happy about this decision and the company's shares have gone up by almost 8% since this was announced.According to the company, both eBay and PayPal will be able to benefit from this decision since the industry landscape is rapidly changing as a result of which both businesses faces a different set of opportunities and threats that need to be dealt with in different ways. The company also will no longer have to hand over the cash it generates to PayPal after this spinoff. eBay will be able to focus on its own strengths and weaknesses as a result of which it will be able to improve its overall financial performance and grow further.What does this mean for eBay's investors?eBay's investors have obviously been concerned with the company's performance lately as its financial position has deteriorated significantly in the third quarter of 2014. The issue caused by the security breach is not likely to be resolved in a short time and will take up a few quarters before it is completely overcome. Furthermore, the company will definitely have to incur higher marketing and promotional costs in order for it to be able to regain its position in the market. As a result of this, investors will probably not be able to get the returns that they expect. eBay also has to ensure that it manages to update its website according to the specifications of the new Google SEO algorithm update if it wants to increase the traffic it gets. However, the company's payments segment is what can still help the company survive through this time of difficulty. In the long run, the company has the potential to improve its growth rates and earnings. In the short run, however, the situation is not too bright for the company."

(NASDAQ:EBAY) haven't been getting much love lately. Since the start of 2014 they have delivered investors a return of -11%, and their most recent earnings report sent the stock down over 7% on October 16th. Though it has since rebounded some, eBay is clearly worrying investors with what appears to be slowing growth and lower margins. While revenue was up a solid 12% compared to 2013's Q3, GAAP EPS increased only 2%. GAAP operating margins fell to 17.9% from 20.5% a year ago. Even when considering the Non-GAAP numbers, EPS doesn't look especially promising, rising only 6% compared to growth of 11% in Q1 and 9% in Q2 of this year. In addition, eBay received several price target cuts and a downgrade from RBC Capital's Mark Mahaney, who insists that investors will be in a ""wait-and-see mode until 2015's 2nd half."" So what is behind this slowing EPS growth, and why on God's green earth am I recommending such an investment?What eBay Does:For those who don't know what eBay is I suggest 1) getting out from under the rock they happen to be living under, and 2) reading the 10K. eBay originally started as a marketplace for buyers and sellers to transact. On these transactions, eBay charges sellers a fee (a percentage of each sale, as well as a fixed fee depending on what item is sold). Since then, the company has grown to be much more. While Marketplaces is still responsible for almost half of the company's revenue, its Payments division accounts for a similar amount. In 2002 eBay acquired PayPal for a total of $1.5B. For comparison, today PayPal is estimated to be worth around $40B as a standalone company (although, to be sure, this number varies depending on which analyst you ask). PayPal, which processed $180B worth of transactions in 2013, makes money by taking a cut of any cash that flows through its payments network. Its rate schedule is shown below.While eBay's Marketplaces segment is no slouch and continues to grow steadily, PayPal is by far the most promising part of eBay's business. According to research by Gartner, mobile payments are expected to reach $720B in 2017, and even then this number will have a long way to grow, given that the world made $15 Trillion worth of retail transactions in 2013. In addition, due to activist pressure from Carl Icahn, eBay announced recently that it would be spinning off PayPal as a separate entity. Many investors, including co-founder Elon Musk, have praised this move, saying it doesn't make much sense to have a payments system be part of an online auction company. While Management had previously disagreed with a spinoff proposition because they viewed the two segments as synergistic, they have since embraced the idea.With PayPal's growth profile, I expect investors to attribute a premium to this segment, which should unlock substantial value for current shareholders. Just as a quick exercise for what valuation PayPal could fetch in the market, consider for a moment its TTM operating income of $1.83B (calculated by adding operating income from the first 9 months of 2014 to Op. Income from the last 3 months of 2013). If we apply a 35% tax rate to this and assume it can grow at 15%/year over the next 5 years (it's currently growing at 20%), then we have a business doing about $2.4B in net income by 2020. Apply a multiple of 25 (which Visa and MasterCard are being assigned, despite growth at half the rate of PayPal) and we arrive at $60B, which is the roughly the market cap of eBay now. In other words, even assuming no growth in Marketplaces or eBay's other various businesses, and no additional cash added to the balance sheet, the Payments division will likely justify the entire market capitalization of the company in a few years time.Despite PayPal being a fantastic business, one thing that concerns me is the decline in take rates over the past few years. In the 3rd quarter of 2013, PayPal's take rate was 3.7%, and this quarter it moved down to 3.45%. While this decline is gradual and taking place in small steps, it is symptomatic of the competition emerging in the online payments space. To continue to attract new customers, and hold on to existing ones, PayPal has had to make concessions in the fees it charges.eBay's last division is its Enterprises segment, which provides a variety of e-commerce and marketing solutions to businesses (mostly retailers), including fulfillment, fraud management, inventory management, and payments processing. The bulk of this segment comes from eBay's 2011 acquisition of GSI Commerce for $2.4B, which was done to help it compete with Amazon. Oftentimes, people save the best for last. Not so with eBay's various segments. Enterprise is a bit of a wildcard, bringing in around $1B in revenue, with little operating profit. It's not where I think the bulk of eBay's value lies, although I allow for the possibility of it surprising investors in the years to come.The Past:Before I go into eBay's current state, a little history lesson is in order. I sometimes find that investors ignore the long-term profitability of a company simply due to recent, short-term problems (recency bias and all that). To help combat this, I've provided a chart of some of eBay's key operating metrics over the last 14 years (all numbers on a TTM basis).Source - YchartsNot quite what you expected from stodgy old eBay, right? Revenue went from around $3.27 Billion at the end of 2004 to $17.51B today, for a CAGR of 18.2%. If you want to look at more recent numbers, Revenue of $8.72B in 2009 grew 15% annually up to today. If we look at Cash flow from operations, a good proxy for profitability, we see it increased from $1.29B in 2004 to $5.75B today (a 16% CAGR), and over the last five years climbed 14.6% annually. Free Cash Flow growth rates are similar. It should be noted that Y-Chart's numbers inevitably include both stock based compensation added back, and changes from working capital, which typically aren't permanent sources of cash. However, working capital changes have historically not been a great boon to eBay's CFO, and when examining growth rates over large stretches of time they tend to even out. Stock based compensation will be subtracted in the analysis of free cash flow to come.One of the most important data points to examine from a historical analysis of eBay's operations is the impact of the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession on the company. Looking at the company's 2010 10K (for the year ended Dec. 31st 2009), something immediately stands out to me - 2009 wasn't that bad of a year for eBay. Below is a summary of the company's income statement for the years 2007 - 2009.Despite going through one of the worst crises in U.S. history, eBay actually managed to increase revenue (primarily thanks to 14% growth in its payments division). This is especially impressive when you consider how much other, larger companies struggled with increasing sales during this period. Even Coca Cola saw their sales fall in 2009 (and who really cares about spending an extra $1 on soda, even in recessions?). As for the Net Income number, I wish it was reliable, as it would imply earnings growth of ~34% from 2008. Alas, it is the result of a $1.4B gain on the company's sale of Skype. Their actual net income, when adjusted for this gain and an associated $343.2M one-off legal settlement with Joltid (the company who eBay originally bought Skype from) is much more modest. My rough calculation of eBay's adjusted 2009 net income number is as follows:Adj. Net Income = [Income / (1-tax rate) + Legal Fees - Gain on Skype] x (1-tax rate)[2,389,097 / (1-17%) + 343,199 - 1,449,80] x (1-17%) = 1,503,507Not so great anymore, is it? GAAP giveth, and I taketh away. This adjusted 2009 net income number represents a 15% drop from 2008, and should rightly give investors some concern. However, let us also look at the company's cash flow numbers to get a more accurate idea of the business's cash-generating abilities.Below is a table of eBay's cash flow from operations, with changes in working capital, as well as the add-back of stock-based compensation (SBC), removed. I remove these because 1) SBC is a real expense, and 2) I wish to focus only on the company's major year-over-year changes, and not whether they happened to be borrowing $100M more this year, or paying back $20M etc… I should add that with SBC and changes in working capital added back, eBay's 2009 operating cash flow as presented in their 10K is higher than that of 2008, so I believe I'm being conservative. All numbers taken from eBay's 2010 10K.You'll see that I also added in one other detail - Foreign Currency Movements. In the 2010 annual filing, management mentioned that ""operating income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of $179.3 million, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year."" As a result, I took this 179.3M and multiplied by (1-tax rate) to get approx. $149M, which you can think of as additional income the company might have received. While I didn't add this $149M back to my net income number calculated previously, (if I did it would have looked even better), for cash flows I wanted to normalize currency conditions. After all, due to fluctuations in the value of the dollar in 2009 a lot of companies were reporting lower operating income than they might have in a more ""normal"" currency environment. When we do all of this, we see that Cash flow from operations only fell a little over 7% in 2009, not too shabby for a potential end-of-the-world scenario.While some might take issue with these calculations (and by all means, feel free to), I merely view them as a way to understand how eBay's business holds up under adverse business conditions. If 2009 is the worst we will see for many years to come, investors can be confident that eBay's earnings won't fall off a cliff, even if recessionary conditions materialize.The Present:With the past firmly established, I wanted to look at eBay's present state. After all, it's an all too common cliche in investing that past performance doesn't guarantee future results. As I mentioned in the introduction, this past quarter was not the best for eBay. Revenue growth of 12% fell short of expectations, and margins took a turn for the worse. Taking a look at filings released by the company, however, I would suggest eBay's current struggles are largely self-inflicted and likely to be temporary. In their most recent quarterly earnings presentation, eBay management details the main drivers behind their lower EPS. The culprit? Predominately higher operating expenses as the company increases spending on sales & marketing and product development. Together, these two categories account for a 2.1% decrease in the company's operating margin from Q3 2013 (see exhibit below).Click for SourceThe most obvious question for an investor hoping to assess eBay's ""normalized"" earnings power is, is this higher spending permanent or a temporary hiccup? If it is permanent, investors need to account for this in their estimation of the company's earnings. If not, it can be considered a ""one-off"" of sorts, and removed for future analysis. Without making too many assumptions, I think this increased spending is mostly temporary, as the company tries to counter the effects the recent PayPal hacking scandal had on their reputation. Management suggests as much in their Q3 conference call saying:""Let me provide a little more color on operating expenses which were 45% of revenue in the quarter, up 270 basis points. The biggest driver was sales and marketing which was up 180 basis points. The incremental spend was to dig our way out of the cyber attack and SEO changes impacting us in the second quarter. And we also increased our sales and marketing expense at PayPal to drive comprehension and usage by our customers"" - Bob Swan, CFOI always try and take Management's comments with a grain of salt. After all, no CEO or CFO in his right mind would come out and advertise that their business is going down the toilet. However, the reasoning behind these increases in spend seems more than logical. Further, while margins have been under pressure, I still see eBay as having a relatively dominant position in online marketplaces and payments. The value of network effects is hard to overestimate in this case, as buyers look to go where the most sellers are, and vice versa. This creates a ""chicken and egg"" problem of sorts, for what merchants are going to participate in a marketplace without buyers? On the other hand, what buyers would engage in a market without an abundance of sellers? This is an issue smaller companies will have trouble overcoming in a short span of time, or without considerable investments.With this in mind, eBay's quarter, while slower than usual, wasn't as bad as the market suggested when it sent their stock plummeting almost 7% after earnings. Revenue growth of 12% is still extremely robust for a company of this size, and once the memory of the cyber attack has faded from consumers' minds, I would expect management to trim spending to normalized levels and for activity in Marketplaces and PayPal to pick up again.Valuation:So what is eBay worth to an investor? For this exercise I wanted to assign the company's free cash flow a range of multiples and see where the stock should trade in a year or so. While not usually a short-term oriented investor, I pick a time frame of a year because one year from now eBay plans on spinning off PayPal, which should act as a catalyst to unlock value.FCF = Net income + Non-Cash Charges - Changes in Working Capital - CapexTaking an average of eBay's operating margin over the last 5 years (trailing twelve months were used to account for this past year) gives us 20.8%. If we assume eBay can hit analyst's average revenue estimate of $20.15B at the end of 2015, and keep their margins in-line with average experience, then the company should generate about $4.19B in operating income next year. While the company has been paying around an average 18% tax rate over the past few years, I don't think this is the right rate to apply, especially considering that the company announced it would be repatriating $9B in cash, and paying $3B in unpaid taxes on it. However, eBay still does derive some benefit from reinvesting cash overseas and deferring taxes for years. Because of this, and the fact that the company receives some tax credits for research, I thought it would be appropriate to apply a 30% tax rate, as opposed to the statutory 35%. When we do all of this we get an estimated $2.93B in Net Income for next year.Non-cash charges cause a lot of angst and fighting among analysts. I don't feel comfortable adding back stock-based compensation, but I do think adding back the company's provision for loan losses makes sense, since losses are accounted for in net income in the future. Below is the company's cash flow statement for the last nine months, taken from their 2014 3rd Quarter 10Q. eBay's loan loss provision totaled $685 million up to the 3rd quarter of this year. If I were to simply annualize this number for the whole year (divide by 9 ÷12 or .75), we would be looking at around $913M in cash added back for 2014. The fourth quarter is typically more active than the rest, however, so it likely could exceed $1B for all of 2014. For next year, I will simply assume this provision is $1B, although it is likely to be even larger given the growth in PayPal and PayPal Credit. As a last simplification, I assume working capital changes even out over the years and are not a substantial source or use of cash. In addition, I assume depreciation and maintenance capex are equal or will at least approach equality in the coming years.So what does our final free cash flow number look like?$2.93B Net Income + $1B Provision for transaction & loan losses = $3.93BIn other words, for fiscal 2015 eBay should generate close to $4B in FCF.What multiple is appropriate for this FCF number? Some authors like to look at past earnings multiples for a company and apply the highest as well as lowest ratios to get a range. While I think this is a viable method, I also think it tends to be too simple in that the earnings number used in the P/E ratio is often taken at face value and not adjusted for unusual events that may have happened that year. I like to think about multiples this way: if your annual required return is 9.5% (about the average of the S&P 500 over the past several decades) and you expect the company to grow 3% (basically at inflation, without any ability to raise prices), then the appropriate multiple would be [1 / (9.5% - 3%)] = 15.4. Thus I like to use 15.4 as a base multiple when doing analysis on companies. The caveat is that the company has to be able to grow at 3% forever, and so this is only a method to be used for businesses with defensible moats and good growth prospects. I think we would all agree that, given the growth profile of marketplaces and payments, eBay is likely able to grow by more than 3% for the foreseeable future. However, as a conservative exercise, let's use 15.4 as an FCF multiple for 2015. Our optimistic multiple will be 25, based on Visa and MasterCard's current earnings multiple, and the midpoint will be an average of the two [(15.4 + 25) / 2] = 20.2Before going into the final results for the FCF analysis, I calculated eBay's net cash balance from its most recent 10Q by taking the company's $15.1B in cash, cash equivalents, and non-equity investments (mostly corporate debt securities), and deducting for taxes that would be owed if it decided to repatriate cash held overseas. $10B of the company's cash is held overseas, and so, assuming a 35% tax rate, eBay would be left with $6.5B plus the $5.1B already in the U.S., for a total of $11.6B in cash. Subtract from this the company's $7.4B in long-term debt, and eBay has net cash of about $4.2B on its balance sheet.Balance sheet: Assets - 2014's 3rd Quarter 10QThe results of adding this cash to our calculated equity values are below. All numbers in billions, except percentages and multiples.Assumptions:I think this exhibit does a good job of illustrating the limited downside of investing in eBay. Even if eBay ends up being assigned a multiple that (in my opinion) enormously undervalues the company's growth prospects (3% is highly conservative), investors still wouldn't lose money. I'll be the first to say that I think it's unrealistic to expect eBay as a whole to be given a 25x FCF multiple. While the ""peers"" I chose, MasterCard and Visa, are growing revenues at similar rates to eBay, they are also growing EPS in a much steadier manner. However, I do think 20x FCF seems very realistic and achievable for eBay, which would represent upside of around 40% over the next year.Risks:While I like the company as an investment at this price, I also recognize the potential for errors and mistakes in my analysis. Most notably are the assumptions I've made for continued growth in the future. While I think I've been reasonable given the markets eBay competes in, additional competition could very well come in and disrupt eBay's business. Margins could remain depressed for longer than I anticipated. Some additional things I found troubling as an investor when looking at eBay included:ConclusionOverall, I think eBay represents a good business at a good price, offering the opportunity for 40% gains from its current market quote. The planned spinoff of PayPal in the 2nd half of 2015 makes for an appealing catalyst, as investors are forced to value the company by its parts rather than as a whole. Even allowing for reduced growth, as shown above, the Payments division is likely to be worth a sum very close to eBay's current market cap in the coming years and should be valued as such. In addition, unless the company's operating results deteriorate significantly over the next year, I think it will be extremely difficult for investors to lose money in this company. Lastly, I expect many of the problems faced this year to prove only temporary, leading to normalization of the company's margins and sales growth as it shakes off issues brought on by its recent hacking ""scandal."""

This is after investors have gotten used to double-digit sales growth.I like the business and PayPal in particular, as I don't find that current levels are providing me with a great entry opportunity, as uncertainty, competition and pressured take rates will weigh on sentiment and performance going forward.Third-Quarter HighlightseBay posted third-quarter revenues of $4.35 billion, which marks an 11.8% increase compared to last year. Analysts anticipated sales to increase to $4.37 billion.Reported earnings came in at $673 million, and were actually down by 2.3% compared to last year. Sizable share repurchases allowed for a modest increase in earnings on a per share basis, with reported earnings of $0.54 per share being up a penny compared to last year.Non-GAAP earnings of $0.68 per share came in a penny ahead of expectations.Growth Driven By PayPalOnce again, growth has been driven by PayPal, which is now the largest segment of the business.Payment revenues were up 19.4% compared to last year, at $1.78 billion. The company registered a 14% jump in the number of accounts, which rose to nearly 157 million as the number of transactions rose by 23% to, nearly 895 million. Payment volumes rose by 25% to $56.6 billion. Relative fees are under pressure, as the take rate of the company of 3.45% fell by 8 basis points compared to the previous quarter, and was down 25 basis points compared to last year.Marketplace revenues of $1.71 billion were up 6.1% on an annual basis. The number of active buyers rose by 13% to little more than 152 million, as gross merchandise volumes were up by 9% to $20.1 billion. Compared to the payment business, the take rate of this business is much greater, although growth in the market place business is rather slow.Fourth-Quarter OutlookFor the current final quarter of the year, eBay anticipates sales to come in between $4.85 and $4.95 billion. At the midpoint of the range, sales are seen up just 8.2% on an annual basis.GAAP earnings are seen at $0.73 to $0.76 per share, based on non-GAAP earnings of $0.88 to $0.91 per share. Last year, the company posted GAAP earnings of $0.65 per share.The guidance is quite soft, with especially the sales guidance being softer than anticipated. Sales are seen quite a bit below consensus estimates at $5.16 billion, while analysts anticipated non-GAAP earnings of $0.91 per share.ValuationeBay held a comfortable war chest of $10.4 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. The total debt load of $7.6 billion results in a net cash position of some $2.8 billion at the same time.Some of the increase in debt was used to finance share repurchases, as the company has shrunk the outstanding share base to 1.25 billion shares, which, at $48 per share, values equity in the business at around $60 billion, and operating assets at some $58 billion after subtracting the net cash holdings of the firm.Based on the full-year guidance, eBay anticipates sales of around $17.9 billion, with the company anticipating essentially a breakeven result on a GAAP basis, given the tax costs related to the repatriation of billions in foreign cash to be used for repurchases. Adjusting for these charges, earnings are seen around $3 billion.Consequently, the operating assets trade at 3.2 times and 19-20 times adjusted earnings.History Of Growth Driven By PayPalOver the past decade, eBay has more than five-folded its sales, from little over $3 billion in 2004 to nearly $18 billion seen this year. Earnings have only four-folded over this time period, being flattish in recent years. Comfortingly for investors, eBay has repurchased about a tenth of its share base over this time period, adding to growth on a per share basis.This stagnation has been reflected in the share price, with shares steadily increasing from levels of $10 in the crisis to trade in a $50-$60 range over the past two years. The long-term performance has been fine, although the recent underperformance over the past two years has been among the reasons why activist investors like Carl Icahn have been attracted to the business.The SplitOf course, the results are very important, but the main focus for investors going forward is the split of the company, with the merchant marketplace business and the payment unit PayPal anticipated to be split in two separate companies next year.After stressing the importance of having both units under one house, CEO John Donahoe noted that the importance of PayPal to the marketplace unit is decreasing. Many executives at the PayPal unit have already left the company given the lack of focus and standalone valuation, which also limits eBay to pay for performance in both stock and options tied to the performance of the PayPal unit.At the same time, other providers are rushing into the payments field after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched its payment initiative, and as Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) looks to introduce Alipay in the US as well.Final ThoughtsI am must say that I am quite unpleasantly surprised with the guidance in particular, as competition is intensifying and a lot of attention will be diverted away from operations in the coming months, with the company preparing to split itself up.As such, investors are rightfully cautious after the company is seeing slower growth, an exodus of talent at PayPal, new competitors and as it has been the victim of a password breach in May of this year.Back in July, I last had a look at the prospects following the second-quarter earnings release, as shares traded in the low fifties at the time. I concluded that shares traded around 20 times earnings, while the company had a strong balance sheet and reported healthy growth. Yet, I warned about competition, something which has clearly occurred ever since, and I warned about pressure on take rates as well.I continue to reiterate my stance that the company is attractive, driven by PayPal, but current levels don't offer a great entry point yet, given the uncertainty going forward, the competition and pressured take rates."
2566785,67313,2014-10-16T11:42:30-04:00,eBay's 3Q14 beat on EPS but missed on revenue.Marketplace continues to face competitive pressure while PayPal is being dragged by low margin units.Long-term competitive risk remains. Favor BABA over EBAY.,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported 3Q14 results. EPS of $0.68 beat by $0.01 while revenue fell short of consensus by $20m, coming in at $4.35b (+11.8% y/y). The bottom line beat was mainly a function of better than expected cost cutting while the top-line miss was in line with my prior expectation. Q4 guidance was weak with revenue of $4.85-4.95b and EPS of $0.88-0.91, which both are below consensus of $5.16b and $0.91, respectively, and highlights the competitive pressure that eBay faces in both of its businesses.It is evident from the Q3 results that both of eBay's businesses are facing competitive pressure and that additional capital is necessary for eBay to compete against Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in ecommerce space, and Google, Amazon and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in payments space. A near-term recovery for both businesses is difficult to gauge and there is no easy solution to the competitive challenges. Specifically, Marketplace continues to be impacted by Google's search engine changes, as well as competition from Amazon and the trend of offline retailers moving online. Marketplace revenue only grew +6% y/y, a sharp deceleration of +9% in Q2. GMV growth of +9% also decelerated from +12% last quarter.PayPal growth is holding up for now, but it is worth noting that low margin units are driving most of the growth. Payment revenue +20% y/y and volume +29% y/y. Active accounts grew by 4.4m to 157m and PayPal credit saw +29% growth. Mobile payment was also a positive highlight with payment volume +72% y/y and mobile volume +41% y/y. The biggest concern on the PayPal side is that the impact of Apple Pay could potentially be a negative to the stock after its spins off. In addition, the decelerating growth in Marketplace is also having an impact on PayPal.The conclusion is that eBay is facing unrelenting challenges on both of its businesses. Despite the near-term strength in PayPal, thanks to Braintree and the larger partners, low margin units will continue to be a drag for the segment. Long-term competitive risk remains with Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) looking to connect US shoppers and SMEs to the Chinese suppliers/consumers and planning to aggressively promote Alipay to rival PayPal in the future. I reiterate my bearish view of the stock and I recommend investors to buy into BABA, which trades a bit over 20x FY16E P/E and is the most attractively priced Chinese large cap in the US."
2566745,22775,2014-10-16T11:37:31-04:00,Marketplaces revenue growth continued to decelerate in Q3.And PayPal’s take rates fell 7% year-on-year.This report confirms our view that PayPal’s take rates and margins are not sustainable.We would continue to avoid the stock but would refrain from recommending a Short position due to eBay’s speculative appeal.,"eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) quarterly report failed to impress once again. While Q3 figures were roughly in line with expectations (very slight top-line miss, small EPS beat), the Q4 guidance was disappointing (revenue of $4.85-4.95bn and EPS of $0.88-0.91, below consensus of $5.16bn and $0.91). More importantly, some key metrics were worrying. We would notably highlight the soft revenue growth of Marketplaces, which decelerated to 6% from 9% in Q2 (a quarter that was already weak as it was affected by Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) algorithm changes and a security breach). Hence, high sales & marketing spending is likely to be sustained in coming quarters (in order to drive traffic growth) and to put continued pressure on operating margins. Another source of concern was PayPal. Admittedly, PayPal's Q3 revenue growth was healthy at 20%, in line with Q2, but its take rate fell 25bps year-on-year and 8bps quarter-on-quarter to 3.45% due to the rising weight of its mobile platform Braintree in the mix.Since our July article, we have been cautious on eBay's most valuable asset, PayPal, considering that PayPal's take rates and margins are not sustainable. This Q3 report clearly confirms our thoughts. And increasing competition in the online and mobile payments space is likely to put additional pressure on PayPal's earnings in coming quarters. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to launch Apple Pay very soon according to various sources, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are working on their own payment initiatives.We would continue to avoid the stock as the business fundamentals are worrying. But we would refrain from recommending a Short position, as speculation is likely to surface in a near future about eBay's two assets now that a split has been announced. Marketplaces could attract the attention of a large e-commerce peer such as Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) while PayPal could be a great addition for a tech giant such as Google or Facebook."
2570195,60151,2014-10-17T10:23:41-04:00,"eBay's recent quarterly report was buoyed by PayPal revenue growth being prodigious, but it still missed estimates. Moreover PayPal's take rate fell 7% y/y.This development has strengthened my bearish outlook on eBay.In my previous article, I opined that eBay would falter as competitors reduce margins for PayPal.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) recently reported Q3 earnings, and although EPS was slightly higher than estimates, revenue was well short of analyst projections. This revenue miss, coupled with disappointing guidance from management has led to EBAY slipping around 4%. The segment that prevented from an even larger miss was PayPal. Revenue jumped 19.4% y/y, and now it represents EBAY's largest business segment. Although that growth is compelling, especially on the heels of a break-up coming in 2015, I caution EBAY investors. By the time of the break-up, EBAY's savior, PayPal, will face acute competition that will stymie the segment, and lead to lower profits and ultimately less money fetched in the market for EBAY shareholders.With Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) all entering the payment industry, PayPal is set to suffer. Facebook has not officially announced plans, but recently discovered code, as well as the poaching of PayPal's CEO, David Marcus certainly leads one to conclude that direction. Furthermore, Apple Pay is set to be launched this week. Amazon also entered the fray by launching a service to allow customers to pay recurring charges by using their log-in credentials. The result of the glut of new competition will be a decrease in the rates charged for transactions. The quintessential drive to zero is set to disrupt this lucrative industry. With PayPal's take rate falling 7% y/y already, this trend is already playing out.In my previous article, ""The Dynamic Payment Industry - Will eBay Suffer?,"" I opined that the payment industry was poised to be commoditized. With the take rate in PayPal falling 7% already, without major competitors gaining traction yet, EBAY is certainly in a precarious situation. With its marketplace business faltering as well, supposedly due to a Google algorithm trend reducing traffic, I caution investors to stay away from EBAY."
2566505,39551,2014-10-16T10:44:41-04:00,"EBAY reported 3Q14 results in-line with expectations;Marketplaces continues to struggle with GMV decelerating again though PayPal was relatively strong;Despite of these near-term challenges, EBAY remains uniquely positioned as online and offline retail converge and as mobile becomes a key driver of disruption and innovation.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported 3Q14 results in-line with expectations. The company had affirmed its 3Q14 guidance just two weeks ago and results came in largely as expected. Total revenue of $4.35 billion came in at the mid-point of guidance range and was up 11.8% year over year. Adjusted EPS of $0.68 was slightly above the consensus estimates of $0.67. While the 3Q14 results were largely in-line, the 4Q14 guidance was disappointing. 4Q14 guidance contemplating $4.85-$4.95 billion in revenue and $0.88-$0.91 in EPS was below consensus estimates of $5.2 billion in revenue and $0.91 in EPS.Marketplaces Continues To StruggleEBAY plans to boost marketing spending in its Marketplaces division in the coming months, as a change in Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) algorithm has reduced traffic to Marketplaces. The division also continues to see pressure from the security breach earlier in the year, with users being asked to reset their passwords, and in some cases multiple times. While hard to quantify, it is a clear drag on the near-term results.Total Marketplace gross merchandise volume [GMV] grew 9.8% year over year in 3Q14 on a reported basis to $20 billion. Revenue growth at the segment fell to 6% vs. 12% in the same period a year ago. Lower growth rates for Marketplaces revenue imply that take rates decreased year over year, which can be attributed to recent daily deals and couponing initiatives, as well as follow-on impact from management's decision during 1Q14 to lower take rates for StubHub in order to protect the property's market share.Near-term Challenges, Long-term PotentialAs I have said in my previous article on eBay, the company faces several near-term challenges. The Marketplaces segment continues to struggle with GMV decelerating again though PayPal was relatively strong, and in-line with expectations. Quarterly results and soft guidance does not come as a surprise as expectations for both 3Q and 4Q were subdued heading into the earnings release. The market had already contemplated the weak earnings. The continued headwinds at the Marketplaces segment and increased investment in marketing at both Marketplaces and Payments caused management to lower 4Q14 guidance.The company is expected to continue to face margins pressure in the near-term, as it spends to rebuild the brand, instill trust in the product, and regain lost members. For PayPal, while margins were weaker in the quarter, total payment volume [TPV] growth has been consistent and strong (up 29%) and revenue has been steady (up 20%). Margins at PayPal are also expected to continue to be under pressure in the near-term as the company invests in future growth ahead of the separation.EBAY continues to face challenges in the near-term. Fundamentals are likely to take a back seat in the near-term, with the planned separation likely 9-12 months away. The practicalities of the proposed spin are also likely to saddle both companies with additional operating costs. On top of this, the company faces additional challenges to reignite growth with the headwinds imposed by the data breach and Panda. Admittedly, these headwinds are keeping some potential investors on the sidelines. While I continue to acknowledge these near-term challenges, there is value in the Marketplaces business and long-term growth at PayPal. EBAY remains uniquely positioned as online and offline retail converge and as mobile becomes a key driver of disruption and innovation.ConclusionNeither the 3Q14 results nor the disappointing 4Q14 guidance came in as a surprise. The disappointing results and the timing of the PayPal spin-off make the recent weakness in the stock understandable but I still believe there is value in the Marketplaces business and long-term growth at PayPal. Despite of these near-term challenges, EBAY remains uniquely positioned as online and offline retail converge and as mobile becomes a key driver of disruption and innovation. As we get into 2015, I believe the market will begin to more closely evaluate the upside from the split of Marketplaces and PayPal. EBAY shares are poised to have a strong 2015 as split nears, comps ease, and investors' concern about the potential risk to consensus earnings forecasts dissipate."
2565515,69675,2014-10-16T01:31:53-04:00,"Shares of eBay fell after reporting revenue that missed forecasts but profits that slightly beat expectations.This reaffirms my opinion that the company presents investors with some nice opportunities but implies that its future may not be as bright as I initially expected.In my previous work on the business, I did not anticipate strong or weak results but I did say that the business may be an attractive prospect.","Shares of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) declined by about 1% in after-hours trading after the e-commerce giant reported revenue and earnings for the third quarter of its 2014 fiscal year. According to its press release, revenue for the quarter hit $4.35 billion. Although this represents a 12% increase in sales over the $3.89 billion management reported during the third quarter of 2013, the company's top line fell short of the $4.37 billion analysts were hoping to see. Despite seeing strong growth in its Payments segment, revenue grew fairly slow in the business's Marketplaces and Enterprise segments.Where eBay missed on sales, it made up for on earnings. For the quarter, the e-commerce business reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68. On top of beating the $0.67 Mr. Market was hoping to see, the company's bottom line came in 6% above the $0.64 seen in last year's quarter. In addition to benefiting from strong sales, eBay also enjoyed positive earnings growth as a result of an almost 5% decline in share count year-over-year.In a previous article I wrote on the business, I highlighted how the company's long-term performance (after removing the positive impact of its Skype divestiture in 2009) has been pretty decent. Given this, combined with the fact that shares aren't ridiculously priced for an internet-based business, I determined that it may make for an interesting prospect for investors. While this most recent quarterly report indicates that sales growth could be slower for now, the earnings beat suggests that my thesis appears accurate."

This is a point of soreness for tech entrepreneurs who create new apps with the potential to improve the quality of the lives of their users, but fail to win adoption outside a small ring of enthusiasts.The would-be users aren't to blame for techies' problems. It's difficult to break existing patterns of behavior, even if change would clearly lead to a superior outcome. Much sleep has been lost struggling to push users to adapt new technologies which only offer marginal improvements over existing ones. One area where where there has been limited success in amassing adoption is mobile payment technologies, but that industry now appears to be on the brink of an inflection point.Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to launch this weekend and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) announced on September 30 that it will be spinning PayPal off into a separate business. In the fight to dominate mobile payments, the contenders are taking off their gloves.(Click here for chart source)Last quarter mobile advertising revenues from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) demonstrated that mobile connectivity is growing exponentially and has already reached a massively profitable scale. Now Apple Pay and PayPal are vying to capitalize on the mobile-internet ecosystem by trying to finally make mobile payments an everyday reality.Monday Peter Thiel, technologist and co-founder of PayPal, went on CNBC to discuss the timing behind eBay's decision to set PayPal free. Thiel pointed out that in 2002 when eBay acquired PayPal, 75% of all transactions on the website were going through PayPal anyway. It was an obvious target for vertical consolidation. By 2008 that number had dropped to 50%, and has dropped to roughly 25% today as eBay has shifted away from its online auction roots toward becoming more of a traditional e-commerce retailer. Thiel commented, ""Today the companies have naturally diverged, it makes sense for them to spin (PayPal) out again and for PayPal to focus 100% on building a good payments system.""PayPal and Apple Pay will both be gunning to control mobile payments, but they won't quite be bashing heads, at least initially. Apple Pay is going to start by focusing on enabling merchants to accept payments from consumers at point of sale terminals. There are probably plans in the cards to expand to peer-to-peer transfers later.Although PayPal also enables businesses to accept electronic payments, the company will probably take the opposite strategy and focus on the peer to peer transfers that made eBay a possibility in the first place.These aren't the only two companies going after mobile payments, but right now they appear to be the favorites. Ultimately mobile payments will only achieve the success that techies dream of if they provide a user experience that is vastly superior to what we already have, cash and credit cards. Frankly one touch payments look awesome, but it's unclear if mobile payments are enough of an upgrade from plastic to drive mass user adoption.In the case of long distance peer to peer transfers, a system like PayPal will be greatly superior to current payment methodologies like wire transfers as long as mobile payments are secure. In May eBay was hacked, compromising over 100 million accounts. It will be good for PayPal to distance itself from eBay as reputation and security are essential to building the necessary consumer confidence for driving adoption. Now that PayPal is being spun off, it can focus on improving its own brand.With local peer to peer transfers, don't be surprised if mobile payments continue to struggle. We've had platforms like PayPal, Square Cash and Venmo for quite some time. Even though we're all connected, excluding the behavior of tech enthusiasts cash is still the go-to vehicle for small transfers of value.We'll get our next look at the state of the industry when eBay reports earnings on Wednesday after the close. Last quarter PayPal added 4 million new users, bringing its total to 152.5 million. However, quarter over quarter the total number of payments was only up 2%, not exactly the exploding metrics that PayPal would like to see. This quarter contributing analysts on Estimize are expecting eBay to report lackluster earnings, falling right inline with Wall Street's expectations.

The Webcast can be accessed through the investor relations website (link to webcast). Consensus expects EPS of $0.67 (+4.7% y/y) on revenue of $4.4b (+12% y/y). The stock has underperformed the broader Nasdaq (-5.4% vs. Nasdaq +2.3%) as the market is concerned about eBay's competitiveness in both its Marketplace and PayPal unit.Source: YahooeBay's Marketplace is facing competitive pressure from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and the trend of offline retailers such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) that are gradually expanding online channels. It was evident from the Q2 result that the Marketplace business is suffering from a competitive squeeze, and investors wonder how Marketplace can 1) compete against AMZN and GOOG and 2) rebrand itself so that consumers will no longer see Marketplace as a place where auctioned/used items are sold. With organic revenue growing in the high single digits, and the change in GOOG's SERP, investors can expect further weakness on the Marketplace side this quarter.PayPal, on the other hand, could continue to see robust revenue growth driven most likely by Braintree and BML once again. While competitive pressure is not as severe as Marketplace, it is nonetheless emerging due to the introduction of Apple Pay and a potential resurgence of Google Wallet. The initial iPhone sales figure could encourage more merchants to sign up on the Apple Pay bandwagon, which could potentially be a negative to PayPal.The good news for PayPal is that I view Apple's ecosystem to be diminishing globally due to the rise of the Android ecosystem and low-end Android handsets, and I believe that PayPal could flourish as an Apple Pay alternative in markets outside of North America due to the lower iPhone penetration. However, the key is for PayPal to move fast before Apple starts to form partnerships in key markets such as China, Brazil, India and Europe.The recent breakup of Marketplace and PayPal is designed for each segment to pursue its own strategic plans but does not change the near-term fundamentals, namely long-term competitive pressure on eBay and medium-term growth for PayPal.Many have speculated that Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) will make a move to takeover eBay MarketPlace to gain a foothold in the US e-commerce market. While I do not question the eventual large-scale entry of BABA into the US, I do question the timing due to the fact that BABA knows very little about the e-commerce market. This should come as no surprise to the speculators since BABA never operated in the US or competes head-on against GOOG and AMZN in North America. Many of BABA's businesses in the US are designed for the company to get an understanding of the market dynamic. Until BABA is comfortable with competing head-on against GOOG and AMZN, we will not see an immediate takeover of eBay Marketplace by BABA. That said, I expect short interest to accumulate over the next year as fund flow shifts from eBay to the soon-to-be listed PayPal. I would underweight eBay in my portfolio, and switch to BABA, which is trading at 25x FY16 earnings. This valuation multiple makes it one of the cheapest Chinese internet large caps available."

For example, in Q2 2014, eBay marketplaces contributed about 50% of the company's total revenues, PayPal payment services contributed about 44% and enterprise services contributed about 6% (source: Q2 10-Q report).Source: eBay Q2 10-Q ReporteBay generates its revenues primarily from transaction amounts or gross merchandise volume (GMV) enabled on its marketplace websites (e.g. eBay.com) as well as from payment amounts or net total payment volume (TPV) enabled on its PayPal and related payment services. eBay earns its revenues by charging a take rate on the GMV and TPV, which is paid by the seller of the merchandise and/or the receiver of a money transfer. The company also earns revenues from marketing services. The most important factors that will drive eBay and PayPal's long-term growth are their GMV and TPV growth.eBay's Marketplace Business and Competitive MoatOver the past several quarters, eBay's stock greatly underperformed the market because the company's marketplace revenue growth has slowed to 6% in Q2 as opposed to double digit growth in the past. Moreover, a recent cyberattack on eBay and the Google SEO algorithm change had impacted eBay's GMV growth. In short, eBay's management is looking for ways to reinvigorate its eBay's marketplace business to achieve double digit growth.Despite eBay's short-term challenges, I believe that it will remain a strong marketplace business after PayPal spins off in 2015. The main reason is that eBay still has one of the best marketplace platforms on the web that allows buyers and sellers/merchants to buy and sell products in almost every country as well as across borders. Whether it is auction-based or fixed price sales, eBay should continue to attract more merchants to sell their products on its platforms (because of its large base of active buyers), which should lead to more buyers as well as GMV growth. Here is a historical look at eBay's active buyer growth:Source: StatistaAnother reason is that eBay's biggest competitive advantage (economic moat) is its cross-border trade, which allows sellers to sell their items (e.g. iPhone cases or almost any items) to buyers in different countries. In comparison, many products that are sold on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) U.S. are not available in other countries such as Canada. Hence, I believe that eBay will still be a leading marketplace platform (after the PayPal spin-off) a decade from now. Note that eBay's international market generates more revenues than the U.S. market. For example, in Q2 2014, 53% of the company's total revenues came from the international market (source: Q2 10-Q report).PayPal's Payment Business and Growth ProspectsSpinning off PayPal will likely unlock much greater value for PayPal because it is growing at a much faster pace than eBay's marketplace business. For example, in Q2 2014, PayPal's revenues increased 20% year-over-year (driven by merchant service growth and TPV) while eBay's marketplace revenues increased 6% year-over-year (source: eBay Q2 Conference Call).One important note is that PayPal is earning almost as much revenues as eBay's marketplace business (see image below). Since PayPal is growing at a faster pace, its revenues and operating income should eventually surpass eBay over the next three years after both companies are separated. If this becomes true and if eBay continues to achieve single digit revenue growth while PayPal maintains its double digit revenue growth, then PayPal's valuation should surpass eBay over the next three or more years.Source: eBay Q2 10-Q ReportIn terms of grow prospects, PayPal still has a lot of growth potential in both the online and offline (retail) payment markets. PayPal is the most popular digital wallet in the world with the largest market share. Recently, PayPal decided to partner with Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) to offer mobile payments in order to compete with the newly introduced Apple Pay. While I do not know whether PayPal will succeed in mobile payments, I believe that its primary business, online payment services, will continue to grow at a double digit rate over the next decade. This is because of the growing payment volume enabled by PayPal and the increasing number of merchants and buyers that are using PayPal (see image below).Source: StatistaeBay's Intrinsic ValuationI have estimated eBay's fair intrinsic value based the assumption that its trailing 12 months' free cash flows (operating cash flow minus capital expenditure) will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% over the next decade (see image below). In comparison, the company's free cash flows grew at a CAGR of 12.5% each year between fiscal 2009 to 2013. The discount rate is assumed to be 10%.Based on my estimate, eBay's current intrinsic value should be around $77 billion in market cap or $61 per share. In comparison, the stock is traded at $67.7 billion in market cap or $54.44 per share at the time of writing (Oct. 3 2014). This means that eBay is currently undervalued. If the company's revenues, net income and free cash flows continue to grow, its intrinsic value will also grow.Should you invest in eBay and PayPal?I believe that both eBay and PayPal are great companies for long-term investing and that both of their revenues and operating income should continue to grow over the next decade. Since PayPal is growing at a faster pace than eBay and it is earning almost as much revenues as eBay, PayPal could eventually surpass eBay in market cap.Regarding the spinoff, eBay shareholders will get PayPal shares when PayPal launches its IPO. eBay's share price should initially decrease by the same amount as the PayPal IPO valuation. And if the PayPal spinoff is successful, it would unlock the values of both companies over time, which means that their share prices should increase a lot if they continue to have good long-term prospects.If you want to invest in PayPal, one way is to invest in eBay and wait until PayPal's spinoff in the second half of 2015. Otherwise, you can invest in PayPal directly when it goes through an IPO. However, you may need to pay a large premium if PayPal's IPO becomes over subscribed.Sources: eBay's Q2 Conference Call, Q2 10-Q Report, 2013 Annual Report, Yahoo Finance, Morningstar, Statista and Intelligent Stocks.This article was originally published on Intelligent Stocks Blog on Oct. 4 2014."

PayPal is connected to 15,000 financial institutions around the world to encourage cross-border shopping. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) acquired the company in October of 2002 for $1.5 billion. This payment processing juggernaut is now worth $47 billion by itself. That's half of eBay's Enterprise value.PayPal is More Valuable AloneTo get an idea of how autonomous PayPal is without eBay:On the financial report, over the past 12 months, PayPal accounted for about 42% of eBay's total revenue and 36% of its sales. PayPal's revenue grew 20% last year, bringing in revenues that topped at $6.6 billion from 26 different currencies.Carl Icahn, an activist investor, tried to convince eBay to spin off PayPal because he believed that it was worth more by itself. PayPal has more than 152 million active users. They grew 15% year-over-year in the second quarter with revenues increasing from $5.8 billion to $7.3 billion in the last 12 months. Although it increased revenues, being a part of eBay has kept PayPal from growing as fast as other payment processors like Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA), which grew three times faster within five years. Therefore, it's no wonder that Icahn thinks eBay has slowed the growth of PayPal.As eBay sets to spin off PayPal next year, it is estimated that mobile payments will reach $485 billion (According to Forbes). The newly independent company will be able to devote itself solely to the business.Apple's Ecosystem is Not Big EnoughPayPal already has a global footprint that dwarfs Apple in comparison. The service is available in over 200 countries, whereas Apple's physical and online stores are in only 59 countries.According to Bank Innovators, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was ""mad"" about the deal that PayPal made with Samsung to include One Touch pay on the Galaxy S5. The idea of One Touch is that you will only have to enter your credit card information once, where it would be securely stored and recalled when needed. Sure, it rubbed Apple the wrong way. However, it wasn't the only reason Apple dropped PayPal as an Apple Pay partner. Credit card issuers requested Apple not to partner with PayPal, according to Bank Innovators.It would interest people as to why PayPal would only do a deal with Apple Pay that would be only exclusively with Apple. Here's why.Apple is losing market share in two of its biggest product areas - iPhone and iPad. Strategy Analytics reported that only 35 million units of the 295 million shipped in the 2nd quarter were Apple phones, while Android phones that are capable of using PayPal made up the rest.The new iPhones didn't make much of a dent into the Android market share in the U.S. This suggests that Apple has loyal customers that would like to stay in the Apple ecosystem.Android has 85% of the market share over Apple. According to Business Insider, Apple's market share in tablets has dropped a whopping 60% last year while Android grew 10%. It wouldn't make sense for PayPal to lock itself to an exclusive agreement on a platform that hardly anyone uses.Many people say that Apple phones are too expensive. They would rather buy a phone that's less expensive than the iPhone. Android also has features that are appealing to its large market.According to Business Insider, Android has some better features that you can't get with Apple. Here are a few features:1.) Longer and interchangeable battery2.) USB port and micro HDMI3.) Increased storage with cloud and SD4.) Room to customizePayPal is Good for Cross-Border Small BusinessesPayPal helps small business people like freelancers, eBay merchants and others that accept payments. The reason small businesses like PayPal is because it is easy to manage the business' inventory. Businesses can handle recurring payments and will give users quicker access to their money than a bank while allowing different avenues to spend and collect money through the use of PayPal. PayPal gives small businesses the convenience to accept credit cards in-person and offline. PayPal's invoicing is easy to use in order to help a business owner get paid faster.Small businesses that do business overseas and back at home know that PayPal's global footprint allows them to conduct transactions in different currencies.Apple is not an immediate threat. Apple Pay is anticipated to be a convenience, too, similar to PayPal. People who have PayPal and use iPhones will still be able to download an application to their devices. Hence, Apple needs to loosen its ecosystem to gain some market share from Android, but that seems unlikely. Meanwhile, PayPal is ready to grow in a significant way after the eBay spin-off. PayPal payment is already ahead with millions of active registered users and vast availability.Due to the spin-off, it may not be a prudent decision to buy eBay. PayPal is and will continue to be a growing business."
2546305,47631,2014-10-07T13:00:33-04:00,"E-commerce is a high-growing segment and mobile payments is at the heart of this online commerce system. Therefore, PayPal has a goldmine of opportunities ahead.Now separate PayPal users can expect to see credible changes in its payment ecosystem. The heat of competition will also ensure that PayPal continuously innovates.PayPal might lose the advantage of using eBay's data and structuring it in form of useful information to help merchants design a wonderful customer experience.While it has its ups, this spin-off carries risks that would impact PayPal's business. Therefore, investors need to be watchful of all the related events.","The e-commerce world is growing phenomenally with each passing day as the rapid expansion of internet in different parts of the world has sparked unparalleled interest in buying and selling goods online. As per Statista, the worldwide B2C commerce sales amounted to more than 1.2 trillion US dollars and is estimated to grow to almost double this number by 2018. One of the fastest growing components of this e-commerce boom is mobile commerce, as evidenced by the 38 billion dollar revenue achieved in the US alone, in the last year.In fact, the burgeoning world of mobile commerce and intense competition in e-commerce could have been a couple of reasons behind eBay's (EBAY) decision to finally spin-off its online payments business i.e PayPal. In the recent quarters, eBay's marketplaces unit has failed to maintain a strong momentum, and PayPal has been instrumental in getting strong growth to the company as a whole. PayPal's mobile payment volume has expanded from $4 billion in 2011 to more than $27 billion in 2013 owing to collaboration with high-profile retailers complemented by the surge in digital payments volume. Now, the pros and cons of this decision taken by eBay's management has been discussed in scores of articles across the web. Also, the threat to PayPal's business from tech giants like Apple (AAPL) and Facebook, who are reportedly working on developing their own digital payment services, has been extensively covered in these articles.Gauging the impactHowever, in this post, I intend to analyze the impact this spin-off will have on the users of PayPal service and how will it impact the operations of eBay and PayPal. As per the statements made by the current management team at eBay, the driving philosophy behind the spin-off has been to make both of these companies more competitive in their respective areas. It is known fact that eBay is facing intense competition from the likes of Amazon and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and the entry of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is just going to make matters worse. As a matter of fact, Alibaba's supersonic IPO has reinforced the fact that the company might become the undisputed leader in e-commerce for a long time period. This article on Forbes provides excellent and extensive coverage on war scenario that is going to occupy the e-commerce world with Alibaba's entry.Coming back to the split, it is therefore clear that the eBay is going to face intense competitive pressure in coming years. Similarly, PayPal also has a line of competitors who are coming up with innovative and sustainable payment solutions and threaten to hamper PayPal's strong topline. In Q2, PayPal observed a 33% y-o-y growth in merchant services TPV, and revenue was up 20% on an FX neutral basis. However, now that there are various payment options that can be utilized by small business owners and mid-scale merchants, PayPal has to offer some innovative features in order to retain customers. As such, this spin-off will allow the company to focus exclusively on innovating and creating a better payments system for its merchant customers without caring for the bureaucratic hurdles. Therefore, current PayPal users could see some pro-active and valuable changes in the payments ecosystem.No leverage on data?However, one big con that I believe will ensue for the operations of PayPal will be its inability to leverage the user data from eBay and extend useful information to merchants that could help them in redesigning their customer experience initiatives. One of the reasons that current eBay CEO Mr Donahoe mentioned in favor of keeping eBay and PayPal together was that the latter leverages user data gathered by the former, in order to enable the merchants to deepen their engagement with customers. In contrast, Apple will not have a hard time achieving data sharing and integration with its Apple Pay service.Apple's new payment system, tied to the iPhone 6, is supported by American Express (NYSE:AXP), Visa (NYSE:V), and MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and recognized by a number of merchants including Walgreen (WAG), Macy's (NYSE:M), and Target (NYSE:TGT). Assuming that Apple Pay performs as expected, in keeping with the fact that the Touch ID security feature goes well with the retailers, the tech giant can easily leverage user data from its digital properties like the iStore and provide credible information to these merchants.TakeawayThe idea that this spin-off will create two separate entities that will now have the necessary resources to fuel growth in their respective areas is praiseworthy. However, investors have to be cautious of the fact that once PayPal becomes an independent entity (estimated to be completed by 2015), it will have considerable difficulty on couple of fronts, which are data and funds. Conversely, eBay will have an opportunity to channelize its funds with renewed focus and in lucrative opportunities. In the end, my advice will be to remain overly-cautious with investment in these companies, and watch from side-lines until some concrete results are visible."
2559165,69675,2014-10-14T04:06:08-04:00,"With shares in the e-commerce giant trading near their 52-week low and with analysts expecting positive results, eBay may be an interesting prospect.
        In recent years, sales and profits of the e-commerce business have been on the rise, especially its profits if investors remove the proceeds from its sale of Skype.
        Add to this the fact that shares don't seem to be trading at too hefty of a multiple and it may be a mistake to discard it so easily.","With eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) due to report revenue and earnings for the third quarter of its 2014 fiscal year on Oct. 15, investors are likely kicking around what to do with the business's shares. Currently, eBay's stock is trading around its 52-week low, which indicates that there's potential for shares to go higher, but should investors opt to look elsewhere for gains instead of buying into its stock?Analysts have decent expectationsFor the quarter, analysts expect eBay to report revenue of $4.37 billion. In the event that this forecast comes to fruition, it will represent a nice 12% jump in revenue over the $3.89 billion management reported the same quarter a year earlier. Based on the e-commerce giant's historical data, the largest contributor to eBay's growth in revenue will likely be its soon-to-be spun-off Payments segment, followed by attractive growth in its Marketplaces and Enterprise segment.From a profit standpoint, the picture isn't quite as nice. If analysts are correct about the business, eBay's management team will likely report earnings per share of $0.67, which would represent a more modest 5% increase over the $0.64 the company reported the same quarter a year earlier. Despite benefiting from an increase in revenue, the e-commerce business's bottom line will probably be at least somewhat impacted by an increase in its cost or revenue year-over-year.But given its strong past, is there value moving forward?Over the past five years, eBay has posted some pretty mixed results. Between 2009 and 2013, the e-commerce business saw its revenue soar by 84% from $8.73 billion to $16.05 billion. Based on the data provided, most of the increase in sales was driven by a whopping 137% increase in revenue stemming from eBay's Payments segment, which saw revenue climb from $2.80 billion to $6.63 billion, while its Marketplaces segment saw its top line rise a more modest 56% from $5.31 billion to $8.28 billion. Some of this growth was negatively offset by the sale of Skype which, in 2009, brought in revenue of $620.4 million but which has since been replaced by eBay's Enterprise segment.EBAY Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsLooking at profits, the situation is a bit more challenging to decipher. While revenue has been on the rise at eBay, profits haven't been able to keep pace. Over the past five years, eBay's bottom line grew by just 20% from $2.39 billion to $2.86 billion (though it's worth mentioning that profits have been very volatile, as can be seen in the chart below). As revenue increased, so too did its cost of sales, which rose from 28.4% of revenue to 31.4%. However, investors should also be aware that some of this shortfall in profit growth is something of an illusion. In 2009 eBay's decision to sell Skype netted it ""other income"" of $1.4 billion. Without this, the company's bottom line would have come out to about $1.21 billion, which implies a five-year growth rate of 136%.EBAY Net Income (Annual) data by YChartsAnother nice thing about eBay is that shares in the business don't look to be terribly expensive. Based on 2013's earnings per share, the company is trading at a multiple of 18.6, while forward earnings have shares pegged at a 17 times multiple. Neither of these measures place the business in the bargain bin, but given the strong growth management has been able to achieve in recent years, it's hard to see shares getting materially cheaper anytime soon.TakeawayIn recent years, eBay has had a pretty nice run. This is especially true after considering that the company's profits have soared compared to sales if investors remove the positive impact of its divestiture of Skype in 2009. While this is not an indication that the future for the company will be equally as bright, the fact that analysts have reasonable expectations for the business should make it an attractive prospect for investors to consider."

2543305,64913,2014-10-06T13:06:33-04:00,A standalone PayPal could be a contrarian investment because it bucks industry trends.PayPal also could be a contrarian investment because some payment providers like Western Union are losing market share.PayPal could be a value investment because it has a moat and a potential to generate a lot of float.PayPal is speculative because it has a lot of potential for future growth.,"The big market news for the past week was eBay Inc.'s (NASDAQ:EBAY) decision to cut PayPal loose and let it become an independent, publicly-traded company. That of course raises a very interesting question for investors: what sort of stock would PayPal be - a contrarian play, a value investment or a speculative move?The most obvious description of a standalone PayPal would be as a contrarian investment. Spinning PayPal off goes against the prevailing trend of online giants expanding their payment offerings. Apple Inc. (OTC:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have launched new payment services in the last year, and Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is heavily promoting its Google Wallet.Operating a standalone company that concentrates on payment processing seems downright old-fashioned these days. Some payment solution providers are already struggling. The wire transfer service Western Union (NYSE:WU) has seen its revenues stagnate over the past couple of years. In June 2012, Western Union reported a TTM revenue of $5.66 billion; in June 2013, that figure fell to $5.558 billion; in June 2014, the figure rose to $5.87 billion.eBay reported that PayPal's annual revenue for 2013 was $6.6 billion, up 20% from 2012. PayPal's revenue for the second quarter of 2014 was $1.95 billion. So PayPal is growing and bucking industry trends.One reason for PayPal's growth is that it is stealing many of Western Union's customers. The payment solution signed up tens of thousands of new customers in Nigeria alone when it opened in that country in July. Around 25% of PayPal's business now comes from cross border trade.Many of those customers are people who are getting money wired in from relatives in other countries' Western Union offices. Now PayPal, which is easier to use, cheaper and more convenient than wiring money, is competing directly in that lucrative market. This business, which is sometimes called the remittance market, is huge - the World Bank estimated that immigrants send $404 billion a year back to their home countries. This too seems like a contrarian play because PayPal is going after markets that other online companies tend to ignore, such as developing nations.The Value ArgumentIt also points to a value argument for PayPal. After all, PayPal is not a sexy company. Its business of moving money around is rather bland. Yet PayPal is a good company that is very well run.It is also something of a bottom feeder going after groups that other financial services companies ignore, such as the unbanked and citizens of developing countries. These are potentially huge markets. There are 68 million adults in the U.S. with limited or no access to traditional banks, according to the US Postal Service, and 63 million Internet data subscribers in Nigeria, according to Reuters.Targeting such groups could widen PayPal's moat because other payment solutions have ignored them. PayPal already has a fairly wide moat - a classic value attribute - because it was the first widely accepted online payment solution. Being first gives it an advantage and a reputation.The problem with this argument is that the ease of taking advantage of new solutions makes customer retention difficult. It also opens the door to a high rate of churn or customer turnover, which can quickly breach a moat.Intriguingly, PayPal has another even greater value attribute - a lot of what Warren Buffett likes to call float. Float is a large cash flow or reserve the company can tap for expansion or other purposes. The float comes from the total value of transactions, which was $55 billion in the second quarter of 2014.Obviously, PayPal cannot touch all of that money, but it gives the provider a lot of potential revenue from transaction fees. It processes around 9.3 million payments a day.Adding to the potential float is Bill Me Later, the line of credit PayPal offers customers. Bill Me Later creates more float because it locks in future payments much like a credit card does. The problem with Bill Me Later is that we do not know how much revenue it is adding to PayPal, although there is one metric that might indicate its potential PayPal's merchant services unit, which includes Bill Me Later, processed $125 billion in Total Payment Volume in 2013.The Speculative ArgumentThis brings us to the speculative argument, which is stronger than you might think. Much of the interest in PayPal is in its prospects for future growth, which are mixed.PayPal has some interesting opportunities once it cuts loose from eBay. PayPal's former Vice President for Global Strategy, Daniela Mielke, told Bloomberg Businessweek that a standalone PayPal might be in a position to do business with Amazon.com and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Currently, you cannot use PayPal on either Amazon.com or Walmart.com.PayPal could also buy a bank or get a charter for a bank in order to underwrite its own credit products and offer FDIC-insured accounts in the United States, Mielke speculated. That raises some intriguing possibilities, including the acquisition of Green Dot Corp. (NYSE:GDOT) or BOFI Holdings Inc. (NYSE:BOFI). BOFI owns Bank of Internet, and Green Dot already has a bank - Green Dot Bank in Utah. Green Dot also has a good working relationship with Wal-Mart through which it plans to offer checking accounts.This makes PayPal a potential momentum stock like Amazon.com, which people buy for the possibility of future growth. Yet it is also based partially on PayPal's value and contrarian characteristics.My opinion is that PayPal would be a speculative stock with some value and contrarian characteristics. It will be an interesting hybrid that would be an exciting issue to watch."
2543975,64913,2014-10-06T18:00:25-04:00,The growth of online payment processors such as PayPal and Xoom is a direct threat to wire transfer companies such as Western Union and MoneyGram.Xoom and PayPal are going after the $542 remittance business that is vital to Western Union and MoneyGram.Xoom’s new cross border online bill pay service will take customers from wire transfer companies.PayPal’s expansion into the developing world is an attempt to get remittance customers.Western Union's TTM revenue is already stagnant.,"Payment processors Xoom (NASDAQ: XOOM) and PayPal, currently part of eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY), are in the midst of massive expansions that could threaten Western Union (NYSE: WU) and MoneyGram International's (NASDAQ: MGI) survival.Xoom is planning to launch a new solution that will allow a person in one country to pay bills directly in another country, The Guardian reported. The service would allow a Guatemalan working in the United States to pay his mother's electric bill back home. That threatens the so-called remittance business in which immigrants send money to the folks in their homelands.Xoom and PayPal Tapping Growing Remittance MarketImmigrants sent around $542 billion in remittance to friends and family, mostly to developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, The Guardian noted. The newspaper also noted that the level of remittance has quadrupled since 2000. The World Bank thinks the volume of remittances will grow by 8% in 2014.Remittances are one of Western Union's and Money Gram's core businesses. PayPal already is muscling into that business by expanding to countries like Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya. It is now possible to conduct e-commerce with PayPal in Nigeria and send money to any South African bank account through the service.Xoom's cloud-based solution, called Red Cycle, charges people $5 for each bill pay in another country. This might seem expensive to an American, but it's cheap to a resident of a developing country who might have to travel miles to the Western Union location to pick up cash. After picking up the cash, the person back home may have to deal with the local thugs and corrupt police that are waiting outside the wire transfer location for their cut of the remittance money.Why Western Union Could Be Vulnerable to Xoom and PayPalXoom's new bill-pay solution is rolling out at a bad time for Western Union because the wire transfer company's revenues have been stagnant for a while. Western Union reported TTM revenue figures of $5.665 billion in June 2012, $5.558 billion in June 2013, and $5.587 billion in June 2014.Western Union already is struggling and facing intense competition from MoneyGram. MoneyGram has been seeing substantial growth in recent years because of its close relationship with retailers such as Albertsons and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT). MoneyGram reported a TTM revenue figure of $1.292 billion in June 2012. That grew to $1.399 billion in June 2013 and $1.1516 billion in June 2014.Xoom's revenue is small compared to MoneyGram and Western Union, but it is growing faster. The earliest TTM revenue figure for Xoom - which started trading in February 2013 - was $73.43 million in September 2012. That figure grew to $99.87 million in June 2013 and $140.18 million in June 2014.PayPal's revenue, on the other hand, already exceeds Western Union's. eBay reported that the payment solution posted an annual revenue of $6.6 billion 2013. eBay also reported that international business now accounts for more than half of PayPal's total revenue. PayPal did not say how much of that business is remittances, but it is safe to assume that a large percentage is.Xoom reported that it processed $6.6 billion in payments between June 2013 and June 2014, and its service is only available in 30 countries. One has to wonder what Xoom's momentum would be if it could roll out its service worldwide.The revenue figures show that Xoom and PayPal are growing fast at a time when Western Union is struggling to maintain revenues and MoneyGram's momentum is slowing. If that were not bad enough, MoneyGram and Western Union also face direct competition from Wal-Mart, which launched its own money transfer service in April.Payment processing is about to go through a process of disruption and upheaval because aggressive online competitors have noticed the big money to be made in one of its core businesses: remittances. Both Western Union and MoneyGram are going to have a difficult time maintaining market share and keeping revenues up in the years ahead."
2540455,39301,2014-10-04T19:18:48-04:00,"The spin-off doesn't generate immediate synergies.Instead it presents two investment opportunities that may appeal to two types of investors.eBay will be managed conservatively and will appeal to more risk averse investors.PayPal on the other hand will grow at a much quicker pace, appealing to growth oriented investors that are willing to put up with higher levels of risk.With a well-defined risk to reward, the separate entities will trade at higher earnings/sales multiples.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) went ahead and made the decision to split itself in two companies and allow both businesses to go down their own separate paths. The reasoning behind splitting the two companies has been a lack of focus by senior level management to aggressively develop growth opportunities in both businesses that can directly result in synergies for both companies.In other words, management more or less admitted that it was pretty incompetent at juggling two companies within a single company. This is a pretty bad excuse for spinning off two businesses because there are tech companies that have their hands mixed into a bunch of different pies. Microsoft owns various software, smartphone and enterprise divisions under its ""One Microsoft"" umbrella. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a ton of different reporting segments that grow at varying rates, all of which compete in somewhat similar but different markets. Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has been able to operate a marketplace and payment business separately, but in a way that can benefit both segments mutually.So what happened? Well eBay thinks that by spinning off the two entities and by operating under a new arms-length relationship, the two businesses will somehow generate the synergies they had before while allowing the two companies to focus investment on areas that will allow them to grow. How the spin-off benefits shareholders is pretty vague, but basically as two separate entities, they will have more flexibility to pursue new opportunities.How eBay the marketplace prevented PayPal the payment platform from pursuing opportunities remains a mystery, but I will offer a theory. Maybe behind closed doors, eBay execs and PayPal execs couldn't agree on where to invest, and as a result they filed for divorce with the push of activist investor Carl Icahn behind it.When reviewing the conference presentation notes from the spin-off announcement, very little quantifiable information was presented on how it will benefit shareholders. I mean, no projections were made of cost savings as a result of operating the two businesses separately.Source: eBayOn the upside, shareholders can now make the decision to either invest into PayPal or eBay separately. eBay grew transaction volume at a much more modest pace. However, the modest revenue growth comes with higher profit margins. I'm assuming that $3.5 billion in annual profit can go toward acquisitions and share buybacks. PayPal grew revenue by 20%, and generated a profit margin of 25%. The more modest margin indicates that PayPal will have less cash left over for dividends and share buybacks.eBay may emphasize expansion into foreign markets (limited presence in foreign markets), whereas PayPal is already a global company (PayPal depends heavily on cross-border transactions). PayPal must invest aggressively to support its own growth rate, whereas eBay marketplace can be milked for a steady stream of dividends and appreciation.Because eBay marketplace has a well-established moat, it can be optimized for profitability. Also, because eBay relies on a crowd sourced model, growth happens naturally with minimal investment into customer acquisition. PayPal may suffer competition in the offline and online payment space due to Apple Pay, and has to operate in multiple countries at the same time, requiring greater emphasis on compliance with bank regulatory rules as it may eventually become a quasi-online financial institution.I think PayPal has the potential of disrupting the banking sector, but it doesn't have the thrust of eBay behind it. However, eBay may want to build its marketplace platform in many more markets, but PayPal isn't really compelled to invest any of its resources into global marketplace expansion. Perhaps the two companies have great business opportunities, but neither wants to support the other in developing them. And since neither of these opportunities presents a whole lot of synergy to the other business, going down separate paths makes more sense.When separated, eBay offers steady growth and predictable dividends. PayPal offers great growth potential, but comes with more risk due to competition from Apple Pay. The two businesses will appeal to a different group of investors and may induce more institutional interest when separated. However, on the downside, the two businesses when separated will have fewer economic resources when presented with an opportunity that requires significant investment. This eliminates the possibility of large scale acquisitions, or business developments that may require added investment from the other reporting segment.To conclude, synergies from the spin-off are limited. However, the spin-off presents investment opportunities for two distinct groups of investors and may lift valuation multiples when separated."
2537585,23479,2014-10-02T18:14:20-04:00,"With the spin-off, PayPal will become more nimble and focused, which is necessary given the recent innovations in the payment processing industry.Additionally, eBay will have more cash to fund its own operations instead of fueling PayPal's growth.Investors are likely to benefit from capital gains as a spin off is usually a tax-free transaction and could unlock hidden value by increasing transparency.","After long resisting such a move, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has finally decided to spin-off its payment services arm PayPal. This spin off will be completed in 2015. While there may be some negatives to consider - such as loss of synergy between eBay and Paypal, spin-off related expenses and the impression that eBay's reluctance and subsequent decision to split indicates slight incompetence on the part of its management - there are some positives too. With this spin-off, PayPal will become more nimble and focused, which is necessary given the recent innovations in the payment processing industry. Additionally, eBay will have more cash to fund its own operations instead of fueling PayPal's growth. Last, but not the least, investors are likely to benefit from capital gains as a spin off is usually a tax-free transaction and could unlock hidden value by increasing transparency.Our price estimate for eBay stands at $67, implying a premium of a little under 20% to the market.PayPal Will Have Greater Flexibility To Innovate And CompeteThe recent developments in the online payment industry and Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) IPO suggest that competition is likely to intensify. PayPal will need to stay focused and innovate. The split will reduce bureaucratic hurdles and allow PayPal's management to take independent decisions quickly.The timing of split is interesting as it coincides with the launch of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) digital payment service, Apple Pay. The service or app is expected to be launched in the coming weeks and aims to simplify payment through the replacement of cash and credit and debit cards. The new app will use the fingerprint scanner on Apple's iPhone to determine the user's identity and is thus likely to be very secure. Interestingly, PayPal has tied up with Samsung to integrate its service in the latter's Galaxy S5 smartphone using a similar technology. [1] Apple Pay's utility is yet to be proven, but the reaction from the industry indicates that it could be a big step forward. Several payment processing start-ups such as Square and Stripe are going to help merchants accept Apple Pay. Moreover, with Alibaba raising over $8 billion in cash from its recent IPO, PayPal is likely to face more competition from Alipay. Operating as an independent company will pave the way for greater focus and a nimble business.eBay Will Have More Funds To Invest And Face AlibabaeBay's management has stated on many occasions that while PayPal is growing fast, eBay's marketplaces business is the cash cow with strong margins and cash flow. For a long time, the company has been investing some of the cash generated by its marketplaces segment in PayPal's operations. With PayPal gone, eBay can invest this money in growing its bread and butter business and better compete against Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which recently had a very successful IPO in the U.S. eBay will have more funds available to invest in improving its security, which has plagued it in the recent past. The security breach that rocked eBay in the second quarter of 2014 had a slight negative impact on the marketplaces segment's growth. Additionally, the company will have more independence in spending on improving the user experience, quality assurance and bringing more merchants online. eBay also wants to expand in China and it could do it better alone rather than partnering with PayPal considering Alipay's dominance in the country. The synergies between the two would probably not come into play in the region.Investors Will BenefitOne of the reasons why eBay's management decided to go for the split was pressure from active investors. Active investor and billionaire Carl Icahn has a reputation for shaking up management of the companies where he owns a significant stake. Previously, he had actively written to eBay's management and board of directors about spinning off PayPal from eBay. As the management stayed firm in its opinion, he also made a tactical change by suggesting a partial spin-off by selling a 20% stake through an IPO. [2] eBay refused back then, but it seems that the pressure grew from investors and management decided that it was in the best interest of investors if eBay and PayPal were separate entities.Paypal has been growing rapidly and there has been an impression among shareholders that the division is carrying the whole company and will command a higher valuation as a standalone entity. This may be true as growth stocks (companies with strong growth in EPS) tend to command high valuation in the market. Paypal's earnings growth will be more transparent now and investors can benefit from capital gains as the stock is likely to trade higher. In other words, the valuation of eBay and Paypal as one entity is likely to be lower than the sum of their valuations after spin-off. Disclosure: No positions."

The move by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) to release PayPal signals the tipping point.PayPal may not have everything ""right"" at this time, but in being released to follow its own path it now has that opportunity to change a lot of things in the financial world.The information flowing out of the discussions connected with the spinoff of PayPal suggests that eBay would keep $7.5 billion in debt with the core Marketplace company, which means that PayPal will come out of the spinoff with no debt!Part of the reasoning for the split in the companies, according to John Donahoe, eBay's CEO, is to allow PayPal the freedom to focus on the markets it needs to be in and to rapidly innovate its products and services for a fast changing environment.Furthermore, it will allow PayPal to more easily acquire and integrate companies that fit into its strategy. PayPal has already moved into two areas in this way, acquiring Braintree Payments.com, which specializes in online and mobile payments, and which also owns Venmo, a peer-to-peer payments group. In addition, PayPal owns BillMeLater, a company that allows people to buy things and pay later with PayPal Credit.Spinning off from eBay with a large ""chunk"" of money and no debt gives PayPal a lot of freedom and a lot of financial resources to pick and choose what they feel fits into their plans.This is one of the things that Carl Icahn wanted PayPal to be able to do in his earlier battles with the board of eBay. Icahn realized, perhaps more than the eBay board, that to play in the game PayPal was going to have to play in, once real competition broke down the doors, that to be really competitive PayPal needed to be able to wheel and deal with the best of the lot. Now it can.All the more reason why eBay made the move it did. With Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) becoming a player in the space and with Lending Club going out for an IPO, it became obvious that the move toward the new banking environment was heating up. Not only were credible competitors now gaining the spotlight, big money was coming to the table to finance the growing competitive environment.I think this is an excellent move by PayPal. The problem that exists, however, is that because eBay did not move earlier when Mr. Icahn was pushing the spinoff it has lost a lot of time. Things do not stand still in the information technology space when events start happening.Now, eBay says that the spinoff will not come until the second half of 2015. My question is how much will this delay hurt PayPal?Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) have all tried to move into the payments area. There are many organizations that are building peer-to-peer lending facilities. Just looking at what PayPal has done…it not only deals with moving money, it also has a facility to make loans. Sounds like a bank to me.If the dam has been broken by Lending Club and PayPal, the tipping point may have been reached and the flood will now proceed.Can PayPal move on before its separation from eBay, to be fully competitive in the evolving banking industry? If it is going to be the investment opportunity I think it can be, I believe that the management of PayPal, now under the direction of the newly named president of PayPal, Dan Schulman, formerly an executive of American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) and the person who will become CEO at PayPal after the split, will need to get into the flow immediately…if they have not already started.If they don't move into high gear, it will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that will have been badly wasted."
2533485,69675,2014-10-01T07:21:39-04:00,"Shares of eBay popped up after the e-commerce giant announced plans to spin off its PayPal operations into a separate publicly-traded entity.This will leave a higher-margin eBay that should be appealing to profit-oriented investors.However, PayPal will provide investors with more attractive revenue growth prospects, which will be more appealing to growth-oriented shareholders.","News broke on Sept. 30 that eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), one of the world's largest e-commerce sites, would be spinning off its PayPal operations into a separate public entity after being prompted by activist investor Carl Icahn. In light of this development, shares of the online merchant rose around 8% in afternoon trading, signaling to shareholders that Mr. Market believes there to be the opportunity for value creation as a result of the deal. Given this news though, which entity should investors be the most interested in once the spin-off goes through?The good behind the spin-offFollowing the spin-off of PayPal, eBay will be a smaller but more niche enterprise. Assuming that what eBay means by spinning it off into a separate entity is that the business will get rid of its entire Payments segment, revenue for eBay would have come in around $9.42 billion in 2013 compared to the $16.05 billion management reported. While this may seem like a negative, the good news is that eBay's profit margin should rise materially.In 2013, eBay generated operating income of $3.37 billion, which equated to an operating profit margin of 21%. For simplicity's sake during our analysis, we will actually be looking at the company's operating income after adding back its Corporate and other operating loss of $1.66 billion to this number, which implies an adjusted operating profit of $5.03 billion for an adjusted operating profit margin of 31.3%. The reason behind this is that this loss from Corporate and other cannot be allocated appropriately between the company's Marketplaces, Payments, and Enterprise segments with the information we have available.eBay Financial Results: 2013While this adjusted operating profit margin is high, the actual margin of the company's Marketplaces segment stands even higher at 40.5% with operating income of $3.35 billion on sales of $8.25 billion. As a standalone entity, this will be slightly offset by the small 8.2% operating profit margin of its Enterprise segment, but with sales of just $1.11 billion, this segment isn't all that material to the company's results. Even so, these segments put together will still have a total operating profit margin of 36.6%.In contrast, the company's Payments segment had operating income of $1.59 billion on sales of $6.63 billion in 2013. This is still a pretty impressive operating profit margin of 24% but serves to weigh on eBay's bottom line a bit. By separating Payments entirely, the e-commerce giant will see its operating profit margin rise meaningfully, which should serve to attract shareholders looking for profitable enterprises.The bad behind the spin-offAlthough Payments has held eBay's profit margins down, there is one downside to the company separating this part from itself. On top of any synergies that may be lost because of the transaction, eBay's growth will slow. Over the past three years, sales at the consolidated business jumped 37.7% from $11.65 billion to $16.05 billion. As impressive as this is, the business's Payments segment saw its top line soar 50.2% from $4.41 billion to $6.63 billion, far outpacing its parent's performance.Sales GrowthMost of this growth for eBay (outside of its Payments segment) came from its Enterprise segment, which saw sales skyrocket 88.5% from $590 million to $1.11 billion, while its Marketplaces segment brought up the rear with top line expansion of 24.7% from $6.64 billion to $8.28 billion. Assuming that eBay's remaining businesses continue to grow at the pace they have been, the e-commerce giant's top line will slow. If the business can allocate its resources more efficiently because of this or if Payments can increase in terms of profitability, then shareholders will likely benefit but this is something only time can determine.TakeawayClearly, Mr. Market received eBay's news in a positive light, but the question for investors is which entity should be considered an attractive prospect moving forward. Once the spin-off is completed in 2015, eBay should be appealing to shareholders looking for an online retailer with hefty margins, but PayPal will likely be appealing to investors seeking sales growth. Similarly, to market participants wanting a business that provides a nice economic moat and which may be appealing to somebody interested in a buyout, PayPal may be the way to go since the business facilitated the transfer of one out of every $6 spent online during 2013."
2509495,39301,2014-09-21T01:37:05-04:00,"eBay formed a partnership with Samsung to develop a mobile payment solution.However, eBay may be working with numerous Android OEMs giving it significant scale when compared to Apple.eBay's stock price has declined following Apple's September 9th event, but it's likely that this trend will reverse soon.eBay will generate more enabled commerce volume from mobile transactions, which will be supplemental in nature.","Yeah, if you thought eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) was going to sit back and let the living heck get beaten out of them, think again. The company is working closely with Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) to develop a mobile NFC payment solution, and since PayPal has a pre-existing base of users, paired with payment transfer capabilities, along with theft protection for merchants on its marketplace platform, the company is well positioned to gain back a bit of the momentum that it has lost from the September 9th event. Furthermore, PayPal already has 150 million global active accounts giving the company incredible scale from the get go.PayPal a long-term winner in mobile commerceQuoted from GIGAOM, the quoted information is pertaining to Samsung:Maybe PayPal isn't just working with Samsung; it's probably working with many other Android-based OEMs. In this case, PayPal is well on its way to developing a scalable mobile payment platform. The mobile payment platform will be structured in a four way network in which merchants, payment processors (Visa/MasterCard), banks (acquirers and issuers), and hardware OEMs will participate.However, I have done some extensive analysis on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Payments, and I'm pretty convinced that the offline payment market, based on industry standard ARPUs should contribute $2 billion in revenue to Apple. My estimate is fairly conservative, but given the revenue sharing agreement that was recently leaked by Apple Insider, the company will generate $0.15 per $100 in transaction volume. The take rate per transaction is comparable to what Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) earns, which is why Apple will generate a modest amount of revenue, but on the bright side the impact to net income will be more significant given the relatively high profit margins payment processing networks tend to generate.PayPal's entry into the mobile payment market with key partners like Samsung bodes well for the company. As Samsung has significant market share in developed and emerging markets. Implementing a fingerprint sensor across Samsung's mobile and wearable product line-up, along with NFC capabilities will give Samsung an added source of revenue in the form of mobile transaction revenue. While the leak revealed that Samsung's wearables will include payment processing technology, it's likely that Samsung will roll out the feature across its smartphone devices too.Currently, Samsung has 31.2% market share based on Q1 2014 figures. PayPal's partnership with Samsung gives the service twice the number of handsets when compared to Apple (based on market share figures). Admittedly, Apple iPhone users tend to have higher discretionary income, which may translate into a lot more transaction volume than what analysts are anticipating. The Samsung-PayPal duo will probably do comparable volume to Apple, because they have a larger base of users.Source: FreeStockChartsAs you can tell, eBay has had a pretty rough September. However, it has been able to find a base at around $50, and it's been able to move slightly higher from those levels. Unfortunately, eBay is below the 20, 50, and 200-day moving average. However, I'm pretty confident that the stock price will recover, and will trade closer to my $58 price target by the end of 2014.While the September 9th event was broadly interpreted as a negative catalyst, I think quite differently of the event. If Apple hadn't released Apple Payments, there's the possibility that PayPal wouldn't have been able to enter into the mobile payment market as quickly. Disruption leads to competition, and since neither PayPal nor Samsung could go it alone, the partnership between the two was inevitable. This should translate into more enabled commerce volume over the long term.Source: eBayeBay reported 26% ECV (enabled commerce volume) growth, which is basically the volume that's generated via eBay marketplace, and PayPal (excluding automotives and real estate). What's impressive is that eBay has a 7.1% take rate on transactions, i.e. for every dollar that a consumer spend via eBay's commerce and payment platform, 7.1% goes to eBay and PayPal. This figure is likely to deflate based on historical trends, paired with the move to offline mobile payments. However, the added volume from mobile payments is supplemental in nature, and since the take rate per mobile transaction will be small, the corresponding take rate across eBay's platforms will decline at a moderate pace. However, the added impact from added mobile commerce volume will contribute to top line results, and will also positively impact net profit, even if it diminishes profitability marginally.ConclusionSince PayPal can work across the entire Android ecosystem, it's entirely possible that PayPal will generate more commerce volume from mobile transactions than Apple. Furthermore PayPal will be able to build upon pre-existing financial relationships with merchants, payment processors, and banks giving them the ability to quickly execute in comparison to other payment solution providers. Therefore, I have great conviction that eBay will remain a long-term outperformer. I reiterate my buy recommendation on eBay.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

This comes after the company successfully fending off activist Carl Icahn, who was pushing for a separation earlier this year. Now, another activist, Dan Loeb and Third Point, has come out and announced a large position in eBay.PayPal could become a separate company by the end of 2015. Current CEO John Donahoe will not have any part of either of the new companies, while Devin Weing (who runs eBay Marketplaces) will become eBay's CEO and Dan Schulman (currently running American Express' enterprise growth group) will be PayPal's CEO.The payments business is slowing down and now looks like the ideal time to sell off PayPal. This could also be a ploy to see what types of buyers or partnerships the company can drum up for PayPal. However, there are concerns where eBay accounts for over a quarter of PayPal's transactions. That's a large number of eBay customers that use PayPal to complete their transactions. And what happens if PayPal ends up in the hands of a rival after becoming public [i.e. get bought up by the likes of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)].As we noted earlier this month, a spinoff of PayPal would unlock value for eBay. As we stated,We still believe that longer-term; this move to separate the businesses will put pressure on eBay. PayPal has kept up eBay's stock for some time. We still have worries over what this will mean for eBay longer-term, but would be interested in playing the hype in the near-term."
2531765,22775,2014-09-30T13:28:44-04:00,"PayPal spin-off: it looks like eBay took seriously the competition threat from the likes of Apple, Facebook and Amazon.We review the pros and cons of the transaction in this article.We put our negative stance on hold.","PayPal spin-off a likely response to Apple Pay and other payment initiativeseBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has just announced that it would spin off its PayPal unit into a separate publicly traded company in the second half of 2015 and that both companies would become independent. The move is quite surprising as eBay fought off Carl Icahn's spin-off request just a couple of months ago, with CEO Donahoe saying that a full separation was ""not a good idea"".It suggests that eBay took seriously the competition threat from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (AMZN), which are all said to be developing mobile and/or online payment businesses (Apple will soon launch Apple Pay). As explained in our July article ""eBay: A Short Idea On PayPal's Upcoming Woes,"" PayPal is a high-quality business and is still in a near-monopoly situation, but competition is heating up and will obviously put pressure on PayPal's take rates and margins, suggesting that revenue and earnings growth could stall in coming years.The pros and cons of the spin-offPayPal is eBay's most valuable asset. In our previous articles, we said that the business was valued around $40bn (or 60% of eBay's market cap). Now that the spin-off has been announced, some analysts value PayPal around $47bn. This makes sense: investors will probably value the business with a 20% premium due to its pure player profile (no need to be invested in marketplaces to invest in PayPal) and its liquidity (the stock will be listed).Another positive is that a standalone PayPal will have the opportunity to accelerate revenue growth through PayPal's integration on other large marketplaces such Amazon and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).That said, investors should not overlook the negatives. First, eBay has probably discussed a sale of the business with potential predators (Apple, Amazon, etc.) in recent months and did not get the expected price. This means that tech companies are well aware of the risks of buying a richly valued business while the competitive landscape is evolving fast.Second, PayPal could lose some ""easy business"" with eBay (assuming that eBay will open up to rival payment systems) and could find it difficult to develop business with Amazon or Alibaba that are also involved in mobile & online payment initiatives.We put our negative stance on holdeBay has taken the right decision in our view. And importantly, it is moving much faster than we expected and will fully divest PayPal. Hence, it will not remain exposed to the competition risk mentioned above.For now, we put on hold our negative stance on the stock. But we would not turn positive as a large part of the PayPal valuation upside is now discounted in the stock price (eBay's market cap. is up $4bn today) and as PayPal's valuation could suffer in coming quarters from the announcements around online payments initiatives made by tech giants (remember that eBay lost 6% following the Apple Pay announcement)."
2519045,61281,2014-09-24T18:33:19-04:00,eBay experienced a decline in core business revenues as a portion of total revenues.eBay launched new mobile ad network to use its enormous database and monetize its huge knowledge over shopping habits of its users.New players in the payment services market increase competitive pressure over PayPal but do not possess a real threat to the company.Possible collaboration with Samsung to compete with Apple Pay may create a new emerging revenues stream for PayPal.,"Online commerce and payments giant eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has attracted investor and the media attention lately for all the wrong reasons. It started in May, when eBay admitted that hackers had broken into its database and stolen user information, which drove the company to urge its worldwide users to reset their passwords. One month later, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced that PayPal chief David Marcus joined the company to lead the messaging initiative. In August, eBay's rival, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), announced a new credit card reading service, named Amazon Local Register, which offers local retailers a quick and easy swipe for credit and debit card transactions and competes directly with PayPal Here. Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) announcement of Apple Pay posed a direct threat to PayPal and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Alibaba's IPO brought Alipay to the public's attention as a possible future competitor of PayPal.On top of the bad news and changes in the market mentioned in the previous paragraph, which had a negative impact on eBay, the company reported a decrease in both their core revenues and in eBay's revenues. As shown in Chart 1 below, the contribution of eBay's marketplace segment to the entire company's revenues has decreased in the last three years, from 61% in Q1'11 to only 50% in Q2'14. The increase in total revenues is mainly driven by the payments sector and has triggered rumors of a PayPal spin-off in order to separate the declining marketplaces segment from the improving payments segment.After all of that being said, eBay is in the middle of a change, and the current negative sentiment and stock pullback can create an opportunity to purchase the stock just before it goes back up. As shown in chart 2 below, eBay's stock has had many ups and downs since the beginning of the year and is currently recovering from a recent correction.Mobile Ad NetworkAs an attempt to generate new revenue streams outside of the declining marketplaces segment, eBay will launch a new in-app mobile ad network in Q4'14, joining other Internet giants, such as Facebook, Google and Yahoo, that already offer mobile ads. According to eBay, the company has more than 149 million active users in its marketplace, which generated $75B in sales in 2013. Mobile sales accounted for 40% of the total sales volume and made eBay one of the biggest mobile commerce apps. eBay can use its mobile sales volume and massive knowledge base regarding users' preferences and shopping habits to provide high-quality user-specific ads on its ad network. The mobile advertising network will enable eBay to increase advertising revenues and cover the 40 percent mobile sales that were not offered any ads until now. Revenue potential for this move could be great and should be reflected in any 2015 outlook.New competitors don't pose a threat to PayPalAs presented in chart 1 above, the ratio of eBay's payment revenues to total revenues increased every quarter and reached 45% in Q2'14 as compared to 39% in Q1'11. As mentioned in the opening paragraph, PayPal is under increased competitive pressure from Amazon, Apple and Alibaba. However, as competition increases in the electronic payments market, PayPal's strengths and advantages are highlighted over the other players. Amazon is considered by many small business owners and brick-and-mortar stores as the big evil which is trying to take over their businesses. Since most businesses will not work with Amazon, the company will probably target food trucks, barber shops and beauty salons. Amazon offers lower swipe rates than PayPal's and will probably gain some market share in the businesses mentioned above. However, that small market share together with the fact that the offer is only valid until the end of 2015 do not present a big risk to PayPal. Apple Pay is currently hurt by the iCloud hack, which may or may not have a real impact on Apple Pay security by putting Apple's security in a poor light. Apple Pay may maintain competition over PayPal Here as a credit card payment service but could not replace PayPal's e-commerce transaction or money transfer dominance. As Alibaba's electronic payment service, Alipay is targeted to the Chinese market and mainly used in Alibaba's sites, and therefore possesses no real threat for PayPal globally. In China, where Alipay is the largest electronic payment service, PayPal may struggle to compete with Alipay. As Apple launched its electronic payment service, Samsung is rumored to have collaborated with PayPal in order to launch a smart-watch based mobile payment service. Such a collaboration could help PayPal appear as an innovative company once again, and smart-watch payment could become an emerging revenue stream for eBay.ConclusionsEven though the proportion of total revenues from the marketplace segment has declined, eBay is still a strong brand with 4.6 million visitors daily and 149 million active users, which has an enormous database of users' preferences and shopping habits. eBay has tried to increase the monetization of this knowledge base and has started to offer mobile ads from Q414 to offset the declining marketplace revenues. In the payment segment, recent competitors do not pose a threat to PayPal, and a possible collaboration with Samsung could enable PayPal to strengthen its position in the electronic credit card swipe market. Taking all of the above into account, I believe that eBay is on the verge of a reflection point, which may reflect an upside for investors who decide to buy the stock now."

The growth of mobile usage has shifted management's position and eBay has now committed to capitalize on its growing mobile base.eBay's second quarter total sales came in at $4.37 billion, a 13% increase versus the same quarter in the prior year. Total company enabled commerce volume, ECV, increased 26% to $62 billion. Most importantly, mobile ECV grew by an astonishing 68% year-over-year, reaching $12 billion. In addition, eBay gained 6.6 million new customers, more than double the 3 million new customers gained through mobile in the second quarter of 2013.Embrace of Mobile Platform:Recently, eBay announced that it will start accepting Bitcoin payments in the coming months. Braintree, a mobile payment processing company acquired by eBay, in 2013, will partner with Coinbase, a third-party Bitcoin payment processor, to integrate the virtual currency to help businesses set up online payment systems. Consumers will be able to use various smartphone apps to make payments and purchases.According to CoinDesk, a website that tracks the proliferation of Bitcoin acceptance, approximately 63,000 businesses handle Bitcoins and have set up more than 5 million digital wallets to accept the virtual currency. Recently, Expedia announced that it will allow users to pay for hotel accommodations using Bitcoins.By accepting Bitcoin, eBay will attract a mobile consumer base for Paypal that has a strong and loyal following. Paypal will immediately have a leg up in one demographic as Apple Pay has already rejected the virtual currency.Advertising Network:eBay has stated it is readying to launch an advertising network that will allow advertisers to connect to the app's 4.6 million daily users. The network seems perfect for advertisers as the company already has data on consumers' purchase history and profiles. eBay has partnered with Triad Retail Media to place the advertisements with the revenue generated shared between the two companies. ebay has not disclosed the terms of the revenue sharing or if it would be getting the larger share. The advertising network has already secured companies like Geico Insurance and Berkshire Hathaway as advertisers.Conclusion:In the earnings conference call, eBay's management lowered its high-end full-year revenue guidance by $200 million, from $18.5 billion to $18.3 billion. However management reasserted its full year non-GAAP earnings per share (or EPS) guidance of $2.95 to $3 per share. The importance of Paypal cannot be understated with management stating that PayPal's strong operating leverage would help offset the impact of slower revenue growth.eBay's emphasis on mobile advertising will only strengthen its revenue growth and its valuation. Its forward P/E ratio of 17.5 is much lower than its competitors like Amazon and eBay has more than 3 billion remaining in a share buyback program."
2510935,41961,2014-09-22T03:06:38-04:00,"PayPal is the incumbent player in the large and growing remote payments market, with significant consumer and merchant relationships.Amazon and Apple's entry into the payments market marks the likely start of additional competition and possible pricing pressures.New competition is no immediate cause for panic, however PayPal should explore alliances with possible partners.","There have been a variety of recent developments which have started to alter the competitive landscape within which PayPal (NASDAQ:EBAY) plays. The entry of both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and more recently Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) into the payments system would likely have caused executives at PayPal to sit up and take notice.Amazon's and Apple's entry into PaymentsIn October 2013, Amazon launched a service which allows partner sites to enable a payments button that allows Amazon users to pay with their credit cards on file. Amazon's move to offer a single-click checkout which can be integrated on 3rd-party websites leverages many of Amazon's natural assets.Apple recently announced its Apple Pay payment service in conjunction with the availability of the iPhone 6. Apple Pay will allow both in-store and online mobile payment with a variety of merchants including Bloomingdales, Macy's (NYSE:M), Subway, Walgreens (WAG), and Whole Foods (WFM) among others. Significantly, Apple's Apple Pay service also enables seamless, one-touch payments for remote commerce, or web-based shopping. Apple's one touch checkout solution automatically transfers payment information into a merchant's cart at checkout Apple's entry into the remote payments market puts it directly in competition with PayPal.New Entrants will likely acquire share and create pricing pressurePayPal will clearly be concerned about Amazon's and Apple's entry into the online payments space. Amazon has more than 230M active users today. That's attractive for merchants and something that they won't be able to ignore. It makes the case that much easier for them to do the necessary integration to support Amazon Payments as a checkout option on their website. Amazon is also known for commoditizing new markets that it enters to facilitate scale and drive volume. While payments processing charges are currently on par with PayPal, the threat of pricing reductions to drive share is significant.There are suggestions that Apple's use of TouchID and the secure element for online transactions will allow those transactions to be treated as card present transactions, rather than card not present transactions. While other cloud wallet providers will likely also be able to get similar treatment, the effect of this will be to bring down the effective risk premiums that merchants today are paying for the processing of online transactions which are currently being treated as card not present.The consequence of new players entering the market is likely that there will be some shift in share to alternate payment platforms like Amazon, Apple and eventually Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) Alipay, with transaction processing economics declining as more players compete in the marketplace.Tokenization removes a key PayPal competitive advantageApple's Apple Pay announcement was significant for PayPal because Apple announced that it was deploying tokenization as a mechanism to facilitate payments. This is significant because it strikes at one of PayPal's key market advantages.PayPal solved for the ability for consumers to shop freely with unknown merchants online, secure in the knowledge that their credit card numbers won't be exposed to these merchants. It makes consumers more likely to complete a purchase, and less likely to abandon a cart at checkout, due to fear of giving credentials to an unknown merchant.PayPal's key consumer advantage was effectively neutralized when Apple indicated that it was looking to tokenize payment. With tokenization, a customer's actual credit card number is masked and never shared with a merchant. Instead, each credit card transaction would be given its own unique identifier that would be for one-time use. That provides consumers with complete peace of mind when shopping online, and with Apple having signed up a wide range of merchants in the ecosystem, it will loom large as a major threat to PayPal.However, PayPal still has some significant opportunities to strike some valuable partnerships in the ecosystem, which I increasingly feel it will need to do to strengthen its hand.Google, MCX may be looking for dance partnersFortunately for PayPal, iOS represents less than 20% global market share and thus the direct impact on PayPal's mobile strategy is likely to be manageable. The opportunity exists for PayPal to partner with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to build a payments offering with Google Wallet in the Android ecosystem comparable to what Apple has done with Apple Pay. PayPal does offer Google a set of valuable payment assets and existing merchant relationships to beef up Google's own wallet strategy. With an existing acceptance and settlement infrastructure already in place, PayPal could offer Google a real and viable payments platform to work with while Google strikes deals for advertising and offers, what it actually does best.The other party that could really use a leg up is the MCX consortium, which has been stumbling over itself for the last few years as it works to sort through a variety of conflicting member interests and harmonization of infrastructure. The overarching goal of MCX is to come up with a solution to cut out merchant interchange that is paid to the likes of Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA), which collectively costs merchants over $48B annually. PayPal does have a possible ace to play here. Given PayPal does have the ability to accept ACH payments, it could conceivably work with MCX to incentivize users to pay with PayPal linked to ACH rather than credit cards, and work with merchants to drive loyalty programs around such a structure. This would assist merchants in reducing interchange, and in turn, help PayPal to attract users to pay in-store with PayPal.It's not doom and gloom, but PayPal should look to strike alliances soonAs the incumbent in a large, growing market, PayPal has a large embedded base of users and merchant relationships that won't see the company being unseated anytime soon. However there are a backdrop of changes that are taking place with new entrants emerging who could disrupt PayPal's position, or at a minimum threaten the favorable economics that PayPal currently enjoys. Significantly, all of these large competitors have alternate ways of monetizing payments, which means that they could afford to commoditize payment processing and recoup revenue in other ways such as through offers and advertising (an approach that Google has looked at). PayPal should look at possible alliances with other players in the ecosystem who are still firming up their payments offerings to ensure that it doesn't get left behind."
2532965,41961,2014-10-01T03:12:11-04:00,"eBay has recently come under increasing shareholder pressure to spin off PayPal to maximize shareholder value.eBay announced Tuesday that it will be split into 2 independently traded companies, eBay and PayPal, from 2015.Apple's and Amazon's entry into online payments requires PayPal to consider strategic partnerships to maximize options. Independence from eBay will assist in this process.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) announced yesterday that it would separate into 2 publicly traded companies in 2015. The legacy eBay business will remain focused on sale and auction of goods, while PayPal will be spun out as an independent payments company. The tax free spin out is expected to be completed by 2015. The new PayPal organization will be headed by Dan Schulman, formerly president of enterprise growth initiatives at American Express.PayPal's spin out from eBay has been building momentum for quite some time. Carl Icahn had been pushing for a spin out of the Paypal business unit to unlock shareholder value, and free PayPal from the conglomerate discount that the business was supposedly trading at. eBay management had long argued that there were natural synergies between eBay and Paypal. By offering PayPal as the default mechanism for settlement of eBay transactions, on net eBay volume was helping PayPal's volume grow.In recent times however, PayPal's off-net volume has surpassed the payment volumes that are generated on eBay. Recent changes in the payments landscape, with Apple's introduction of Apple Pay and Amazon's entry into payments have added competitive pressure on eBay. I recently argued that PayPal needs to consider partnership opportunities with other players in the space, such as Google, in order to remain a strong force in payments. PayPal's spin off from eBay is a necessary step towards independence to allow PayPal to consider all actions to remain a leader in online payments."
2496015,22675,2014-09-15T13:06:52-04:00,,"I've written a decent amount about eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) over the years and have generally been a believer. Today, as I take a new look at things, I'm not as convinced. Why? There are a few reasons that I'll get into. But the one thing that seems apparent is that the current web ecosystem plays (AAPL, GOOG, FB, AMZN, MSFT) are now very much ready to take on eBay and I don't think the company has been able to properly prepare itself. It's not impossible to survive in such a context (Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) are 2 great examples but I feel like eBAY is about to run out of time on that front.Turns Out Carl Icahn Was Right.. But Maybe Too LateA few months ago, Carl Icahn waged a very public war with eBay's board, arguing that they were not doing their job and among other things, should spin out Paypal. Even at the time, I had argued that he was right but I'm believing that more and more. The company is reportedly still considering the move but at some point it will be too late. The problem isn't so much about having both an auction store and the leading internet payment site in the same company. The issue is that Paypal didn't get the attention it deserved. I've personally said for years that I was valuing eBay as a payments company because that was where the growth and the future was.So what did Paypal need to do? It needed to quickly build a customer and offline business base that were very active, to support developers (what % of apps that you use try to get you to pay through Paypal?), etc. On those fronts, Paypal has made very little progress.What Just Changed?For years, Google has been trying to build a payments solution, Facebook has built ""Facebook credits"" while Amazon's ""Payments"" has slowly but surely continued to gain ground. But what changed was Apple's recent ""Apple Pay"" announcement.Not only does that confirm how seriously Apple is taking ""Payments"" but it will force competing players to up their game VERY quickly because you can bet that Apple will become a major player in the payments space. Apple Pay will also be used for online payments in apps, websites, etc. That is very serious competition for eBay's Paypal and you can bet that Amazon, Google and Facebook will react to this news very quickly.The Game Is Not Lost… YETOf course, Apple only offers payments to its customer base leaving a majority of users unsupported. It is likely that at least one more player will emerge in this space and eBay could certainly compete. I don't think its chances are good compared to a few years ago when it was by far the dominant payment player. Paypal has around 150 million active users and Apple will almost reach half that number when its new operating system ships next month:credit StatistaApple has also signed up all 3 major credit card issuers as partners, will have hundreds of thousands of retail points from the start, etc. Paypal was apparently pushing to be part of Apple's payments effort but that has clearly failed.And again… eBay is not so focused on Paypal. Instead last week it announced:An Ad Network?!?!? To compete with Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter and others in an ultra-competitive business where eBay has little to no competitive advantage? I don't think I need to argue this one. Yes eBay knows a lot about what its users like to shop for… but an ad network??? It's even worse than the focus on same day shipping. eBay is not a technology company or an ad specialist.. so where does this make sense? Why not focus on the area where the company makes most of its money and is being targeted by the world's leading ecosystems?Disclosure: Long eBay ... but not for long"
2533245,67313,2014-10-01T04:12:42-04:00,eBay plans a tax-free spinoff of PayPal in 2H15.Fundamental story of competitive pressure in both Marketplace and PayPal remains.Alibaba unlikely to make a bid given the complexity of the US market.,"In a rather surprising move, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) announced Tuesday a plan to separate eBay and PayPal into two independent publicly-traded companies under a tax-free spinoff by 2H2015. I view this move as rather surprising given management's prior remarks on the synergy between eBay and PayPal. Fundamentally, I do not see any changes to eBay's story in that ecommerce continue to face heavy competition from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and PayPal will soon face Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a threat and the potential resurgence of Google Wallet.The only bright spot behind the separation is a potential M&A on the ecommerce division by Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which has expressed strong intention to enter the North American market. However, given the current competitive headwind, taking on eBay's Marketplace would be difficult for BABA to handle given its lack of understanding towards the US market and the industry players. A near-term acquisition would likely be destructive to shareholder value, in my view.Capitulation and challengeseBay's spin-off of PayPal suggests a sign of capitulation by the ecommerce giant on the sustainability of the Marketplace and PayPal. Recall that since January, eBay has been pointing out the key reasons on why ecommerce and PayPal have a natural synergy:The move today suggests that those reasons are no longer relevant and does not change the fundamental story of eBay, which is facing competitive pressure in both of its segments.Marketplace is facing the obvious challenges from AMZN and GOOG that are placing greater emphasis on building out a comprehensive ecommerce platform. Longer term, BABA will be another threat assuming that it does not make the move of taking over Marketplace to gain a foothold in the US. Besides online threats, offline players such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and specialty retailers are working to improve their online sites, thereby adding another layer of competitive pressure. Finally, the Marketplace still faces the brand perception that it is a place for auction/used items, which does not resonate with consumers nowadays.PayPal will face the biggest competition from AAPL now that Apple Pay has rolled out. Google, looking to revive its Google Wallet post Apple Pay announcement will no doubt come in the picture. At the end, this space will be crowded and PayPal's competitiveness will be tested.The M&A pictureMany eBay investors are speculating that BABA, rather than competing against, could acquire Marketplace to gain an immediate foothold in the US ecommerce site. While this will likely to be the case, it is still early to tell how competitive Marketplace will be or whether the fundamental will turn the corner post BABA acquisition. While BABA dominates ecommerce in China, it has little, if any, experience in the US. Judging by BABA's prior entry points in the US, those businesses are much smaller in scale and act more like experiments for BABA to study and understand the US ecommerce market. Most important, BABA simply does not understand its competitors so it does not make strategic sense for it to acquire Marketplace and tackle GOOG and AMZN head-on. As such, I do not expect the M&A scenario to play out for at least a few years.What to expect from eBay's stock? Short interest will likely to accumulate over the next year as money gradually shifts from eBay to the soon-to-be listed PayPal."
2485185,22775,2014-09-10T14:45:16-04:00,"Apple will rival PayPal in its core online payment business, with a one touch checkout feature.We remain convinced that PayPal will lose share in online payments and will find it incredibly difficult to grow in physical transactions.In a reasonable bear case, PayPal's valuation could be halved, leading to a -30% impact on eBay's stock price.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), whose main asset is PayPal, has lost 6% since the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay announcement. Apple was widely expected to launch a payment platform but most analysts and investors believed that Apple would focus (at least in the short term) on in-store transactions, which are a tiny part of PayPal's business. The news that Apple would become a key rival in online payments through a pay button on online merchants' checkout pages (similar to the PayPal button) was a major surprise and sparked the eBay sell-off.In our July article, we warned that eBay would be a major victim of Apple's ambitions in the mobile & online payment business. Following Apple's keynote, we are pretty convinced that the seamless user experience (one touch checkout) offered by Apple Play (on the iPhone and probably soon on the iPad) will enable the Cupertino firm to gain share at the expense of PayPal in online payments and will shatter PayPal's ambitions in physical transactions. Increasing competition will obviously put pressure on PayPal's take rates and margins, suggesting that revenue and earnings growth could stall in coming years. If we assume that the market grows at 20-25% and that PayPal loses 10-20% market share, its revenue growth could be halved in coming years (from the current 20% growth rate). This is not what investors are expecting from eBay and the de-rating risk is thus significant.It's quite difficult to figure out a bear case valuation for PayPal, as we don't have full details about the company's financials. But in our view, PayPal's valuation could easily be halved to reflect a much tougher outlook and increased beta. Such a scenario would have a -30% impact on eBay's stock price. In all, we remain sellers of the stock as we believe that the upside scenario (eBay moves extremely fast on the rumored PayPal spin-off and unloads most of its PayPal shares) is unlikely at the moment."
2491425,41741,2014-09-12T14:20:47-04:00,"Rumors of eBay spinning off PayPal have kept the stock propped up.But Apple Pay could put pressure on the company in the interim.The spin-off would be a positive for shareholders, even if it's not great for the core eBay business.","eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock got a boost after the company was considering a spin-off of PayPal. That becomes an even greater possibility with the recent introduction of Apple Pay. Shares have slid since the Apple Pay announcement. eBay also is trying to replace former PayPal CEO David Marcus, who left to join Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). We still feel that the sell-off of PayPal won't save eBay.Keith Rabois, a partner with Khosla Ventures, has said that it was a good idea, but he would recommend that eBay choose the simpler solution of renaming itself PayPal. He points out that PayPal, which was acquired by eBay more than 10 years ago, is still regarded as a subsidiary, and that this could create problems down the road. He also believes that the company has missed out on plenty of opportunities.Many experts believe that PayPal has not really delivered with mobile payment services, despite the fact that it has 150 million users throughout the world. The activist investor Carl Icahn began a campaign for eBay to spin off PayPal through an IPO, accusing board members and the eBay CEO of conflict of interest and bad leadership, though this accusation was withdrawn after his nominee was appointed to the board of directors.The prospects for PayPalThe prospects for PayPal remain somewhat attractive, even with Apple Pay on the horizon. It has a large franchise that processes $7,000 per second in payments, and the speculation that parent eBay was considering a spin-off was enough to send eBay share prices up by 5%.The payment business, particularly mobile payments, is considered to be hot for investors. Even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), whose initiative called Amazon Local Register is providing card readers to retail outlets, is tapping the marketPayPal does have the advantage of volume, with more than 150 million users and the $55 billion in volume that it handles (about one-third of which is contributed by eBay) generating revenues of around $2 billion and an operating profit of $500 million, which does not include overhead costs attributable to eBay.It should be noted that most of this profit comes not from payments, but from riskier lending. PayPal provides more than $1 million a day in loans to small businesses, and is planning to acquire in 2016 the $1 billion loan portfolio generated by its co-branded credit card business with GE.This raises the question of the valuation for PayPal. Putting the same valuation as major payment processor, Visa (NYSE:V), which trades at a multiple of 16 times EBITDA, PayPal should have an enterprise value of around $28 billion.In reality, the valuation would probably be higher, because revenues are growing 20%. eBay has an enterprise value of around $64 billion, and excluding PayPal, would result in a valuation of $36 billion for all other businesses.The implications of the spin-off for eBayeBay has been telling potential recruits for the position of PayPal CEO that it is considering a spin-off, which could happen as early as next year. eBay is a highly successful e-commerce company which generates annual revenues in excess of $17 billion, and a comprehensive business plan will ensure that the company remains highly successful in the future.In this particular instance, PayPal is the mobile payment system which services payments for eBay customers, and it makes sense to isolate the value of PayPal from eBay's stock price. Thus, it's likely that eBay is being valued at less than the sum of its separate parts, and a spin-off such as this would enhance the value of eBay as a whole.Bottom lineWe believe it's clear that a spin-off would unlock some value for eBay shareholders, but it's not in the best interest of the eBay business. A PayPal spin-off over the next 12 to 18 months would be a positive for the stock price, and we're capitalists."
2493525,69695,2014-09-14T12:16:04-04:00,"EBay has a prized asset, PayPal, which is growing much faster than the overall company.Despite PayPal's growth, eBay holds a conservative valuation that is a discount to both the broader market and its industry peers.One way eBay could reward its shareholders would be spinning off PayPal, because PayPal would very likely receive a much higher earnings multiple.","E-commerce giant eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) needs a catalyst. The company is growing, but it's not getting much credit from investors. Despite solid, above-average underlying earnings growth this year, it's not receiving a premium multiple. eBay's share price has lost value year-to-date, and over the past 52 weeks as well. This is because the company is under pressure from a variety of headwinds, including a data breach earlier this year, that impaired the brand's reputation.But underneath the surface, eBay holds a very valuable asset in PayPal. Since eBay in its current form trades for a discounted valuation, the company needs to do something drastic to reward its loyal shareholders. Sometimes, the sum of a company's various independent parts could be worth more than the whole. That's why eBay should take Carl Icahn's advice, and spin off PayPal.eBay's predicamentE-commerce is a booming industry, thanks to its level of convenience. Consumers undoubtedly love being able to shop from home and receive at-home deliveries, which gives internet retailers a distinct advantage over their brick-and-mortar competitors. Consider the astonishing growth that Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has achieved. According to the company's SEC filings, in 2008, Amazon generated $19.1 billion in sales. That same year, the company generated $1.49 in diluted earnings per share. Since then, the company has grown sales at an impressive clip. Last year, Amazon produced $74.4 billion in sales. That represents an astounding 31% compound annual growth rate over the past five years, and demonstrates the amazing success the e-commerce industry has had.Likewise, eBay is performing well too. Revenue and operating profit are up 11.8% and 7.8%, respectively, over the first half of the year. Not surprisingly, this is due largely to PayPal. PayPal generated $1.9 billion in revenue just last quarter, which represents 18.7% growth from the second quarter last year. The platform gained 4 million new active registered accounts in the second quarter, up 15%.But eBay has a problem. Even though its results look good, still, the stock holds a conservative valuation. Shares of eBay trade for just 15 times forward earnings estimates, which is a discount to the broader market. The S&P 500 Index trades for approximately 16 times forward earnings.Enhance value for shareholdersPayPal is growing much faster than it's getting credit for. By languishing under the eBay umbrella, shareholders aren't being rewarded as much as they could be. If eBay separated PayPal, it would very likely be awarded a much higher valuation than eBay currently enjoys. PayPal is a large and successful enough business to trade on its own. PayPal is a nearly $7 billion business by annual revenue, so it can clearly handle operating as an independent entity.After Icahn's initial push, eBay resisted his advice to spin-off PayPal. The company issued a statement in which it explained its opinion that eBay and PayPal are better together rather than apart. That doesn't appropriately frame the argument. There is little evidence that the market is going to place an above-average multiple on eBays stock. A spin-off could, however, represent the positive catalyst investors need to get the stock moving in the right direction again. eBay trades for just 12 times enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. That is a very conservative multiple.Even Overstock.com Inc. (NASDAQ:OSTK) trades much higher than that, at 18 times enterprise value-to-EBITDA, despite lower growth than eBay this year. Revenue is up 11% through the first six months, but operating profit has declined by 32% in this time period because of significantly higher operating costs. But Overstock still enjoys a premium valuation, even with its operating challenges.If eBay were to reach that valuation, it would represent a 50% return. While it can't be said with certainty that spinning off PayPal would bring that result, it's clear that eBay needs to do something big to propel the stock. Remaining in its current form simply isn't rewarding shareholders."

In the second quarter, PayPal’s net payment volumes grew 29% to $55 billion.About $27 billion, or 15%, of PayPal’s payment volumes last year were mobile transactions, largely ecommerce-related. Apple would have the potential to disrupt about 15% of PayPal's revenue source.Apple’s upcoming mobile payment solution is unlikely to slow down PayPal, which has continued to grow at a healthy clip over the last several years.","As the launch of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) mobile payment solution careens our way, perhaps now is a good time to examine what it really means for PayPal and, by extension, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). The first time news that Apple was planning to launch a mobile payment solution hit news feeds, eBay's shares started selling off by a huge margin, a true testament of the kind of fear that Apple instills in its competitors. PayPal is by far eBay's most important cash cow, bringing in about 45% of its overall revenue each year. Anything that threatens PayPal's future growth is, therefore, very likely to have a negative impact on eBay's growth as well. Let's now look at just how serious is Apple's mobile is to PayPal and eBay.How serious is the threat?Apple new mobile payments solution will be based on NFC and/or iBeacon. It's very likely that Apple will look to focus more on offline payments rather than online ones where the space looks a bit crowded with the likes of PayPal, ISIS by American Express (NYSE:AXP), Google Wallet, and other payment solutions by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Visa (NYSE:V) MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and so on. PayPal, ISIS and Google have made iterations on their online payment solutions to cover physical payments as well, but their efforts have mainly been hampered by the popularity and ubiquity of credit cards. Square is a large mobile payments player, but has of late run into problems with its high cash burn rate and consequently been forced to delay its much-awaited IPOPayPal is by and large an online payments platform, with a tiny presence in offline payments (probably 2% or less of PayPal's revenue). The fact that Apple's mobile payment solution is likely to focus on offline payments therefore eliminates a lot of potential trouble for PayPal.If Apple, however, decides to also launch an online payments solution, it will not automatically mean that PayPal will be backed down to a corner. PayPal's payment volumes have grown phenomenally since 2001. PayPal processed about $180 billion in transactions in 2013. In the second quarter, PayPal's net payment volumes grew 29% to $55 billion. About $27 billion, or 15%, of PayPal's payment volumes last year were mobile transactions, most of which were largely ecommerce-related. This means that Apple would have the potential to disrupt about 15% of PayPal's revenue source.Source: The FinancerGiven Apple's history, however, PayPal would probably have little to worry about. It's not very likely that Apple would be very keen on supporting Android. This would naturally severely limit merchant interest in regions that are Android strongholds such as the EU, China, Latin America and most parts of mainland Asia. About 27% of mobile payment transactions in 2013 were done over an iOS device, with the rest done mainly via Android devices.Source: GlobalWebIndexHow is PayPal going to cope with the threat?eBay has really upped its game in the mobile payments platform. The company has PayPal Here, a smartphone POS dongle that is widely used in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia. PayPal Here was recently introduced in Europe as a Chip and PIN version. eBay has also introduced PayPal Beacon, a hands-free easy way to pay that uses Bluetooth.PayPal's mobile payments have grown even more impressively than its online payments. From less than $1 million in processed transactions in 2006, mobile transactions hit $27 billion last year, with $50 billion in the cross hairs this year.A survey conducted by Thrive Analytics this year showed that PayPal mobile payments is by far the most popular mobile payments platform in the U.S., with almost twice as many people using it than its closest competitor Google Wallet.Source: StatistaeBay went ahead and hedged its mobile payments bet by acquiring Braintree last year. Braintree is a global payments processing company with relationships with the likes of Uber, OpenTable, TaskRabbit, LivingSocial, GitHub, Rovio, LevelUp and AirBnB. The company processed $12 billion in payment volumes last year, of which $4 billion were mobile payments. eBay plans to incorporate Braintree directly into PayPal, and will therefore acquire its customers at zero costPayPal has forged numerous relationships with retail establishments, and lets them accept payments directly into their networks instead of going through merchant processing systems such as Global Payments. This reduces transaction costs for these merchants considerably, which is one big reason that most prefer online payments done via PayPal.Difficulty of physical paymentsDigital payments, such as iTunes that Apple sells, are much easier to deal in than physical goods, primarily due to the less risk involved in these transactions. For instance, if a customer buys two movies from a merchant and uses the merchant's mobile payment processing system, but the goods get lost along the delivery chain, they can claim a refund from the merchant, who will simply give back the money and suffer almost no marginal cost for delivering the item.The story is quite different for physical goods. If this time the merchant is selling laptops and they got lost somewhere along the delivery chain, then the merchant will not only be forced to refund the customer's money, but will also be forced to bear the cost of the lost item.It is this inherent risk involved when selling physical goods that makes mobile payments for physical goods so challenging - and what gives PayPal an edge over its rivals. PayPal has over the years built a comprehensive risk model, and has close to 5,000 employees to handle this, and an equal number to handle the huge customer care needs that come with the business.Moreover, Apple's accounts are tied to credit cards, which implies that for the company to monetize mobile payments, it would have to support tying customer accounts to their bank accounts and transact via ACH, or Automated Clearing House, the way PayPal does in order for it to bypass credit card processing.Additionally, Apple also will have to contend with the limited adoption of iBeacon if it decides to use it in its mobile payment platform.ConclusionApple's upcoming mobile payment solution is unlikely to slow down PayPal, which has continued to grow at a healthy clip over the last several years. The overall mobile payments market is expanding at a fast clip too, giving ample room for Apple's new payment solution to thrive as well."

This report is quite surprising as eBay fought off Carl Icahn's spin-off request just a couple of months ago. eBay replied that its stance hasn't changed but that the board ""will continue to assess all alternatives"". As a reminder, PayPal is the group's most valuable asset. It accounts for more than 40% of eBay's revenue, is the main growth driver (20% revenue growth in Q2 vs. 13% growth at group level) and is valued by analysts around $40bn (60% of eBay's market cap). One of the strongest arguments in favor of the spinoff and of a standalone PayPal is the potential to accelerate revenue growth through PayPal's integration on other large marketplaces [Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)…].As explained in our article ""eBay: A Short Idea On PayPal's Upcoming Woes"", PayPal is a high-quality business and still in a near-monopoly situation, but competition is heating up and is a major threat to the business. Indeed, promising growth prospects and comfortable take rates (3.5% at PayPal in Q2) have been attracting the attention of tech giants Amazon (AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), not to mention start-ups such as Square. Expansion of these companies into online payments is not a question of if but when as reported by many media outlets. Increasing competition will obviously put pressure on PayPal's take rates and margins, suggesting that revenue and earnings growth could stall. In our view, rumors surfacing now about eBay's ambition to spin off PayPal and eBay's comment that the board will continue to assess all the alternatives suggest that something is going on and that eBay's management has probably taken notice of the increasing competition risks. That would be a smart decision to contemplate a (partial) sale of the business right now, before Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook aggressively enter the payment market and put pressure on PayPal's earnings and valuation.If eBay moves on PayPal, the main question will be whether eBay retains a significant stake or unloads most of its shares. If eBay retains a large stake, it will remain exposed to the above-mentioned risks. And if it does not move fast enough, PayPal's valuation will probably suffer from the announcements around online payments made by Apple and peers in coming months. In all, we remain sellers of the stock as we believe that the upside scenario (eBay moves extremely fast and unloads most of its shares) is unlikely at the moment."

Its volumes are increasing and it is well positioned to capture the transition to m-commerce.eBay is focusing on increasing penetration in the emerging markets and recently launched a website for Latin America. Census target price and relative valuation show an upward potential.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is one of the leading e-commerce businesses and is at the forefront of the rapidly growing e-commerce and m-commerce platforms. Its ability to partner with traditional retailers and merchants is superb. EBAY is capitalizing on the growing trend of shifting from brick-and-mortar retailers to the e-commerce platform. With over 150 million active accounts, EBAY is the world's largest online marketplace. With its leading payment platform, PayPal, EBAY has strong long-term prospects as the global commerce evolves.Some Challenges on a Long Successful JourneyEBAY experienced a lower growth figure in same-store-growth in the month of July and its growth rate decreased to 9.7% compared to June's same-store sales growth of 12.3%. Auction decreased by 8% in the month. As the transition to e-commerce proceeds, the industry is becoming increasingly competitive and EBAY has to strengthen its competitive position. The fall in matrices was partially due to the data breach in May but EBAY is expected to use it strengths to cope with these bumps along the long road to success.EBAY is Increasing its PenetrationEBAY is expanding its target market at a rapid pace and is successfully increasing its commerce volumes. In the 2nd quarter of 2014, EBAY managed to increase its enabled commerce volume (ECV) to a record level of 61,639 reflecting a growth of 26% YOY. As mobile commerce's penetration increases, mobile ECV's percentage of total ECV also increases. During the 2nd quarter of 2013, 15% of the ECV was mobile ECV. In the 2nd quarter of this year (2014), mobile commerce's share has increased to 20%. EBAY is in a strong position to capture the exploding growth in the m-commerce platform as this transition continues.Source: Investor PresentationEBAY managed to increase cross-border trade by 26% in the 2nd quarter of this year. EBAY is at an important position to fuel international trade as the world becomes a global village. This important position is expected to give EBAY long-term growth in its top and bottom lines in the coming years as economies become more integrated over time.EBAY is aggressively increasing the strength and penetration of PayPal to realize the full potential of this electronic payment platform. EBAY is launching PayPal in 10 new countries.On the mobile-commerce front, EBAY won another 6.6 million new buyers and accounts. EBAY's success with the mobile platform is evident in the fact that about 260 million eBay Inc. apps have been downloaded so far.Positive Payment Operating MatricesPayment operating matrices show that EBAY is continuing its growth momentum in key matrices. Global active accounts have grown by a healthy 15%. Net number of payments increased 21% YOY. eBay's global penetration rate increased to 79.8%. Transaction margins have also increased in the quarter compared to previous quarters. These matrices provide evidence of continued efficient operations of the expanding payment business.Source: Investor PresentationExpanding in the Emerging Market of Latin AmericaEBAY is focusing on capitalizing on the growth potential of emerging markets. EBAY's launch of the Spanish and Portuguese versions of its popular website is a very important strategic move that will enable EBAY to exploit the large growth potential in emerging Latin American economies. EBAY has also acquired machine translation company AppTek to help the company with its global expansion. EBAY's Spanish and Portuguese websites are expected to generate more business since they include the important features such as availability of local deals and promotions, and the use of local currency instead of US dollars. Presently, Latin America has a rapidly growing customer base of over 2 million customers.Growth in Top and Bottom LinesEBAY has managed to grow its top line by a healthy double-digit growth rate. The report from its most recently ended quarter show that its top line grew by 13% compared to the same quarter last year. The top line's growth momentum continues.Source: Investor PresentationEBAY was not able to maintain its previous double-digit EPS growth. EPS grew by 9% YOY in the latest reported quarter. The operating margin has also declined over the past two quarters but it is still a healthy double-digit figure of 24.4%. EBAY needs to regain the double-digit EPS growth rate. Through its proactive strategy and aggressive expansion to capitalize on e-commerce growth, EBAY is likely to continue to experience significant growth in its top and bottom lines in the coming years.Source: Investor PresentationProviding Shareholder Returns through Share RepurchasesEBAY rewards its shareholders through share repurchases. During the last quarter, EBAY repurchased 32.4 million shares using free cash flow of $1.7 billion. There is still $2.2 billion left to be repurchased in the coming quarters. EBAY utilized $1.2 billion of commercial paper to fund the stock buyback and this will help EBAY make its returns and optimize its capital structure.Attractive Upside Potential at Current PriceAnalyses of average target price provided by 36 brokers show that EBAY's stock is undervalued and that upward potential exists. The mean target price is $59.50 with an upward potential of about 12% at the current price of nearly $53. The median target is $60 with an upward potential of 13%.

2451875,66403,2014-08-26T13:59:48-04:00,"Seth Klarman's Baupost Group, a strictly value-oriented firm, revealed a new position in eBay in its 13-F filing.The Information reports that two PayPal CEO candidates informed them that the CEO pitch includes the eventuality of a spin-off, maybe as early as 2015.Amazon's move into the unprofitable, niche card-reader business presents no competitive threat to PayPal's core business.","IntroductionMy previous article on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), which can be viewed here, presented the view on June 6 that eBay was unlikely to fall very far below $50 because it was a high-quality business trading at attractive levels at a key resistance level. Even though the stock has since moved over $55, it continues to look like a good investment even though its fundamentals are slightly less attractive. The recent news flow suggests the market agrees with my viewpoint.If you held those October 55 calls I suggested in my last article then you're up a little over 2x, but it's been a bumpy ride to get there, so I won't elaborate on how I thought it was a masterful trade. eBay is a great buy today.Baupost Group's Second Quarter Entry PointSeth Klarman's flagship value fund has generated over ~$20 billion in profits for its investors and sticks to a strict value strategy. During the strongest bull market in U.S. history from 1995-1999, Baupost ignored the noise in technology stocks and still generated strong returns while buying put options the entire way up.The firm manages $27 billion but owned a little over $6 billion in U.S. equities on 6/30, if that helps provide a window into Klarman's views on valuation in the U.S. markets. Still, Baupost saw the quality of the respective eBay and PayPal franchises at the right price and opened a $222 million, or 3.6%, position.An entry point alongside a firm as storied as Baupost reaffirms my confidence in the position as a value play at a great cost basis. The competitive risks were the biggest question mark for me, and now I feel more comfortable because Baupost stresses quality value investments that have a low chance of permanent capital loss.PayPal Spin-Off Reportedly in the WorksThis section will contain a bit more social science than fundamental analysis. I understand that some dislike the approach, but companies are run by people and people are driven by social science in large part. Michael Milken did say that the best investor is a social scientist.The Information reported that eBay had told suitors for the open PayPal CEO position that spinning off the subsidiary is an eventuality, something I strongly believe. Donahoe then came out saying that their plans haven't changed but all strategic alternatives would be considered, but the story was not denied.CEOs can't flip-flop at the risk of losing their credibility. PayPal is the future of eBay; a rough estimate that I've seen thrown around is that the subsidiary makes up about 2/3 of the parent company's value on the low end, and I think that's accurate. In order for eBay to recruit a top-tier talent as CEO, they essentially have to promise them that PayPal will spin off from eBay, maybe sooner rather than later, so that they can assure their autonomy.The health of the firm's most valuable business is critical to the firm's future success, and a stand-alone entity with a strong, technologically sound CEO sets PayPal up for success better than if it were under the eBay umbrella. I think Donahoe knows his hands are tied, and he must eventually spin off PayPal in order to make the payments giant more agile. If PayPal flops due to its perceived inflexibility under his watch, he knows he will be to blame.This Bloomberg interview with ex-eBay and ex-Square executive Keith Rabois and Emily Chang provides some good colour on how an investor should think about the behind-the-scenes. I don't agree with everything Rabois says, but he is knowledgeable about payments and has insight that I would never have as an individual investor.The interview is especially interesting because Rabois ends up talking at length about Square, which is distinctly related to my last item of business: competition from Amazon.Amazon Entered the Unattractive Personal Card Reader BusinessRabois clearly has an equity interest in Square and wants to talk his own book, but I think the overall impression he gives of the company is quite negative.Chang eventually asks up front, ""Can Square ever be profitable?"" Rabois responds that Square has 34% margins, which are ""higher than a lot of the companies on your show"". What Rabois fails to acknowledge is that those 34% margins are gross margins, and Square is a highly unprofitable business.eBay's stock dropped on news that generally stated that Amazon had entered mobile payments and was competing on pricing with PayPal. In reality, the news was that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had entered another largely unprofitable business (surprise surprise), so this was in fact noise. As soon as I saw headlines of ""price competition"" in payments, I knew that Amazon had not entered PayPal's lucrative mobile payments market but had rather begun its own point of sale card reader business.The first rule of payment processing is that under the current regime, rates are standard at 2.9% + $0.30 for smaller transactions. Here are Google's rates (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon's rates if you would like to double check. You cannot charge lower than these rates if you want to process your payments on the current 'rails' or processing infrastructure, which are operated by Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) through the ACH, or Automatic Clearing House. In order to process payments as PayPal does, a corporation needs an ACH origination bank. If you were previously uninformed of this arcane system, Wells Fargo is PayPal's ACH origination bank.Yet, this arcane system has many benefits to modern society. The Durbin amendment was going to dismantle the old system, but that choice would have been ignorant, as cash economies have implicit costs that taxpayers must bear. The two main reasons are that cash is very expensive to keep up and being forced to transact in cash reduces the will to spend. Tax evasion is also blunted by electronic payments, but the effects are not hugely significant.Privatizing a little profit for what really is good for society (even though it may not seem like it) is likely best for everyone in terms of cost-benefit. eBay, luckily enough, gets a chunk of this privatized profit with its huge moat, and that is a big part of what makes the company high quality. (Many thanks to SunTrust's Andrew Jeffrey for this insight on the esoteric payments industry).ConclusioneBay is still a great buy. A well-known value investing firm initiated a position, the company's best asset should get spun off in the next 12-18 months, and Amazon's movement into payments is little more than a side show."

We would even say that the pie will probably grow even faster with mobile payment initiatives from Apple and peers likely to attract new customers. But if we assume that the market grows at 20-25% and that PayPal loses 10-20% market share, its revenue growth could be halved in coming years.

While it's difficult to summarize everything that was mentioned in the interview, the key points of PayPal becoming a larger payment services company, paired with further integration into off-line retail channels, helps to flesh out key growth catalysts going forward.PayPal wants to position itself in the contextual environmentThe next generation of the web is likely to be significantly more contextual. However to understand ""context"" this article may help to explain the topic a little better.Going forward, more devices will improve information flow, and it will allow consumers to experience e-commerce in the real world. Instead of walking into a shopping store, running around the store to find items to purchase, it's possible that a retail experience will become similar to e-commerce, in which a consumer can pick and choose products from a mobile device, a robot will bring the products to the consumer, and the payment will be processed wirelessly.However, the enabler of this type of commerce is mobile devices, advanced artificial intelligence, paired with a further abundance of information, along with user specific data. In this up and coming world, mobile commerce solutions like PayPal will become more important as it is an enabler to various commerce models that have yet to exist. However, PayPal mentions the challenges this new retail environment will have on both merchants and retailers.Laurent Le Moal (PayPal VP of EMEA):However, Laurent Le Moal explains how mobile apps are integrating with PayPal and flourishing in the real world environment:Commerce won't necessarily be about purchasing goods and having it shipped via delivery services. The web or the web of things will allow for retail transactions to become much more streamlined, and more personal. In this environment, integration of digital wallets and transfer services like PayPal will drive volume for merchants in ways that wasn't anticipated five years ago.PayPal has global ambitionPayPal has significant growth potential just by offering payment transfer services in more markets. Which is why, in a different article I penned, the global payment transfer business was discussed in further detail:Assuming PayPal continues to expand into foreign markets, and offers further support and services unique to PayPal, payment volume has further room to accelerate. Total payment volume accelerated from 27% to 29% between Q1 and Q2 2014.Laurent Le Moal mentions that the ambition for PayPal is very large:Thankfully, the world is a very large market, and earning a small fee from cross-border transactions is a proven business model that already works for PayPal. However, building further scale into it, so it can improve the process of cash transfers globally, will put PayPal on a compelling growth trajectory when comparable to peers in the space (Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and AliPay).ConclusionPayPal is well positioned in an environment where commerce will be driven by mobile devices. Mobile will drive commerce volume through PayPal's platform. However, commerce volume will also come in other forms, like further expansion into emerging market economies, which will allow for remittance and other transactions to occur more seamlessly.Since a payment platform requires significant users to scale effectively, paired with ongoing relationships with merchants, and back-end infrastructure, the business has a solid durable advantage. eBay also trades at a reasonable valuation when compared to peers in its space, and it also has a solid track record of generating growth and returning cash to shareholders, making it a compelling investment opportunity."
2474195,62833,2014-09-05T12:35:08-04:00,"Activist investor Carl Icahn sparked interest in the shares this past January with his stock purchase and subsequent proposal to spin off Paypal.A cyber attack and Mr. Icahn's formal withdrawal of his proposal to separate the company's Paypal business changed investor sentiment overnight, sending the stock lower.The ""story"" takes another twist as eBay discloses that it may in fact spin off Paypal as part of a plan to unlock value for shareholders.A good fundamental backdrop and another large hedge fund purchase adds to the picture that makes eBay an attractive investment at current levels.","I wrote an article about eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) back in March, when I believed the stock was on the cusp of a breakout, as shares jumped on news that activist Carl Icahn had taken a stake in the company. Investors welcomed Mr. Icahn's purchase, but it was the message to spin off the ""Paypal"" division in an effort to unlock ""value"" in the company that sent shares higher.Prior to this announcement, I had been a shareholder in the company, initiating a position in December 2013. My enthusiasm for the company led me to target the shares as one of my 2014 stock picks.eBay Inc. (EBAY), headquartered in San Jose, California, is a leading global e-commerce marketplace bringing millions of buyers and sellers together to exchange goods and services. The company has over 16,000 employees and a localized presence in 24 countries across the globe.Now, let's fast-forward eight months to the present, and we find that eBay has, in fact, underperformed the major indices.I believe this underperformance comes from a myriad developments that have taken place. From the outset, it was clear that the company wasn't too happy with Mr. Icahn's assessment of the present management team. This set the stage for some vigorous debates between both sides. eBay's management team issued their rebuttal to the Icahn proposals by stating:A clear indication that they were not at all interested in following Mr. Icahn's proposals.The battle lines were drawn, and the suggestions that CEO John Donahoe may not be the best man for the job followed. However, a look at the company's stock performance under Mr. Dohanoe's leadership suggests that investors shouldn't jump to conclusions, as eBay shares are easily outperforming the major averages while he is at the helm.Source: eBay Shareholder RelationsIt should also be noted that Mr. Donahoe was the architect for strategic changes in the company by spinning off ""Skype"" and adding ""Paypal.""The 'back and forth"" debates continued through April, making for an unsettled situation, and this ""overhang"" contributed to the stock price weakness. The technical ""breakout"" I envisioned was now history, as both parties ended the proxy fight on April 10th, when eBay reached an agreement with investor Carl Icahn. Mr. Icahn formally withdrew both his proposal to separate the company's PayPal business and his two nominees to the company's Board of Directors.What went unnoticed and seemingly dismissed by investors was the commentary from Mr. Icahn that ensued. Here are excerpts taken from the Company's April 10th press release:Investors weren't impressed, as the shares continued to drift lower through the remainder of May. However, I believe that commentary is ""telling"" of what may lie ahead.The Technical Picture:Shares bottomed in November 2013, moved higher and subsequently ""broke out"" of the trading that had previously capped the share price at $58. A subsequent move lower to retest those November lows amidst the negative backdrop ensued, setting up a potential ""double bottom"" pattern.While investors were disenchanted that Mr. Icahn had ""publicly"" changed his mind about the fortunes of eBay, another round of bad news hit the scene. A cyber attack on the company's databases affecting user passwords and personal information occurred during the early part of May. Management responded by issuing a press release indicating that it had no evidence that the attack resulted in any unauthorized activity for eBay users, and no evidence of any unauthorized access to financial or credit card information.There was more price weakness as the Paypal division leader decided to leave to take on a position at Facebook.The damage was done, and the analyst community quickly jumped on board, as Wells Fargo issued a ""caution"" and a downgrade for the shares. The stock reacted accordingly, and the shares slumped to the $48 level in June, a share price last seen in November 2013.July and August saw the stock stabilize and recover somewhat, as the company released some positive news developments:In August, the company released news that Paypal launched its new mobile payments platform, ""One Touch.""However, the return to the ""story"" of spinning off Paypal had investors interest piqued once again, as the company reported that it has been ""telling potential recruits for the position of PayPal CEO that it's considering spinning off the payments business as soon as next year.""Fundamentally SpeakingHighlights from the company's July 21st second-quarter earnings report.During the second quarter, the company repurchased 32.4 million shares of its common stock for approximately $1.7 billion. As of June 30, 2014, the company's remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $2.2 billion.A snapshot from ""F.A.S.T. Graphs"" indicates the shares are not overvalued, given the company's growth levels.Connecting the dotsI believe it's important to go back and review the commentary from Carl Icahn that I noted above. It clearly indicates that soon after the ""public"" announcement on his withdrawal of the proxy, he then indicated that he was ""privately"" having discussions with eBay management. At the same time, Mr. Icahn not only retained his original 27.8 million share investment, but added 3 million shares during the second quarter.Hardly an indication that Mr. Icahn is ""throwing in the towel"" on his mission to unlock value with the ""Paypal"" issue.Value investor and hedge fund manager Seth Klarman added another ""dot"" to this story with his purchase of 4.4 million eBay shares during the second quarter as well.So while there have been ""ups and downs"" in this ongoing story, the positive highlights that are currently being presented can be summed up as follows:When connected, these ""dots"" should have investors sitting up and taking notice. While it is difficult to know what may or may not develop vis a vis ""Paypal"", what is apparent is that there are some ""heavyweight"" investors involved. I view them as key players in this story, and investors should not mind having them as partners.Given the backdrop that is now presented, and with shares selling in the middle of their recent trading range, eBay appears to be an attractive proposition. In my view, the risk/reward setup is slanted in favor of slowly building a position in the shares at these levels.Best of luck to all!"
2431545,39301,2014-08-18T09:51:02-04:00,"eBay has experienced difficulties with cyber attacks and competition.Despite these short-term difficulties, the stock is slightly undervalued and growth rates in its payment business are robust.I forecast that eBay will trade at $58.05 by the end of 2014, and I also believe the growth trajectory of the business is intact.","Based on third-party sales channel data, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is still experiencing some headwinds following the eBay market place hacking from May of 2014. However, even with a slight drop in volume, the business carries strong fundamentals.Investment thesisI think the forward P/E of 15.57 is way too low relative to growth potential, and risk factors. Furthermore, key performance indicators like enabled commerce volume growth, paired with opportunities for further expansion in developed and emerging markets, makes it a compelling investment opportunity.While competitive headwinds from neighboring e-commerce websites have weighed heavily on the company in prior quarters, I think that the business has a competitive moat across its payment ecosystem, and its third-party market place still carries reasonable volume growth. Also eBay has made a successful transition to mobile on both PayPal, and eBay, positioning the company reasonably well when compared other mobile apps (Groupon, Four Square, Amazon, and etc.)The use of share buy-backs, and the relatively high profitability of the business, when compared to other opportunities in its space, also makes it very appealing. I think the combined impact from top-line growth, moderate cost efficiency gains, along with continued capital returns will allow eBay to trade at a significantly higher valuation in future years.Notable data-points and key-performance indicatorsSource: ChanneladvisorThe data provided by Channeladvisor is its proprietary same-store-sales metrics, and to get a basic idea of how it works, I suggest you follow this link, and read into it, in more detail. It's not fully representative of eBay's gross market place volume, nor does it include details from certain sales segments, however, it does give investors a basic idea on how e-commerce stores are performing on more of an aggregate scale.Looking at the data, same store sales growth has declined, and it's more in-line with broader industry growth trends. The slower growth rate is to be expected, as triple-digit growth rates are very difficult to sustain in any industry, especially e-commerce. When translated into eBay's consolidated performance figures, the data aren't too discouraging.Source: eBayLooking over the data points, the FX-Neutral year-over-year growth declined from 11% to 8%. The growth rate has declined by 3 percentage points. However I think this decline in growth is likely to be temporary, and it's a lot less severe than what could have happened, which is why investors are starting to get back into the stock.Source: eBayAlso, PayPal, the payment platform that eBay runs, wasn't too negatively affected from the May database hacking. The payment volume grew on a year-over-year basis, and this was driven by expansion into other emerging markets, paired with further penetration into the eBay marketplace.Source: StatistaPayPal remains the most dominant payment platform. Out of 2038 U.S. consumers polled, 79% of respondents have reported that they have used PayPal's payment services. The relatively high penetration rate, along with further expansion into emerging markets, gives the company exposure into domestic e-commerce volume growth, paired with emerging market payment volume growth. I think investors are well positioned by investing into the e-commerce, and payment platform.Bottom lineThe payment business exhibits fairly attractive growth rates, and has the highest market share among peers in its space. Ecosystem synergies between marketplace and payment, along with continued expansion opportunities in emerging markets should drive top-line growth over the next five years. Bottom line growth will happen incrementally, as take-rates from transactions, paired with falling costs per transaction drive incremental transaction profit. The impact from share buybacks will also drive EPS growth; therefore, low to mid-teen EPS growth looks sustainable over the next five years.I'm initiating a buy rating on eBay; my EPS forecast for 2014 is $3.03. My price forecast is $58.05 on 19.16 times earnings. I think the core investment thesis is still intact despite competitive headwinds, along with unforeseen difficulties with cyber security. The stock has 10.2% upside over the next four months, based on my price forecast.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The reader will plug into the headphone jack of mobile phones and tablets, just like Square, PayPal and others in the industry. This move is a definite negative for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), as PayPal represents a staggering 54% of its operating income.Source: WiredAmazon, similar to other endeavors, will undercut its competitors. It will take a 2.5% cut of each card swipe, which is less than Square's 2.75%, and Paypal's 2.7%. Further, Amazon will give merchants an incentive to sign up, as they will give them a special rate of 1.75% until 2016 if they sign up by October 31. Amazon will have an advantage over others in the industry, as merchants will have access to data on sales trends, peak sales times, as well as more information. Coupling this off sale information with its current database will allow Amazon to have a superior database of retail sale info.In my previous article, ""The Dynamic Payment Industry - Will eBay Suffer?,"" I opined that the payment industry was being commoditized and eBay would falter because of the trend. I also discussed how Amazon was already entering the industry with the announcement of allowing customers to automatically pay recurring charges by using their Amazon log-in credentials.

2426715,28151,2014-08-15T09:49:58-04:00,"Amazon is making another push into a crowded industry, hoping to steal market share with their usual strategy of undercutting more established players.This would seem to bode poorly for currently dominant PayPal, but I believe they are well enough established, especially with larger retailers, to fend off Amazon's charge.eBay shareholders stand to benefit from the continued strong performance of PayPal, while Amazon shareholders could see just another unprofitable foray into a low margin business.","Yesterday, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced further expansion of their mobile payment initiatives, rolling out a credit card reader and associated payment app dubbed Local Register. This takes square aim at the similar service popularized by, fittingly enough, privately held Square. It also targets (no pun intended since Target hasn't rolled out their own payment system, although they do have a thriving credit business) other players in the mobile payments game including eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) PayPal and Intuit's (NASDAQ:INTU) GoPayment.In typical Amazon fashion, they have come in with the lowest prices, offering an introductory 1.75% fee for new customers who sign up by Halloween, and 2.5% thereafter. This undercuts the 2.7% and 2.75% fees charged by PayPal and Square, respectively. Therefore, Amazon is banking on attracting new customers by offering price breaks, with their vice president of local commerce, Matt Swann, saying in the press release that they've ""heard some business owners say the only thing that would make them change (point of sale) systems is cost savings.""If Amazon is correct and makes significant inroads into the payments arena, we would certainly expect this to negatively impact the established players, a sentiment echoed by this article. While I often joke that no one can compete profitably with Amazon, not even Amazon themselves, I feel that this is not as big a threat as initially perceived.For one thing, Amazon is only targeting small businesses at first, and if they try to expand into larger retailers, the very same ones they're often engaged in cutthroat competition with, they might meet with some stiff resistance, especially since their system collects information on each transaction, presumably to try to figure out how to route even more sales through Amazon.Also, people seem to be underestimating the current leaders in this area, especially PayPal, which has incubated under eBay's watch for over a decade now. They have obviously done a fabulous job expanding the business, such that it now contributes 45% of revenue as of the latest quarter. The even more impressive thing is that, unlike some of Amazon's ventures, eBay managed this growth without sacrificing profitability.Coming out of the downturn, eBay has managed to grow EPS from 26 cents in 2007 to $2.20 last year, with a peak of $2.50 in 2011. Earnings the next couple years are expected to eclipse this mark, with average analyst estimates just under $3 for this year and $3.40 for next. Meanwhile, the share price has gone nowhere the last two years and is now trading at forward P/E ratios under 18 and 16 based on 2014 and 2015, respectively.We all know that Amazon has been going in the other direction, from $1.15 in 2007 up to $2.58 in 2010 before turning negative in 2012. Amazon posted a meager EPS of 60 cents last year, but earnings are again predicted to come in negative this year after their most recent disappointing second quarter and even worse guidance for the third quarter, with a possible loss of $800 million predicted on the low end.While analysts have kept the faith that earnings will rebound to around $2 next year and then presumably accelerate from there, it's worth mentioning that this delayed gratification has been continually put off, with estimates coming down over a dollar for both periods in just the past month.The mantra of the Amazon bulls is that they're ""investing in the future."" Well, I've got news for them: so is eBay. They just seem to be going about it in a more focused manner, buying a logistics company in 2011 and growing it into their underrated Enterprise division, which helps manage the online sales and distribution for a number of other retailers, something I covered in more depth in my previous article on eBay. Instead of competing directly with them like Amazon, this further demonstrates eBay's willingness to form profitable partnerships, such as with South American rival MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) and historic auction house Sotheby's (NYSE:BID).Amazon has adopted a more scattershot approach, seemingly trying to singlehandedly be all things to all people. While this has paid off in some cases in their quest to be ""The Everything Store"", such as with AWS becoming a dominant player in cloud storage, not all their initiatives have been home runs and even fewer seem to be profitable.They have not seemed to make a dent in some of the other high profile markets they've entered, such as streaming video. Despite Amazon investing billions in this area, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has continued to thrive and has become the dominant player, although they could have avoided this if they had just bought Netflix when they had the chance, like I suggested.Also, as with their initial push into tablets with the Kindle and then the Fire, this is also likely to be the case with the Fire Phone, whose high price and lukewarm (pardon the oxymoronic pun) reviews make it seem more likely to flop than generate the much anticipated profits the company may have had in mind with the aggressive pricing and consumer targeted features.Maybe mobile payments will be different, and Amazon will be able to use their vast scale, deep pockets, and secure cloud based technology to become a major player, but I highly doubt this will happen any time soon. The incumbents such as PayPal and Square are too well established to cede too much market share no matter how much money Amazon throws at the problem.I think investors are overestimating the benefits of this development for Amazon and the effect it will have on competitors. Just for reference, the $3 billion plus gain in market cap Amazon tacked on yesterday on the news is more than half the entire valuation implied for all of Square in their last funding round.PayPal has a more than 10 year head start and is already benefiting from a well established network effect, so Amazon has a lot of catching up to do. Therefore, so I would look to buy eBay on any weakness related to this perceived threat and avoid Amazon for the time being, at least until they can start to demonstrate more consistent profitability or cash flow.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in EBAY over the next 72 hours.

2460385,39301,2014-08-29T14:12:51-04:00,"eBay plans to expand its credit portfolio; Bill Me Later is in its early growth stages.While Bill Me Later doesn’t contribute significantly to sales, it offers significant synergy.Since eBay monetizes e-commerce transactions in multiple ways, eBay can leverage its model to offer significantly lower interest rates to competing lenders.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) continues to expand into untested yet strategic areas that offer adequate growth potential. These new areas (Bill Me Later and a consumer loan portfolio) will supplement PayPal's growth going forward.PayPal's next major category, consumer lendingCurrently, one of eBay's faster growing segments is the bill me later category, which is eBay's version of extending credit to consumers so they can buy more products and services. In the most recent earnings conference call, eBay's CFO, Bob Swan, goes into greater detail about its credit business (Bill Me Later), and strategic partnerships, along with ways to extend its reach into the credit business.According to Bob Swan, CFO of eBay:Using those figures, Bill Me Later has an estimated volume of $514 million, as domestic merchant service volume is $20.589 billion, and of that amount 2.5% share is $514.7 million. The Bill Me Later segment is near non-existent on a financial basis, meaning that it doesn't have a very meaningful impact to earnings or revenue. However, this part of the business will grow at a rapid pace due to BML's integration into eBay's ecosystem, along with rapidly improving consumer awareness.Also, according to Bob Swan, PayPal is planning to make credit a bigger part of its core strategy going forward:PayPal plans to integrate more closely into the established payment ecosystem of credit cards by buying the loan portfolio associated with PayPal branded credit cards. This has significant implications as eBay is developing a more vertical ecosystem for commerce. This ecosystem effect may have significant implications for eBay's growth trajectory going forward.Bottom lineInvestors should anticipate the BML segment to become a larger contributor to eBay's consolidated revenue and net income figure. Assuming eBay is able to earn interest on a high-quality portfolio of consumer loans, eBay will be able to monetize its ever expanding installed base of users.A bill me later transaction on eBay's marketplace platform will be monetized through insertion fees, final value fees, transaction fees (from PayPal) and interest income (from Bill Me Later/Credit portfolio). A unique characteristic of eBay is the ability to extend credit at lower rates, as it can monetize the same transaction in other ways. Assuming eBay offers the lowest interest rates among lending institutions on transactions via its various web properties, eBay can become a dominant lender in the e-commerce space."
2408175,70395,2014-08-11T04:16:00-04:00,Data breaches may suck away both buyers and sellers.eBay’s foray into live auctions with Sotheby’s could create new customers for both firms.Perceived lack of direction is causing confusion.,"Over the past couple of months, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has taken proactive measures to counter the potential damage of a recent data hack on its customer base. From study groups to measure the impact of the security breach, eBay hopes to learn what actions it can take to counter negative views. An incentive for participating in a focus group session - an ""opportunity to come to the eBay campus and get paid $150"" will no doubt bring lots of participants, but one might ask, why not listen to the community of sellers and buyers you've already built? They seem to be particularly vocal on eBay chatboards with opinions on what the company can and should do. Unfortunately, online attacks continue as reported by Ina Steiner of EcommerceBytes.com in early August: eBay Accounts Breached through Live Chat.In April, eBay announced they would send a $3 billion dollar payment to the IRS in order to capture another $6 billion in unclaimed overseas profits. At the time, company CFO Bob Swan was quoted in Reuters as saying, ""We are an acquisitive company and we need to ensure we have the resources available to capitalize on targets that become available."" But he also added, ""To be clear, we are not announcing any large U.S.-based acquisition.""But if the company isn't going to use the money to acquire, then why take the tax hit? Could eBay need the cash infusion to keep things running smoothly at home and facilitate a company stock rebuy plan announced about the same time?Under the leadership of Chief Executive John Donahoe, eBay has worked hard to revamp its business from a focus on auctions to a general marketplace with well-known brands and fixed prices. These changes have caused turmoil and defection among the smaller businesses that once were eBay's base. Hence, amazement when eBay announced in July, 2014 a partnership with Sotheby's (NYSE:BID). Over ten years ago, in 2002 eBay promised to power Sotheby's auction website, but that partnership ended the following year. Now the two firms have a new initiative, but many auction goers are skeptical, including this writer.This is not the first time eBay has ventured into the world of ""high end"" auctions, or spent serious money acquiring firms, only to sell or disband them later. Butterfield and Butterfield was a large American auction house, founded in 1865 by William Butterfield in San Francisco. Purchased in 1999 by eBay for $260 million, only three years later it was acquired from eBay by British auctioneer Bonhams and is now defunct.However, the art market is riding a high and if eBay can launch a Sotheby's online auction line, it could increase revenues at both firms. According to Artprice, the global art auction market rose in value by 17 percent to a record $7 billion in the first half of 2014. Artprice is a French company which tracks art auction results worldwide. According to Artfixdaily, during the first six months of 2014, art works sold at public auction brought a total $7.15 billion, approximately a billion above the $6.11 billion spent in the same period in 2013.This writer doesn't want to sound negative on Ebay. Indeed, one of my first stock purchases years ago was eBay after they announced their IPO. I made money on that purchase and have subsequently done the same on downturns. Currently selling in the $54 mark, some might think it time to buy since the company held an almost $60 high in February. According to MarketWatch, RBC Capital's Mark Mahaney, in a note to clients, eBay ""has enough momentum in its current markets, growth potential in those markets, new investment initiatives in place and execution competence to consistently deliver at least low double-digit earnings per share growth.""Really?I don't share Mr. Mahaney's enthusiasm. eBay continues to exhibit bipolar tendencies that make me nervous. Contradiction of company policy makes me wonder if there is no policy at all. Who exactly is leading this ship, and where are they headed? Until Mr. Donahoe can shed more light on company direction, I'll remain a holdout on purchasing eBay stock. I fear the company has reached the apex of their value, and I'm not willing to risk the downside.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2336005,22989,2014-07-24T00:15:29-04:00,"eBay issued $3.25 billion of debt from three to ten years.While on an absolute level, the yield doesn't seem attractive, relative to peers it is compelling.The 2021 debt has a decent position on the curve and ""roll down"" potential.","As was somewhat expected in the market, online retailer and payment company eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) issued $3.25 billion in debt.Details of the offering are:The deal is broken down among the following maturities:The prospectus can be found here.Covenants include:eBay Inc. is a global technology company that enables commerce through three reportable segments: Marketplaces, Payments and Enterprise. The Marketplaces segment includes the eBay.com platform and its localized counterparts and related commerce platforms, such as online classifieds sites and StubHub. The Payments segment is comprised of PayPal and Bill Me Later. The Enterprise segment provides commerce technologies, omnichannel operations and marketing solutions for merchants of all sizes that operate in general merchandise categories and includes our Magento business. eBay ""enabled"" $205 billion of total commerce volume in 2013 and, as of June 30, 2014, the Marketplaces segment had 149 million active buyers and the Payments segment had 152 million active registered accounts.eBay has strong debt metrics, as one would expect given the nature of the company. Some of the debt metrics, graphically, are:As evidenced above, the company generates significant free cash flow which can service debt and support growth. Trailing twelve month free cash flow equaled just North of $4 billion.You will note that ""net debt"" has not been used as cash is not necessarily held for the purpose of repaying debt. That said, eBay has accrued $3 billion of deferred taxes on $9 billion of the $9.8 billion of cash held overseas - essentially giving them the ability to repatriate a net $6 billion into US cash. While net debt is not used, this accrual and ability to repatriate cash into US accounts is a credit positive.Further, debt is covered by EBITDA (.84x EBITDA) and occupies a very conservative amount of the capital structure (17%).Income has also been healthy and generally growing. Net income recently took a hit due to a large tax bill.EBITDA margin has been holding in near the 30% level, but has recently taken a dip. This is somewhat of a concern, but will have to be monitored to see if it continues to trend this way.At June 30, 2014, eBay had approximately $4.1 billion of senior unsecured notes outstanding; approximately $1.2 billion of senior unsecured indebtedness outstanding under their $2.0 billion commercial paper program; no indebtedness or letters of credit outstanding under the $3.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and $3.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under their senior unsecured revolving credit facility (of which $2.0 billion of available borrowing capacity is reserved to provide liquidity support, if required, for the commercial paper program); and no secured indebtedness outstanding. At June 30, 2014, eBay subsidiaries had approximately $12 million of secured indebtedness outstanding and approximately $17 million of unsecured indebtedness outstanding (recall that the debt of subsidiaries is structurally senior to that of the parent company).The distribution of this debt (including the new maturities) is as follows:The largest debt maturity year is 2019, with approximately $1.8 billion of debt coming due. Trailing twelve month free cash flow is $4.5 billion. Debt maturities should not strain the financials of the company.Having shown the conservative financial profile of eBay, let's now take a look at the existing debt and new debt of eBay (new debt is shaded green and bolded).As the table shows, the new debt came at a concession to outstanding debt, but only marginally. I tend to favor the 2021 debt due to its spot in the belly of the curve and the pick-up available coming out of the 2020 existing debt (+41bps and take out 4pts). You should also be able to realize the roll of the benchmark from the 7yr to the 5yr in time for potential Fed rate hikes.Next, let's take a look at the eBay credit curve (new issues marked in orange):While the new issues help define the curve, they fall above the curve and make them attractive within the eBay debt complex. Note that the existing 2022s are attractive as well.Then eBay on a basis point per unit of duration (BPUD) basis to get a picture of the value of ""rate risk"" (again, new issues in orange):On a BPUD basis, all three new issues are valued near where you might expect them to be. On this basis, the new 2019s are still compelling.Of course, we have to look at the bonds versus comparables. The peer group being used for eBay is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), Macy's (NYSE:M), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). eBay is difficult to find comparables to as it is retail on a technology platform, payments and enterprise.First, a look at the fundamentals:As you would imagine, eBay compares very well to the selected peer group.Next we move to the peer relative value table to discern if eBay bonds compare favorably to their peer group's bonds:The peer group credit curve (note existing eBay bonds in green, new eBay bonds in orange).The new seven and ten year debt is attractive relative to the curve.And on a BPUD basis:The new bonds on a BPUD basis are also attractive relative to their peers.Bottom Line: I believe that the new eBay bonds offer compelling relative value versus their peers and the existing debt of the company. While many investors may not be attracted to the absolute yields, relative to similar options and existing debt, there is an opportunity here. While they may not have significant upside due to the rate environment, there is the potential for marginal spread compression versus their peers. Given the potential for rising rates and the relative spread levels, the 2021's are compelling due to their position in the belly of the curve (which should outperform in a rising rate environment) and their ""roll down"" from a seven year benchmark to a five year benchmark.CUSIPs on the new bonds (from the term sheet):2017 Floating Rate Notes: 278642AM592019 Floating Rate Notes: 278642AJ212019 Fixed Rate Notes: 278642AH642021 Fixed Rate Notes: 278642AK932024 Fixed Rate Notes: 278642AL76Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Retail sales are weak too - growing 2.4% in Q1.Yet, ecommerce remains strong - growing 15% in Q1. Even in a stagnant economy there are secular growers.EBAY's key metrics are growing even faster than ecommerce. Off-EBAY PayPal usage is accelerating. Merchant Services Total Payment Volume grew 33% y/y in Q2 2014.EBAY's shares have been flat for six quarters, but intrinsic value continues to grow.","While the overall economy's slow growth presents an investment headwind, there are still opportunities. Of course, sales growth is not a prerequisite for investment success. Plenty of people have gotten rich buying depleting assets like oil wells. Price paid is always the determining factor. But, secular1 growth has its merits, particularly in a world where growth is scarce. A growing company with a competitive business advantage can reinvest capital at a high rate. Owners can compound their return rather than continually look for the next place to put the proceeds of their royalty stream (to use the oil well analogy again).Two of the most powerful secular growth trends today are the shift from offline retail to e-commerce and the shift from physical currency to cashless transactions. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is well positioned to take advantage of both of these trends.The first half of this year was full of noise and distractions for EBAY: publicly-hostile correspondence with activist investor Carl Icahn (who did make some good points), a security breach that forced a system-wide password reset, and a new algorithm from Google that had a detrimental impact on search results for eBay listings. Despite these challenges, EBAY grew Enabled Commerce Volume (ECV) 26% year-over-year in the second quarter. This is up from 20% in the first quarter of 2013. And, it is significantly better than the already strong growth in ecommerce. The US Census Bureau estimates ecommerce grew 15% in the first quarter compared to 2.4% for all retail sales.2While EBAY's company-wide trends are strong, PayPal's trends are even stronger. Every single metric is solid, but we are particularly excited to see Merchant Services Total Payment Volume growing at an accelerated rate - from 26% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2013 to 33% in the second quarter of 2014. This tells us that PayPal is NOT just being used within eBay's Marketplaces. More and more, it is being used across ecommerce (and even offline) to facilitate payments.Figure 2 - EBAY's payment metrics slide from the Q2 2014 earnings call shows strong growth in merchant services TPV.We first discussed our eBay position in our third quarter 2013 letter. At the time of that letter, EBAY shares traded just above $50. We wrote, ""We initially purchased eBay shares in December 2011. At the time, eBay was unloved trading at 18x 2011 earnings per share and just 12x 2012's prospective earnings. Since then, eBay's shares have returned over 75%, but that return was all in 2012. Shares have been flat throughout 2013."" It is now nine months later and we can say shares were flat for all of 2013, as well as the first two quarters of 2014. In other words, our EBAY investment has not produced results for six quarters. However, intrinsic value has grown significantly. This is the more important metric for the long-term investor.While the economy is growing at low-single digit rates, EBAY's industry (ecommerce) is growing in the mid-teens, and EBAY's participation in this industry (its ECV) is growing in the mid-20s. Yet, EBAY trades at the same multiple as the S&P 500. With the S&P 500 at all-time highs and growth scarce, there are few bargains. We think EBAY is one.This article is an excerpt from our Q2 2014 quarterly letter.1 A trend that is neither cyclical nor seasonal but long-term in nature.2 Click hereDisclosure: The author is long EBAY.

(NASDAQ:EBAY) was hit by a cyber attack last May, in which 145 million customer accounts were made vulnerable. The company has seen its search rankings fall recently and its payment chief depart, resulting in further turmoil. Growing competition also remains a problem, with competing mobile payment systems from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remaining a major headwind. These issues alone have caused the share value to decline by nearly 11% in one year. However, after eBay announced its second-quarter results this week, the shares climbed by more than 1.5% in after-hours trading after the U.S. market closed.In this article, I will discuss the company's earnings and the performance of the recently ended quarter. I will also outline the future potential of this online reseller.Second QuartereBay's quarterly results were lower than expected but still positive, as revenue climbed 13% to $4.4 billion. The company's commerce network continued to gain market share, with total company commerce volume, ""ECV"", increasing 26% to $62 billion. Mobile ECV increased by 68% to $12 billion. The mobile trend continued to grow as more and more consumers shifted towards purchasing items using their smartphones. The company now delivers nearly 20% of its volume through the mobile channel. International expansion also remained healthy, with cross-border trade growing 26% and representing 22% of the company's total ECV.PayPal signed a deal with GE Capital to offer a dual-branded retail credit card, and planned to purchase the loan portfolio in 2016 for an estimated $1 billion. The action seemed reasonable, as it will provide PayPal the flexibility to expand its credit offerings to consumers and merchants, while improving its ability to manage transaction expenses and reinvest for future growth.PayPal also continued to expand, as net total payment volume, ""TPV"", grew 29%. Revenue was $1.9 billion, with 4 million new accounts opening. While the total revenue growth was below the guidance figures, I believe that, given the present competition environment, sustaining growth was a challenging task. This is because only buyers representing 80%-85% of volume have reset their passwords following the cyber-attack, and many have not yet returned to their previous activity levels. eBay needs time and efforts such as targeted marketing to reengage these and other users back to its website. I suggest investors refrain from worrying about guidance figures and concentrate on absolute return measures. In that sense, eBay delivered a good top line last quarter and there wasn't anything to worry about.Source: PresentationMarketing expenses rose due to attempts to attract more customers, owing to dwindling numbers after the cyber attack. Product development expenses rose slightly as the company attempted to offer a better customer experience. A general trend that became evident was the fact that eBay is spending more to engage and retain customers. While general costs remained nearly constant, the company was able to extract diluted earnings per share of 53 cents, reflecting an increase of 8% in comparison to the figures of the same quarter last year.eBay's expansion plan continues, as the firm announced its plans with Argos in the U.K. to expand its Click & Collect service to approximately 650 stores. The expansion puts the shopping feature within 10 miles of most of the U.K. population. By year-end, it is expected that 65,000 eBay sellers will offer items that can be purchased online and picked up at an Argos store. The move will allow eBay to extract Argos's consumer base and those customers to shop on eBay and use PayPal for their transactions.Secondly, PayPal is now supporting eBay sellers by extending credits to small merchants to help them grow. The program will loan $1 million a day to small business merchants, giving them access to capital. This program will bring an edge to the company's strategy, especially after Google changed its search algorithm, which is now negative to eBay. This loan extension is likely to go beyond mere advertising through word of mouth, and is needed by merchants for their own business growth.Bottom LineThe online retail sales in the U.S. will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 10% over the next few years and account for 10% of total U.S. retail sales by 2017. eBay is expected to benefit from this trend. With 60% users now using multiple screens to make purchases, eBay will also cross-benefit from the integration of mobile shopping interfaces. The growing market, together with recovery after the cyber attack should also support eBay's marketing and customer-gaining efforts. For all of these reasons, I recommend buying the stock.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2324625,59361,2014-07-20T03:00:30-04:00,"eBay released its earnings on Wednesday which resulted in positive price action for the stock on Thursday and Friday.The Analysts have revised their price targets but still hold eBay as a Buy.Overall however, with respect to eBay in particular the analysts have been statistically wrong.Within this article we discuss this and some possible reasons for this overly optimistic attitude towards eBay.We also provide our data in excel for your own download and analysis.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) saw positive action after it released earnings on Wednesday. While not beating consensus estimates, the second quarter came off rather well with respect to year-over-year comparables.The analysts for the most part still have eBay as a buy, with positive price targets revised slightly lower. According to the Analysts Network, the consensus estimate is at roughly 14% - 15% in upside potential. After an earlier surge in the stock price due to the Icahn attempt to split PayPal from eBay, analysts had expected more from the stock. Now, they appear to believe it is still a buy, but not with as high a potential for increase, and therefore they have decreased the price targets marginally while keeping them higher then the actual stock price.We can discuss many things with respect to eBay, I think some other Seeking Alpha authors have done an excellent job at this. You can read a quick assessment of the earnings and a brief summary of the current market position in another Seeking Alpha article right here. I think if this article was summed up in a SWOT analysis we would see a lot of dangers ahead for eBay. Among the threats we would see that Alibaba's emergence in the United States will impact eBay, as well as the increasing differentiation in the offering of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). With Google continuing to expand into the market area of PayPal, which is eBay's most profitable component, we can easily see that the threats seemingly outweigh the positive opportunities for eBay.Icahn was most likely correct in his analysis which indicated that the company was better in stripping down its value chain and spinning off PayPal. This would have resulted in a more tightly run eBay and PayPal with value chain activities more closely tailored to the individual customers that each company serves.Once again, enough has been said on this topic and you can read about it almost anywhere. The above linked-to SA author appears to believe that the stock is not a buy because the company has little upside potential from a strategic perspective and also from a stock valuation multiple perspective (or fundamentals perspective). What I would like to contribute to the potential investor is a quick analysis of the performance of analysts with respect to this stock, because they have it as a buy despite the negatives.Analyst Performance:Here is a visual snapshot of the historical performance by analysts during the last year as plotted out against a timeline by TipRanks.Other then the point in March when the stock increased due to Icahn attempting to break the company into more economically efficient units, the stock has essentially been running flat despite the analyst consensus rating the stock as a buy.I put together a simple linear regression analysis which can be helpful in determining the value of analyst contribution to the discussion. The Analyst Network (as linked to above) was used for two years of data consisting of 187 different price targets. Google Finance was used for the actual price info. For the excel spreadsheet containing all of this data and the regression models and all of the formulas you can download it right here.Below are two charts with the subsequent average price plotted along the y-axis as the dependent variable and the price target set by analysts along the x-axis as the independent variable. In this way we can determine how much of the change in price is explained by the analyst price target.This is the analyst price target plotted against the subsequent closing average price for the duration of one month:And here is the subsequent average closing stock price for 6 months as plotted against the analyst price targets:What is important to recognize here is that the points are all over the place indicating that the analysts really haven't been able to figure out the key drivers that contribute to this stock's success or failure. This is a problem. Perhaps the investing community is overly hopeful with respect to eBay's potential, while the company is unable to focus on a key area to drive value creation. Perhaps the company is actually a strong company, but unfortunately structured in a way that cannot allow management to realize its full potential.So just how successful have the analysts been over the last two years? We can answer this in the following chart:Our R^2 shows the fitness of the regression model. As one can see we have 0.2515 or 25.15% accuracy for the 6 month model and 0.3615 or 36.15% level of accuracy for the 1 month performance. This means that analysts have had price targets that correlated with the actual price performance about 1/3rd of the time with respect to 1 month performance and about 1/4 of the time with respect to 6 month performance. This is not very good, even for Wall Street Analysts.Conclusion:So what is the point in all of this? It is easy to get lost in the math and the data. But really the story here isn't in the data, the numbers, or the regression analysis. What this data shows us and what the regression analysis really shows us is that analysts have a historically inaccurate appraisal pertaining to the future performance of this stock in particular. We often see this in companies that are actually rather good with respect to many functions considered separately, but where the company continues to struggle due to managements ability to run a company with fragmented market exposure. eBay has many positives, but it also has trouble aligning its value chain. eBay has the online auction business and the PayPal online banking business. As Icahn had suggested, it is probably time for eBay to seriously consider aligning its value chain to the market need. I am therefore not a buyer of eBay currently, but I will be awaiting positive changes along the side-lines.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2319915,25120,2014-07-17T09:09:52-04:00,"eBay reports second quarter earnings which are in line with expectations.Investors are relieved amidst a security breach, a high profile departure, a fight with Icahn and competitive threats.CEO John Donahoe has a lot of work ahead, I like the company but not yet at this price.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported its second quarter results on Wednesday after the close. Investors were relieved with the report which was essentially in line with consensus estimates as some were fearful that all the recent bad publicity and developments could have had a bigger negative impact on the business.That being said, CEO John Donahoe has a lot of work to do for the remainder of the year. Despite the recent underperformance I remain cautious amidst fierce competitive pressures.Highlights For The Second QuartereBay posted second quarter revenues of $4.37 billion which was up by 12.6% compared to the comparably period last year. Revenues missed consensus estimates at $4.39 billion.Earnings growth was limited to 5.6% with earnings advancing to $676 million. Share repurchases managed to boost earnings per share growth to 8.2% as earnings rose by four cents to $0.53 per share.On a non-GAAP basis, earnings were up by six cents to $0.69 per share. This came in a penny better than anticipated.Looking Into The ResultsAs is very clear, PayPal is the growth driver behind eBay's continued expansion. Revenues at PayPal rose by 19.8% to $1.95 billion, making up nearly half of total revenues. Underlying this growth is a 29% increase in commerce value being enabled to $55.0 billion.The number of accounts rose by 15% to 152.5 million while the total number of payments jumped by 21% to 850.2 million. The so important ¨take¨ rate which are the revenues as a percentage of revenues came in at 3.53%. This is down 26 basis points compared to last year, and down 2 basis points on a sequential basis.Marketplace revenues came in at $2.17 billion. The namesake and traditional business posted 8.6% revenue growth compared to last year. Total enabled commerce volume rose by 12% to $20.5 billion.And last is the relative small enterprise business which posted a merely 3% increase in sales to $267 million. Margins are relatively high but are shrinking as commerce volume jumped by 15% to $940 million.It is clearly disappointing to see earnings growth trailing topline sales results. Operating costs jumped by 90 basis points while gross margins were down by 70 basis points. Part of this of course has to do with the fact that enabled commerce volume at both PayPal and eBay's marketplace outpaces actual revenue growth amidst price and rate pressure. Higher operating costs were the result of strategic investments as well as costs associated with the security breach.Given today's heightened focus on taxes, realize that eBay only reported a 15.8% effective tax rate, far below statutory tax rates. This is as much money is earned abroad, which does result in sizable repatriation charges when cash is being send back home.OutlookFor the current third quarter, eBay sees revenues of $4.3-$4.4 billion which would imply sales growth of 12.1% at the midpoint of the range.Despite flattish sequential revenues, earnings are expected to face more pressure. GAAP earnings are seen between $0.51 and $0.53 per share, down from a reported $0.53 per share in the second quarter. Non-GAAP earnings are set to fall towards $0.65-$0.67 per share.The third quarter outlook looks soft compared to consensus estimates with analysts anticipating earnings of $0.70 per share on sales of $4.42 billion.Full year sales are seen at $18-$18.3 billion which implies $5.0-$5.3 billion in revenues for the so important holiday quarter. Non-GAAP earnings are seen between $2.95-$3.00 per share. This is as the company expects to post a tiny profit on a GAAP basis for the year due to tax repatriation charges taken in the first quarter.ValuationeBay ended the quarter with $12.4 billion in cash, equivalents and short term investments. Subtracting $5.3 billion in debt, results in a net cash position of about $7.1 billion.Trading around $51 per share, eBay's equity is valued at $64 billion which values operating assets at $57 billion. This values the company at roughly 3.1 times sales and roughly 20 times GAAP earnings after backing out cash repatriation charges.Given the healthy balance sheet, eBay is already returning cash to investors as it bought back $1.7 billion worth of shares during the quarter. At the moment its board has authorized management to repurchase another $2.2 billion worth of shares.Multiple Headwinds Are Affecting eBayCEO John Donahoe is having a rough year. He is aiming to fence off competition in the two core businesses, has to deal with activist investors, saw a huge data breach and faces the results from changes in algorithms at Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) search engine.Competition is hurting eBay in both the payment and market place unit. PayPal is still dominant, but attractive take rates have attracted interest from start-ups, while industry giants like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google are looking into the area as well. Amazon is furthermore a big competitor in the marketplace business in which it is reporting superior revenue growth, while traditional retailers are ramping up their e-commerce investments as well.Perhaps following the much anticipated public offering of Alibaba later this summer, the Chinese e-commerce giant could become a worthy competitor on at least a global basis as well. Reports indicated that the Chinese giant is entering the US e-commerce market after previously mainly focusing on China.Furthermore Donahoe witnessed a very public and though fight with activist investor Carl Icahn, which urged Donahoe to spin-off the PayPal unit. The company and Donahoe settled the disagreements with Icahn but the poor share price performance, which has caused losses for Icahn at current levels, will undoubtedly pressure Donahoe.The breach resulting from a cyber attack has had in impact as well, with eBay asking customers to change their passwords back in May. The effects of this were notable in the short term, being a big driver behind operating costs increases. At last was the departure from PayPal's boss David Marcus which was highly regarded. Marcus left for a top job at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Final TakeawayThe market is relieved by the numbers, possibly anticipating a bigger impact from the recent weaker news and distractions. That being said, enabled commerce volume of $61.6 billion was up by 26% as a sizable portion of these volume gains were offset by compressing take rates.Shares now trade around 20 times earnings after backing out the net cash position. While growth is still impressive at lower double-digit rates, there are clearly plenty of reasons to worry. Of course competition and continued pressure on take rates are two of my main concerns which could erode the core businesses.Long term investors have seen their up and downs. Unlike many competitors, shares actually peaked in 2004 and not during the dotcom bubble. Shares fell from $60 that year to lows of $10 during the crisis, but underlying growth at PayPal which it acquired about a decade ago has pushed up shares significantly. Since the end of 2012, shares have now largely traded in a $50-$60 trading range, lagging overall markets and technology stocks in recent years.The valuation has therefore become more appalling based on price-earnings ratios, while the competitive risks are larger as well in my eyes.At current levels I don't view the risk-reward opportunity as compelling enough. Trading around $45 per share I might be included to pull the trigger.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company continues to grow itself both through acquisitions and organic growth.As online and offline retail converge and as mobile becomes a key driver of disruption and innovation, EBAY is uniquely positioned to benefit.Addressable market opportunity in emerging markets and mobile should continue to drive growth.","eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) has been receiving a lot of bad press lately and the stock is down 6% YTD as a series of incidents/events, including departure of a key executive, a penalty imposed by Google, the recent security breach, and the technical breakdowns, had a negative impact on the stock. However, despite the near-term challenges, the long-term growth potential remains. The company continues to grow itself both through acquisitions and organic growth.EBAY, which started as an auction based company, is little like what it was when it started back in the mid-1990s. EBAY's transformation in its business model over the years has been commendable. The company has transformed from an auction based retail model to a more comprehensive payments and market place model. The company has huge addressable market opportunity in mobile and in international markets (especially emerging markets), and these new markets should continue to drive strong revenue growth in the coming years.The retailing company operates in three segments: Marketplaces, Payments, and GSI. eBay.com and StubHub are included in Marketplaces while Payments services include PayPal and Enterprise. Marketplaces and Payments generate approx. 70% of the company's overall earnings.With Growth in B2C E-Commerce Sales, User Base Has a Significant Potential to GrowThe San Jose, California based company has the largest online payment network with more than 100 million active users. The company added approx. 20 million accounts to its database in 2013 alone and the active registered user accounts have increased approx. 86 million during the 2007-2013 period. According to eMarketer, the global business-to-consumer [B2C] e-commerce sales are anticipated to increase by approx. 20% to $1,500 billion during 2014, led by the growth in mobile usage in emerging markets, advancements in payment and shipping services, and geographical expansion.The growth in B2C sales should continue to have positive impacts on EBAY's earnings. In fact, the company's first quarter reported results showed the impacts of these above mentioned factors and the tailwinds are expected to continue to impact the ratios for the rest of the year as well because of EBAY's continued investment in expansion of its product categories and PayPal's interface.Marketplaces Expected To Stay Profitable Despite CompetitionThe online retail company is struggling to stay in place in its marketplace division because of tough competition. Although the company has made a number of changes to its business in order to remain relevant, none of them have enabled EBAY to gain market share as expected by the company. However, still the company is expected to grow its sales at least in line with the e-commerce growth.The e-commerce market is highly efficient where consumers look for trust, value and selection. EBAY offers a wide variety of more than 550 million items such as clothing, used goods, car parts and collectibles to select from. While the company boasts a wide variety of goods, it doesn't offer any high tech must have items to offer the online buyers who largely belong to the digital generation. However, with respect to value, the company is offering the goods at pretty competitive prices.When compared to mass market retailers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), the company lags behind in providing quality service to its users as it has no control on shipping costs and delivery timing, which are two very important factors for online retailers. Despite this, EBAY has done a pretty good job with respect to gaining the trust of its users by improving sellers, rankings, and moving best vendors to the front.Going forward, eBay is partnering with traditional retailers to increase its selection of the offered goods. This move is also expected to resolve the delivery issue faced by EBAY and enable it to get the product to consumers within 1-2 hours. The company is also working towards simplifying its product by adding collections (curated items picked by either users or experts) to its site. This would not only result in a more simplified product but would also make it more interesting and engaging for users, and would also add a social element to the shopping.Although the company is innovating and expanding, the measures taken by the company are similar to what many of its peers are already offering. In order to really re-invigorate traffic and sales the company needs to do something additional in order to make it habit forming.PayPal - The Star PerformerDespite the challenges from established financial companies, PayPal has grown into a worldwide market leader in the financial services sector. EBAY acquired PayPal in 2002 for approx. $1.5 billion, which amounted to approximately one quarter of all of eBay's reported transactions. At the moment, PayPal accounts for nearly half of the company's $65 billion market capitalization. The biggest advantage to PayPal's users is its ability to facilitate cross-border transactions due to its huge infrastructure. PayPal has license to operate in 193 countries and it has built relationships with 1500 financial institutions. PayPal has built an infrastructure, which is hard to replicate.While PayPal has shown tremendous performance in the online space so far, it is expected to show a similar performance as the mobile payments become truly mainstream. Mobile is going to be one of the key growth areas for PayPal in the future not only in developed countries but also in the emerging markets of Latin America and Asia. Although the segment has been performing exceptionally well, it can grow further if the company shows a more aggressive behavior towards innovation i.e., its new product launches through more aggressive marketing and product plans in the future.PayPal Spin-off?Although the fight with renowned investor Carl Icahn appears to have cooled down, I do not believe that the uncertainty regarding PayPal's spin-off is resolved yet, as is evident from the CEO's comments during the first quarter call. At one point, he stated that a ""full separation doesn't make sense at this point"" and at another time he stated ""the company is better together, for now."" I think the company has just put to rest the issue as of now but it expects PayPal monetization sometime in the future.I think the management made a good call by not spinning off PayPal at the moment, as it would have only resulted in an equity gain in the short term. From a competitive viewpoint, with the increasing trend towards online shopping, every major e-commerce retailer is launching its own online payment method. The Chinese company Alibaba has its online payment service by the name of Ali Pay. Similarly, Mercado Libre has Pago. According to me, the current market structure doesn't preclude eBay from working with other partners, so a spin-off wasn't going to help. Moreover, PayPal isn't able to generate as much free cash flows as it needs. The combined company gives PayPal greater access to capital to grow the business and therefore I do not think that PayPal is at any disadvantage by remaining part of eBay. In fact, it is actually in favor of PayPal to remain part of the combined company.Compelling ValuationAs I mentioned in the beginning, EBAY shares are down 6% YTD as a series of incidents/events, including departure of a key executive, a penalty imposed by Google, the recent security breach, and the technical breakdowns, had a negative impact on the stock.The company is trading at a significant discount compared to its peers and the industry. The company has an EV/EBITDA of 12.4 as compared to 41.6 of the direct competitor Amazon and 17.1 of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). Moreover, the company has a price/book of 3.3 compared to the 15.8 of Amazon and price/cash flow of 12.7 compared to 31.0 of Amazon. Finally, EBAY is trading at forward price/earnings of 15.7 compared to 70.4 of Amazon.ConclusionDespite all the negative attention that EBAY has attracted this year, the company has a little downside risk going forward. EBAY's turnaround in its fundamental marketplace is expected to continue to gain traction and the PayPal division is anticipated to gain share both online and offline. The company made a sound decision of not spinning off its PayPal division as it would have resulted in only a short-term gain in the equity. Going forward, one thing that can hamper the company's upside potential is the increased competition faced by the company from its peers in both the consumer cyclical and financial services industries.Although the company is growing itself both organically and through acquisitions, it is also to be noted here that these are weighing heavily on its cash flows. Still the company's management is making a number of encouraging moves in terms of execution and return of capital. While I do acknowledge the near-term challenges the company faces, I see long-term potential in EBAY.Note: EBAY will report 2Q14 results after market close on Wednesday, July 16, 2014.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

(NASDAQ:EBAY) is slated to report Q2 2014 earnings after the bell on Wednesday, July 16th. The earnings release is expected at approximately 4:15 p.m. EST, with a conference call to follow at 5:00 p.m. that is webcast through eBay Investor Relations. This internet consumer-to-consumer corporation is now a multi-billion dollar business with operations localized in over thirty countries and a component of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes.Outliers & StrategyKey measures:Adjusted earnings per share and revenue guidance for Q3 2014, FY2014, and FY2015:Recent NewsTechnical RevieweBay shares consolidated mostly in a $50.00 to $57.50 trading range since late 2012, below which is limited support at $40, so a weak earnings release could have a larger-than-normal effect on the stock price. The 200-day moving average at $53 is roughly at the mid-point of the previous range, where traders favoring an upside breakout may show more interest. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryeBay has beaten consensus the last three quarters by 1c to 3c, so the company beating by 1c on slightly higher-than-expected revenue would be almost routine. The company probably needs to report above $0.70 on revenue of above $4.39 bln to be viewed favorably. Q3 guidance complicates the trade, and analysts are already on the high side of FY 2014 guidance, so the company reaffirming the same range again probably would be a negative.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

Such a scenario would have a -30% impact on eBay's stock price.","eBay a Short opportunityeBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) poor stock performance in the last 18 months has led many investors to assess a long position. As far as we are concerned, we are assessing the situation to recommend... a short position. We are indeed much less constructive than many on the stock's valuation and equity story. Contrary to what many think, the stock's performance has not been dismal, as it's roughly flat in absolute terms vs. early 2013 levels. And more importantly, PayPal, eBay's arm in online payments, is about to face a much tougher competitive environment.As a reminder, PayPal is the group's most valuable asset. It accounts for more than 40% of eBay's revenue, is the main growth driver (20% revenue growth in Q2 vs. 13% growth at group level) and is valued by analysts around $40bn (60% of eBay's market cap).Cash isn't king anymoreThe online payment industry is growing fast, as we are gradually moving towards a cashless economy. What once started with Internet purchases made on a computer is set to encompass everyday purchases made on a smartphone or a tablet.Juniper research estimates that the number of consumers making contactless payments via their mobile handsets will reach 300m by 2017, up from 110m last year thanks to the accelerated rollout of NFC-enabled payment cards and Point-Of-Sale (POS) terminals. There could be significant upside on these forecasts, as several countries around the world are now trying to limit the use of cash and to foster digital payments.Italy, for instance, is now forcing retailers to have Point-Of-Sale terminals and to accept electronic payments (debit cards, contactless payments) for purchases of EUR30 and above.And in Israel, the head of the Prime Minister's Office recently recommended the implementation of major restrictions on the use of cash: all cash transactions over NIS15,000 between individuals and NIS7,500 between businesses would be banned.The goals are quite obvious: reducing tax evasion, criminal activities and money laundering. In our view, most countries will follow these examples soon, suggesting that the digitalization of payments is a secular trend.Increased competition is not a question of if, but whenWhile PayPal is a high-quality business and is still in a near-monopoly situation, the competitive landscape evolution is a major threat, in our view. Indeed, promising growth prospects and comfortable take rates (3.5% at PayPal in Q2) have been attracting the attention of many companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), not to mention start-ups such as Square.Expansion into online payments is not a question of if, but when, as several clues suggest that these companies will be part of the game soon:Potential new entrants have everything needed to succeedThe threat is real. Even if the ramp-up of mobile/online payment processing services will obviously take a few years, these new entrants have everything needed to succeed: a strong brand, technology know-how and large user bases. Large user bases will obviously be key when these companies offer their payment services to merchants and negotiate take rates with them.And worryingly, all these new entrants already store some credit card information.The eBay bulls will probably argue that PayPal has a huge credibility and security track record in the payment space. That's right, but we should not forget that Apple, Amazon and Google already handle large numbers of transactions on their respective sites and app stores... and that eBay, PayPal's parent, suffered a security breach very recently.PayPal/eBay's earnings growth likely to stall in coming years, valuation at riskProduct and competitive disruptions in the tech space can have dramatic consequences on valuations, as illustrated by the Nokia (NYSE:NOK) example. Nokia was worth around $100bn in 2007 before the introduction of the iPhone, and was sold to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) earlier this year for $7bn.We believe that PayPal could suffer a similar fate. Assuming a 40% market share loss within 3 years in a market growing at a 25%-30% pace, PayPal's volumes would grow around 5% a year, which is far from being impressive.Importantly, increased competition will put pressure on take rates and margins, suggesting that revenue and earnings growth will stall.It's quite difficult to figure out a bear case valuation for PayPal, as we don't have full details about the company's financials. But in our view, PayPal's valuation could easily be halved to reflect a much tougher outlook and increased beta. Such a scenario would have a -30% impact on eBay's stock price.The news flow in the coming months around mobile/online payments initiatives from Apple, Facebook and peers will probably act as a catalyst.Disclosure: The author is long AAPL.

Perhaps worse, back in May eBay revealed it was the victim of a cyber attack and recommended that 145 million users change their passwords.

2317225,50682,2014-07-16T08:45:22-04:00,,"PayPal watches as China licenses first foreign e-payments firmChina has issued so many electronic payment licenses by now that I mostly ignore the steady stream of announcements about new licensees, who now number more than 250. I was getting ready to ignore the latest report of a new batch of such licenses, when my attention was attracted by a news bit deeper in the story saying the fifth batch of awards included the long-anticipated first license for a foreign-backed company. The move looks promising for a number of foreign companies that have been waiting impatiently for years to enter the market, led by eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) PayPal online payments unit.I've written quite a few times about PayPal, whose officials are regularly optimistic that they will soon receive a China license to offer domestic electronic payment services. The value of such a license grows with each passing year, as e-commerce in China grows at lightning speed and is on track to surpass the US to become the world's largest market.And yet despite its repeated optimism, PayPal and other electronic payment giants like MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) have had to sit on the sidelines and watch as China's central bank made 4 previous rounds of license awards. Some 269 companies can now offer such services since awards began in 2011, and all are domestic firms.But the prohibition on foreign participation has now been lifted with word that a foreign-backed firm was among the 19 companies to receive a license in the 5th round of awards. (Chinese article) The new licensee is a company called Beijing Chanjet, which is 75 percent owned by foreign backed software maker Ufida.The development looks like a positive step for the big foreign players, though it's a bit unclear why such a relatively unknown name was chosen as the first foreign-backed licensee. I suspect Chanjet has strong connections with the central government, and perhaps its status as a joint venture rather than a fully-owned foreign firm helped it to win the landmark award.Looking more broadly at the bigger players, PayPal has said repeatedly over the last 3 years that it wants to enter the market and that it was cautiously optimistic that it would receive a license soon. It made the latest such proclamation about a year ago, when eBay CEO John Donahoe said he was seeing ""encouraging signs"" that led him to predict his company could soon become the first foreign firm to win a third-party payments license for China.China's regulators are famous for moving notoriously slow, especially in sensitive areas like financial services. In this case, the regulator is almost certainly trying to give domestic players as much head start as possible before opening the market to foreign competition. Perhaps the central bank thinks 3 years is sufficient lead time for such a head start, which seems reasonable.If all that is true, the question once again arises of whether PayPal and other major foreign financial services firms might finally be allowed into the market later this year. The answer could well be ""yes,"" though I suspect that development will have to wait until the end of the year when the next round of licenses may come.If and when PayPal finally gets its license, it could find a potent partner in the business with leading Internet firm Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY). eBay and Tencent formed a partnership last year in the e-commerce space, centered on online clothing seller Xiu.com.Since then, Tencent has shown a strong preference for forming major strategic alliances, and then spinning off businesses outside its core social networking services (SNS) to those partners. If the same pattern holds true, perhaps we could see a major tie-up between Tencent and eBay in electronic payments, which perhaps could pool PayPal's name with Tencent's existing Tenpay e-payments service.Bottom line: PayPal could finally get its long-awaited electronic payment license for China by the end of this year, following the new first license award to a foreign-backed company.Disclosure: NoneEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The consensus expects $0.68 in EPS (+8% y/y) on $4.4b in revenue (+12% y/y). I expect eBay to continue to grow on the back of PayPal given its solid growth profile. Longer-term, I expect PayPal to be disruptive in the mobile payment industry. However, my long-term concern is the intensifying competitive environment for the marketplace business.PayPal leading the wayI see PayPal a potential disruptor of the mobile payment space. While the online payment space is gradually becoming crowded with entrants such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), PayPal has made positive progress into the real world, which I expect to be equally successful given PayPal's brand power and first mover advantage.The PayPal model is truly compelling, in my view. The growing number of PayPal users (~150m and counting) creates a strong network effect that incentivizes merchants to sign up so they can cater to their customers. From the merchant's perspective, the platform allows them to keep track of customer credit card details in an organized fashion, translating to solid user experience. Moreover, innovation such as PayPal Beacon's ""tap and go"" function is facilitating transaction in a way that customers are no longer required to take their phones out to pay, which I view as accretive to building a strong network effect and future revenue growth.Competitive risk a long-term challengeIn the near term, both Amazon and Google are direct competitors to eBay's marketplace business. Moreover, same-day delivery and new product verticals by both Amazon and Google will weigh in on eBay's marketplace growth.Longer-term, Alibaba could be a threat as my conversation with industry professionals indicates that Alibaba is very interested in expanding its presence in North America and draw merchants away from eBay and Amazon by leveraging its ad-based model. Alibaba's recent introduction of its US website, 11main.com, is a testing ground for Alibaba to understand the North American ecommerce market so that it can eventually roll out a larger platform to compete against eBay and Amazon. Just a note, Alibaba's gross merchandise volume in 2013 was ~$250bn, bigger than eBay and Amazon combined (~$180b), so it will not be a surprise for Alibaba to leverage its scale to compete against the North American ecommerce giants.I remain cautious on eBay ahead of result as I don't see PayPal's current growth profile, while robust, offsetting eBay's long-term risk profile.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2313925,22561,2014-07-14T12:31:05-04:00,"eBay faces an oncoming headwind from Alibaba, but Amazon's stock could get crushed.The stock is fairly priced, and PayPal continues to generate strong revenue and profit.eBay's shares are more stable than the overall market.","Background: eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is one of the world's largest online trading communities. The company's shares are heavily traded, with an average of 9.7 million shares per day, and the company has a market cap of $65 billion.Significant competitors include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) and Target (NYSE:TGT). Because eBay is most like Amazon and Staples, I will focus my comparison on them. An argument could be made that Yahoo Shopping should be included, and indeed it once was the premier shopping portal, but as one commenter stated in my Yahoo earnings preview, Yahoo Shopping is all but forgotten. Upcoming IPO Alibaba, 24% owned by Yahoo, is far from forgotten, albeit somewhat unknown.eBay is anticipated to report solid second-quarter earnings after the market closes on July 16, 2014. The consensus estimate is currently about 68 cents a share, an improvement of 5 cents (7.9%) from 63 cents during the same period last year. Analysts' estimates for this quarter range from 64 cents to a high of 72 cents per share. The whisper numbers I've read range from 70 cents up to 73 cents.Analysts as a whole like this company. Currently, eBay has 25 buy recommendations out of 39 analysts covering the company, along with 14 holds, and zero sell ratings. The average analyst target price for eBay is $61.05 on Yahoo Finance, $59.87 on Analyst Ratings, and $60.89 at The Wall Street Journal. The 52-week trading range is $48.06 to $59.70, making eBay a relatively stable stock with a beta of .82.Beta is a measurement of volatility, with 1 representing the market average. Above 1 indicates the stock on average has been relatively more volatile, and below 1 represents greater stability compared to the overall market.Considering the breath of products sold through eBay, it's a fair statement that it competes with just about every bricks and clicks retailer out there, and is a partner for most of them. The partnership comes in part through the auction site, but also from PayPal, eBay's crown jewel subsidiary.EBAY Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsCompared to Amazon 112 and Staples' 11.2 price-to-earnings multiples, eBay's 15.2 is closer to Staples' and reasonably priced. Amazon's P/E ratio is so high - an oxygen mask is required to buy it. A curious situation awaits eBay and Amazon that few fully appreciate, especially Amazon shareholders.Alibaba, the world's largest venue in online sales, is coming to America. First with 11main.com as a testing and proving ground for what surely will entail Alibaba's entry into North America. For eBay, it means another formidable competitor, however, for Amazon it's a complete and unmitigated disaster in the making. I'll get back to this, but let's examine what other investors and market participants are expecting for eBay's earnings through options.Option buyers and sellers are betting on a price change of $2.88 up or down in the stock price, or about a 6% change during the next 8 days.In other words, shareholders or potential investors should reasonably expect the stock to trade as low as $47.45, or as high as $53.21, and still remain within one standard deviation.After last quarter's results, the shares decreased a modest 5%, or $2.71 from the close before the earnings release to the next closing. The final price preceding the report was $54.54, and concluded at $51.83 the next trading session.Regardless of the change in price, investors can capture the time premium between now and after the earnings release by selling call options, while also protecting their portfolio. Simply buy back any calls and or puts sold after the report. If the shares jump higher, what you lose in stock appreciation is likely more than made up through the expected fall in implied volatility after the report.Returning to Amazon and Alibaba, Amazon isn't eBay's greatest threat any longer, Alibaba is. More goods are sold through Alibaba than eBay and Amazon combined. You probably haven't shopped there unless you're a business that imports products from China. You may soon buy products through Alibaba's new site, 11main.com.I expect 11main.com is a ""practice"" site before unleashing a full frontal attack on Amazon and eBay. Regardless of the level of success, eBay and Amazon can expect, at a minimum, margin compression. For eBay shareholders, it means a likely headwind. Amazon shareholders are going to feel some real pain. With a current forward P/E multiple of 120 and trailing-twelve month figure over 200, Amazon is priced for rapid growth.If Amazon's shares fall in half, yes half, the P/E will still be priced for well above average growth. The shopping portal is Amazon's cash cow, and Amazon charges between 6% and 25%, depending on the item. 15% is a good average number for back-of-the-envelope math, and eBay's fees are closer to 10%. Alibaba's success, in part, is based on its low-referral commission rates.I believe Amazon's current sellers will face a choice of less than 5% referral fees from an Alibaba-like U.S. site and Amazon's 15%, and will offer the same products they do now for less. Price-conscious consumers will quickly figure out that most, if not all, of the same products are available on an Alibaba site for less than Amazon.Amazon will face a decision of lowering its fees or losing sales. In either case, Amazon's shares will collapse on the first earnings conference call, when it guides to lower sales and margin than Wall Street expects. eBay is priced more modestly, and as stated above, will have an additional headwind, but it won't be anything like the perfect storm Amazon faces.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2285693,67393,2014-06-25T10:48:53-04:00,"eBay has had some bad press over the past month - does this present an opportunity to buy, or will it hurt the company in the long run?eBay expects strong sales and EPS growth next year but has a significantly lower EV/EBITDA than its competitors.With a CAGR of 19%, Payments is eBay's fastest growing segment and will continue to grow by expanding internationally and developing its mobile and offline point-of-sales platforms.eBay is currently spending heavily on investments and acquisitions, which is a promising sign for future growth.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has been making a lot of headlines recently, but not in a way that is likely to please its investor relations department. The trouble started with a data breach in late May that compromised its entire user database, bringing punitive action from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) that has resulted in lower search visibility of its web pages. Additionally, both eBay Marketplace and PayPal are now facing ramped-up competition from the respective launches of 11 Main, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's U.S. online retail debut, and Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) subscription billing and recurring payments service. On top of everything, PayPal head David Marcus announced on June 9th that he is moving to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to direct its messaging app, and there is speculation that he will also be there to help Facebook develop its own payments service. Reflecting this series of unfortunate events, eBay's share price has dropped near its 52-week low of 48.06, as shown in the chart below.Here at Stock Rover, I've been wondering: do these developments present the perfect opportunity to snap up shares of eBay at a bargain price, or will they instead shadow the company's long-term prospects? To answer this question, I decided to take a closer look at eBay from an investor's perspective.An Evaluation of ValueMy first step was to create a watchlist for eBay and its major competitors in the consumer cyclical and financial services industries. I will compare them in several key financial metrics.What I immediately noticed was that eBay's EV/EBITDA is significantly lower than that of its competitors, about a third less than Visa's (NYSE:V) and MasterCard's (NYSE:MA) and nearly three times less than Amazon's. This indicates that eBay is a good deal less expensive than its competitors. I chose to use EV/EBITDA rather than Price/Earnings, because it accounts for differences in debt structure between the various types of companies on the list.Following this lead, I generated a table of valuation metrics for eBay and its peers:According to these metrics as well, eBay is less expensively priced than its peers. Amazon's lower P/S can be attributed to its incredibly high sales volume. Notably, eBay's low PEG forward suggests a favorable ratio of share value to expected growth.Momentum: Are investors bidding?I wanted to see how investors are currently feeling about EBAY, so I took a look at some momentum indicators. What they tell me is that, from a technical standpoint, EBAY is currently out of favor with investors.EBAY's RSI and MFI indices of around 30 are much lower than those of its competitors, and they indicate that the stock is oversold. This is also illustrated by its current pricing at the low end of its 52-week range.But does all this suggest that eBay is a spectacular value or that something is fundamentally wrong with the company? Because if the company is sound fundamentally, then being so out of favor technically gives the stock potential to bounce back.Checking up on eBay's Financial HealthLet's take a look at its income statement and balance sheet to figure out which of the two cases it may be:eBay's income statement exhibits an interesting trend: its numbers all lie midway between those of Amazon, a retailer, and Visa and MasterCard, payment processors. This makes intuitive sense, as eBay's business is a hybrid of retail and payment processing.Its net income, calculated by GAAP standards, comes up negative because of its recent repurchase of 1.82 billion shares of stock and repatriation of $9 billion in foreign cash, with a tax of $3 billion. Thus, in this case, operating income is a more appropriate measure to go by. Compared to eBay, Amazon has five times more sales but less than one-fifth the operating income. Amazon's cost of sales relative to its sales is also considerably higher than eBay's, revealing that, although Amazon is making more sales, eBay is more efficiently reaping profits.To give a picture of eBay's financial health in the long run, here is a table showing how these metrics have changed over the past 10 years:While the net income, and consequently the net margin, has jumped around a bit, it shows a general upward trend. The operating income has increased every year since 2009, and the operating margin has hovered steadily around 21%. eBay's EBITDA exhibits the same trend, with a healthy 30-31% margin over the past 3 years. It has also seen quite rapid sales growth, averaging 14.6% annual growth over the past five years. Solid margins mean that eBay has ample money left over to spend on acquisitions and improvements to its existing services.eBay's balance sheet (above) also looks clean. While its debt is going up, its cash is as well. As evident in its income statement and balance sheet, eBay has plenty of money on hand to channel into acquisitions and investments to grow its company. In fact, these intentions underlie its aforementioned repurchasing of stocks and repatriation of foreign cash.For a general sense of how eBay is actually using its profits, here is a table showing how its capital expenditures, research, and intangibles have changed over time:Indeed, eBay is channeling significant cash into capital expenditures and research, and even more into intangibles. Thus, eBay is growing not only organically but also via acquisitions. This is definitely a good sign, as it means that the company believes in itself and is looking to grow. Though these expenditures may take a toll on the net income as of now, they should transform into future profits given eBay's track record.Capital Efficiency: Bang for the Buck?eBay's financials seem to show that it is a healthy and well-run company, but let's look at its capital efficiency in order to assess its productive use of capital. The return on assets, return on equity, and return on invested capital metrics tell us whether the investments a company is making are paying off, and thus translating into profits for investors. I've included Amazon for comparison. Since all these measures are calculated with GAAP net income, the results are negative for the first quarter.eBay's return metrics have jumped around, and, while they all move in the same direction, they offer no discernable trend of improvement or deterioration. Thus, as of yet, ROA, ROE, and ROIC are all inconclusive on whether the company's investments are paying off. While it would be preferable to see a steady increase in returns, eBay's numbers are more comforting than Amazon's, which range from the negatives to 2.9% over the past 3 years.Revenue Growth: A Three Act PlayThe big decider of whether eBay is a buy, however, is its potential for growth. eBay's business is broken down into three reportable segments:To see how each segment contributes to the main business, I generated a chart of their net revenue growth over the past five years.Source: eBay's 10K Net Revenue by Type data for 2011, 2012, and 2013Here, we can see that Marketplaces is still eBay's main source of revenue and is seeing steady net revenue growth. However Payments proves to be eBay's main driver of growth. The sector brought in 41% of eBay's total revenue in 2013 and, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.07%, it is gaining on Marketplaces. Slightly slower Payments revenue growth over the past year of 18.9% can be attributed to investments in platform growth initiatives, such in-store PayPal tests and its recent acquisition of Braintree Payments.Enterprise, eBay's smallest sector, is at this time not meaningfully contributing to the company's growth, though it could play an increasingly important role with more and more retailers seeking to build up their online businesses.EPS and Sales Growth: Bidding Up the ValueLooking at eBay's EPS growth gives a better sense of how the business as a whole is growing. The graph below shows that eBay's EPS has fluctuated quite dramatically over the years but is expected to grow by 13.7% next year.eBay's EPS trends also show that analysts are expecting solid earnings growth from eBay going forward, and they are holding steady in that view.Sales are predicted to grow by a similar rate of 14.3% next year, and have seen steady growth for the past 3 years.It's good to see that EPS and sales are growing together, as it means that revenue growth is performing well. Given that eBay is exhibiting steady double-digit growth and healthy finances, it is definitely looking undervalued right now.There are still two important questions to be addressed: Is eBay's current fast-paced growth sustainable in the long run? And can it weather the recent blows it has taken?Is this Growth Sustainable? - Keeping Competition at BayWhile there is no way to predict the future of eBay with certainty, my research leads me to conclude that yes, eBay's growth and competitive advantages will likely persist. Here's why:MarketplacesLet's start with eBay's Marketplaces segment. Marketplaces clearly faces heavy competition from the Goliath that is Amazon, though I feel that there are enough differences between the two online retailers to give eBay substantial staying power. Though Amazon offers a bevy of attractive perks to buyers such as ever-faster shipping and add-on items, eBay is still the place to go if one is on the hunt for excellent deals on brand name, used, or vintage items. Moreover, there will always be a segment of buyers and sellers who favor eBay's auction format to Amazon's fixed prices. eBay has also undergone several changes as of late in order to better compete with Amazon. It has moved away from a strictly auction format to provide more and more fixed price offerings and has revamped its Cassini search engine to create a better experience for users. Just last Tuesday, it launched eBay Valet, an app that essentially sells items for users, from estimating retail value to communicating with buyers, for a 30% commission. It has also put focus on expanding and improving specific verticals such as auto parts and fashion. One such example of this is eBay's recently unveiled Designer Collective, through which customers can shop directly from high-end brands such as Cynthia Rowley and True Religion.In regards to competition from 11 Main, I believe that eBay is safe for now. 11 Main's angle is to create a niche marketplace for local businesses to sell specialty goods rather than to compete with the likes of Amazon and eBay. And though it's hard to tell how 11 Main will grow in the future, eBay, with some 145 million users, has a wide economic moat. Current users of eBay and Amazon won't make a shift unless they have a significant incentive to do so, and both companies are innovative enough to grasp on to their customers.The data breach, too, should not have a major impact on eBay. Given the performance of other companies, such as Sony and Adobe Systems, that have undergone similar breaches, eBay's long-term stock price should not be negatively affected, and most of its customers will not be deterred from using its services. eBay surely is well aware of its cyber security flaws and will take steps to correct them.Lower search engine visibility for eBay webpages on Google is rather problematic, as it is likely to cause some sellers to flee to Amazon. However, sellers should take comfort in knowing that many customers, myself included, search for products directly from eBay.com rather than through Google. eBay may also be able to come up with ways recover its Google rankings. For now, it looks like eBay Marketplaces' biggest threat is still Amazon, not search visibility.PaymentsEven if Marketplaces sees slower sales in the future, Payments should have no problem carrying the company's growth. PayPal currently has over 148 million active accounts worldwide and is seeing continued expansion through the development of its mobile platform and offline point-of-sales services in partnership with Discover (NYSE:DFS). PayPal is also well positioned for emerging markets: 40% of its active user growth is coming from mobile users, which are on average younger, and it processes 20% of global online retail transactions, as estimated by Morningstar analysts. It is true that PayPal faces heavy competition from the likes of Visa's V.me, Amazon's Payments, and MasterCard's PayPass, just to name a few. However, like eBay, PayPal has a strong economic moat due to the vastness of its user network - it will take a while for new competitors to amass a comparable user base, and current users may be discouraged by the switching costs. Moreover, PayPal has made several very smart acquisitions that have further increased its reach and value. For instance, PayPal's acquisition of Braintree in 2013 not only gave it merchant account, payment gateway, recurring billing, and credit storage capabilities but also Venmo, the popular app that allows users to pay friends directly.Recently, eBay has announced some exciting developments for its Payments sector. It plans to build an office in Chicago, where Braintree is headquartered, and pledges to hire 360 employees over the next three years. It also launched PassPort last week, which is a site that will provide its merchants stats and information for selling internationally. Alongside the development of PassPort, PayPal has acquired AppTek, a company that creates machine translation and automatic speech recognition software. These moves clearly point to eBay's emphasis on growing its Payments sector, especially in terms of mobile and international expansion.When PayPal acquires startups, it also acquires the brains and talent behind them, such as Braintree president Bill Ready and eight members from the AppTek team. These additions, in lieu of former director David Marcus, will hopefully provide the innovation eBay needs to keep afloat of looming competition.ConclusioneBay's current business is definitely in the right place at the right time: ecommerce, mobile and alternative payments, and international markets are all pegged to see high growth. Added to that, eBay has a load of promising investments under its wing. For a profitable business that is growing extensively, its low valuation right now makes it a compelling long-term value. Though the heavy competition it faces now and in the future should be taken into consideration, EBAY is still a stock I'd add to my cart.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2273433,23142,2014-06-17T16:31:33-04:00,"Too many people love tech.Not enough people love free cash flow.""Competition is the enemy of competence"".","The first time I saw the movie, Napoleon Dynamite, I walked out of the theater before the final wedding scene. This caused me to miss Napoleon's brother Kip singing ""Always and Forever"" to his new bride, LaFawnduh. The key line in the song was, ""I love technology, but not as much as you, you see!"" Kip found LaFawnduh ""in a chat room,"" which indebted him to technology.It seems to us that the US stock market, as represented by the S&P 500 Index, falls in love with technology even when it is not finding LaFawnduh. The newness and wonderment associated with technology creates a disconnect with the purpose of a business. For the sake of our discussion, LaFawnduh is revenue which generates profit and free cash flow. We believe the purpose of a business is to meet an economic need and to profit the owners in the process.At Smead Capital Management, we have noticed lately that clouds, eye balls, tweeted selfies and a wide variety of aspects of technology have become the stars of the show. It appears that profits and free cash flow have taken a deep back seat to the excitement over what could be, but might never be. In a way, Kip loves the possibilities of technology more than he loves LaFawnduh, the wonderful byproduct of his time spent with technology.An extreme historical example might be helpful. In 1999, there was a public company called eToys. US investors at the time were jacked up about the possibilities of the worldwide web without any long-term evidence of who might survive. eToys had about $41 million of sales and was losing millions of dollars. It had an $11.4 billion stock market capitalization near its peak. At the same time, Toys-R-Us had $11 billion in revenue, a $300 million profit and a $2.5 billion market cap. At the time, it seemed the stock market loved the possibilities of the Internet more than it loved profits and free cash flow (LaFawnduh).Does the current affection for technology hint at a disconnection similar to 1999 for tech investors? Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has revenues and revenue growth with little profit and little free cash flow in relation to its capitalization. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has eyeballs (including mine), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) has tweeters (including Smead Capital), and LinkedIn (LNKD) has users (including me). The question we ask is do they have profits now and in the future which will justify the current stock prices. In other words, is there any chance of finding LaFawnduh via the technology? Can they make us ""salivate"" over existing and future profits and free cash flow?Charlie Munger explained to Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting attendees that ""Competition is the enemy of competence."" When asked how to determine where you have competence, Munger said, ""If you are 5'3"" tall, don't try out for the NBA."" It seems to us that everybody wants to try out for tech among today's 15-30 year olds worldwide. We see the primary problem with investing in cutting edge tech companies is the fact that there are possibly millions of bright, young software engineers who get up every day and seek to create new technology that will cause Kip to fall less in love with the existing technology. In our view, these young brilliant software and computer science experts are coming after the profitable tech companies and even coming after technology companies whose profits could possibly be a fantasy. The competition is challenging competence in both cases.The latest fears about eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and our long-duration ownership of the company reminds us of this dichotomy. EBAY loves to use technology, which is mostly created by somebody else, to facilitate e-commerce. This online commerce facilitator has massive revenue in their Marketplace and PayPal secure online payments business. They generated enough revenue and profit in the last year to have $4 billion dollars of free cash flow. In effect, it seems they are the envy of the incredibly popular companies like Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, because they love technology and the way it helps meet an economic need, but they love LaFawnduh (profits and free cash flow) ""more, you see.""Experience has taught us that the best way to measure a moat is to see how well it stands up to a real test. A few years back (centuries in tech land) Google took a run at creating an online payments competitor to PayPal. It was reported that Google spent over $300 million and had all the muscle that a monopoly in search could provide. Can anybody even remember what they called it originally? PayPal has grown much larger and is more dominant today despite the run at payments Google made. It has 148 million registered users and gushes free cash flow. Is it any wonder that one of the companies which loves technology and needs to figure out ways to make profit and free cash flow would hire the guy who ran PayPal? My guess is someone at Facebook recognizes that you should love LaFawnduh (profits and free cash flow) more.The information contained in this missive represents SCM's opinions, and should not be construed as personalized or individualized investment advice.

2265333,20411,2014-06-12T06:59:10-04:00,Past EPS and revenues trends have been steady.Recent news has shaken investor confidence.And now the stock is beginning to break.,"Recent headlines would prompt concern from almost every investor in eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), but are these short-term problems or long-term concerns? After all, both EPS and revenue have been growing steadily, and when it boils down to it, investors are really only concerned about the money.With that, one important observation needs to be made. Slowly, EPS trends are starting to lag behind revenue trends, suggesting that the company is experiencing difficulty bringing earnings to the bottom line. This affects shareholder value and shareholder perception, and it doesn't help when negative news hits the tape.Specifically, recent negative news has included the departure of a key executive, penalties imposed by search engines, and in my observation, technical breakdowns as well. These are all concerning factors, downgrades of the stock have also occurred, but thus far, there are no reasons to suggest that EBAY will not be able to continue on its path, as illustrated in the chart below.After extraordinary items are excluded, the PE multiple for EBAY is about 17 times earnings. Given that EPS growth has been exceeding double digits in recent years, this is not an obtuse multiple, but the stock is breaking down, and for those investors who adhere to the notion that price is all that matters when it comes to making money in the stock market, the focus shifts from what the fundamentals might suggest to what the stock is actually telling us.Quite often, stock prices will reflect risk in the company before the fundamentals actually begin to deteriorate on paper, and that could be true in this case as well.According to our real-time trading report for EBAY, the stock price has begun to break the longer-term support level that we have identified, and that presents serious risks to investors. When longer-term support levels break technical red flags surface, sell signals and short signals are triggered. This will be true so long as the stock remains under longer-term support, which has now been converted into a resistance level.Everything considered, the company is not deteriorating, but the stock certainly is, and for those people who understand that price is all that matters to making money in the stock market, they should respect the price action we are witness to.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: By Thomas H.

2266203,30661,2014-06-12T14:54:44-04:00,eBay has a vibrant economic castle and possesses one of the strongest business models on the market today.Investors need to understand that news flow is quite different than valuation. Even firms with terrible press can be significantly undervalued and be great long-term investments.eBay is trading at less than 15 times 2015 earnings on sales growth in the mid teens. The firm is cheap on almost every valuation multiple. Shares are worth ~$90.,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has one of the strongest business models on the market today. The firm uniquely benefits from a network effect in its auction business and a secular trend toward consumer online consumption in its payments business, PayPal. Recent same-store sales performance has also been solid, albeit slowing, in recent periods. According to ChannelAdvisor, same-store sales growth at eBay came in at 11.5% in May, down from 14% in April. eBay retains a vibrant economic castle.Before we start walking through the five relatively poor incremental data points from eBay, we need to make a couple of things clear. First, we hold eBay in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter, and we do not expect to make any changes to its weighting at this time. Second, every company has both good characteristics and bad characteristics, and every company strives to capitalize on positive trends as it navigates through inevitable challenges. Staying up with incremental pieces of news on your holdings is extremely valuable, but only insofar as the news informs the valuation process. An understanding of which pieces of news are material, and which pieces of news are 'noise' is one of the most important aspects of investing.Let's walk through the recent eBay data points to assess materiality within the context that eBay's same-store sales are still growing at a nice double-digit clip.1) Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)  Panda 4.0. On May 20, Google rolled out a new iteration of Panda, an enhanced search algorithm. The goal is to improve the search experience, weeding out lower-quality ""spammy"" websites in the rankings and bolstering higher-quality websites that have strong brands and trusted, original content. Panda will impact as many as ~8% of all search queries performed in English. According to SearchMetrics, ebay.com is expected to experience a reduction of as much as 33% of traffic on the basis of the rollout of the new algorithm. Wordstream estimates that eBay may lose ~80% of all of its first page organic rankings.Valuentum's Take: The latest Panda update is the 25th iteration of such improvements to Google's search algorithm. This certainly won't be the last update, and we fully expect eBay to recover in coming periods from any search rankings that it has lost. Our opinion of InterActiveCorp's (IACI) Ask.com, which is expected to see traffic halved from Panda (much worse than eBay), is the same. We view the Panda 4.0 update as largely immaterial to long-term performance, though it may clip a few pennies off of earnings per share for this year and next as it forces some firms to buy more Google search ads.2) The Cyberattack. On May 21, eBay disclosed a cyberattack that compromised a database containing encrypted passwords and other non-financial data. eBay concluded that after conducting extensive tests on its network that ""there was no evidence of any unauthorized access to financial or credit card information."" PayPal was not impacted in any way, shape or form, as the firm emphasized that PayPal data is stored separately on a different network and that there was no evidence of unauthorized access on that network.Valuentum's Take: We think the market may be associating eBay's cyberattack with the recent credit/debit card data breach at Target (NYSE:TGT), the latter we view as more severe. eBay has simply asked users to change their passwords, and we're not reading into anything more than that. Though the news could cause some weakness in traffic flow this month or next, the security breach is immaterial to eBay's long-term trajectory. We would expect a full recovery.3) Management Turnover. On June 9, PayPal President David Marcus announced that he will be leaving the company to join Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) messaging products. The release indicated that Marcus is looking for a more entrepreneurial role: ""leading smaller teams to build great product experiences."" PayPal's leadership team will report to CEO John Danahoe until a replacement can be found.Valuentum's Take: We're not reading too much into this piece of news either, as high-performing technology executives swapping companies is not unusual. For example, Sheryl Sandberg cut her teeth at Google before becoming chief operating office at Facebook. Marissa Mayer did the same before joining Yahoo (YHOO) as chief executive. eBay has a deep bench to find a replacement, though we would not be surprised to see the firm look externally to reignite innovation. We also cannot rule out the possibility that Marcus's departure may possibly hint at the separation of PayPal, an event that we would consider to be a distinct positive.4) News of Increased Payments Competition. On June 9, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) indicated that it will start managing subscription payments for start-ups and other firms. Rivals such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Visa (NYSE:V), Facebook, and even Alibaba (ABABA) will also be looking to invade PayPal's turf in coming years. Any one of them, for example, could acquire mobile payments firm Square or other tech-heavy upstarts to accelerate a push into electronic payments technology.Valuentum's Take: We think this news is more important than the others and speaks to a more competitive environment in the next 3 to 5 years for PayPal. Still, PayPal benefits from a substantial first-mover advantage and a large installed base. Switching costs are not small for existing PayPal merchants, and Amazon will have to offer a superior product at a much lower price to make inroads into this market. In any case, however, the competitive landscape needs to be watched very closely.5) Carl Icahn's Proxy Fight and eBay's Tax Blunder. In mid-April, activist investor Carl Icahn, after an aggressive exchange with eBay management, abruptly ended the proxy contest, withdrawing his proposal to separate the company's PayPal business. eBay then in its first-quarter results, released late April, made a decision to repatriate earnings and foot a huge and unnecessary tax bill of $3 billion.Valuentum's Take: Needless to say, we were disappointed with both events. We believe eBay should separate PayPal from its operations and preserve the economic relationship contractually. Existing eBay shareholders would benefit significantly from the separation, in our view, as the market would then assign more appropriate multiples to each firm individually. This may still happen in the years ahead, however.The tax decision was a complete mess, in our view. To save from paying the tax bill, eBay could have issued new debt (like Apple) to fund repurchases and/or refill its cash coffers. The move is probably best-described as 'value-destructive from an opportunistic standpoint,' especially if an international opportunity comes along and eBay is unable to capitalize on it. We don't think Carl Icahn wanted eBay to repatriate earnings and foot a huge tax bill to buy back stock.Wrapping It UpThe news flow hasn't been great for eBay as of late. Changes in Google's search algorithm, a cyberattack, management turnover, and growing competition have hit the wires in the past few weeks alone. These news items followed Icahn's withdrawn proxy contest and the tax debacle, both of which we weren't particularly happy about. eBay has been hit with a storm of negative news.But in spite of all of this, eBay's same-store sales continue to advance at a nice double-digit clip, and we would expect the pace to continue to be resilient. With shares trading under $50 each at the time of this writing, our ~$90 fair value estimate implies substantial upside potential. Investors need to understand that news flow is quite different than valuation. Even firms with terrible press can be significantly undervalued and be great long-term investments. We're keeping our position in eBay in the Best Ideas portfolio at this time, though we fully admit that negative news flow could continue to pressure shares before they inevitably turn higher, in our view. eBay represents ~3% of the portfolio and has a cost basis just north of $30.Shares of eBay are trading at less than 15 times 2015 earnings on sales growth in the mid-teens. They are cheap on almost every valuation multiple. The company's Valuentum Buying Index rating is a 6, but once technicals improve, it would register a 9 or higher (the equivalent of a ""we'd consider buying"" rating).Disclosure: Several firms mentioned in this article are included in Valuentum's newsletter portfolios.

2265913,21136,2014-06-12T12:28:50-04:00,"EBAY has been mired in internal issues lately, ranging from proxy fight with activist investor Carl Icahn to a recent cyber attack.Correlating with this negative press, EBAY stock is on a consistent decline in 2014, along with revenue results.We recommend EBAY investors take profits, particularly as the e-commerce competition heats up in the run up to Alibaba’s IPO.","In a recent interview, Carl Icahn, Chairman of Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP) and activist investor who currently holds over 2% of eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) equity, stated, ""I have never seen worse corporate governance than eBay.""Although waxing poetic is nothing new in the world of activist investors, Mr. Icahn's statement is tantamount to saying that eBay is the worst run company he has ever seen. Given Mr. Icahn's status as a renowned investor, billionaire and shareholder, eBay's CEO John Donahoe was listening.Recent Deal To End Proxy FightIn April, eBay hammered out a deal with Mr. Icahn to end a long-standing proxy fight in which he sought two board seats and a spin-off of eBay's PayPal division, the crown jewel and rising star of the company.The deal places former AT&T CEO as an eBay board member and, at least for now, a media truce that have both men touting each other's praises. More importantly, it moves Mr. Icahn from an adversary to a strategic advisor at a time when Mr. Donahoe needs all the advice he can get.It appears more likely that a Pay-Pal spinoff could be impending, following recent quitting of its leader David Marcus to be head of Facebook's mobile messaging.PayPal Division Head LeavesIn June, the head of eBay's PayPal division, David Marcus, left to lead Facebook's messenger business. His reasons for leaving during such a critical time in PayPal's growth have led to speculation that he was not confident in the future of its business.Marcus faced numerous difficulties as PayPal's leader - managing over 13,000 employees, some of whom refused to download the company's app.PayPal faces numerous new competitors, including companies as catchy-sounding as Square, Stripe and Clinkle, along with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) - as the market for mobile payments heats up. While PayPal is still an established leader in the space, the current incumbency could easily become a void for other companies to shine - both in the US and particularly emerging markets.Google, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple, with strong and increasing international reach could appear to be the most formidable competitors in this regard.Sixty percent of the global population, which does not currently use the Internet, could be deemed ""untapped users"" for mobile payments in the coming years.Recent Cyber AttackMr. Marcus's departure is on the back of a recent cyber attack against the company's network that targeted encrypted passwords, prompting the company to urge users to change their passwords as a precaution.Although cyber attacks have become more commonplace these days, especially against high-profile companies, it is still unsettling to investors as the financial risk of any customer's personal financial information could lead to stiff government fines, restitution and more importantly lost customers.Despite Distractions, eBay Attempting To Move ForwardEven with the many recent distractions, eBay is still driving forward with enhancements to its core business with the launch of Designer Collective.These will be featured shops of 16 American designers selling their current-season collections at full price. eBay hopes that the shops will attract new users to its 145 million active user platform and support its rebranding effort as more than just an auction site.In addition, earlier this year the company took the unusual step of repatriating $9 billion in foreign held cash that has triggered a $3 billion federal tax bill. There is only one reason you bring that much cash back to the US and that is to invest it.For eBay Investors: Caution in 2014While eBay remains one of the most iconic online brands in the world, and customers will likely continue to flock to use its services, competition in e-commerce is certainly heating up as Chinese giant Alibaba (ABABA) is increasing its presence in the US in the run-up to its IPO, followed by several other smaller Chinese companies, including JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Jumei International (NYSE:JMEI). In a similar vein, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is ramping up its services in several ways.Investors may want to proceed with caution and take some profits.Despite most Wall Street analysts continuing to hold onto their buy rating for the stock, eBay has had mixed results, relative to analyst estimates. The company missed expectations for revenues four times in the past five quarters.eBay stock is on a steady decline YTD, correlating with continued internal controversy.(Nasdaq.com)Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2267703,24963,2014-06-13T11:19:15-04:00,"The recent news that eBay’s local delivery plans are unraveling is misleading.In reality, eBay/Shutl is heir apparent to the crown 'Uber of E-Commerce'.EBay's enterprise valuation stands at $59 billion (52-week low) and Uber at $18 billion (proposed).Perhaps if the market understood Shutl better, eBay's stock would be worth 30% more (e.g. $59 billion plus $18 billion).","I believe reports that 'eBay Now' May Shut Down (NASDAQ:EBAY) may be masking an enormous positive, which is that eBay's Shutl is actually the Uber of E-Commerce.As background, Shutl is about efficient use of logistics. Every Internet retailer needs to ship goods on an on-demand basis to the marketplace. In a connected world (where social media is utilized as an efficient method of connecting businesses), nimble shipping services are signing up to compete for that business on a more timely basis.I was the speaker before Shutl at CLDA (Customized Logistics and Delivery Association - previously known as the Messenger Courier Association) in May, so learned some things I would not have otherwise.At the world's largest e-commerce conference where I spoke this week, Ben Gordon, founder of BG Strategic Advisor's asked me a provocative question.""What's the reason for the eBay Shutdown?"" Here is my perspective from the front line:499 of the Top 500 Internet Retailers need an alternative to Fulfillment By Bezos (""FBB"").In my opinion, eBay owns the Uber of E-commerce (Shutl - acquired in October of 2013). It's untapped value could be on the level of PayPal.Why? For every e-commerce company there is enormous 'Brand' risk between the time a customer clicks 'Buy' on their site, and the product shows up on the doorstep.If you're the CEO of one of the 499 (not Amazon), how do you tell your board of directors that your strategy is to outsource same-day/same-hour to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) via FBB?Prior to CLDA conference in Arizona last month, all attendees received an email (and I paraphrase) ""eBay/Shutl is looking to work with companies like some of you (CLDA members), and will look to meet with you. This is a great opportunity to learn what Shutl is looking for in delivery partners and shouldn't be missed!""Within minutes of reading I ""got it"".Shutl is the leading platform. And it's already executing brilliantly by being first to recruit CLDA member companies (established infrastructure of same day talent) among other things.Why tie up all sorts of capital like Amazon in fulfillment centers when it's possible to serve thousands of Internet retailers with already established professional delivery networks? Answer, you shouldn't.What about Google Shopping Express (NASDAQ:GOOG) which just launched in Manhattan? How does it fit into the mix?

Online sellers on eBay will suffer from Google’s punitive action.Google absolutely despises search engine optimization tactics that are exploitative. The ‘doorway pages’ tactic of eBay offended Google.eBay can just formulate new SEO tactics to recover its search engine rankings.,"The past weeks have been terrible for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). First, there was the massive data breach and then there was the huge drop in eBay.com's Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search engine visibility. eBay's lifeblood is online selling and Google's punitive action last month hurts eBay's overall business health.The sellers on eBay will have to put up with the -48% drop in eBay's SEO visibility. Consequently, eBay's revenue will feel the pain if the current situation lingers.Source: SearchmetricsI believe this unfortunate event is more dangerous than David Marcus' defection to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). In spite of Marcus' expertise, it will still take a long time for him to develop a Facebook-owned clone of PayPal.The grave threat now is for online sellers to abandon eBay. Google's delisting or blacklisting of eBay-listed products for sale is strong incentive for online shops to defect to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). As far as I know, Google has not yet taken any punitive action against Amazon.Amazon has been outpacing eBay in terms of revenue growth for the past seven years. Google's act will further worsen the situation.Source: Amigobulls.comManual Delisting By GoogleA Recode article alleges that Google manually deleted/blacklisted a lot of eBay's clever ""doorway pages"" from search results. The said ""doorway pages"" were category or sub-category pages that were allegedly created and optimized to increase the search engine ranking of eBay-listed products.In the eyes of Google, this is bad SEO practice. Getting a lot of your website content delisted from Google's Index is just terrible. The manual action may also be a strong reminder to eBay to correct its behavior. Google's dominant search position makes it the almighty judge in deciding which websites get traffic or no traffic.Everybody who wants to prosper online have to play by Google's rules. A more in-depth explanation on how eBay might suffer from Google's action is at Refugeek. Google's latest search algorithm may also assess other eBay product pages as low-quality content. Yes, Google's new Panda 4.0 update is more deliberate in identifying non-high quality webpages (such as those from online retailers or news aggregator sites) for delisting.Google is not singling-out eBay in its quest to rid the internet of content farmers. Google is trying to protect its search advertising cash cow. Junk search results offend users, which causes significant ad revenue loss. Even Ask.com, the top most visible U.S. paid search advertiser, was one of Panda 4.0 update's biggest losers.Why It Matters to InvestorsInvestors are already griping about EBAY trading near its 52-week low price. The loss of many keywords of eBay on Google search may lead to lower sales for eBay sellers. Low sales due to unfavorable Google search rankings of eBay-listed products affects the top line and bottom line.Source: Google FinanceAmazon will continue to outgrow eBay and Google's act might increase the disparity. However, investors can take comfort that PayPal is still the world's largest online payment processor. Carl Icahn has lost interest but eBay investors should not lose hope that Donahoe will eventually spin off PayPal.Icahn seems to have accepted John Donahoe's explanation that PayPal operating as an independent unit, will kill the current synergy it has with eBay's e-commerce business. In my book, a PayPal spinoff and IPO will make it far more valuable than eBay's Marketplace.ConclusionUBS still rates EBAY as a Buy but it reduced its price target to $60. Eighteen analysts at BarChart are also endorsing eBay as a Buy. However, it might be more prudent for Seeking Alpha users to wait for the stock to become cheaper.BarChart's technical indicators are saying a 100% SELL for eBay. The double tornado of Marcus' defection to Facebook and Google's act are inspiring the bears to descend on EBAY.Google's punitive action against eBay is a major setback. On the other hand, eBay has smart people working for it. Donahoe's underlings should already be plotting up a replacement for the ""doorway pages"" SEO tactic.Lastly, EBAY has a long-term tailwind in PayPal. I don't use eBay anymore for online shopping. However, I am still very dependent on PayPal. There are alternatives to eBay but PayPal will remain king of digital wallets for many years. Google Wallet, Apple iPayments, or Facebook e-money transfer, will still take many years to mature before they can match PayPal's pervasive success.The infographics below explains why eBay is still a Buy for long-term investors.Source of Images: Adhugger.comDisclosure: The author is long FB, GOOG.

        Ebay has a heavy reliance on its revenues from Paypal.
        Amazon's payment system has done well in its test phase and was just released for wide scale use.","Certain industries are categorized by much higher degrees of innovation and transformation than others. Industries such as utilities provide stable and recurring revenue streams and are classified as stagnant. However, other industries are constantly reinventing themselves and a company can go from a Goliath to bankrupt in a matter of years. The e-commerce industry is incredibly dynamic and the payment segment of this unstable industry is set for a major rehaul.Competition is mounting in the payment industry as a number of companies with significant user bases have entered. The most obvious change that will result from the acute competition will be a compression in margins. Companies will fight it out to give customers the lowest costs which will commoditize this industry.Although the reward will not be as lucrative as it once was due to the heightened competition, the company that eventually wins will do so because of two reasons: user base size and customer trust. The company with the largest user base will be at an advantage when negotiating rates with merchants. However, with that being said, customers will only use the service if they have trust that their sensitive information will be secure on the platform.I will now delve into each player in the industry and give a conclusion on which company has the best opportunity of success.eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)The payment industry so far has been dominated by eBay through its Paypal segment. As of December of 2013, Paypal had 143 million active registered accounts. Actively registered means the account has successfully sent or received at least one payment or payment reversal through Paypal within the last 12 months.Paypal revenue accounted for roughly 34% of eBay's total revenue in the most recent quarter. Moreover, this segment represented a staggering 54% of operating income. From these numbers, it is easy to deduce that eBay relies heavily on Paypal.Yesterday, eBay announced that Paypal's President David Marcus will be leaving to head Facebook's mobile messaging platform. Turnover at the most senior level when competition is mounting should be viewed as a red flag.Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), (NASDAQ:GOOGL)Google originally was in the payment industry through its online payment processing service, Google Checkout. The service which was originally launched in late 2006 was discontinued in favor of Google Wallet in 2013.Google Wallet is a mobile payment system that allows users to store card information as well as redeem sales promotions on their mobile phones. Google Wallet can use near field communication to make secure payments fast by simply tapping the phone on an enabled terminal. Google's business model is slightly different in that it doesn't charge users or merchants for access to Wallet. Google makes money by offering sponsored ads to their users.However, Google does compete with others in the industry through another aspect. Google recently announced the integration of Google Wallet and Gmail which will allow users to send money through Gmail attachments. Gmail currently has 425 million users.Interestingly enough, in May, Google added Paypal support to Google Wallet. Paypal's use on the platform is quite restricted, however, and only allows users to pay for apps through Google Play. A customer would have to use Google's payment system in order to may purchases for anything outside of Google Play.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)On Monday, Amazon launched a new service that will allow customers to automatically pay recurring charges such as monthly subscription fees or phone bills by using their Amazon log-in credentials. Amazon plans to charge a small fee on each transaction. With more than 244 million active customer accounts, Amazon has quickly thrust itself into the center of the payment industry.This new service will broaden Amazon's role as a middleman for third-party sellers which currently account for 40% of its sales. The ancillary effect of this service is that it will extend Amazon's influence beyond its website. Amazon tested the service over the last several months and its results were promising. Ting, a mobile phone company reported that customers spent 30% more if they were signed up for recurring payments by Amazon. Fledgling companies without much credibility will be eager to integrate this service to their platforms.Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)In late April, Facebook entered the payment industry fray when it began seeking regulatory approval from Ireland to store money and make electronic payments through the social network. Facebook has yet to receive approval, but rumors are that it is just weeks away. The process is being held up because it is waiting on Europe's central bank to approve Facebook as an electronic money institution.Facebook which boasts a massive 1.23 billion user base will be able to allow this diverse network to store and transfer money through the site. The biggest risk to this venture for Facebook could be its perception as being untrustworthy.So Who Will Come Out On Top?eBay currently sits atop this industry with its Paypal segment. For that reason, competitors entering this market are playing with the house's money while eBay will be fighting for its livelihood. eBay heavily relies on the revenue from this segment and with the influx of competition, it is set to struggle. This industry will become commoditized as none of the companies can offer much of a differentiated product. In the end, eBay will lose the most from this fight. The winner will depend on user trust and the size of the user base.With that being said, the winner will not gain much from this battle, but I believe that Amazon has the upper-hand. Although Amazon does not have the largest user base, it is best positioned to win. Tests of the integration for its system have been wildly successful and I expect merchants to readily sign up if that success can be replicated.Google Wallet has a different business model than the others which I do not believe will work well. Consumers are being exceedingly desensitized to advertising which does not bode well for this strategy.Although Facebook has the largest user base by a far margin, the area it lacks in is credibility. Many users have already questioned Facebook's security and use of user data. For this reason, Facebook will struggle to gain a foothold in this market.ConclusionThe payment industry will soon be commoditized which will benefit consumers and will be detrimental for eBay. Amazon is poised to become the new dominant player in this industry although with the commoditized nature, it will not prove to be an enormous victory.Disclosure: I am long FB.

2256903,66403,2014-06-06T16:06:28-04:00,"eBay runs two main businesses: its popular legacy business, eBay Marketplace, and its rapidly growing online payments subsidiary, PayPal.The recent hacking of eBay Marketplace presents more opportunity than risk since its password hashes were salted and should therefore present few long-term risks.The company is priced well below its competitors based on multiples of free cash flow.The stock has never traded below $50 for longer than four days during the past 18 months.The options are pricing a bimodal distribution, but it seems like the technical floor of $50 and relatively cheap earnings growth present more upside than options would suggest.","Benjamin Graham wrote in his book The Intelligent Investor that every investor should ""apply a set of standards to each [stock] purchase, to make sure that he obtains (1) a minimum of quality in the past performance and current financial position of the company, and also (2) a minimum of quantity in terms of earnings and assets per dollar of price.""eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) currently fits the bill for Graham's quality and quantity aspects of investing. The company's quality lies in its management team and high barriers to entry in its business, while the quantity lies in a strong balance sheet, free cash flow (FCF), and the firm's positioning for future growth.I will overview payment processing, management, valuation, and the opportunities in the options market and conclude with my trade.The Payment Processing ArenaPayment processing is a high margin business with high barriers to entry. It is a business built on trust, which tends itself toward large, dominant players. eBay's two main competitors in the United States are Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA).The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago released a white paper on innovation in payment processing in 2003 that provides a good view into the payments business. Section II gives an overview of the business model in layman's terms.Is Apple a Threat?The entry of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) into the mobile payments arena has been much ballyhooed, but the giant poses few near-term risks.Apple, or any future competitor that has already built a base of trust, could begin tomorrow and charge half the commission of eBay, Visa, or MasterCard, but the firm would never risk crimping its margins. This could hurt PayPal's growth, but its margins would remain untouched.PayPal's standard 2.9% fee is well entrenched and the concept of real competition in the space is farfetched for the next few years. There are very few trusted firms that could begin a payment processing business and none that have the incentives to undercut the competition.ManagementJohn Donahoe II: Donahoe began his career at Bain & Company and spent over twenty years there before making his way to eBay as President of eBay Marketplace in 2005; he continued up eBay's corporate ladder until being named CEO in 2008.Donahoe is a secure, well-renowned CEO. He holds influential positions on boards of directors like Intel and Skype. My only issue with him is that he did not spend the majority of his career at eBay, but he is now 10 years into his tenure and a steady leader, although his knowledge of the payments business may be lacking.Robert Swan: Swan is currently the CFO of the Company and has held important leadership roles at Electronic Data Systems and TRW as well.Swan is well acquainted with the lists of the best Silicon Valley CFOs. He has the impressive resume of growing eBay from a free cash flow negative business to the cash flow behemoth it is today.Pierre Omidyar: Omidyar is the founder and chairman of eBay. He was a billionaire at the age of 31 at the advent of eBay's IPO and has continued to keep a close watch on the Company's culture while staying outside of the day-to-day operations.I get the impression that he has engendered a strong corporate governance culture that offsets much of the worry I had when I first heard about the eBay Marketplace hacking scandal. Alongside Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, Pierre has signed the giving pledge, where the pledgee signs away 99% of his wealth to charity. He now spends his time running charities and local publications.Comparable Companies AnalysiseBay generated $4.08 billion in FCF during the 12 months ended March 2013, up 39% from the $2.93 billion generated the 12 months beforehand. Free Cash Flow, by my calculations, is EBIT - CapEx + D&A. Source: Company Presentation.eBay's market capitalization is $64.5 billion and its enterprise value (EV) is $60.8 billion. eBay is relatively unleveraged and has about twice as much cash and short-term investments as long-term debt. Source: Yahoo FinanceThis gives an EV/FCF multiple of 14.9x. Let's see how that compares to its main payment processing competitors, Visa and MasterCard.MasterCard generated free cash flow of $4.72 billion over the past twelve months and has an EV of $84.1 billion. The company's TTM EV/FCF multiple is 17.8x. Source: 10-Q FilingVisa's financials fail to present an easy-to-understand FCF figure, but the company guided to ~$5 billion in free cash flow for 2014. Visa's EV of $159.4 billion gives a 2014 EV/FCF multiple of 31.9x. The figure is after-tax and so is understandably lower. However, after a tax treatment of 30%, the 2014 EV/FCF multiple is still 22.3x. Source: 10-Q FilingOf the two, MasterCard is most comparable to eBay in terms of financial strength, but the firm still fails to compete on every metric. eBay has greater relative free cash flow and its revenue and free cash flow are growing slightly above that of MasterCard. eBay comes out ahead financially relative to the most comparable companies.Optional OpportunityThe current mispricing in eBay gives an investor a strong risk-reward profile, but playing the stock in the options markets appears to increase the reward while limiting the risk of permanent capital loss.The options appear to price based on the modified Black-Sholes and the model's assumptions of a normal, bimodal distribution.In Joel Greenblatt's section of Hedge Fund Market Wizards by Jack Shrager, he names Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) during the 1980s as an example of options market mispricing. For that example, he believed the downside was zero but the upside was almost double the market price at the time.I don't believe that this is a book-worthy example of options mispricing, but I do believe that the scenario presents a good opportunity to think about option pricing. In my view, the percentage chance of the stock trading at $45 at the end of the year is much lower than the percentage chance of it trading at $55.A variety of factors create this unique scenario. Quality companies and companies with low EV/FCF multiples relative to the market tend to outperform in the long-run. I tend to be a skeptic of technical analysis, but when a stock has failed to trade below a certain level and continued to test it with good results, then I believe that that particular price level means something to traders and investors. In this example, eBay has failed to trade below $50 per share for an extended period of time and the chance of the stock doing so is likely less than a typical option pricing model would suggest.The hack in months past of eBay Marketplace could present a downside scenario somewhat like Target (NYSE:TGT), but I believe this is unlikely. Hashing and salting was used to keep passwords safe and I doubt eBay would give up its cryptographic methodologies; everyone is looking at the situation from the same cloudy viewpoint. This is a risk I am willing to take; the better entry point was well worth it.ConclusioneBay is attractive based on its positioning in a growing, profitable industry with strong barriers to entry. It trades at lower multiples of FCF than its competitors and is attractive on a technical basis due to the resistance at the $50 per share level.There is currently a unique opportunity in eBay: an opportunity to buy a quality company at a good price. The firm becomes even more attractive through the use of vanilla call options; four- to six-month volatility is cheap on an implied volatility/historical volatility basis and a bimodal distribution seems unlikely based on the above.Disclosure: I am long EBAY.

Year-to-date, eBay shares are down about 8%, with the S&P 500 roughly flat. But eBay's merchandise rival Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is down about 28% and eBay finds itself actually trading right where it increasingly belongs - alongside payments leaders MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V).EBAY data by YChartseBay's payment business, PayPal is approaching the size of its merchandise business and is the faster-growing side of the company. PayPal grew by 19% last year and at the same rate during the first quarter. That's ahead of the rate of growth at Visa and MasterCard; eBay as a whole is growing at about MasterCard's rate right now and a bit faster than Visa.EBAY Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsBut eBay's a good deal cheaper, based on forward PE ratio.EBAY PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsOne thing Carl Icahn can take at least partial credit for is the greatly increased stock buyback activity at eBay.EBAY Stock Buybacks (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe company formerly did enough buybacks to counter stock issued from options exercises and the like, buying in $1 billion or so a year. Now the company is seeking to reduce shares outstanding. It took the unusual step of repatriating $9 billion of retained profit that had been stashed overseas, beyond the reach of the tax man, paying about $3 billion in U.S. taxes, and using $1.8 billion of cash during the first quarter alone to buy in shares.The outlook for 2014 is for revenue of $18 billion-to-$18.5 billion, roughly in the 12%-to-16% range of growth. ebay's online merchandise service grew about 12% last year and 10% during the first quarter; PayPal's the operation turbocharging growth.eBay had a pretty good -- if not airtight -- argument against Icahn's breakup proposal: a substantial minority of PayPal charge volume involves eBay merchandise sales. And supporters of the company's keep-it-together plan like to say that eBay is the gateway drug for PayPal users, getting many to sign up for the payments service, making them comfortable with it and then getting them to use it elsewhere.Running what are two distinct businesses may weigh on eBay's stock over time. And trading at a discount to MasterCard and Visa is understandable. Those credit card processing giants are more deeply woven into global commerce and likely have wider moats around their businesses. All three companies face increased competition as Amazon and others try to gain a significant foothold in the payments business. If eBay can continue its growth, in hindsight the months after Carl Icahn folded his tent and went home may look like a great entry point. YCharts' eBay Rating on fundamentals is a strong 9 of 10, and on a historical basis the shares are priced low.Disclosure: No positions"
2249413,25106,2014-06-02T17:01:17-04:00,eBay shares have fallen after Carl Icahn backed down from his proposal to spin off PayPal.eBay has recently ramped up its buyback program which should prove a positive for the stock.eBay trades at a reasonable valuation.eBay is part of the old tech cohort that has been doing quite well of late.,"Shares of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) have fallen from their recent highs over the past few months after Carl Icahn announced that he would back away from his proposal to spin off PayPal. Investors should use this decline as an opportunity to buy EBAY.EBAY data by YChartsIcahn ProposalWhile it is true that EBAY shares reacted positively to Icahn's proposed spinoff of PayPal, it is not clear that such a move is in the long-term interest of EBAY and its shareholders. EBAY CEO John Donahoe has laid out the case for why the company does not support a spinoff. I tend to agree with Donahoe in believing that keeping PayPal, for now, makes sense. In the future, a possible spinoff of PayPal remains a possible bullish catalyst. It is important to point out that, despite failing to achieve a PayPal spinoff, Icahn continues to hold EBAY stock and has said he might increase his position. Clearly, Icahn has some degree of confidence in management and believes the stock is significantly undervalued. Icahn will meet with EBAY CEO John Donahoe regularly which I believe is a positive. Icahn has proved to be one of the best investors of all-time and shareholders will likely benefit from his continued involvement at EBAY.Increased BuyBackIn early 2014, EBAY announced a new $5 billion stock buyback program. While EBAY had done some stock repurchases in the past, the amount of stock buybacks had been relatively small. Given EBAY's market cap of about $65 billion, the $5 billion buyback has the potential to be highly impactful.EBAY Stock Buybacks (Quarterly) data by YChartsValuationAs shown by the chart below, based on both forward PE ratio and price to free cash flow, EBAY appears to be reasonably valued. EBAY also appears to be fairly valued relative to mature tech companies such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While EBAY trades at a comparable valuation, it is growing much faster than other mature tech companies.EBAY Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsEBAY Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsEBAY Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe Right Kind Of Tech Stock2014 has proved an interesting year for technolgy stocks as fast growing high valuation tech stocks such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) have done quite poorly while value tech stocks such as Microsoft, IBM, and Intel have done well. I believe this trend is likely to continue for a while and EBAY is the kind of stock that could benefit due to its reasonable valution and strong buyback.IBM data by YChartsConclusionIcahn's decision to drop his proposal for a PayPal spinoff has sent shares of EBAY lower. However, the move lower has provided investors with a good entry point. EBAY's reasonable valuation, growth potential, and increased buyback are all reasons why EBAY shares are a good long-term investment. Furthermore, over the short-to-medium term, I believe EBAY is poised to benefit from the rotation out of high growth high valuation tech stocks into value tech stocks.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in EBAY over the next 72 hours.

2186673,20521,2014-05-02T11:50:34-04:00,,"Earlier this week, online retailer eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) announced their quarterly results. Their results exceeded market expectations, but the big surprise was the announcement of repatriating $9 billion in cash and paying $3 billion in taxes on these funds. eBay wants to use these funds to drive further growth.eBay's Financials Their first-quarter revenues grew 14% over the year to $4.26 billion, ahead of the Street's expectations of $4.23 billion. EPS of $0.70 was also ahead of the market's expectations of $0.67 for the quarter.By segment, Marketplace revenues grew to $2.2 billion, driven by a 12% growth in gross merchandise volume and a 14% increase in active buyers. They ended the quarter with 145 million active buyers and over 650 million listings on their Marketplace.eBay settled the earlier Board battle between investor Mr. Icahn regarding the spin-off of PayPal by adding an independent director David W. Dorman, an ex-AT&T executive, to the board. PayPal is no longer expected to be spun off, and continues to deliver strong growth. Total payment volume for the service grew 27%, with Merchant Services volume growing 32% and eBay-related volume rising 15%. PayPal was able to generate revenues of $1.8 billion. Their member base grew 16% to 148 million.Mobile solutions are also seeing strong growth. Total eBay-enabled commerce volume grew 24% to $58 billion, and within that, mobile volume recorded a 70% growth to $11 billion.During the quarter, eBay bought back 33.1 million shares for $1.8 billion.eBay expects to end the current quarter with revenues of $4.33 billion-$4.43 billion and earnings of $0.67-$0.69 per share. The Street was looking for revenues of $4.398 billion and EPS of $0.70. eBay expects to end the year with revenues of $18.00 billion-$18.50 billion and EPS of $0.04-$0.09.eBay Improving Offerings Meanwhile, eBay continues to improve their service offerings. Earlier this year, they announced the acquisition of PhiSix for an undisclosed sum. PhiSix is a computer graphics company that creates three-dimensional models of objects from photos and pattern files. Their solution creates a virtual fitting room for people to try clothes on in various environments. The acquisition will help eBay make their marketplace offering more attractive, as users will be able to see how the clothes look on them before ordering them.Additionally, eBay is also working on releasing a retail mall for merchants called The Plaza. The service is expected to enable direct-to-consumer sales, as it will essentially become another storefront for retailers. eBay already has stores like Toys ""R"" Us (TOYS) offering their products through the eBay site. But with a new branding image under The Plaza, eBay will hope to attract other big retailers to sell through their site.eBay is also enhancing the customer experience for PayPal. Earlier this year, they released a native payment app for merchants that simplifies payments through PayPal. Now, customers are not taken to a PayPal page, instead, the payment can be made through a window on the retailer's page so that the consumer does not have to leave the merchant website.eBay Repatriates Funds Along with the results announcement, eBay also announced plans to repatriate $9 billion from their foreign earnings. eBay will have to pay $3 billion in taxes on this repatriation. eBay says that they want to have these funds available with them to help fund growth and future acquisition. However, they don't have anything on the radar right now. Most of their acquisitions so far have been in the U.S., and they want to ensure that their coffers are ready for other future acquisitions. Even so, it is surprising to see eBay willing to pay 33% in taxes on these funds.Recently, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced their plans to raise $12 billion in bonds to fund their buyback. Most companies follow the policy of keeping their funds outside the U.S. and raise debt in the U.S. Taxes are high on repatriated funds, and it is much cheaper to pay interest on the loan. Organizations have been lobbying to get the Government to ease these taxes so that they can invest in growth within the U.S. But, the government has not been very willing. For some surprising reason, eBay would much rather pay the charge to use the money up-front than increase their debt position.It's an intriguing choice, and I don't understand it.eBay's stock is trading at $51.83, with a market capitalization of $67.1 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $59.70 in February this year. Right now, it's much lower because the market is confused. They need to explain the decision to the market."
2224653,59401,2014-05-19T04:44:21-04:00,"eBay has a very profitable business model, generates a lot of free cash flow each year and has great economic moats.The stock has remained relatively flat since early 2013, while the company's free cash flow has increased substantially during the same period.The stock is undervalued relative to its intrinsic value (the company's business value).Billionaire investor Carl Icahn also invested in eBay. He normally invests in undervalued stocks that have good growth potential.","eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is one of my favorite companies for long-term investing, because the company has a great business model that generates a lot of free cash flow each year, the company has two outstanding businesses (eBay marketplaces and Paypal), and great economic moats that can protect it from competitors.The stock market is not always rational or efficient. Every once in a while, we can find great investing opportunities from great companies such as eBay, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) that are mis-priced by the market. For example, I published an article about Apple a few months ago when the stock was substantially undervalued. It was trading at $455 billion in market cap at the time of writing and is currently worth $514 billion. In other words, we can often find great companies that are undervalued in the stock market, invest in them for the long-term, and sell them when they become substantially overvalued or when they no longer have good economic prospects.At this moment, I believe that eBay is a great company that is undervalued and that it could be a great buying opportunity for investors who like to invest for the long-term. A great company is one that 1) we can understand, 2) with good economic moats, 3) with great long-term economic prospects, and 4) with an able and trustworthy management team. Great buying opportunities occur when the stock is undervalued, which means that the stock is below its intrinsic value-the company's business value.eBay Has Several Great Business SegmentseBay has three main business segments: Marketplaces (eBay websites), Payments (Paypal and Bill Me Later) and Enterprise (formerly GSI Commerce). While all of them are great businesses, eBay marketplaces and Paypal are the two main ones that generate the most revenues for the company (see image below). Also note that eBay is earning more revenues from the international market than the U.S. (e.g. 53% of eBay's total net revenues came from the international market for Q1 2014).Source: eBay 2013 Annual ReportWhile I will not go into the details for each of eBay's business segments (this is available on eBay's Q1 2014 Report and Q1 2014 conference call), I want to share with you several economic trends that I believe will drive eBay's revenue and free cash flow growth in the next decade.Before we start, we must first understand that eBay generates revenues primarily from the transactions enabled on eBay websites and the payments processed through Paypal. Unlike Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay's Marketplaces business does not carry inventory and does not run fulfillment centers (except for the company's Enterprise segment). eBay merely acts as the middle person/platform that enables transactions between buyers and sellers around the world. For eBay's Marketplaces business, the company charges the seller listing fees and final value fees plus other optional marketing fees. This means that eBay's business model is much more profitable than Amazon's, because it does not have inventory and fulfillment center costs.In addition, Paypal is very profitable, similar to Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA). Paypal earns money by deducting a commission fee (e.g. $0.30 per sale + 2.9% of the sales amount) from the final sale amount.Growing Enabled Commerce VolumeeBay's most important performance metric is Enabled Commerce Volume [ECV] (aka commerce volume). The company's earnings are largely dependent on the amount of commerce volume it generates. ECV measures the total amount of commerce volume generated from eBay's Marketplaces and Enterprise segments and the payment volume generated from eBay's Payments segment.Source: Q1 2014 Earnings SlideeBay's commerce volume has been consistently growing over the past several years. This is due to the increase of active users and sellers/merchants, eBay's expansion in mobile platforms and in the international market, as well as the rapid growth of Paypal. Since eBay is continuously expanding more in the international market, mobile platforms and payment services, I believe that its commerce volume should grow at a double-digit rate- between 10% to 20% each year- for the next decade.Cross-border Trades as a Competitive AdvantageeBay websites allow cross-border transactions between buyers and sellers from different countries. This is eBay's biggest competitive advantage (in addition to Paypal) because it encourage more merchants to use eBay. For example, merchants in Hong Kong can often make iPhone cases at a lower cost than anyone else and can sell them to U.S. buyers via eBay. On the other hand, buyers can often find cheaper items on eBay-such as iPhone cases-through auctions or fixed-priced purchases. Hence, I believe that cross-border trades will continue to help eBay attract more commerce volume and revenues from the international market.Rapid Growth in Mobile Commerce VolumeeBay has been very successful in its mobile platforms. For example, its mobile ECV has grown from 14% of its total ECV in Q1 2013 to 19% of total ECV in Q1 2014 (see eBay-enabled ECV image above). As more people use mobile devices for eBay and Paypal transactions, we can expect that eBay's mobile commerce volume will continue to grow at a faster pace than its non-mobile commerce volume.eBay's Growing Revenues and Free Cash FlowsOver the past 10 years, eBay's Free Cash Flow [FCF] grew from $992 million to $3.7 billion with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (OTC:CAGR) of 15.9% each year (see image below). For the trailing 12 months between Q2 2013 and Q1 2014, its Free Cash Flow was $4.1 billion.Note that eBay repatriated (brought back) $9.0 billion of foreign earnings to the U.S. in Q1 2014. This resulted in a ""non-cash"" tax charge of approximately $3 billion on eBay's income statement, and the company had to report a GAAP loss of ($2.3 billion) or ($1.82) per diluted share (source: Q1 2014 Earnings Release). The non-cash tax charge may distort eBay's performance (net income and diluted earnings per share) for Q1 2014. A better performance metric is the company's free cash flow.Competition and RisksCompetition is likely eBay's biggest risk as more companies are competing in eCommerce and in payment services.For online marketplaces, Amazon is eBay's biggest competitor in the U.S. and in the international market. Alibaba-the largest ecommerce company in China-will likely become a huge competitor should it enter the U.S. market. For payment businesses, eBay's Paypal is the leading digital wallet and online payment service. It is much more popular than Google Wallet and other digital wallets. For mobile payment services, Paypal is expanding more in offline stores and will likely compete with Apple should it enter the mobile payment market.eBay has great economic moats (e.g. cross-border trading, a large selection of products that is comparable to Amazon's, cheaper products, market-leading Paypal, auction-based trading, etc.) that I believe can protect the company from most competition. However, I do not know whether mobile payment will disrupt or complement Paypal.Why eBay is UndervaluedAs mentioned above, the stock remained relatively flat between early 2013 and the time of writing this, while the company's Free Cash Flow grew from $2.6 billion in fiscal 2012 to $4.1 billion for the 12 months between Q3 2013 and Q1 2014. This may suggest that the stock is undervalued because the market has not recognized the company's growing free cash flow.Intrinsic valuation (a method that measures a company's business value) also suggests that eBay is undervalued. To measure eBay's current intrinsic value, I have used three scenarios: an optimistic valuation with a free cash flow CAGR of 15%, a fair valuation with a CAGR of 13%, and a pessimistic valuation with a CAGR of 10%. My other assumption is that the discount rate is 13% (see image below).According to my estimates, eBay's fair intrinsic value should be around $76 billion in market cap or $60 per share, assuming that the company's free cash flow will grow at a CAGR of 13% for the next decade. This means that the stock is undervalued by around 15%. However, if the company's free cash flow grows at a CAGR of 10% for the next decade, the company should be worth around $65 billion in market cap or $51 per share.If we consider eBay's growing commerce volume and the economics trends that I mentioned earlier, I believe that its free cash flow should grow at a CAGR of 10% to 15% each year for the next decade (its Free Cash Flow grew at a CAGR of 15.9% for the past 10 years).The Bottom LineI believe that eBay is a great company for long-term investing, because it has two great businesses-eBay websites and Paypal-that are very profitable, generate a lot of free cash flow, and have great economic moats. The stock is likely undervalued because it has been relatively flat since early 2013, even though its free cash flow has grown substantially. In addition, I have estimated eBay's fair intrinsic value to be around $76 billion in market cap or $60 per share.On a separate note, billionaire investor Carl Icahn has invested in eBay and owns 27.8 million shares, according to Businessinsider. He normally invests in undervalued stocks that have great growth potential. This also indicates that eBay might be undervalued. Icahn tried to separate Paypal from eBay, but eventually backed away from his proposal. I believe that both businesses are better together because they can increase each others' commerce volume as well as payment volume.Sources: eBay 2013 Annual Report, Q1 2014 Quarterly Report, Conference Call and Earnings Slides, Morningstar, Yahoo Finance, Businessinsider, SA Transcripts and Intelligent Stocks.Disclosure: I am long AAPL, AMZN, YNDX, MA, V.

2246603,23479,2014-05-30T16:34:19-04:00,"We expect eBay to grow its revenues from roughly $16 billion in 2013 to $36.5 billion by 2020.PayPal has been going strong over the last few years, with the number of active registered accounts rising from 57 million in 2007 to 143 million in 2013.According to eMarketer’s forecast, global business-to-consumer e-commerce sales are expected to jump by roughly 20% in 2014, amounting to $1.5 trillion.","Our current price estimate for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) stands at $60, implying a premium of about 20% over the market. eBay has been performing well for the past few years given the secular trend of consumer shifts to the internet, strong growth in e-commerce and PayPal doing exceedingly well. As a result, we expect eBay to grow its revenues from roughly $16 billion in 2013 to $36.5 billion by 2020, implying a compounded annual growth rate (OTC:CAGR) of 12.50%. At the same time, we believe that the company’s free cash flow can jump from an estimated $1.77 billion in 2013 to $6.5 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of roughly 20% on the back of efficient management of net working capital and lower capital expenditures. Our valuation is based on a weighted average cost of capital of 10% and terminal growth rate of 2.5%. Below we take a look at the trends driving these numbers PayPal Continues To Expand Its PresencePayPal has been going strong over the last few years, with the number of active registered accounts rising from 57 million in 2007 to 143 million in 2013. The company added close to 20 million accounts in 2013 alone and continued this momentum by gaining 5.8 million accounts in the first quarter of 2014. The number of payments and the total payment volume are also growing thanks to the explosive growth in global e-commerce. Given the momentum and the opportunity, eBay is likely to try to push PayPal more in emerging markets where online payments still form a small proportion of overall transactions. E-commerce is still at a nascent stage in these markets, but over the next few years online purchases should pick up driven by the growing number of internet users and increased smartphone usage.Business In Europe Remains Strong eBay’s international revenues jumped from $4.57 billion in 2008 to nearly $8.34 billion in 2013, a CAGR of 12.8%. The last three years have been especially rewarding, as the growth was much higher than the overall CAGR for the last five years. Germany and the United Kingdom together accounted for about 49% of eBay’s international revenues in 2013, and close to 26% of its global revenues. Both markets grew at a similar rate of 15-16%, whereas the company saw its revenues from the rest of the world jump by 13%. This all around growth is an encouraging sign, as it reduces eBay’s dependence on a single market.Given that the Eurozone and the U.K. are gradually coming out of recession, we expect eBay to benefit from some economic tailwinds as demand improves. We believe that eBay will continue to focus on expanding its international presence and lay greater emphasis on PayPal’s growth in emerging marketsGrowth In E-Commerce And Mobile Focus In Q1 2014, eBay enabled $58 billion of commerce volume, which represented an increase of roughly 24% over the first quarter of last year. This growth was driven by its focus on mobile, cross-border trade, especially in China, and the symbiotic relationship between eBay’s marketplaces business and PayPal. The company enabled about $11 billion of mobile commerce volume during the quarter, which accounted for roughly 19% of the total enabled commerce volume. In this regard, we believe that eBay is doing at least as well as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or possibly even better, as the latter reportedly earned roughly 5% to 8% of its revenues from the mobile platform in 2012.According to eMarketer’s forecast, global business-to-consumer e-commerce sales are expected to jump by roughly 20% in 2014, amounting to $1.5 trillion. This expected growth is higher than what the industry saw last year, and much of it will be driven by the continued uptake in mobile usage in emerging markets, expansion into new regions and advancements in payment and shipping services. We believe that eBay will continue to benefit from these tailwinds and achieve its 2014 targets.Disclosure: No positions"
2209803,43971,2014-05-11T11:14:38-04:00,eBay's Marketplaces and Payments divisions have performed well recently and are under-appreciated by the market (est. 20% upside).Apple and Amazon are both making pushes to enter payments and Amazon continues to take e-commerce share.Significant governance concerns highlighted by Icahn proxy fight and management's decision to repatriate $9B in overseas cash for unclear reasons while creating a $3B obligation to the IRS.,"Business OvervieweBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) enables global commerce and payments. The company was founded in 1995. It operates in 3 segments:Economics of the BusinessAccording to eMarketer, Global e-commerce is expected to grow 17.2% annually through 2017.That's very good for all of eBay's operating divisions. By only maintaining market share, both the Payments and Marketplaces divisions should be able to grow at a fast pace. However, these two businesses have very different competitive positions in my opinion.Marketplaces has been losing share to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other global competitors as evidenced by its lower active buyer and GMV growth rates compared to the industry rate:SourceI expect this to continue as Amazon is here to stay and imminent fierce competition from new entrants is almost inevitable in an industry growing this fast and of this size, akin to smartphones a few years ago. Interestingly, eBay seems to be aiding competition through its Enterprise division by enabling brick and mortar retailers to go omnichannel, albeit profiting from doing so. I still think the business will do double digit growth going forward, however. In an excellent recent piece on Alibaba (ABABA), Aswath Damodaran emphasizes the importance of network effects in e-commerce. Most of the value an e-commerce platform offers to sellers is not in low transaction costs or value-added services, but in the number of buyers the platform brings to the table. eBay's Marketplaces division brings many (145M to be exact), and this number is still currently growing at a solid 14% pace.Payments/PayPal has a leading competitive position in the payments industry. Heavyweights like Amazon and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are developing payment systems. Amazon has both devices and a leading e-commerce platform to launch its payments service through and Apple has devices and ~600M iTunes accounts (most of which are linked to credit cards), but PayPal has a pretty large head start. I also like that the business has been reducing its dependence on eBay.com and other commerce platforms owned by eBay. Finally, the electronic/mobile payments industry is younger than e-commerce and should get all of the benefit of e-commerce growth and then some from mobile physical payment adoption. This is supported by PayPal's recent financial results:SourceSourceThe most important number is Total Payment Value ""TPV"" and this has been growing mid 20s and accelerating, though some of the Q1 '14 acceleration is related to Braintree being included in Payments for the first time (acquired December last year).I think cautious optimism is the best way to think about eBay's prospects right now. The businesses have and will likely continue to perform well, but there are real competitive threats and I don't feel that eBay has an impenetrable moat.Governance ConcernsRepatriation of overseas cashWith the Q1 earnings release, management announced a strategic decision recently made to repatriate $9B of overseas cash to the US. In so doing the company will incur $3B in US taxes, so it will only be left with $6B in additional cash in the US when all is said and done. Many large US companies with global operations have kept cash generated overseas outside the US to avoid the large tax bill. Politics aside, investors have generally strongly supported this, but also urged companies to put the cash to work in some way (reinvestment, M&A, etc). eBay's decision was met with a great deal of anger from investors and rightfully so. The repatriation instantly destroys 4.7% ($3B cash/$64B market cap) of shareholder value. It's also unclear why the company needed to move the cash. From the conference call:If the company is truly only moving the cash because it is short of funds within the US, then management should not have pulled the trigger on $1.8B in share repurchases in Q1 with US cash. I think most would agree that eBay stock is not trading for less than 37.5% of fair value ($1.8B / ($1.8B + $3B)), so the move makes no financial sense. Despite management's statement, there have been rumors floating around that the company is planning to purchase MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) (which it already has a stake in) or another company. I don't know if this is the case or not, but hope the company will be generating extremely high returns in some way with the cash. If not then the repatriation decision points to gravely inept financial management.Spin off or sell Payments division?Carl Icahn takes a lot of heat for his investment style but in his proxy fight with eBay management, he made some good points. He mainly pushed for the company to spin off PayPal. I have mixed feelings about the merits of such a course of action, but I think it's at least worth considering in detail. PayPal has better prospects than the rest of eBay, is growing faster now, and would likely fetch an additional premium in this market for being an interesting tech business. Only certain kinds of businesses are subject to mania and bubbly valuations in the current market environment and historically (think 1999). I think PayPal is that sort of business. PayPal Co-Founder (and, ironically, CEO of one of the bubble/'momo' companies today, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)) Elon Musk thinks a PayPal spinoff makes sense:So add that to the list of reasons for a spinoff - there are no synergies between the rest of eBay and PayPal.Or are there? The company's main argument for keeping eBay and PayPal together is claimed synergies. Apparently the businesses exchange data, PayPal leverages the eBay.com platform to acquire users, there is overlap in transaction security, etc. I think that makes sense as well, and while the Icahn/Musk view drew support from much of the investment community, if the businesses were separate I could just as easily see whimsical analysts arguing for synergies between the two again.What I'm getting at is that I honestly don't know whether eBay and PayPal are more valuable together or apart. What bothers me though is the hostility that the proposal was met with. CEO John Donahue seemed defensive from the very beginning. I understand that Icahn's reputation precedes him, but being reluctant to even consider options that could potentially create shareholder value does not make me confident that executive management at eBay are the stewards of value that I am looking for. Many informal and nasty letters were sent on both sides and the press releases from eBay later on in the proxy fight seemed more concerned with the job security of management than creating value. I think the situation could have been handled much better, a la Apple-Icahn.Performance & ValuationBecause of the varying performance and prospects across eBay's 3 divisions, I think a sum of parts valuation method is appropriate. I will assign an appropriate multiple to each division and then calculate a weighted multiple for the entire firm based on the % of the firm's total value of each division. I will then apply this weighted multiple to both 2013 after tax EBIT and LTM free cash flow and blend the two results together.MarketplacesGMV and revenue have been growing at 12-13% with stable margins. As mentioned earlier, this segment has good prospects with 17% projected annual global e-commerce growth over the next 4 years, but competition is already intense and should heat up a great deal more. I am assigning a multiple of 16 to the segment.PaymentsPayments EBIT has grown an average of 27% in the past 2 years but was only 17% in 2013. TPV has been growing 25-27% and accelerating in recent quarters, but this has been partially offset by intentional reductions in take rate to keep PayPal ubiquitous:(sequential quarters from right to left)SourceAs a result, revenue growth has averaged 23% in the past two years and was 19% in 2013. Margins have been stable. I think 18-22% is a reasonable range for profit growth in the next few years and also think a premium valuation is appropriate because of the business' leading competitive position and excellent industry prospects. I am assigning a multiple of 25.EnterprisePerformance has been entirely inconsistent and it is not clear what competitive advantages Enterprise has. The division has been adding value for its clients as shown by solid GMS, but that is not trickling down to the division's own financial results.SourceKeep in mind that this is not too important to the overall valuation. I am assigning a multiple of 9.Valuation Summary:The composite multiple comes out to just under 20x, reasonable if not somewhat conservative for the 19.2% average EBIT growth the consolidated company has posted over the past 2 years. The company's trailing FCF was substantially larger than 2013 EBIT after tax due to favorable changes in working capital, depreciation > capex, and substantial stock-based compensation which resulted in a large discrepancy between the two methods. Also note that I added cash but excluded the $3B that will be paid to the IRS at some point related to repatriation. I also added the $800M the company paid to acquire Braintree in December as the cash is gone but Braintree is not included in any of 2013 financials and only 1 quarter of the LTM FCF figure.My calculations resulted in a fair value price target of $60.71, just over 20% above where eBay stock is trading currently. That is pretty substantial for a $64B US company in this expensive market.ConclusionI believe there is worthwhile upside on eBay shares right now, but am still reluctant to invest due to governance and competition concerns. If I were to invest in eBay it would be a concentrated position because that is my strategy. For me to pull the trigger I would need to believe my thesis to be bullet-proof, but unfortunately it is not. In thinking through all aspects of the story, I keep coming back to the threat of Apple and Amazon. Those may just be the worst two companies to have to compete against and for that, I probably would not sleep well at night owning eBay shares. I think eBay is far from the worst US large cap available right now though. If it continues to decline, say another 10%, I would reconsider it. Despite this article coming to mixed conclusions, I hope it will offer value to readers.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company’s operations are growing like a clockwork with sustained year-over-year growth across almost all operating metrics including active buyers, number of active PayPal accounts, total payment volume and gross merchandise volume (GMV). There was some impact of seasonality in overall GMV that led to a small sequential decline. But looking at the company’s historical performance, the decline appears to be within the expected range. eBay is strengthening its position globally by improving its delivery system and boosting mobile commerce, and expects to grow its revenues by 12% to 15% in 2014.However, we notice that the take rate has come down in the last two quarters. This can be partially blamed to a slowdown in StubHub’s business, which has higher than average take rate. eBay needs to address this in order to maintain its profitability.We are in the process of reviewing our price estimate for eBay in light of recent earnings, and will have an update ready soon. Our current price estimate for the company stands at $60, implying a premium of about 10% over the market. eBay’s Commerce Volume Growth Remains Impressive, Mobile Focus Clearly Visible In Q1 2014, eBay enabled $58 billion of commerce volume which represented an increase of roughly 24% over the first quarter of last year. This growth was driven by its focus on mobile, cross-border trade, especially in China, and the symbiotic relationship between eBay’s marketplaces business and PayPal. The company enabled about $11 billion of mobile commerce volume during the quarter, which accounted for roughly 19% of the total enabled commerce volume. In this regard, we believe that eBay is doing at least as good as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or may be better, as the latter reportedly earned roughly 5% to 8% of its revenues from mobile platform in 2012.According to eMarketer’s forecast, global business-to-consumer e-commerce sales are expected to jump by roughly 20% in 2014, amounting to $1,500 billion. This expected growth is higher than what the industry saw last year, and much of it will be driven by the continued uptake in mobile usage in emerging markets, expansion into new regions and advancements in payment and shipping services. We believe that eBay will continue to benefit from these tailwinds and achieve its 2014 targets.Service Enhancements Will HelpeBay has been aggressively rolling out its new delivery system of ‘click and collect’. The company has signed a partnership with Argos store chain in the U.K., wherein customers can choose from more than 6 million listings from over 100 sellers and collect their purchased items from more than 100 Argos stores across the country. This is somewhat similar to what Amazon does, and will help eBay compete better globally. The company is testing similar strategy in the U.S. as well. eBay is also promoting PayPal’s credit features in order to drive sales. However, the revenue contribution of such services still remains small at this point. Its ‘Bill me Later’ service accounted for 4.4% sits U.S. addressable GMV and 2.1% of U.S. merchant services total payment volume.Disclosure: No positions"
2169203,62713,2014-04-28T09:53:17-04:00,"Over the past four quarters, the company has seen its income grow by an average of 13% year-over-year, including a 26% increase in the January quarter.eBay's revenue has risen by an average of 16% year-over-year over the past four quarters. Management surprised the Street with its biggest jump of 21% in January.With the stock still down 2% on the year to Friday's close of $53.72, the current share price seems attractive on the basis on analysts' high price target of $75.","With worse-than-expected results coming out from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which sent the online retailer's stock tumbling down 10%, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) investors are -- understandably -- nervous for what this may mean for the auctioneer's results. Although eBay stock has done relatively better, down just 2% year-to-date, eBay stock has lost more than 9% since reaching its 2014 high of $59.30. But it's not hard to figure out why.Although eBay is still posting strong growth numbers, both from its Marketplace and from the PayPal division, activist investor Carl Icahn, who owns 2% of eBay's stock, has rattled eBay's boardroom by demanding the company to spin off the PayPal business into a separate entity. Icahn believes this will create more value for both eBay and PayPal. But Icahn has also made things personal.Aside from demanding that eBay spins off PayPal, Icahn recently claimed that board members Scott Cook and Marc Andreessen have not acted in the best interest of shareholders, to put it mildly. He has described their actions as ""lapses in corporate governance."" In a letter to shareholders, Icahn said:Icahn was referencing Scott Cook for his investments in companies that compete with PayPal and eBay. When it came to Andreessen, Icahn claims that shareholders lost out on roughly $4 billion in profit when he sold Skype to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) three years ago in a $8.5 billion deal.All told, eBay has largely under-participated in the strong rally in equities this year, and investors are getting restless. On Tuesday, the company will report its first-quarter results, and you can bet that management will be pressed about details regarding the proposed spin-off and any new developments related to PayPal and ways eBay can leverage PayPal's popularity to further its growth in the realm of mobile.On Tuesday, analysts will be looking for earnings per share of 67 cents. Although that estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days, it is up by one penny since eBay reported its fourth-quarter results. The 67 cents represents a 6% increase in profits year-over-year. Last year, eBay posted earnings per share of 63 cents. For the full fiscal year, analysts are projected a profit of $2.99 per share, 10% better than a year ago.But investors have reason to be optimistic. Consider that over the past four quarters, the company has seen its income grow by an average of 13% year-over-year, including a 26% increase in the January quarter.In terms of revenue, the Street is projecting $4.23 billion for the quarter, which represents a 13% jump year-over-year. Last year, eBay posted revenue of $3.75 billion. For the year, revenue is projected to roll in at $18.26 billion, which will top last year's mark by roughly 14%. As with the strong trend in earnings, over the past four quarters, revenue has risen by an average of 16% year-over-year. Management surprised the Street with its biggest jump of 21% in January.So the fact that eBay has not participated in the strong stock rally is puzzling. From my vantage point, more important than PayPal, eBay's future will hinge on the company's ability to grow its mobile payments business. That's the only way for eBay to prove that it is more than just an online marketplace, which will remove concerns about Amazon's decline.With increased pressure from existing mobile payment platforms like Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) new Gmail Wallet and traditional credit card processors like Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA), eBay management must show that PayPal, which already has more than 130 million active users, can still be a dominant player, especially with rumors of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) now entering the mix.On Tuesday, management must convince analysts and Carl Icahn that they have a suitable plan. And I expect that they will. With the stock still down 2% on the year to Friday's close of $53.72, the current share price seems attractive on the basis on analysts' high price target of $75. Note, the median analysts' price target is $64. And I think this level offers a nice entry for long-term investors, and is a sure bet to reach $60 by the second half of the year.Disclosure: I am long AAPL.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Wall Street Playbook's tech sector analyst.

2170633,23625,2014-04-28T18:53:28-04:00,,"eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings after the market closes on Tuesday, April 29th. The online auction website's earnings won't quite match the strength of the holiday quarter reported back in January, but growth expectations are lofty. eBay has had its fair share of headlines lately due to interest from activist investor and shareholder Carl Icahn who continues to apply pressure to company management to spin off subsidiary PayPal which he believes will increase shareholder value. Management has stuck to its guns and insists that eBay and PayPal have natural synergies and shouldn't be broken up. This quarter Wall Street is looking for an increase in revenue of 12.7% compared to FQ1 of last year and an increase in earnings by 4c per share. Investors have just slightly higher expectations for Tuesday's report.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click Here to see Estimates and Interactive Features for eBay)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for eBay to report 67c EPS and $4.223B revenue, while the current Estimize.com consensus from 47 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 68c EPS and $4.236B in revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting eBay to beat the Wall Street EPS consensus by 1c per share and beat revenue expectations by a thin margin.Over the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize.com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting eBay's EPS and revenue 4 times and once respectively. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69.5% of the time, but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market's actual expectations. It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant. Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case we are seeing a very small differential on eBay's earnings.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from 64c to 74c EPS and from $4.196B to $4.329B in revenues. This quarter we're seeing a moderate to large range of estimates on eBay.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A wider distribution of estimates signals less agreement in the market, which could mean greater volatility post earnings.At the beginning of the quarter both Wall Street and Estimize took their EPS and revenue projections down steeply. Wall Street reduced its EPS forecast from 73c to 67c while the Estimize community lowered its forecast from 72c to 68c. Wall Street also brought its revenue consensus down from $4.306B to $4.223B while the Estimize consensus fell from $4.309B to $4.236B. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and we see that earnings expectations are relatively flat going into the report.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is iMarcelo, who projects 70c EPS and $4.300B in revenue. iMarcelo is ranked 20th overall among over 4,300 contributing analysts. Over the past 2 years iMarcelo has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 60% and 40% of the time respectively throughout 20 estimates. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case, iMarcelo is making a bullish call expecting eBay to beat the Estimize community's expectations on both the top and bottom line.Analysts from both Estimize and Wall Street are expecting a fairly solid quarter from eBay on Tuesday. Contributing analysts to the Estimize platform expect sales to be up 13% compared to FQ1 of last year and expect FQ1 earnings to increase from 63c per share to 68c per share. There is a lot of action going on in the mobile and electronic payments area right now but eBay management has reiterated that it has no plans to spin off PayPal to meet Mr. Icahn's demands. Expect a solid quarter of growth with no news about PayPal from eBay on Tuesday.Disclosure: None"

Consensus is also cautious on increased spending in opex amid a rising competitive environment, and expects 279bps y/y decline in gross margin and 53bps decline in EBITDA margin.Amazon and Google are near-term threatsIn my view, both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) threaten eBay's Market Place business in the near term. Potential market share gain from the offline retailers like Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) may not be sufficient to offset market share loss to Amazon and Google. Google's beta-testing of unlimited same-day delivery will compete directly with Amazon Prime's two-day shipping. Amazon, on the other hand, continues to expand its e-commerce platform with new products and verticals.Payment business under pressureWhile PayPal has dominated the online payment business for quite a while, there is increased competition from well-established internet players (i.e., Google and Amazon) and startups (i.e., Yerdle and Square).To fend off the increasing competition, eBay will have to increase R&D and marketing. However, this strategy may result in further margin decline, which may trigger share price de-rating.Valuation looks reasonable at 16x FY15E earnings and a 1.1x FY15E PEG, compared to the average of 30x FY15E earnings for the e-commerce peers. I am cautious on eBay going into the results season.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

A somewhat cautious guidance for the current second quarter and a massive $3 billion cash repatriation tax bill are the main reasons behind the disappointment.Despite the recent sell-off I believe that the valuation is not appealing enough as the core two businesses of the firm might face increased competitive pressures while Icahn has settled for peace with CEO Donahoe.First Quarter HeadlineseBay generated first quarter revenues of $4.26 billion, up some 14% compared to last year driven by strength at its payment PayPal unit.The company reported a big GAAP loss as a result of tax repatriation charges. GAAP losses totaled $2.33 billion versus a $677 million profit in the first quarter last year. As one of the first major technology companies eBay decided to repatriate $9 billion in cash held overseas.On a non-GAAP basis earnings came in at $899 million which is up by 8%. Modest share repurchases accelerated earnings per share growth toward 11% with earnings coming in at $0.70 per share.PayPal Drives ResultsPayPal has been the driver behind topline growth again. Revenues of the payment unit rose by 19% to $1.84 billion. Total payment volumes actually rose by 27% to $52.0 billion.This means that the average commission which the company fetches per transaction is slowly coming down. Average commissions totaled 3.55% on enabled payment volume, down 22 basis points compared to last year.The unit recorded 148.4 million active accounts which is up by 16%. In total these users made 834.4 million payments which is up by 22%. As such an average user makes $350 worth of payments a quarter, or $62 per average transaction.Marketplace Continues To Lead, But For How LongThe marketplace business continues to be the largest business of eBay generating 10% revenue growth as revenues came in at $2.16 billion. Gross merchandise volumes were up by 12% to $20.5 billion. On average, eBay takes a much larger cut in terms of commissions in this part of the business. Commissions came in at 10.49% of total volumes, down 20 basis points on the year.While the marketplace business is still a little bit bigger than the payment unit, many question how much longer this will be the case. Given the significant growth profile of payment operations, some including Carl Icahn urged eBay to defend the rationale for operating the two businesses in one big corporation. Earlier, Icahn urged CEO Donahoe to spin-off PayPal arguing that a split of the two businesses could generate value for shareholders. In recent weeks Icahn has resolved his issues with Donahoe.Looking Into The Remainder Of The YeareBay sees second quarter revenues between $4.325 and $4.425 billion which is up 12-14% compared to last year. Analysts were looking for a midpoint guidance of revenues around $4.40 billion. GAAP earnings are seen between $0.51 and $0.53 per share, compared to $0.49 per share last year.Full year revenues are seen between $18.0 and $18.5 billion, up between 12% and 15%. Non-GAAP earnings are seen between $2.95 and $3.00 per share as the company expects to report a minor GAAP profit as a result of the tax repatriation charges.ValuationeBay stressed that it held $11.9 billion in cash and equivalents, while having just $4.1 billion in debt, resulting in a $7.8 billion net cash position. A strong balance sheet is needed to some extent as eBay is also starting to extend credit with credit balances coming in at $2.9 billion at quarter's end.At $52.50 per share, eBay fetches a $70 billion valuation, or little over $62 billion net of cash. In this light the cash repatriation charge is sizable as it costs the company $3 billion to repatriate $9 billion in foreign cash which it intends to use to repurchase shares.eBay has some $3.8 billion worth of share repurchases still being authorized after repurchasing $1.8 billion worth of shares over the past quarter.Factoring in the losses following the earnings release, operating assets of the firm are valued at roughly 15-16 times non-GAAP earnings, or roughly 20-21 times GAAP earnings after excluding the repatriation charge.Investment TakeawayInvestors are not pleased about the cash repatriation move which cost the company close to $2.50 per share. With US companies holding so much foreign cash abroad as the debate about the tax is heating up, investors might have wanted eBay to await a deal. To illustrate the size of the repatriation charge, Forbes calculated that if Apple would repatriate its foreign cash holdings it would have to pay a $44 billion tax bill.CEO Donahoe explained the expatriation move by stressing the need and greater opportunity for domestic acquisitions. eBay's marketplace business has seen revenue growth trailing that of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the US. At the same time many start-ups and even established names like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are possibly looking into launching their own payment devices. This ever increasing competition will undoubtedly put pressure on commission margins on which eBay relies in its businesses.While Icahn and Donahoe have settled their disagreements after Icahn urged eBay to split up earlier this year, the latest disappointments continue to put pressure on management to deliver shareholder value. With competition heating up, Icahn's original thesis might have strengthened again.While this pressure might built up over time, especially if the stock remains under pressure, it could spark a spin-off which could create possibly the most value for investors. I don't think pressure is high enough yet at current levels to spark such a move.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2135483,57152,2014-04-10T09:53:47-04:00,"Carl Icahn's proposal of a PayPal spin-off is nearing its end.eBay and PayPal are the best clients for each other, and have grown faster together than they would have apart.Currently, eBay is trading at lower P/E compared to the industry.","eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is a leading global e-commerce platform that operates the online marketplaces eBay.com, Half.com, Rent.com, and Shopping.com. eBay was also makes money through its global payments platform PayPal, that enables secure, easy, quick and cost-effective transfer of payments online.A few days ago Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 1 percent of eBay, put forth a proposal to spin off PayPal into a separate company, believing that both companies would have a higher value as standalone entities and also issued an open letter to shareholders. eBay's management disagrees with Icahn's conclusion and laid out its arguments for why shareholders should reject the Icahn proposal.Why eBay wants to keep PayPalOne of eBay's strengths that investors should find appealing is the company's strong and increasing revenues.Source: YChartsIn the last year, revenues of the company have been trading upward, supported by the rapid growth of PayPal. In the last two years, PayPal's revenues increased by approximately 50 percent and became nearly 41 percent of the total company's revenue.Last year, PayPal generated $179.6 billion of total payments volume, out of which $54.4 billion of TPV comes from eBay's marketplace platforms. Management does not want to spin off its fastest-growing segment.What Would Happen If eBay spins off PayPal?If the two companies go their own way, as Icahn would prefer, would eBay still be able to keep running effectively on its own? Would PayPal?In the last two years, PayPal has become the main growth driver of eBay and contributes approximately 41 percent to the total revenue of eBay. Although eBay's auction business is still expanding, its growth rate is less than PayPal's growth rate. In fiscal year 2013, PayPal's total revenue increased approximately 19 percent, reached $6.6 billion in annual revenue, and the rest of the company's revenue increased by only 11 percent.The best part of the story is that PayPal still has plenty of room left for growth. The service, which processes roughly 78% of eBay's global gross merchandise volume, could benefit enormously from mobile e-commerce. Around 40% of new PayPal users in 2013 came from mobile devices.Source: investor PresentationThe other main point is that eBay does help fund PayPal's growth via profitability. While eBay's marketplace transactions account for 30% of PayPal's TPV, these transactions provide 50% of PayPal's profitability. This is likely due to the fact that PayPal has zero acquisition costs for marketplace customers. eBay essentially provides the customers for free and dramatically reduces associated selling, general, and administrative costs.Meanwhile, eBay strongly benefits from having an online payment system right at its fingertips. Regular users don't have to fumble around for a credit card or mess around with an outside payment system. PayPal is available to cover their purchases, quite literally, at the touch of a button. For those with existing PayPal accounts, payment is smooth and nearly instantaneous. Those without can set one up in minutes by using an email address and funding the account with a payment card or bank account.Final ThoughtsThe presence of strong cash flows associated with PayPal was likely the justification for Icahn's proposal. Stable and increasing cash flows make valuing a stand-alone entity easier, but the two divisions are each other's best clients. Dividing them would almost certainly affect that relationship negatively, and other vendors could jump in to handle eBay's payments. I believe that the activist squabble between eBay and Carl Icahn is all drama. It will soon end when the shareholders reject Icahn' proposal after understanding the importance of keeping the two companies as a single entity.Based on the above discussion, I also believe that Icahn's issue does not affect the company's stock, and eBay can continue its growth as a single entity. Currently, the stock is also trading at a lower P/E 26.59 compared to the industry average of 34.21, but that gives an opportunity for investors to buy it at a significant discount.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by APEX Financial Consultants.

With PayPal, eBay has become an Internet commerce powerhouse and an impressive, hard-to-duplicate payment platform. If this weren't enough to get investors excited about the company's stranglehold on the Internet, Carl Icahn is taking some major steps to coerce the market to recognize eBay's true intrinsic value.The activist guru is encouraging management to conduct an initial public offering (IPO) of PayPal, a move that we think will unlock shareholder value. We've seen companies spin off subsidiaries many a time before, the most recent planned offering is Yahoo (YHOO) and Alibaba, for example. Yahoo has performed wonderfully in light of the monetization and increased liquidity of its investment in Alibaba, and we think a similar ""premium"" can be unlocked should eBay spin off PayPal in a controlled IPO. We say controlled, as both Icahn and eBay's top brass think the deal would only make sense if eBay and PayPal continue their existing business relationship in a secure and enduring capacity.An IPO of PayPal would also allow new management of the separated publicly-traded entity to pursue strategic investments to keep PayPal ahead of behemoths such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that are looking to enter the payment space, but do not (yet) have the same comparable scale and product offerings. Outside of the eBay umbrella, PayPal becomes a more focused entity, with a dedicated management team, and an open market that will price its value more appropriately, eliminating the company's embedded discount within the consolidated eBay.In any case, our stance has been that, while we like the idea of the IPO of PayPal, we like the idea of Icahn forcing the market to evaluate eBay and PayPal on a standalone basis even more. Alibaba, for example, had been stuck under the Yahoo umbrella for years, and it wasn't until the path to Alibaba's IPO that Yahoo's ownership stake in the firm translated into significant pricing gains for Yahoo shareholders. We think eBay is in the early innings of this path, and we're excited about the pricing upside.On a fundamental basis, eBay continues to execute. ChannelAdvisor (NYSE:ECOM) recently released same-store sales of eBay in March, and we liked the performance. According to ChannelAdvisor, March ""saw a 'thawing out' with most e-commerce channels posting increased same-store sales growth in March compared to February."" eBay's same-store sales growth accelerated in the month and came in at 17.8%, up from 15% in February and 12.7% in January. Its legacy auction business continues to face pressure, but eBay's fixed price business advanced more than 20% during the period. ChannelAdvisor noted that this was eBay's strongest month since March of last year.Valuentum's TakeThe ChannelAdvisor data is yet another solid data point for eBay. The company's fundamentals remain strong, and Icahn's involvement should lead to relative price outperformance even in a difficult market environment. We think an announcement by eBay regarding a potential IPO of PayPal is forthcoming, though the timing remains uncertain. If not, we would expect Icahn to increase his stake and become even more aggressive. Under either scenario, eBay's shares should perform well. We think eBay is worth nearly $80 per share at the time of this writing. Like all of our best ideas, eBay is included in the Best Ideas portfolio.Disclosure: Some of the firms mentioned in this article are included in the portfolio newsletter products of Valuentum.

I have a dividend portfolio, which is currently on track to deliver close to $28,000 in dividend income for 2014 and maximize income return. Additionally, I have a growth portfolio, which I am managing to maximize capital returns from established companies. Finally, I have a small venture portfolio, which has the focus of extracting more speculative capital returns from early-stage companies. I am considering eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) as a possible addition to my growth portfolio.Each of eBay's 2 dominant business units (Payments and Marketplaces) have wide moats, which benefit from the network effect. The Marketplaces segment benefits from each incremental buyer and seller that is added to the platform. Additionally, the Payments segment, which is principally PayPal, benefits as more users and more merchants are added to the platform. While Payments is the faster growing segment, Marketplaces contributes greater revenue and greater margins to eBay's business.EBAY has a market capitalization of $71B, with revenues of $16B and a gross margin in excess of 68%. EBAY generates a net income of almost $2.8B. EBAY currently trades at a forward PE of 16.There are some compelling arguments to support the investment case in EBAY, many of which revolve around the strength of the PayPal business.Online payments exposurePayPal and eBay offer unique exposure to the still-expanding online commerce market. PayPal has a very unique value proposition and competitive position that is unlikely to be replicated by any new entrants into the payments space. PayPal provides consumers the ability to shop freely with unknown merchants online, secure in the knowledge that their credit card numbers won't be exposed to these merchants.PayPal has a user base of more than 130M consumers, and almost universal acceptance by merchants. This creates a unique network effect, which serves to effectively lock out new entrants looking to enter the space. It will take a player with considerable merchant influence and a large base of users to displace PayPal in the online payments space.Realistically, that only leaves the likes of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as potential challengers, each of whom have the disadvantage of delayed starts in the payments domain.After some false starts in attempting to crack in-store payments with NFC technology, Google has now pivoted to build online wallet users via Google Play. The real threat for PayPal with respect to Google's involvement in payments is Google's willingness to subsidize interchange fees in exchange for merchant transaction data. Such a move may make merchants far more likely to accept Google Wallet as a checkout mechanism.Amazon's move to offer merchants a single-click checkout which can be integrated within 3rd-party websites is potentially more worrying for PayPal. Amazon has a solid brand reputation with consumers. Consumers will likely have a high level of trust that Amazon will manage their payment information and transaction data in a secure and trustworthy way. Amazon has more than 230M users today, which is a very attractive proposition for merchants, and makes the case easier for them to do the necessary integration to support Amazon Payments. Still, PayPal has a significant headstart in terms of merchant adoption, something which will take Amazon quite some time to catch up.Shift to mobilePayPal has made significant inroads in ensuring that it has presence in mobile commerce and mobile payments. PayPal has had a mobile app presence since almost 2008. During that time, the functionality of the app has expanded beyond just payment and transfer to users now being able to fully manage individual account and add funds, amongst other things.One of the traditional points of friction in paying via the mobile phone has been the inconvenience of entering user names and passwords to authenticate. PayPal is a step ahead here, and has embraced mobile device fingerprint authentication to authenticate users, in partnership with Samsung.Bridge between online and offline paymentPayPal has also been using mobile payments as a bridge between online payments and offline payments. This serves as a very important beachhead to get users accustomed to using PayPal for in-person payments. Examples of in-person payments that are enabled via the mobile app include the ability to pay select in-store restaurant bills via the PayPal mobile app, and also the ability to order ahead, pay and then pick up in-store. All of these help condition users to use PayPal for in-store payments.In-store payments exposurePayPal has been making steady, sustained progress in its efforts to be a major player for in-store payments.PayPal launched PayPal here, which is a mobile-based POS acceptance solution very similar to Square's Mobile Point of Sale reader. This product enables PayPal to tap into the fast-growing SMB space and payment volumes from small merchants.The more interesting activity that PayPal has been doing as far as in-store payments has been some of the direct Point of Sale integration in major merchants, such as Home Depot and Jamba Juice.The elegant point of sale solution allows users to simply input their PayPal credentials directly into the point of sale and have their payment processed, without the need for the mobile device or any other intermediate device.PayPal is extending its in-store payments strategy even further by having a low-energy Bluetooth beacon which integrates with a merchant's point of sale, displaying a user's photo at the point of check out and simply requiring confirmation for payment.While a potentially frictionless way to pay, the stability of the user experience is uncertain, given a requirement for users to enroll to accept communications from beacons, and have Bluetooth enabled, something which the majority of mobile device users typically do not do. Nonetheless, PayPal's efforts here are quite encouraging.Paypal's ability to make significant inroads with in-store commerce is the real ace that could significantly boost the stock. The real potential of the in-store payments opportunity is clear when it is considered that in-store payments represents approximately 80-90% of total payments. In other words, in-store commerce is approximately 8-9 times online commerce. If eBay, through PayPal, is able to capture some of that payment volume, that clearly represents a step change upward for PayPal in terms of payment volume and revenue. However, there remain a couple of significant hurdles in eBay's way to achieve dominance with in-store payments.Value proposition to customersWhile PayPal may be making strong inroads with convincing merchants to adopt its point of sale technology, it's unclear whether consumers will see a compelling enough value proposition to pay with PayPal in-store.PayPal solved a major customer pain point with online payments. That is, it enabled consumers to transact online with unknown merchants without the fear of exposing credit card numbers.What value PayPal is providing consumers for in-store payments remains less apparent. The in-store payment experience is not broken. Consumers can pay, as they always have paid, with their credit cards in their wallets.As other players who have tried to crack the in-store payments experience have discovered, the magic of just being able pay with your phone in-store isn't typically enough of a hook to get consumers excited. Google's efforts with NFC in-store payments and the muted user response provide evidence of this.PayPal does have a possible ace to play here. Merchants are desperate to reduce the interchange that they are paying to the payment networks, which collectively costs merchants over $48B annually. Given PayPal does have the ability to accept ACH payments, it could conceivably work with merchants to incentivize users to pay with PayPal linked to ACH rather than credit cards, and work with merchants to drive loyalty programs around such a structure. This would assist merchants in reducing interchange, and in turn, help PayPal to attract users to pay in-store with PayPal.Pushback from the ecosystemThe really big question mark in my mind as far as PayPal's ability to win with in-store payments is just how the incumbents in the payments ecosystem will respond. Both Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) have a considerable amount at stake from PayPal taking more in-store payment volume over the PayPal network, particularly if this happens via ACH transactions.The likely treatment of PayPal as a staged wallet by the payment networks, and the potentially higher fees that PayPal may have to pay for the processing of Visa and MasterCard transactions gives some insights into how dependent PayPal still is on the payment networks. Any attempts to significantly disrupt the networks core business of in-store payments could be met with significant competitive response. PayPal will continue to be hamstrung in the extent that it wishes to take on the networks, given just how dependent the PayPal business is on payment volume that comes from transactions that run over the Visa and MasterCard networks.ConclusionThe investment case for EBAY is positive as far as PayPal's prospects for continued success in driving online payment volume. With e-commerce and now m-commerce expected to show significant growth going forward, PayPal will benefit from its decade-long lead over Amazon and Google, both of whom will take time to close the gap in spite of impressive assets.The real kicker for the EBAY investment case will be what share of volume PayPal can get from in-store payments. Merchant adoption is only one part of the story, with the consumer value proposition still unclear. Even if PayPal can convince consumers to pay in-store with PayPal, true disruption of the payment networks is likely to be met with a firm competitive response from Visa and MasterCard.I will be watching closely for signs of PayPal's ability to make real inroads with in-store payments, at which point, I will likely consider initiating a position in EBAY.Disclosure: I am long MA, V.

2133843,23479,2014-04-09T15:06:51-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has done well in recent years by reviving its marketplaces business and accelerating PayPal’s growth across the board. We continue to remain positive on the company’s prospects due to its strong performance in North America and international markets and continued adoption of PayPal. Our price estimate for eBay stands at $60, implying a premium of about 10% to the market. This is a reflection of its growing customer base, payment volume, expansion in mobile commerce and the overall growth in the e-commerce industry. eBay expects to grow its earnings and revenues significantly over the next couple of years, and given its recent performance, we believe that management is capable of doing so.Encouraging Performance In Europe eBay’s international revenues jumped from $4.57 billion in 2008 to nearly $8.34 billion in 2013, registering a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.8%. [1] The last three years have been especially rewarding, as the growth was much higher than the overall CAGR for the last five years. Germany and the United Kingdom together accounted for about 49% of eBay’s international revenues in 2013, and close to 26% of its global revenues. Both these markets grew at a similar rate of 15%-16%, whereas the company saw its revenues from rest of the world jump by 13%. All round growth is an encouraging sign as it reduces eBay’s dependence on a single market.Given that the eurozone and the U.K. are coming out of recession, we expect eBay to benefit from some economic tailwinds as demand improves. The company signed a deal with Argos last year, a store chain in the U.K., to allow local shoppers to pick up their online purchases from eBay at ﻿﻿local Argos stores. [2] We believe that eBay will continue to focus on expanding its international presence and lay greater emphasis on PayPal’s growth in emerging markets.PayPal Going Strong PayPal has been going strong with the number of active registered accounts rising from 57 million in 2007 to 143 million in 2013. The company added close to 20 million accounts in 2013 alone. The number of payments and the total payment volume are also growing thanks to the explosive growth in global e-commerce. Given the momentum and the opportunity, eBay is likely to try and push PayPal more in emerging markets where online payments still form a small proportion of the overall payments. E-commerce is still in nascent stage in these markets. Over the next few years, online purchases will pick up, driven by the growing number of Internet users and increased smartphone usage. Mobile is going to be one of the key growth areas for PayPal, not just in the developed countries but also in emerging markets of Asia and Latin America.Focus On Emerging Markets eBay’s marketplaces business will benefit from international expansion in BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries. Foreign retailers are showing interest in these regions due to an increasing market size, a growing number of aspirational buyers, rising personal income and the lack of organized retail penetration. eBay recently raised its stake in Snapdeal.com, which is India’s largest online marketplace. According to research conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in 2012, the retail market in India stands at over $350 billion and is growing at a healthy compounded annual growth rate of 15-20%. As far as the online retail market is concerned, it is still at a nascent stage but seems to have picked up significantly in the last couple of years. Consulting firm McKinsey expects India’s e-commerce market to grow at a rapid pace for the next few years, amounting to $2 billion by 2015. [3] The firm also estimates that the country will have roughly 38 million active online shoppers by then. [2]As far as China is concerned, local e-commerce sites Tmall and Taobao account for the bulk of the country’s marketplaces volume. Owned by Alibaba, these portals have grown their combined gross merchandise volume from RMB 16.90 billion in 2006 to more than RMB 1 trillion in 2012. [4] That’s almost 100% compound annual growth rate for a period of six years. eBay is reconsidering its strategy on China and is likely to invest going forward to gain foothold in the region.Our price estimate for eBay stands at $60, implying a premium of about 10% to the market.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"

One in every six dollars spent on e-commerce is through PayPal.EBAY produced an approximately 346% return in the last five years and outperformed GOOG and the S&P 500 Index.EBAY is continuously investing in growth opportunities. EBAY has leadership in m-commerce.In 2013, EBAY handled $35 billion worth of volume that grew by 88% compared to the previous year.","eBay and PayPalPayPal is one of the services that are transforming the payment industry, and its acceptance is increasing globally. Value created by PayPal translated into great success, and PayPal's payment volume tripled between 2008 and 2013 at a CAGR of 25%. One in every six dollars spent on e-commerce is done through PayPal. This success attracts investors and analysts to eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Presently, EBAY is under intense scrutiny from analysts and investors, thanks to Carl Icahn.Pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn, who owns a 0.82% stake in EBAY, built up to spin off its PayPal business. Icahn is of the view that spinning off the PayPal business and operating it under a separate management team would unlock the true potential of PayPal. EBAY's board and CEO John Donahoe were under fire, and the corporate governance of EBAY was being questioned. EBAY's CEO, John Donahoe, was ranked the number one CEO in 2013 by sell-side analysts in Institutional Investor Magazine. EBAY's management maintains that its PayPal business creates the greatest value for shareholders if kept together with EBAY.Icahn seems to have retreated from this demand, and now he demands that EBAY sell only 20% of the PayPal in IPO. The proposed partial separation of PayPal will be a similar case to that of EMC's (EMC) partial spin off of VMware (NYSE:VMW), in which 15% of the VMware was separated from EMC through an IPO. This really unlocked the value of VMware, and VMware's value increased by more than 100 times the price EMC paid to acquire it. It is argued that such subsidiaries that have great future growth potential are often overshadowed by the conglomerate effect that hides their true value. If EBAY agrees to make an IPO of PayPal, then it is expected that PayPal will enjoy the same success as enjoyed by VMware. I believe that Icahn's only motive is to drive up the stock price of EBAY's shares, and he is not really concerned about the fulfillment of his demand.PayPal has no doubt it will experience tremendous future growth potential. It makes up around one third of EBAY's value. The PayPal business along with EBAY's other businesses are all set for future growth. Investors should consider investing in EBAY, since all the heated discussion is going to increase EBAY's price as the debate is based on the argument that EBAY and PayPal have greater potential that still needs to be unlocked.EBAY's e-commerce StrengthsEBAY has expanded its business rapidly and is connecting more buyers and sellers every day. Leveraging its strong stable cash flow, EBAY completed 37 acquisitions since 2008 and grew its portfolio of investments. EBAY started off as an auction-based marketplace site, but its dynamic management allowed it to continuously evolve so as to create better value for buyers and sellers. In 2013, 73% of the items offered were at fixed prices rather than at bargain prices.EBAY captured the growth in mobile commerce and attained its leadership in m-commerce. In 2013, EBAY handled $35 billion worth of m-commerce volume, and this volume was 88% more than the volume in the previous year. EBAY is well-positioned to ride the upward trend in m-commerce that would translate into growth in its top and bottom lines.Comparative Return and Valuation of EBAYEBAY's successful strategies are translating into great returns for its shareholders. The following chart compares the return produced by EBAY, the S&P 500 Index and the two tech giants, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), over the past five years. EBAY produced an approximately 346% return over the last five years and outperformed GOOG and the S&P 500 Index. EBAY has a beta of 0.92 that shows that the company has lower systematic risk compared to the systematic risk of the overall market, thus presenting superior risk-adjusted returns.Source: Yahoo FinanceEBAY's business model has created a tremendous amount of value in commerce, and it is continuously leading the transformation of global commerce. This is the reason why EBAY has seen a strong growth in revenues. Its revenues grew at a CAGR of over 19% in the last nine years. Its revenue growth has slowed down in the recent years, but it is still in the double digits. Its revenue grew at a CAGR of 13.44% in the last five years. Online US retail is expected to increase by over 10% in the coming years, and EBAY is in the right position to take advantage of this growth. With its strong competitive position in the e-commerce industry, EBAY is expected to produce high returns in the foreseeable future.Source: ReutersWe can estimate whether or not the company is undervalued, overvalued or properly valued by comparing the price multiples of EBAY with the price multiples of the industry. First we compare the 26.26 times P/E multiple [TTM] of EBAY with the industry's P/E multiple of 34.63 times. This indicates that EBAY is relatively undervalued. EBAY's price/sales, price/book and price/cash flow multiples are also lower than the industry, and that also suggests that EBAY is undervalued.EBAY is relatively undervalued compared to the industry in which it operates, and its competitive strength and innovative capabilities make it a company that one should seriously consider investing in at its current price levels.ConclusionEBAY is consistently awarded Fortune's Top 50 Most Admired Companies, and it's also honored as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. EBAY's investments are helping it to grow rapidly. It outperformed the industry's indices and GOOG. It is expected to produce attractive returns for its stockholders in the future. Relative price multiples suggest that EBAY is undervalued compared to the industry. Therefore, EBAY is an attractive company to invest in.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

But eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) increasingly fills that intriguing bill. Revenue has nearly doubled over the past five years. Granted, that’s about one-third the pace of revenue-crazed Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but then again, eBay actually manages to churn out earnings growth along with its none too shabby revenue growth:EBAY EPS Diluted (TTM) data by YChartsAnd eBay has been showing up in some interesting value spots. Morningstar says that eBay currently sells at near a 15% discount to Morningstar’s (NASDAQ:MORN) estimate of fair value. Add in the fact that eBay is also one of the rare stocks covered by Morningstar to earn a coveted wide moat rating, and you’ve got yourself an interesting stock for these times: a global firm (52% of 2013 revenue came from international markets) with an enduring competitive advantage that happens to sell at a decent discount in a market that doesn’t.eBay’s peace pact with investor Carl Icahn removes a distraction from the stock and from management's life.(Morningstar, an investor in YCharts, pegs the overall market as currently selling right in line with fair value.) eBay is in fact one of the 20 stocks currently in the index-beating Market Vectors Wide Moat ETF (BATS:MOAT) that tracks a Morningstar index.The management team at Weitz Value mutual fund seems to think eBay is an even bigger value. As we’ve covered earlier at YCharts, the Weitz team gets interested in stocks that they surmise trade at discounts of 40% or more to the managers’ estimate of intrinsic value. And in the first quarter, Weitz Value established a small (for them) 1.4% stake in eBay. What’s worth noting is that Weitz isn’t at all interested in relative values. For the past year, they have been lugging around a 30% cash stake as they’ve sold or trimmed winners and have not found a wealth of new deep discounts to get excited about. That they’ve still managed to post a 19% return -- fewer than two percentage points below the S&P 500 -- over the past year while nearly one-third of their portfolio earns nothing is a testament to some stock-picking chops. As is a 21% annualized gain over the past five years that is nearly one percentage point ahead of the S&P 500.The fact that Weitz Value put money to work in eBay is especially telling. And it’s got some interesting company among other top value funds. Yacktman Focused established a 1.5% position in the fourth quarter of last year, and the venerable Vanguard Wellington fund owns eBay and was adding to its stake in the fourth quarter of 2013 (we’ve yet to get Yacktman and Wellington’s Q1 portfolio filing.)While Carl Icahn can bellyache about spinning PayPal from eBay, it’s easy to see why the eBay board has no interest. Active registered accounts at PayPal and Bill Me Later (acquired by eBay in 2008) grew by one-third the past two years and the total payment volume processed through both systems grew 50% over that stretch, to nearly $179 billion. PayPal’s share of eBay’s revenue has grown from around 40% at year end 2011 to 44% at the end of last year, as it becomes a bigger player in third party payment solutions.Net income growth has slowed the past few years as management has upped its investment in sales, marketing and product development. The latter grew from $1.235 billion in 2011 to $1.7 billion last year, with much attention given to building out both eBay Marketplace and PayPal mobile apps.EBAY Net Income (TTM) data by YChartsThat goes a long way to explaining the stock’s stagnation of late in a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately world. But for more patient value investors, eBay’s spending is an investment in future growth and moat defending.EBay’s near 22 forward P/E ratio isn’t an absolute bargain given the 17 level for the S&P 500, but given its strong revenue growth, it’s not anywhere near nose-bleed level, either. And there’s now more than $9 billion on the sidelines in cash and short-term investments, providing some extra operational gunpowder.Moreover, eBay has turned up its ability to generate free cash flow, (something Yacktman in particular always appreciates), which certainly hasn’t been reflected in the price:EBAY Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsDisclosure: None"
2114713,24491,2014-03-28T11:54:09-04:00,"It doesn't much matter whether PayPal has an IPO or not, especially now that attention has been brought to eBay’s significant under-pricing on a consolidated basis.We are more excited at what the news of the IPO will bring than the idea of the IPO itself.Shares of eBay trade in the mid-$50s at the time of this writing, implying significant upside on the basis of our valuation.","Global commerce and payments leader eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has been in the news quite a bit lately. First, Carl Icahn came public with his intentions to invade the firm's board of directors in hopes of pushing for change and encouraging a spin-off of its fast-growing subsidiary, PayPal. Then, in probably one of the more ironic situations, another one of Carl Icahn's activist targets, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), indicated that it is considering exploring options in mobile payments, which could impact eBay's PayPal business to a degree. Icahn has since backed off from applying pressure on Apple, but the activist icon is currently hoping that eBay will conduct an initial public offering of PayPal, selling 20% to the public. We like the idea very much.Expecting eBay to Rocket HigherThough Apple is a giant with near-unlimited resources and a credible threat to PayPal over the long haul, we still like eBay's (and PayPal's) long-term potential. Recently, eBay reported that revenue in its fourth quarter advanced 13% and non-GAAP earnings jumped 16%, the latter to $0.81 per diluted share. Total company Enabled Commerce Volume jumped 22%, Marketplaces and PayPal achieved record mobile results, and PayPal revealed accelerating momentum in its merchant business. Profitability was solid, with the company's operating margin jumping to 22.6% in the fourth quarter from 21.9% in the same period a year ago. The firm's free cash flow was also quite impressive, coming in at $1.4 billion in the quarter (about 30% of revenue), and eBay ended the year with $12.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. It's difficult not to like the recent performance.Looking ahead, eBay's outlook came in slightly lower than our projections, but we think management is being conservative, particularly with its full-year 2015 guidance (nearly two years away from being actualized), which pegs net revenue in the range of $20.5-$21.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth greater than 10% above the targeted 2014 range of $2.95-$3.00. We expect future bottom-line results to be buoyed by the authorization of an additional $5 billion stock repurchase program. Though a credible threat, Apple won't be able to impede PayPal's pace of expansion anytime soon (in our view), and we point to Pandora's (NYSE:P) resiliency in the wake of Apple's invasion with iTunes radio as supporting evidence for this view.eBay's results and outlook provided in its most recent quarterly results, however, aren't the most important thing to us at this juncture. Instead, we are focusing on and very much like that Icahn is actively pushing for the company's undervaluation to be resolved by the marketplace (a tangible catalyst for shares to rocket higher). Here's the latest release from Icahn (source):Though the likelihood of an IPO of PayPal remains remote, we are more excited at what the actions toward pushing for an IPO will bring than the idea of the IPO itself. We understand the board's and Carl Icahn's respective views (there's been a ton of back-and-forth since the original disclosure), but whether or not eBay conducts an IPO of PayPal is largely irrelevant (to us) at this juncture. What is relevant is that the market (in evaluating the potential upside of an IPO) will begin to better understand eBay's significant underpricing on a consolidated basis, even after accounting for Apple's competitive entrance.It is our view that the headline and continued activist push toward an IPO will drive investors and analysts back to their valuation models to derive a sum-of-the-parts valuation of eBay, which is much higher than the Street's current expectations. We're puzzled by some of the recent commentary by sell-side analysts that they're not in favor of such an IPO (a mere financial transaction that would not change the substance of the relationship between eBay and PayPal). It's possible that if sell-side analysts were to come out in favor of Icahn, they may lose favor or fluid access with the management team (a classic conflict of interest). This is a distinct possibility as providing management access to the buyside is one of the key jobs of sell-side analysts this day and age.Valuentum's TakeThere are a variety of ways that eBay can reveal its underpricing to the markets, and we continue to believe that Carl Icahn is serving as a necessary catalyst. The pricing of an IPO of PayPal and PayPal's underlying ""embedded value"" within a consolidated eBay are two different measures, and the difference of which represents the primary gap between eBay's share price (high $50s) and our estimate of the company's intrinsic value (high $70s). Yahoo (YHOO) has been a case study of the recent success from the coming IPO of Alibaba. We maintain our view that eBay's shares are significantly underpriced. We're expecting them to rocket higher in coming periods, as evidenced by its rating of 9 on the Valuentum Buying Index, our stock-selection methodology.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2097713,42971,2014-03-19T10:31:35-04:00,Paypal is ideally suited to create a merchant and customer centric virtual currency.Virtual currencies are likely here to stay so companies like Paypal should embrace the concept.Bitcoin will never be a mainstream virtual currency because of its volatility.,"I recently wrote an article about eBay that was picked up by Investors Business Daily.In the article I argued that Paypal could be eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) Alibaba (ABABA). Most importantly I discussed how an independent Paypal would be more likely to pursue a potential ""virtual currency"" to compete with the Bitcoin. I've written a lot about alternatives to the Bitcoin, and at least to me a better mouse trap is obvious. The Bitcoin killer will be a merchant centric stable value virtual currency, that has all the benefits of the Bitcoin without the speculative volatility.The comments I got on that concept were that Paypal wouldn't want to do that because Paypal is very profitable, and they would sacrifice existing earnings. That is 100% true and buggy makers made a lot of money...until the Auto came along. Facts are Paypal can either get in front of this Bitcoin bandwagon or get run over by it. Microsoft's ex-CEO Steve Ballmer is known for mocking and ridiculing change instead of embracing it. He focused on preserving existing markets and products and allowed the world and opportunities to dramatically pass him by while MSFT remained relatively unchanged. Paypal should not make that same mistake.Right now tobacco company Lorillard (NYSE:LO) faces a similar situation to money transfer companies. Like the Bitcoin to money transfer, the e-cigarette is threatening to dramatically alter the entire tobacco industry. Lorillard can either turn a blind eye to the emerging threat, or it can embrace it and have it work for it. Lorillard has embraced the e-cigarette and has decided to make change work for it instead of getting run over my it. When a ""gale of creative destruction"" blows, companies have to either pull up the sails and harness the energy to ride with the change to a new location, or stay tied to the dock and get blown over by its force. E-cigarettes are going to happen whether or not the traditional cigarette industry likes it or not, so it is in their best interest to embrace the inevitable change instead of fighting it.Right now, like the tobacco industry, the money transfer and banking industry is getting hit by a ""gale of creative destruction."" Only problem is, if the Bitcoin stays as is, it will never turn into a category 5 hurricane. The Bitcoin as a virtual currency is a joke, and a very bad joke at that. Yea, I know someone got an A+++ in their computer science class for developing it, but that person failed econ 101 on an epic scale, and never even made it to Money and Banking 301.Marc Andreessen took offense to Warren's comments and ""tweeted"" an insult, basically calling Warren a luddite.The problem for Marc is that both Warren and Dan are correct, the Bitcoin has zero chance of ever becoming the virtual currency of choice for merchants and causal consumers which make up 99.9999% of the potential market.This video highights the fatal flaw of the Bitcoin enthusiasts. Like the climate warmists and End the Fedders, the Bitcoin enthusiasts simply have ideological blinders on. The benefit of the Bitcoin is its ease of use, security and low costs/transaction fees. That benefit however is immaterial when compared to the costs and risks involved with its volatility. I can tell a Bitcoin enthusiast 1,000 times that the average consumer or merchant doesn't give one hoot about saving 1% on a transaction fee or possibly making 100% appreciation, when by the time they can check their e-mail the Bitcoin may have fallen 50%, or the exchange where their wallet resides no longer exists, and it will simply go in one ear and out the other. The Bitcoin enthusiasts simply dismiss the risks assuming that merchants and consumes will be willing to risk their entire life's savings and business to support the Bitcoin cause. They simply won't, not matter how desperately the Bitcoin enthusiasts want to believe they will.Most people simply aren't libertarian fanatics wanting to undermine the global financial system. Most people have no interest in the political philosophy behind a deflationary currency or hate the Federal Reserve and have no interest in becoming high risk currency speculators. The Bitcoin is specifically designed to be a volatile bubble machine. The attraction of the Bitcoin by design is its volatility. The hope was that the possibility of huge gains to be made by holding the Bitcoin will get more and more people to use it and more merchants to accept it. The fatal flaw of volatility inherent in the Bitcoin is an essential part of its design. It is deliberately designed to be what most don't want in a currency, that being volatile.That is where Paypal comes in. Paypal and other companies are likely to take the Bitcoin virtual currency and alter the code to suit their needs as well as those of their customers."" The ultimate virtual currency likely to survive the market Darwinism will be a virtual currency that has a stable value, is secure, can be anonymous, is easily transferred with an e-mail, and have very low or no fees. Those are the characteristics that are important to most merchants and consumers, and that is what virtual currencies will eventually evolve to.The problem as I see it now is that VC firms like Marc Andreessen's are trying to build an ecosystem around the flawed Bitcoin. They are catering to the Bitcoin instead of getting out the box and designing a Bitcoin to satisfy the needs of the consumers and merchants that will ultimately use it. The flawed Libertarian ideology is inherent in the Bitcoin. Unless that is rejected, virtual currencies will always have a prohibitive level of volatility. If the Bitcoin and future virtual currencies every want to succeed the volatility has to be addressed. As long as the owner of a Bitcoin, be it either the customer of the merchant, has to risk losing far more than they can save or benefit from using the Bitcoin, it will never go mainstream, it is that simple.The first firm that figures that out will be the Bitcoin killer, and Paypal has the potential to do that. A stable value ""Palcoin"" would allows customers and merchants to use a Bitcoin like virtual currency without fear of it losing its value. Paypal could also provide secure ""wallet"" and other services. That is what I speculate to be the future of virtual currencies, and Paypal is ideally suited to make that future a reality.Disclaimer: This article is not an investment recommendation or solicitation.

2106053,23479,2014-03-24T15:34:35-04:00,,"Active investor and billionaire Carl Icahn has a reputation for shaking up management of the companies where he owns a significant stake. He has been actively writing to eBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) management and board of directors about spinning off PayPal from eBay. As the management has stayed firm in its opinion, he has now made a tactical change by suggesting partial spin-off by selling 20% stake through IPO. [1] PayPal is growing rapidly and there may be an impression among shareholders that the division is carrying the whole company and will command a higher valuation as a stand-alone entity. However, given the co-dependent relationship and synergies that exist between PayPal and eBay, we continue to believe that a spin-off may not be a good idea, unless a mechanism is put in place that nurtures this relationship. In this analysis we’ll argue why it is better for eBay and PayPal to continue operating as a combined entity.Our price estimate for eBay stands at $59.70, implying a slight premium to the market price.eBay acquired PayPal in 2002 as it made a lot of sense. Despite strong marketing, eBay’s own billing service Billpoint was not able to compete against PayPal, which was gaining market share very quickly. At that time, roughly 40% of eBay’s transactions were happening electronically and it was imperative for it to invest in making online payments faster, secure and easier. [2] PayPal was doing very well on these fronts. During the last decade, eBay’s payments related revenues have gone up from merely $438 million to $6,628 million, registering a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 31%. During the same period, revenues from the marketplaces business have jumped from $1,727 million to $9,419 million, implying CAGR of 18.50%. Clearly, the combined entity has benefited PayPal rather than subduing its growth, which puts Carl Icahn’s claims that ‘eBay is stifling PayPal ‘s growth under doubt. In fact, much of the growth has come in recent years as PayPal’s penetration increased on eBay’s platform and the marketplaces saw a revival. Both entities have a symbiotic relationship which may be affected by a spin off.That’s not the end of it. The combined entity has been able to harness certain synergies and save operational costs, which was one of the reasons why eBay bought PayPal in the first place. The resulting cost saving feeds the cash pool available for re-investment. Now whether this investment is directed towards PayPal or eBay’s marketplaces business is not important as either way, PayPal will benefit.Carl Icahn’s earlier suggestion was for eBay to spin off PayPal as a separate entity. We disagreed with this view as a significant portion of the investments made in PayPal are being funded through cash flows generated from the marketplaces segment. In addition to this, PayPal owes a notable portion of its success to its integration with eBay. These synergies would be disturbed, or lost, if the company were to spin off PayPal as a separate unit. Now the billionaire investor, softening his stance, is suggesting a partial spin-off of PayPal with eBay retaining the majority of the share. The essence of his argument is that having two highly focused and dedicated businesses will improve PayPal’s competitiveness in the online payments market. There is some merit to this argument as separation from eBay could hamper PayPal’s funding and push it out of its comfort zone, creating an incentive for the management to step up its product development and marketing efforts. The other way to look at this is that the management would be free from bureaucratic shackles of the parent company and invest in more ambitious projects. However, the argument about the symbiotic relationship still holds, and we believe that eBay may not consider this unless strict commercial agreements are put in place to nurture the relationship between eBay and PayPal, going forward.Partial spin-offs can be done to reduce credit risk. However, eBay is a cash rich company with $9.87 billion in net cash and cash equivalents as of December 31 2013. Icahn hasn’t given any cogent arguments or evidence that may suggest that eBay has stifled PayPal’s growth. Historical data indicates otherwise. The number of accounts and the total payment volume has been increasing at a rapid pace and there is plenty of opportunity to tap international markets. eBay’s growing presence can certainly help PayPal there. On the surface, it looks like a suggestion that’s more likely to result in short-term gains for shareholders and overlooks what may be best for eBay and PayPal in the long run.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"

A similar story is developing right now with eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). eBay owns PayPal, and Carl Icahn has recently taken notice. What should make this an interesting story to follow is that Carl knows how to piss in a pool like no other.The case Carl makes however is very compelling, and with the recent developments with the Bitcoin, an independent PayPal may be just the right approach to expanding its market and value.I would add one additional point to the above list, PayPal could develop its own merchant centric virtual currency called a Palcoin that is designed with the merchant's needs in mind, unlike the currency speculator centric Bitcoin. I imagine PayPal could do that now, but given that they haven't, I assume eBay either hasn't thought of it or isn't interested. An independent PayPal would likely be forced to address the virtual currency issue.Right now eBay has a market capitalization of $77 billion, and its stock has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and YHOO over the past year. A PayPal IPO could be just the thing eBay needs to jumpstart its stalled company. Even talk of one is likely to be a positive for the stock price.PayPal is estimated to be worth $40 billion, or over 50% the value of eBay, right now, but having followed the YHOO Alibaba story last year, early estimates tend to be wrong, every wrong. When I wrote my first article on Alibaba, it was valued at $38 billion.The last article I wrote on the subject had Alibaba valued at $153 billion.While I doubt PayPal will show the explosive increase in valuations that Alibaba has, a virtual currency angle to the PayPal IPO could dramatically change the calculus. Personally I've been amazed at the passion, fanaticism and longevity that surrounds the Bitcoin, even after all the bad press. The Bitcoin has survived the Mt Gox and other disasters, and is still trading over $600 with a market value of over $8 billion. Personally I think the Bitcoin is being manipulated to give the illusion of success, but still, it currently trades at over $600, manipulation or not. Bitcoin is designed to be manipulated, and that will forever prevent it from being a widely accepted currency. If the Bitcoin can take a very bad idea and make it a semi-success, imagine what PayPal can do with a good idea. The Bitcoin is designed to attract currency speculators, not merchants and consumers. PayPal could be the first to make a virtual currency for merchants and consumers, users that demand stability, certainty and reliability, not volatility, uncertainty and speculation.Bottom line, Carl's attention towards eBay will likely drive the stock higher on its own. While I don't know what the eBay board or shareholders will do, I imagine that I will be writing future articles highlighting how analysts are boosting the valuation of a possible PayPal IPO. As/if those valuations go higher, so will the chances of a PayPal IPO.Disclaimer: This article is not an investment recommendation or solicitation.

2071113,22675,2014-03-06T06:55:15-05:00,,"After failing (for now) to convince Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to return its massive cash reserves to shareholders, Carl Icahn has turned his activist mind to eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), launching a full blown offense on its executives and board. If you have not yet heard about it, I highly recommend that you take a look at some of these posts:It's been entertaining to see, and I do understand that he's trying to get some changes made. It looks like he thinks the only way to get these things done is to go ahead with a massive public attack. If I understand well, the main points he's arguing are:I basically agree 200% with one of these statements and only mildly with the 2 others. Clearly, the company has been executing poorly. Is it ""the worst managed company in the world""? Of course not… but it's well below average. Not only has its main marketplace suffered, but it's also clear that while Paypal-- its most valuable asset-- has increased revenues and income, its actual product is not as good as competitors. It has kept its market share mostly because it's the default payment method and that is a powerful thing.However, that won't last forever and the fall could come much sooner if Paypal does not get its act together. Nimble startups such as Stripe are moving quickly and could eventually gain enough traction to fraction the payment space. Paypal remains a clunky product that has poor customer service and is a poor experience for a large portion of users. I do still think that eBay remains a buy at these levels because it will take much longer than expected to take out Paypal, but the company does seem like it's doing a poor job of working its transition to the 21st century.I do understand that spinning out Paypal could lock out some value for EBAY shareholders and there's also an outside chance that it would help the company innovate more, etc. But to me, spinning out would make the most sense if there was little integration between Paypal and the rest of eBay, which is not the case. Should the company be renamed Paypal to give it the focus it deserves? Perhaps... but who really cares?Saying that the board has members with conflicts of interest might be true to some extent, but in this world where companies like eBay, Apple, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are doing so many different activities, it makes little sense to expect to have board members that have no conflicts at all. Marc Andreessen is a venture capitalist that I follow, and while I understand that he also sits on boards of potential eBay competitors, I would still give him the benefit of the doubt but I also think he's the type of guy that brings a critical perspective to eBay.One big issue with the company is that they have not evolved very much and while it's a challenge to know who should be blamed, I'd argue that he would be one of those to know what the company should evolve into. One counter-argument I'd bring is that it is true that Daniel Loeb shaking up things at Yahoo (YHOO) does seem to have worked incredibly well, so giving it a shot might not be the worst idea in the world.Disclosure: Was long eBay (EBAY) but closed the position yesterday morning."

[1] The U.S. e-commerce giant had earlier invested close to $50 million in the same company. These investments also include a commercial partnership under which eBay will get access to Snapdeal's 20 million registered users, logistics software and distribution network. [2] It makes sense for eBay to raise its stake as Snapdeal.com is expanding rapidly and expects to grow its gross merchandise volume from INR5 billion in 2013 to INR30 billion in 2014. [1] We expect India's e-commerce market to see explosive growth as buyers develop comfort with online purchases and Internet usage increases.Our price estimate for eBay stands at $59.70, implying a slight premium to the market price.The Indian Online Retail Market Can See Tremendous GrowthAccording to research conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in 2012, the retail market in India stands at over $350 billion and is growing at a healthy compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15-20%. Foreign retailers are showing interest due to a large market, a growing number of aspirational buyers, increasing personal income and the lack of organized retail penetration. As far as the online retail market is concerned, it is still at a nascent stage, but seems to have picked up significantly in the last couple of years. The consulting firm McKinsey expects India's e-commerce market to grow at a rapid pace for the next few years amounting to $2 billion by 2015. [3] The firm also estimates that the country will have roughly 38 million active online shoppers by then. [4]Marketplaces Model Is Likely To Gain Popularity In IndiaLooking at the long-term potential and current growth in India's e-commerce market, it appears that there may be enough room for several retailers and competition shouldn't be a big concern. Moreover, the restriction on pure play foreign retailers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is likely to limit their services in the country. Indian regulations do not allow foreign online retailers to have a fully-owned Indian arm that sells merchandise directly in the region. This is why Amazon cannot sell the merchandise that it owns, but can essentially act as an aggregator for other retailers. This can limit the company's control over its profits and supply chain, but plays right into eBay's strengths. eBay has been in the Indian market for a while and already dominates the U.S. market when it comes to a marketplace model where it acts as a medium between individual buyers and sellers (including businesses).Disclosure: No positions."
2049773,24747,2014-02-26T09:20:30-05:00,,"Once again corporate raider and white knight Carl Icahn has launched an attack on the status quo. His latest battle, which pits him against board members and the management of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), shines a spotlight on a part of corporate America few get to see from the inside.Perhaps Gordon Gekko said it best when he told Bud Fox; ""Wake up pal; if you're not inside you're outside.""In his letter to shareholders Carl claims that board members Marc Andreessen and Scott Cook have breached their fiduciary duty. He also had very harsh words for CEO John Donahue calling him ""completely asleep ..."" In his letter, he questions why eBay sold Skype for less than what they paid, especially considering Mr. Andreessen is on record saying ""Skype is the archetypal phenomenon: a breakthrough technology."" He asks; Did Mr. Andreessen share this strong view with Mr. Donahoe?Carl points out that an investor group including Mr. Andreessen, preempted a planned IPO buying 70% of Skype for less than what eBay had paid to acquire it. He gives quotes from Mr. Andreessen suggesting he knew Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) would be a willing buyer at a significant premium.The letter continues accusing Mr. Andreessen of making investments in and actively advising five direct competitors to eBay (four of which are competitors of PayPal). He claims this occurred while he was privy to nonpublic eBay Board information. Carl's Open Letter to eBay StockholdersI'll leave it to Carl and shareholders to determine the validity of these claims but if true it is another example of shareholder rights being trampled.With Carl involved, eBay, whose stock has struggled over the last year, has a bid trying to break out to a 52 week high. Merrill Lynch analyst Justin Post believes that with Icahn demanding a separation of eBay and PayPal, their fast growing payment solution, investors will start to appreciate eBay's sum-of-the-parts valuation.Business As UsualFor too long, Gekko's statement above has been the norm. Once voted in, directors often seem more focused on keeping their job than actually fighting for shareholder rights. How many times do we need to see this movie before we wake up and do something about it?In December, I wrote a series of articles describing egregious failure at the board level dealing with CEO compensation. When I wrote Freeport McMoRan: Let the Shareholders Vote I pointed out how the board gave CEO Adkerson an early Christmas gift of $36 Million in the form of an up-front severance package.In You're Fired I talked about Occidental Petroleum's (NYSE:OXY) Ex-CEO and Chairman Ray Irani coming with his hand out looking for a severance package and received $14 Million. According to Bloomberg from 2001 to 2009 Irani received an annual compensation of $80 Million.DeclassifyIncreasingly a small subset of shareholders is pushing for reform. These investors are looking to force public companies to declassify their boards. Votes for directors in a classified board occur on a staggered basis. The entire board is never up for re-election at the same time and therefore becomes difficult for activist shareholders to gain enough seats to cause change or reform.According to ProxyMonitor.org 8 Fortune 250 companies held votes to declassify their boards in 2013 and thereby removing the staggered voting structure. All but one, PACCAR (NASDAQ:PCAR) received a majority vote. Since 2006 there has been significant gains with more than 3/4 of companies in the S&P 500 now declassified.Independent ChairmanAn even more important governance issue seems to be gaining steam. Last year, again according to ProxyMonitor.org 39 Fortune 250 companies held votes demanding an Independent Board Chairman. Too many CEO's fill both roles with an obvious inherent conflict of interest. Even though the CEO doesn't participate in the compensation committee it's hard not to imagine there is an incestuous relationship, especially with CEO's that have had a long tenure.Progress here is still a struggle. According to Price Waterhouse Coopers LLP at the end of 2012 only 43% of S&P 500 companies had an independent chairman.Activists on the MarchActivist investing is clearly gaining steam. Whether its Carl going after the boards at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and eBay or Dan Loeb of Third Point pushing for changes at Sony (NYSE:SNE), investors seem to be tagging along for the ride. According to theStreet.com an IRRC study in 2009 of 120 companies found shareholder returns were 19.1% to 16.6% higher than peers following a proxy contest.Even this morning we see another headline in the Wall Street Journal discussing the battle shaping up at CommonWealth REIT (NYSE:CWH), traditionally a sector where activists have had little success because of corporate charters that prevent any one investor from owning more than 10% of a company's shares.VoteJust like your local elections, change happens when people show up. Having the right to vote is useless if you don't exercise it. How many Americans lash out at their representatives both locally and nationally but fail to go to the polls to cast their ballots.If investors don't vote their shares then the burden falls completely on the institutional community. Even institutions drop the ball including yours truly. I intend to focus more closely on the mountains of proxies that come to our firm.Remember if your want change, you have to show up. Stand Up and Be Counted.Disclosure: I am long AAPL. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it.

2081163,62833,2014-03-11T12:25:42-04:00,"Growth, solid fundamentals, and a $5B share repurchase program are all positives.The technical breakout supports the fundamental story.Having Carl Icahn as a partner is a good thing.A trifecta is in the making for a higher share price.","eBay Inc., headquartered in San Jose, California, is a leading global e-commerce marketplace bringing millions of buyers and sellers together to exchange goods and services. The company has over 16,000 employees and a localized presence in 24 countries across the globe.I have written about eBay numerous times in my instablog commentary that covers my call writing portfolio here on Seeking Alpha. The strategy has provided relatively safe income time and time again by purchasing shares and selling calls against that position as the stock was range bound for quite some time.However, last year I noticed that the fundamentals were also improving and in addition to my position in the call writing portfolio, I decided to add shares to my account @ $51.30.Feeling more confident, I then marked EBAY as one of my stocks for 2014.I believe the fundamentals alone make a compelling argument for share purchase. From a valuation perspective, eBay has grown its EPS from $0.82 in 2008 to $2.07 in 2013. Last year also saw revenue growth of 14%, with the Paypal division growing at a remarkable 19% and their latest quarterly report which details these accomplishments also announced a $5 billion share repurchase program.Recently eBay broke out of the trading range I mentioned earlier as it closed @ $58.77 on February 28th. This last round of strength has come with Carl Icahn's involvement in the company, as in addition to the fact that he has purchased a stake in eBay, he is now taking on a more 'activist' role.In a letter to eBay, Mr. Icahn proposed that eBay spin off PayPal, and unlock the value he sees in the company. The company then responded that it believes it is in shareholders' best interest to keep eBay and PayPal as one company, given operating synergies. The battle lines have been drawn. I like having Mr. Icahn as my partner.Here is the weekly chart showing that breakout.First, let's take a look at the trading range in 2011, then the upward breakout to the next range that developed in 2013.The old intraday high in the upper range was $58.04 with a closing high of $57.31. With a close of $58.77 and an intraday high of $59.70 on February 28th, the technical breakout is confirmed. It was also an all-time high.The old all-time record high was recorded in December '04 when the stock hit an intraday high of $59.17 and a close of $58.17; both of these milestones were surpassed last week.The adage of what was resistance will now become support ($57.50- $58.50) should play out in the shares as it did when it broke the first trading range in 2011. Notice the 2012 breakout, then the quick retest of that new support (old resistance) @ $35-$36 followed by the march higher.Now it has to be noted that the stock surely had the overall market tailwinds at its back in 2012 to assist in the stock charging ahead. Now that the S&P has come a long way, we may not have those same tailwinds.Even so, there are many stocks that will outperform the overall market and this may be one of those names.There are no guarantees, but the same could very well be in the offing for the shares now, as was evident in the earlier breakout in 2012. False breakouts can occur, but with the Icahn involvement and good fundamentals, I like the prospects that this breakout is real. This may then be the trifecta to take EBAY to new all-time highs.With no overhead resistance, the shares could trade up to the mid 60's, my original target when I initially bought the shares back in December.The recent surge last week leaves EBAY overbought on a short-term basis. However, any weakness could suggest a buying opportunity.Given the market weakness over the Ukraine situation, I added shares to my initial position at the open @ $57.92 on March 3rd.Disclosure: I am long EBAY.

2041373,41741,2014-02-23T04:53:37-05:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is the largest auction site on the internet. It also owns one of the world's leading payments companies, PayPal. eBay has jumped onto many investors' radars over the past week as notable billionaire and activist investor, Carl Icahn, has taken a stake.Icahn has been a force over the past few decades and was quite possibly the most successful activist in 2013, taking market moving stakes in major companies that included Netflix, Herbalife and Chesapeake Energy.Our question is becoming, is Icahn biting off more than he can chew of late? Of course, many thought the same thing when Icahn made his big bet on Netflix and we all know how that turned out. Icahn's latest battle include going toe-to-toe with Apple CEO Tim Cook and trying to push eBay to spin off PayPal.As far as eBay goes, it appears to be doing fine on its ownOver the last three years, from 2011 to 2013, the internet company grew revenues 37%, gross profit 34%, and operating income 42%. And it doesn't stop there; the stock is up 260% since its low in 2009, and the technical indicators are bullish.eBay is also crushing industry averages on a trailing twelve month basis, with gross profit margin at 68% versus the industry average of 64%, its operating profit margin is at 21% compared to the average -1.8%, net profit margin 17% vs. -7.2%, return on equity of 13% versus 11%, return on investment 10.4%, compared to 9.6%, and revenue per employee $479,015 versus $323,372, etc. etc. etc. As you can see, the company seems to be doing quite well.It's not all sunshine and rainbows thoughHowever, the e-commerce giant still has a number of issues that need to be dealt before we're ready to call eBay a growth story. Those issues have actually been what's keeping the lid on its stock price, as it hasn't been able to break out of a trading range of $48 to $58 since November 2012.Firstly, the numbers over a longer horizon aren't all that appealingOver the trailing twelve months, eBay's stock has gained a mere 3%, whereas the tech-heavy NASDAQ is up 33%. And from 2011 to 2013, its net income dropped 11%, profit margin decreased by 35%, and EPS declined 11%. In addition, eBay's trailing 12 month revenue growth rate of 14% was well below the industry average of 33%. This may indicate that the company is becoming less efficient at using its resources. eBay's PEG ratio is also at 1.7 while the industry average is less than 1.0.Second, Icahn could prove to be a major distractionCarl Icahn, who owns approximately 1% of eBay, has put a proposal to spin off PayPal into a separate company on the table, believing that both companies would have a higher value as standalone entities. eBay management disagrees with Icahn's conclusion and has indicated its reluctance to such a move. As a result, a protracted proxy war may be unavoidable. Sometimes these issues take years to settle, only adding to the uncertainty moving forward.Also, because the benefit of a divestment of PayPal is uncertain and the methods and timing of a resolution are unclear, an unfavorable environment from a credit standpoint may be created for the foreseeable future. It is also possible that if eBay were to spin off PayPal, the remaining Marketplaces business would encounter higher long-term business risk since its growth prospects would be tied to its ability to bridge the gap between online and offline retail. While PayPal might thrive as a standalone company, it's not clear that eBay Marketplaces would have the necessary tools to execute its retail strategy.Finally, there's just too much competitionAny conversation about competition in the tech space is not complete without mentioning Apple. The tech giant, which also has its own battle against Icahn, recently-announced an effort to explore its own mobile-payment business.This plan to compete with eBay is not welcome news for PayPal, which is one of eBay's key cash flow generators, accounting for over $20 billion in revenue in 2013, about 40% of eBay's overall revenue. Although PayPal is the world's most popular mobile-payments service, boasting over 140 million registered users, the competition in the sector was intense even before Apple's announcement. You already have the likes of Square and Stripe clamoring for a spot on consumers' phones, helping make it easier to pay for physical goods via smartphones.It's unclear exactly what Apple has in mind, what technology it will use, or what its goals are. It could simply act as a mobile wallet, which is what Google Wallet has attempted to do. It could also give customers the ability to make in-app purchases for non-digital goods using credit cards already associated with its 575 million iTunes accounts.It's also possible that Apple could allow iTunes accounts themselves to be used as a payment method at physical stores for physical goods and services. Regardless of which route it goes, it could an instant major player.All in allWhile eBay certainly has its strengths and is not stagnant in its pursuit of success, one has to wonder whether it can overcome the serious challenges that lie ahead. Trading at 25x earnings and 4.5x sales, it's already stretching its historical trading multiple averages. Using its historical price-to-earnings multiple would suggest it should be trading closer to $50. Because there are multiple large dark clouds on the horizon, we recommend staying away from the stock until the future becomes a bit clearer.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2025011,56822,2014-02-16T08:45:32-05:00,,"Big retail companies including Target (NYSE:TGT), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Macy's (NYSE:M) now have stores on eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY). However, this online seller has struggled in the past against its competitor Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) who is considered a better alternative in terms of locating products and a better shopping experience. However, with PayPal under its hood and with significant improvements, it will be no time before eBay begins posing a challenge to Amazon. In this article, we will go through the company's latest quarter bringing up the key highlights. Later, we will shift our focus towards the company's future initiatives that will help drive investor value.The QuarterBeginning with the marketplace, the holiday season quarter gave strong revenues that increased 11% to $2.3 billion as a result of 14% growth in active accounts obtained by improvement in mobile and customer experience and partially due to the Christmas season. I will discuss these improvement highlights later in the article. The margin was 41.1% in the quarter at the upper end of the company's 38-42% guidance range strengthening our confidence in the projection of the company.With regards to PayPal, it can be said that the payment merchant is a strong backing for the company that will take it to greater heights. Revenue reached $1.8 billion, increasing nearly 20% on a currency neutral basis year over year driven by accelerating merchant services growth and strong growth on eBay. The unit increased penetration on eBay by 175 basis points this quarter.As of year-end, 70% of the US internet retailer and 63% of the EU internet retailer had integrated PayPal. It is evident that PayPal is a very strong component that Amazon lacks, and together with its integration on channels other than the eBay marketplace, it will ensure that seasonal variation for eBay is smoothed through revenues brought from online retail vendors.Total operating expenses were 40% of revenue down 165 basis points mainly due to lower sales and marketing from improved marketing efficiencies and a shift in spending on improving product and user experience. Non GAAP EPS increased 16% to $0.81, and the company generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow. All in all, the quarter was successful owing to PayPal's strong performance, increasing mobile usage, and better features that are being introduced.The FutureI believe the features that have come to my attention could enhance the viewership on eBay resulting in immediate sales. Good search placement is vital for any eBay seller to sell their products. A year ago, this was a simple process, as search results were based on the presence of keywords in listing titles. However, this didn't bring much success for the company, as Amazon still offered a better alternative. However, things have begun changing since eBay introduced Best Match. Now, the company has launched what it calls Cassini. Cassini is data-driven and is about moving outside listing titles and producing a direct correlation between the list of results and the word that a shopper has typed. eBay has an enormous block of data on hand that includes seller performance, buyer preferences, market trends and correlations of an infinite variety. Through Cassini, rather than just finding a keyword match, the company is enhancing the way buyers search for products.Good search capabilities are a vital component that can make a sale for eBay. This is the same reason why users prefer Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) search engine over those of competitors. Cassini might not look big at the moment, but I believe it can create a psychological impact in the longer term for consumers to revisit eBay after their initial purchase.Source: PresentationThe BML Option is Another Achievement for the CompanyMoving away from search results and towards making payments, the Bill Me Later [BML] option recently introduced by PayPal is proving to be another success and is at its market making stage. By greater adoption on eBay, the company is able to accelerate usage of BML on eBay by giving consumers another funding choice. The increased penetration is further helping the bottom line by lowering PayPal's transaction expenses.The BML option is an addition to preserve the dominant position PayPal holds. The business generates around 40% of the company's sales and is growing faster than the marketplace. Regarding the concern about the spin-off of PayPal offered by Icahn, I don't think it will come to fruition, because there is a lot of healthy growth on the back of PayPal and its mobile operation. Spinning off the unit is unlikely in such a situation, as PayPal accounts for as much as half of eBay's $70 billion market value.These two features sum up my analysis regarding factors that can significantly impact the company's value. However acquisitions, such as that of Braintree, will also help company reduce potential threats that could snatch market share from PayPal in the future. These strategies together portray how eBay is destined to deliver superior performance for those long term investors.ConclusionResearch firm Forrester estimated last year that online retail sales in the US will reach $370 billion by 2017, increasing from $231 billion in 2013 by a 10% CAGR over the next five years. Though eBay and its ecommerce peers are positioned to benefit from this trend with better search optimization and PayPal behind to successfully back payments, it seems evident eBay will be performing nicely for the betterment of investors in the future and much better than its competitors. Based upon the analysis, I give eBay a strong buy rating.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1965611,25120,2014-01-24T09:41:08-05:00,,"Carl Icahn's next target is eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), urging the company to split itself up. CEO Donahoe resents the idea, pointing towards the rationale for holding the combined operations within one firm.Given the relative underperformance of the stock over the past year and Icahn's aggressiveness, the battle is on. This could potentially become lucrative for investors if Icahn wins.Icahn Focusing On TechnologyAfter buying a $3 billion stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Icahn has again focused on a technology name to become active. Icahn acknowledged that he bought an 0.82% economic stake through derivatives and shares in the company, valued at roughly $600 million.Icahn believes eBay should spin-off the highly successful PayPal payment unit which the company bought for $1.5 billion back in 2002. Being a separate company could spur adoption of PayPal for other online retailers, and spur growth.Icahn nominated two of his employees for the eBay board which includes prominent names like venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, among others.eBay Defends The Rationale Of Keeping PayPalCEO John Donahoe acknowledged that he received a call from Carl Icahn, who initiated a stake in the firm. Icahn is so excited about PayPal he believes it is better off as a separate business.Donahoe confirms that the idea of a spin-off is not new as management and the board routinely reviews all strategic options. Yet eBay believes the company is better off keeping PayPal within the firm.He believes PayPal is successful because of its part of eBay and not despite being owned by it. Donahoe believes eBay accelerates the success of PayPal, making its offerings smarter and financing the growth of the business.There are furthermore synergies of technological capabilities, data, commerce and relationship with banks, retailers and other parties, according to Donahoe.BattleIcahn is serious and his track record is strong. He furthermore has a time horizon of years to engage in a battle with companies and won't let management off the hook that easily. While Donahoe's defense is reasonably strong, his argument is weakening every day with PayPal growth value outpacing that of eBay.To put shareholders on its side, the company announced a new $5 billion share repurchase program, sufficient to retire roughly 7% of the outstanding share base at current levels. The company has a sufficient $9.0 billion in cash and equivalents, while it operates with $4.1 billion in debt, resulting in a sufficient net cash position.With the strong growth and PayPal being responsible for 40% of current revenues, it already reflects the majority of the company's value, according to some analysts. You can see the resentment of management to a spin-off, cutting the size and value of the company in half.A Quick Peak At Fourth Quarter ResultsAt the same time, eBay announced its fourth quarter results as well. Revenues rose 13.5% to $4.53 billion, while earnings rose by 13.2% to $850 million, or $0.65 per share. Non-GAAP earnings of $0.81 per share came in a penny ahead of consensus.Growth is fueled by the PayPal unit which reported 19.1% revenue growth to $1.84 billion, now making up 40% of total revenues. Payment volumes rose by 25.3% to $52.0 billion in the meantime, reporting solid growth.Growth at the traditional eBay marketplace was 12.1% to $2.30 billion. Perhaps the high fees in relationship to $21.5 billion in merchandise volume is limiting top line growth.Timid 2014 OutlookFor the current year, eBay looks for revenues of $18 to $18.5 billion, falling slightly short of consensus estimates at $18.5 billion. At the midpoint of the guidance, revenues are seen up by 13.7% on the year before.Non-GAAP earnings are seen between $2.95 and $3.00 per share, with GAAP earnings seen between $2.40 and $2.45 per share.For 2015, revenues are seen between $20.5 and $21.5 billion, suggesting 15% growth at the midpoint of the revenue guidance for 2014 and 2015. Despite the strong topline growth, there appears not to be a lot of operating leverage in the business model, with the company guiding for non-GAAP earnings per diluted share growth of at least 10%. Given the economies of scale and technology scaled business this is surprising, as eBay should be able to reap more operating leverage benefits.ValuationBy 2015, PayPal could make up roughly $10 billion in revenues assuming by then it makes up half of total revenues. Competitors MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) saw very strong returns in 2013, both trading far above 12 times annual revenues. While PayPal's profitability lags these majors, a multiple of even 8 times revenues would result in a market value of $80 billion. This is roughly equivalent to eBay's current market capitalization.For simplicity we would add another $20 billion valuation for eBay assuming $10 billion in annual revenues, and applying a slight revenue multiple discount compared to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).This alone could warrant a $100 billion valuation, valuing the business at around $75 per share.What's Next?Icahn won't let eBay of the hook that easily. Valued at nearly $75 billion in after hours trading it will be hard to see how much potential is left as the company does not break down earnings from eBay and PayPal separately.One thing is for sure, with the value being attributed to PayPal potentially more than 50% of the current market capitalization, management has done a great job. Remember that it bought the business for $1.5 billion little over a decade ago. The strong mobile position of the unit is a big plus as well.The majority of the times Icahn has stepped up, initial buyers have been able to profit from his moves piggybacking on his efforts.If Icahn can succeed and the market picks up his thesis, the combined value of the spin-off could be as much as $75 per share, suggesting some 30% upside. This incidentally is the extent of eBay's market underperformance in 2013.I might initiate a speculative long position based on Icahn's thesis.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in EBAY, over the next 72 hours.

Founded in 1995, it quickly took off as the ""original"" online marketplace, eventually spawning sites like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Overstock (NASDAQ:OSTK) in years to come. It's approaching its 20 year anniversary, which in Internet years, makes it a billion years old.

The company has been a swing traders dream, bouncing from $50 to $55 about once a month for the past year:eBay reported earnings on Wednesday of this week and produced excellent results for investors. The company told investors that it had a great holiday season. eBay posted net income of $850 million, an EPS beat of $0.81, and $4.5 billion in revenues - up 13%. - from eBay.com)But, that wasn't all of the story.By now, the news has dropped that Carl Icahn has taken a stake in the company to the tune of 0.82% - and already, just one day after disclosing his position, he's annoying management.Part of Icahn's plan for eBay was to spin off PayPal, which is currently a part of eBay, into its own company. eBay purchased PayPal in 2002 for $1.3 billion - since then, PayPal has been growing faster than eBay itself. ABC reported on eBay's response to Icahn:Additionally, Mr. Icahn requested members on eBay's board, to which eBay responded that they would consider them ""in the normal course of business"" - which, in business speak means, no way in hell.Yet again, Icahn is simply thinking of short term growth for himself with this spinoff. The facts are that eBay cannot afford to lose PayPal. Why?But, the problem with eBay right now isn't so much a valuation one - the company trades with a P/E of 25.70 (a bit high) - it's the fact that the platform is starting to become archaic and will, in my prediction lose out to Amazon. eBay, on the Internet, is synonymous with ""old"", not unlike MySpace, Friendster, AOL (NYSE:AOL), or Hotmail (NASDAQ:MSFT). If you ask the 18-24 demographic where they do their online shopping, the trend is likely to be moving in the direction of companies like Amazon. The ""original"" eBay user base - believe it or not - has aged 20 years since the company started.Additionally, you have a growing constituency of people like Matthew Levy, who recently commented on eBay:With a short interest in the stock so just 1.7% of the float, there's no shorts to squeeze out, so an upward catalyst is going to have to have some beef to it. The company has a price/book value, currently, of 3.12 - giving a nod to the fact that there is room for this company to pull back.The forward valuation of the company looks good to investors (P/E around 15), but as soon as the company can't continue to grow, the valuation behind eBay is going to start to look out of whack. And, according to eBay's guidance, we could be at the precipice of the company pulling back a bit:Finally, the insider trading record of the company over the last year isn't anything special at all. Insider buys are outnumbered by sells/options executions by a 17 to 96 clip.(from Nasdaq.com)At the end of the day, Icahn or no Icahn, I'm steering clear of eBay. Though I'm not necessarily advocating it as a short at these levels, I'd be wary marching into 2014 as to whether or not the company is going to be able to sustain the growth that it has. Icahn is simply making a pest of himself at this point. From an investing standpoint, I agree with his stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) - but not the way he pushes short term gains over the long-term health of a company. He could be more trouble than good here for eBay - and I'll watch this one from the sidelines.Best of luck to all investors.Disclosure: I am short YELP, .

Upon making his investment, Icahn proposed splitting off eBay's business unit PayPal as a separate company. So far, eBay has resisted Icahn's proposal.After battling PayPal in the market for online payments, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002. Since then, PayPal has become eBay's fastest-growing business division, riding a boom in online payments. In 2013, PayPal had 143 million users and processed $180 billion in payments. PayPal's online-payment capabilities are a major asset for its parent company eBay, which is based in Silicon Valley.In a press statement, eBay announced that its board considered Icahn's proposal and rejected it. The company stated: ""eBay's Board of Directors has concluded that the company and its shareholders are best served by the current strategic direction of the company and does not believe that breaking up the company is the best way to maximize shareholder value.""Undeterred by such resistance, Icahn is nominating two of his employees for seats on eBay's board. In an interview reported by the Wall Street Journal, Icahn stated that an independent PayPal could become acquired, making the prospect of a spinoff even more attractive. ""PayPal is the gem,"" stated Icahn. Icahn said he will engage in a proxy fight, if necessary, to split off PayPal.Gearing up for a fightIn a proxy battle, activists like Icahn attempt to persuade shareholders to use their individual proxy votes to oppose top management. Icahn is a battle-tested veteran of corporate power struggles. Recently, he challenged Apple, Dell, and Netflix before targeting eBay.Splitting off PayPal is not a new idea. Such a proposal has been considered and rejected before. Analysts are divided about whether a spinoff would be a net positive for shareholders.Analysts who favor the proposal maintain that eBay's competitors would be more willing to use PayPal's online-payments platform if it were not part of a larger rival like eBay. Analysts who criticize Icahn's proposal believe that keeping PayPal in-house helps eBay compete against larger companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Moreover, spinoff critics argue that a unified eBay helps fund PayPal's long-term expansion.Future prospects for eBayRegardless of the outcome, the publicity of a high-stakes battle over PayPal will focus attention on eBay. Analysts note that management will be under increased pressure to deliver value to shareholders, one way or the other.""Rest assured that when we see a path that unlocks value, we pursue it,"" said eBay's Chief Executive John Donahoe in a January 22 conference call discussing fourth quarter 2013 earnings. Annual revenue increased 14 percent at eBay, while earnings were up 15 percent. Over the past three years, eBay's stock price has increased approximately 75 percent.Investors will do well in 2014 following Icahn and eBay's management team.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1966251,23625,2014-01-24T12:26:52-05:00,,"Wednesday afternoon eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported its FQ4'13 earnings. Technically speaking, eBay narrowly beat the Wall Street consensus on profit, but also missed on revenue. Given what happened in the brick and mortar retail sales world this holiday season, it might be time to sound the alarm.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.On Wednesday eBay reported quarterly earnings of 81c EPS and $4.530B revenue. Meanwhile Wall Street was expecting 80c EPS and $4.555B revenue and the community consensus from Estimize.com was 81c EPS and $4.557B in sales.Over the past 7 quarters the profit forecast from Estimize.com has been more accurate than Wall Street 4 times. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69.5% more accurate than Wall Street, but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market's actual expectations.It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus.What is this means is that eBay's report from Wednesday was really a miss, not a beat. The buy-side as represented by the Estimize consensus was expecting the 81c EPS that eBay reported, but also had higher revenue expectations. Given the weakness in retail sales at physical stores in December, expectations for e-commerce websites have surged lately, and it's a discouraging sign that eBay missed. Here is a graph of the buy side revenue expectations for competitor Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Something similar happened with the eBay revenue consensus leading into the report, but eBay failed to report inline with forecasts.Based on our quantitative research we have found that if you benchmark against the market on average, when a firm misses the Estimize consensus the stock price tends to drift downward over the next 3 trading days after the market reopens. Of course in this case there is another big story from Wednesday's release, other than the numbers, and it involves Carl Icahn.In Wednesday's report eBay announced that famous activist hedge fund manager Carl Icahn, a 0.82% shareholder of the company, has nominated 2 board members and recommended that subsidiary PayPal be spun off into its own company. Icahn's argument is that by unbundling the two platforms into separate companies lead by separate management, both could be run more effectively. eBay CEO John Donahoe has rejected the idea and insisted that eBay and PayPal have strong synergies and there is no reason to break PayPal off. Specifically Mr. Donahoe cited the position of PayPal as a leader in mobile payment, which enhances eBay's position as a mobile platform going to in future.Whenever activist investors get involved in a stock, the future is uncertain. From a strictly fundamental point of view, eBay experienced year over year growth this quarter but failed to live up to the buy-side's expectations. The risk of Amazon and other e-commerce websites capturing more and more of the online commerce market has become a threat hanging over eBay's head."
1979391,51782,2014-01-30T06:02:50-05:00,,"eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is an e-commerce and payment company that has seen tremendous growth through two of its services--eBay and PayPal. Through these services, the company has managed to grow revenues by 14% in FY2013 along with a significant increase in transaction volume. This coupled with strong mobile adoption of the two services, and I believe that the market has undervalued eBay by as much as 40%.High Growth in Both E-Commerce and PaymentseBay is the e-commerce arm of eBay Inc., and provides around 60% of eBay's revenue, while PayPal provides the other 40%. Therefore, if one were to forecast continual growth of eBay, one would have to provide significant evidence to support both the long-term viability and growth of the e-commerce market and the online payments market. Therefore, I will attempt to prove just that in the following paragraphs.Though, present performance is not indicative of future performance, one cannot simply ignore the tremendous growth that both eBay and PayPal have seen in recent fiscal years. In fact, in FY2013 alone, revenue for eBay grew by 14% (from $4.2 billion in annual sales), and revenue for PayPal grew an even more staggering 19% (from $6.6 billion in annual revenues). Furthermore, looking at total payment volume (TPV) of PayPal and eBay, we get an even clearer picture of the growth achieved by these two services. TPV for eBay grew by 14% for FY2013 on $76.5 billion in revenues, while TPV for PayPal grew by 25% on $180 billion in transaction volume. eBay Inc. has not only been able to grow revenues, it has actually accelerated its revenue growth in the past few quarters. Thus, there is no sign of either e-commerce or online payments slowing down anytime soon. In fact, even eBay forecasts significant double-digit growth going into the next 2 fiscal years. However, it is not just eBay that forecasts tremendous growth in the coming years, many projections call for double-digit CAGR for the global e-commerce market. In fact, when put into perspective, eBay's growth is only modestly above projected growth rates. Consequently, due to PayPal's tight integration with eBay, you will see tremendous growth in PayPal's revenue as well, due to increased spending on eBay. This translates into significant growth for both of eBay's services in the coming years. Therefore, the estimates provided by eBay are in no way bullish or overly optimistic estimates that misrepresent the company's potential earnings.Pessimists might say that projections are just projections, and there is no evidence to support those estimates. But they would be wrong in their reasoning. Aside from eBay's past results that clearly support this premise, there is an undeniable trend towards online shopping and e-commerce in general. A growing amount of people are starting to leave traditional brick-and-mortar shops to go towards the convenience that online shopping provides. This trend is reflected in the rapidly growing e-commerce market (which had around $1 trillion in revenues last year) and the waning sales of the traditional retail market. Even Deloitte--in its report on retail for 2013--predicts the future of retail will be in e-commerce. In its report, it states that,eBay will be the beneficiary of the ""paradigm shift"" in retail, which will help drive the company's double-digit revenue growth in the coming years.Strong Mobile AdoptionMobile users represented 40% of eBay's 36 million new users in the last fiscal year. Furthermore, eBay's mobile commerce volume was up 88%, which represents tremendous growth in mobile commerce volume YOY.Why is mobile adoption of eBay's services so important? There are billions of mobile devices in the world today. With an ever-expanding base of mobile devices getting connected to the internet, coupled with waning desktop users, it is paramount that internet companies--like eBay--get a share in this new ""growth"" market. Without having a strong hold on mobile, eBay will potentially miss out on the billions of dollars in sales that mobile consumers will spend in the coming years. The following table, courtesy of eMarketer.com, paints a picture of the extent of mobile commerce sales--which includes past and expected mobile retail sales.Source: www.eMarketer.comWe see in the preceding table that mobile commerce will be instrumental in the growth of e-commerce. As a result, eBay's strong position in mobile will help the company further expand its revenues.ValuationI always try to leave bias out of valuations, and so that is why I clearly laid out the premise before attempting to do a valuation on the company. This way, you can clearly see where I come from and why I chose the numbers I did.Please note that in the following valuation, I use a DCF model (i.e a discounted cash flow model), with a 15% discount rate. For the terminal value, I simply use the perpetuity model, assuming a 2% CAGR in perpetuity (which is around the current inflation rate). I also assume in the valuation model that margins, SG&A and capex will be relatively stable, simply due to the strong e-commerce and online payment presence that eBay has.For this valuation model, I project eBay to grow 10% for a time period of 10 years--based on eBay's current FCF of $3.6 billion--which is not all that unreasonable considering the points listed above, and the fact that the global e-commerce market is expected to grow faster than 10%. Nevertheless, I chose to use this lower CAGR as I wanted to be on the safe side.The following is the table that lays out the cash flow numbers used in my DCF valuation:Adding the numbers together, we see that eBay is worth around $100 billion. Divide $100 billion into 1.29 billion shares, and we get a per share value of $77 (which is 42% above eBay's current market price). Further, the per share value of $77 does not factor in any buybacks; if we were to factor in eBay's $5 billion buyback plan, the per share value would be around $83.Please note that my valuation of eBay assumes that it underperforms its peers--i.e the e-commerce sector in general--even though the reverse is likely to be true. Consequently, one could say that my estimates are still conservative; however, I chose to be on the safe side, and not over-estimate the earnings potential of the company.ConclusioneBay is a company that is trading significantly under its intrinsic value of $77 per share. The market has mispriced the company, and anybody smart enough to take advantage of this situation will be rewarded in the long run.Disclosure: I am long EBAY.

In the article I will discuss the expected role of smartphones as a key growth driver of the catalog and mail order industry and the company's ability to take advantage of future endeavors.OutlookModern and busy life styles with less time available for shopping are fuelling the growth in mail order markets. Other key drivers of growth in this market are low investment and capital requirements for service providers which result in a bigger number of products offered to customers. According to Global Industry Analysts this market is likely to reach $835 billion by 2015.The catalog and mail order industry is a very competitive, large, and rapidly growing industry that is significantly affecting physical retail. Despite the fact that in a physical retail store the customer has the benefit of physically examining the product, consumers' comfort with online shopping is resulting in continuously increasing online sales. Ultimately this fact does not suggest that the need for stores will evaporate. Still, for many people in most circumstances, in-store shopping is and will remain the preferred means of shopping.In 2010, 3.8% of total visits to e-retailers stemmed from smartphones. As long as smartphone adaption increases mobile traffic to e-retailers also increases due to the introduction of different user friendly and efficient mobile apps facilitating online shopping. Furthermore, it is easy for customers to cross check and compare prices while shopping online. Smartphone adoption has a very important in the online shopping market. In 2013, 39% of the visits to e-retailers were made through smartphones. This figure is growing so fast that by the end of 2014 it is expected to reach 53.2% denoting almost 49.6 billion visits to e-retailers through smartphones. In 2015 this percentage may increase to 60%.Source: Internet RETAILERSAccording to FORRESTER, cross-channel sales in the U.S. will reach $1.8 trillion by 2017. Cross-channel sales are those which are influenced by the website but are completed in stores. Direct e-commerce sales (including mobiles and tablets) may cross $370 billion 2017. Total retail sales in the US are estimated to reach $3.6 trillion by 2017, 60% of which will be performed directly on smartphones or tablets. Major contributors to cross-channel sales are likely to be apparel, grocery, consumer electronics, home improvement and accessories industries and will constitute almost $1.1 trillion of the total expected cross-channel sales of $1.8 trillion. In next five years, almost 10.3% of total retail sales in the U.S will be completed online and will result in $370 billion in web sales of the $3.6 trillion expected total in retail sales.Current PositioningEBay is the second largest e-commerce site that attracts almost 224 million unique visitors per month.Source: Internet RETAILERSA major chunk of visitors are from the U.S. and that is why I have kept my focus mainly on eBay's current and expected performance in the U.S.Source: Site InfoAccording to a survey 63% of smartphone owners utilize e-commerce sites because of on-the-go convenience. Available special offers and coupons fetch 52% of customers. Comparability of prices across the brands and stores makes 48% of smartphone owners liable to purchase items through e-commerce while 41% buy if they are in store and the store is out of stockSource: Internet RETAILERSEBay has been able to exhibit splendid profitability in the last twelve months. The company displayed 68.99% gross margin compared to the industry margin of 53.67%. With regards to the operating margin eBay was slightly below the industry score by recording 20.78% for last twelve months compared to the industry margin of 22.5%. However, eBay has maintained a higher net profit margin of 17.77% that is above the industry's net profit margin of 15.82% for the trailing twelve months.Source: ReutersSustained profitability is proof of eBay's efficacious business planning, prolific implementation of resources and inexhaustible utilization of every available opportunity. Over the last five years eBay has outperformed the industry with a gross margin of 71.33% and net profit margin of 22.64% compared to the industry's average gross margin of 58.96% and net profit margin of 17.82%. These figures showcase the aptitude, understanding and commitment of the company's management to conduct business in such a competitive industry.Source: ReutersGoing forward, the recent acquisition of Braintree and its integration with PayPal will support customers as well as the growth of eBay. Braintree along with its mobile application Venmo will accelerate PayPal's strong presence in mobile payments while Braintree will receive a boost through PayPal's global scale and resources. EBay is now able to provide its customers Venmo that enables them to pay each other using mobile devices.0020Many next-generation innovators like OpenTable, HotelTonight, Uber and Airbnb have picked Braintree as a payment platform of choice. In short, the industry is clearly revealing that considering past performance, recent acquisition, current foothold and propensity to exploit future potentials eBay has gained a stronger position in the industry and is well prepared to utilize the growth opportunities especially in mobile purchases.ValuationIncorporating past performance and interpreting future potential I have used the multiple based valuation approach to estimate the fair value of EBAY.

That may still be a conservative estimate when one compares National Retail Federation’s projections of online holiday sales to grow to $82 billion. In reality, on Black Friday, according to an IBM research, web sales grew 21% over the year as retailers like Amazon and eBay both “siphoned consumers from brick-and-mortar stores”. But surprisingly, eBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) recent quarter’s bigger news was driven by their payment segment business, PayPal.eBay’s FinancialseBay’s fourth quarter revenues grew 13% over the year to $4.53 billion, marginally short of the Street’s expectations of $4.55 billion. EPS of $0.81 was, however, ahead of the Street’s projections of $0.80.By segment, Marketplaces revenues grew 12% to $2.3 billion with gross merchandise volume growing 13% to 21.52 billion. PayPal’s revenues grew 19% to $1.8 billion and revenues from the enterprise segment fell 2% to $0.39 billion.Mobile was a big contributor of growth. During the year, 40% of new eBay users used mobile apps. Total mobile commerce volume grew 88% and they added over 14 million customers on mobile devices. They ended the year with revenues growing 14% to $16.05 billion with an EPS of $2.71.eBay expects revenues for the current quarter to be $4.15 billion-$4.25 billion with EPS of $0.65-$0.67. The market was looking for revenues of $4.3 billion and EPS of $0.72 for the quarter. eBay projected 2014 revenues at $18.0 billion-$18.5 billion with EPS of $2.95-$3.00, again falling short of the market’s projected earnings of $3.12 per share. The Street was looking for revenues of $18.5 billion for the year.For the year 2015, eBay projected revenues of $20.5 billion-$21.5 billion, with EPS growing over 10%. The Street was projecting revenues of $21.2 billion.Will eBay Spin off PayPal?More significantly, the market was abuzz with talks about activist investor Mr. Carl Icahn’s proposal to split eBay into two with Marketplace and PayPal becoming independent entities. Mr. Icahn owns 0.82% stake in eBay and made the non-binding proposal to help the company deliver faster growth.eBay has refused the offer because of the fact that PayPal is the main driver of growth for eBay. Not only does PayPal see stronger revenue growth, but also continues to attract a bigger customer base. Recently, eBay strengthened PayPal’s offering by adding features such as Here, which is PayPal’s version of a mobile card reader. But PayPal’s growth is also dependent on Marketplace. During the last quarter, nearly a third of PayPal’s new accounts and half of their new mobile accounts came from Marketplace’s user base. Additionally, Marketplace helps fund growth for PayPal. eBay CEO John Donahoe, apparently, gave Icahn a ‘tutorial’ on how eBay’s business works, and why spinning off PayPal is a bad idea.Meanwhile, eCommerce in China is booming, and Latin American eCommerce leader MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) continues to deliver strong growth. eBay’s international strategy needs revisiting. Why isn’t John Donahue making more decisive moves into those markets?During last year, eBay’s international revenues grew 14% over the year, in line with the revenue growth in the U.S. The growth was benefited by the improved market conditions in Europe and their tie up with Argos in the U.K. Now, U.K. shoppers can collect their online purchases from a local Argos store in the U.K. Within the emerging markets, eBay’s biggest growth seems to be in India where they invested $50 million in local online retailer, Snapdeal. Within Latin America, they are driving growth through mobile initiatives and PayPal. PayPal has a domestic payment capability in Brazil for PayPal. Last year, they also launched a mobile app in Brazil that lets Brazilian consumers shop eBay’s global inventory.eBay’s stock is trading at $54.94 with a market capitalization of $71.13 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $58.04 in April last year. As you see, the chart explains why Icahn and other shareholders are getting antsy about the growth rate of the company. The stock has been relatively flat for a year."

However, Intelligent Investors following Benjamin Graham's methods must take the time to analyze the fundamentals of the company utilizing the various requirements and metrics Graham proposed. It is through this sort of analysis that investors are able to determine whether a given company presents opportunity for profit while requiring a low level of risk.

EBAY data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 3/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - 9/30/2013Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamConclusion:eBay appears to be a very solid company that should intrigue value investors that classify themselves as Enterprising Investors. The company does not qualify for the Defensive Investor due to the current ratio not quite reaching the 2.0 requirement, the lack of dividend payments, and the high PEmg and PB ratios. The Enterprising Investor is much more interested, as the company only fails the dividend requirement. This investor type should feel very comfortable proceeding with further research to determine whether the company would be a good fit for their individual portfolios. Such research should include a comparison against some of eBay's competitors, perhaps starting with a review of ModernGraham's valuation of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and ModernGraham's valuation of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).From a valuation perspective, eBay has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $0.82 in 2008 to $2.07 in 2013. This is a very strong level of growth that definitely supports the market's implied estimate of 8.38% growth and the market price falls within the ModernGraham valuation model's margin of safety. As a result, the company appears to be fairly valued at the current time.The next part of the analysis is up to individual investors, and requires discussion of the company's prospects.

1960921,53552,2014-01-22T18:37:50-05:00,,"eBay (eBay) had a busy night on Wednesday as the company reported quarterly results and disclosed that Carl Icahn has a stake in the firm and has made requests for change (press release available here). Shares have been range bound over the past twelve months (see the chart below), and Icahn clearly sees an opportunity to get the stock out of its current rut. As a consequence, shares have spiked over 7% after hours on this news. In this article, I will first go over eBay's results and then Mr. Icahn's suggestions before coming to a conclusion about the company's fair value.First in the quarter, eBay reported EPS of $0.81 on revenue of $4.53 billion. While earnings beat by a penny, revenue missed by $30 million, though it did still grow 13.5% year over year. Earnings growth was 16% thanks to higher revenue and transaction volume. eBay operates two main businesses: its online marketplace and PayPal. While the marketplace is a major part of the business, PayPal is seen as the driver of long-term growth as consumers continue to move towards electronic payment systems. Importantly, the company is performing well in mobile as PayPal is built to be used on phones with volume up 88%. Over 22% of wBay's combined marketplace and PayPal volume is done with mobile devices.PayPal grew revenue by 19% both in the quarter and all of 2013 with total revenue of $6.6 billion, and the service now boasts 143 million active accounts and 3 billion annual transactions. Marketplace growth was slower but still strong at 12% both annually and in the quarter for an annual total of $8.3 billion. While eBay's marketplace has faced stiff competition from the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), there is no reason to be gloomy about its performance with double digit growth. Put simply, Marketplace continues to grow, albeit slower than other e-commerce sites, while PayPal performs more strongly thanks to a secular shift towards electronic payments as more business is done over the internet.This quarter was even stronger when you realize that eBay actually had a higher effective tax rate this quarter (20%) versus last year's quarter (18%). This EPS beat was driven by stronger volume rather than accounting maneuvers. eBay also continues to be a cash flow machine as it generated $1.7 billion in operating cash flow, and impressively, free cash flow was $1.4 billion. For all of 2013, free cash flow totaled $3.7 billion.Thanks to strong cash flow, eBay carries $12.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which accounts for 17% of its market capitalization. Thanks to this free cash flow and strong balance sheet, the company has increased its share buyback authorization by $5 billion. Combined with the $640 million outstanding on the previous authorization, eBay can now buyback $5.6 billion worth of stock or over 7.5% of the float. eBay should generate over $4 billion in free cash flow in 2014, so this buyback will eat about $1-1.5 billion of the company's excessive cash hoard.Management is looking for a strong 2014 with non-GAAP earnings of $2.95-$3.00 on $18-$18.5 billion in revenue, which gives shares a forward multiple of 19.5-20x after accounting for the pop on the news release. Now, analysts had been looking for $3.12 on $18.5 billion in 2014, so while eBay's projections for 15% annual growth look strong they do miss the street's expectations. It is important to recognize that shares were range bound in 2013 in large part because management at times gave overzealous expectations that it failed to meet. It follows then that management sets a more conservative bar for 2014 so that it can beat numbers.Moreover with the Icahn news likely to overwhelm talks of lackluster guidance, this quarter was the perfect opportunity to sand-bag a little and make it easier to beat in the coming months. With that said, let's turn to Mr. Icahn who has amassed a 0.82% stake, which is worth roughly $500 million. Icahn has nominated two directors to the board and has offered a non-binding proposal to spin-off PayPal's business. eBay struck a somewhat conciliatory tone at first saying it ""welcomes the opportunity to listen to the perspective of all of its shareholders, including Mr. Icahn. His Board nominations will be passed on to the Boards Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, which will consider them in the ordinary course of business.""However, eBay says it has in the past undertaken strategic reviews of the business and determined that investors are better off with PayPal part of eBay and opposes the idea of a spin-off. Now, Icahn clearly has plenty of dry powder as a $500 million position is relatively small for him, so he could easily try to take a bigger stake to force a spin-off, though he would still need significant support from other shareholders, which remains uncertain.Now, Mr. Icahn's position does make sense as Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA), which are PayPal's major competitors, trade around 25-30x earnings and 10-12x sales. Depending the valuation metric you used, PayPal as a stand-alone entity is worth $55-$75 billion. At the high end, it is worth more than what the entire company is trading at. With the marketplace still growing revenue and profitability, it clearly has positive value, even $25-$30 billion with a rock bottom valuation.As separate entities, eBay and PayPal would be worth 10%-40% more than where shares are currently trading assuming they traded at similar valuations to peers. In other words, it is easy to see why Icahn wants the company to separate. With his small stake, it will be difficult to get traction for his plan, and a spin-off would likely be more than 12 months away. Frankly, I would not bet on it. However, I still would be a buyer of eBay under $60 thanks to its discount to its fair value when you combine the value of each segment. As a combined entity, eBay should still trade to at least $70-$75. With strong performance, Icahn's involvement, and a discount to fair value, eBay makes sense as a long right here.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in eBay, over the next 72 hours.

1957071,24706,2014-01-21T10:45:01-05:00,,"By Craig BowlesOvervieweBay, Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is slated to report 4Q2013 earnings after the bell on Wednesday, January 22. The earnings release is expected at approximately 4:15 p.m. EST with a conference call to follow at 5:00 p.m. that is webcast through investor.ebayinc.com/events.cfm.Outliers & StrategyKey measures:Insiders have unloaded 1.7% of their holdings the last six months but still retain 10% of shares outstanding. Buybacks are helping support share prices since the high with 2Q2013 reported at $355 mln while announcing plans for an additional $2 bln.eBay shares haven't done much since early last year but are still close to 2005's all-time high and showing none of 2005's volatility. The stock now trades at 25.4x trailing earnings and above the 5-year average of 19.5x.eBay's having expanded into more traditional online retail is increasingly compared to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and a price chart comparison of the two companies back to 1999 shows share prices nearing parity, so quarterly results could impact Amazon which is reporting a week after, as well as Google, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Groupon, Inc. (NASDAQ:GRPN) and Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK).eBay shares tend to see close to a 1% move off earnings, so the 1-day average price change on earnings is -0.17% is a little deceiving. Also, the index futures are more apt to be impacted by surprising results from eBay given its stature and influence in the marketplace.Recent NewsTechnical RevieweBay shares couldn't push through $57.50 early last year and have come off a bit since while maintaining support around $50.00. Shares are currently trading close to the $53.75 mid-point of these support and resistance areas and are still close to double the 2011 lows ahead of Wednesday's earnings release. eBay shares have at times acted counter-cyclical, so aren't ideal for swing traders playing a risk-off market move into a 4-month cycle low. So far, eBay has been relatively untouched by consumer spending worries of the retail sector. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and MACD have neutral short-term readings and the weekly MACD having fully corrected makes a move above $55 enticing for the bulls. Should earnings fail to meet the high end of Street estimates, this slow grind lower could change to some actual deterioration. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryeBay shares haven't done much since early last year but are still close to 2005's all-time high and showing none of 2005's volatility. One particular worry about the lack of share price movement is insider selling is being supported by the company's stock buybacks, a phenomenon that was popular in the late 1990s and mid-2000s. Given the recent price stall, the Street will focus on the outlook for 2014. Expectations have been slightly reduced for this quarter, so the 2014 forecast could weigh heavily, both on eBay shares, as well as the broader market indicators. Guidance that is in line with estimates would support the 17 forward P/E for 2014 which is relatively cheap for a company growing at 15.4% when the S&P has a forward PE of 15.8 and growing at close to 10%.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

1957371,23625,2014-01-21T12:07:00-05:00,,"With the absolute mess that’s going on in the brick and mortar retail world right now, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is an intriguing company. The gradual change from physical stores to online shopping has been an obvious trend, but this holiday season it was particularly pronounced. Holiday sales were down and physical retail stores struggled. In the past week alone GameStop (NYSE:GME) and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) watched their stock prices plunge by 15 and 30 percent respectively.Amazon.com and other e-commerce companies are the obvious winners. UPS (NYSE:UPS) had to hire an extra 30,000 workers to deal with the unexpected increase in last minute holiday demand, a drastic measure that will take a chunk out of their quarterly profit numbers. eBay may be positioned to take advantage of the big shift this year, but it’s difficult to compare them to Amazon as eBay’s role as an online auction house is fundamentally different than the core of Amazon’s business.In addition to seeing large growth in other online retailers such as Amazon, eBay’s well known subsidiary PayPal is also under stiff competition. In 2013, we saw the rise of several other alternative payment methods including Square, Stripe, and possibly even Bitcoin.Here’s how buy-side and independent analysts expect eBay to report earnings and how we can expect the stock price to react. The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for eBay to report 80c EPS and $4.556B revenue while our current consensus from 47 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 82c EPS and $4.561B revenue. This quarter our community is expecting eBay to beat the Wall Street expectations by a small margin.The magnitude of the difference between Wall Street's and our consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case, we are seeing a 2c EPS differential between the groups, which is average compared to past quarters.eBay has met or exceeded the Wall Street profit consensus in each of the past 6 quarters. This quarter our aggregate estimate is forecasting that the company will do it again.By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non-professional investors we have created a data set that is up to 69.5% more accurate than Wall Street, but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market’s actual expectations. It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from us than from the Wall Street consensus.One of the big questions hanging over eBay this quarter is whether they were able to cash in on brick and mortar retailers’ weakness or if Amazon ate the whole cake. The distribution of estimates published by our analysts range from 76c to 87c EPS and $4.471B to $4.650B in revenues. This quarter we’re seeing a large distribution of estimates compared to previous quarters.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. In this case the large range of estimates is signaling that analysts disagree about how well eBay will perform this quarter. Disagreement between analysts may mean that the expected earnings cannot be accurately priced into the stock before the report, so we could see a lot of volatility in the stock price after the earnings release.Throughout December into mid January we saw our EPS consensus increase from 80c to 82c, while Wall Street briefly entertained the idea of 81c only to return to 80c at the end of the quarter. Wall Street revenue expectations have dropped from $4.636B to $4.556B while our consensus has pushed higher from $4.532B to $4.562B.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is OptionsHawk who projects 82c and $4.535B in revenue. In the Winter 2014 season, OptionsHawk is currently ranked as the 76th best analyst and is ranked 12th overall among over 3,400 contributing analysts. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research, which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case the highest rated analyst is expecting eBay to beat the Street in profit and report in-line with us. While OptionsHawk expects eBay to beat the Street on profit, he thinks the online auction site will come up significantly short on revenues."
1901571,51322,2013-12-16T18:15:26-05:00,,"I have recently been spending a lot of time on eBay (EBAY) and PayPal, both buying and selling $1000's worth of merchandise.I have experienced the ""negative"" side of eBay, making me rethink my ties to the service. I believe that my experiences are one of the many reasons why 1000's of eBay sellers have left in the previous years, hence slowing eBay's potential market value.Once more, many sellers are unhappy with the service and some if its ridiculous rules and actions, such as blocking 15,000 eBay sellers from selling on eBay, holding funds from sellers, and hiding listings.I believe that eBay is catering to the buyers, believing that when the buyers are there the sellers will come soon after. While this might be true, ignoring a party in the transaction can turn the deal upside down, jeopardizing both parties' association with eBay.While I believe that eBay has some negative aspects, there are also many positive factors. In this article I will compare eBay and PayPal to their competitors, and their potential value in the near future comparatively.MobileeBay's potential can be mainly tagged to its mobile aspect, allowing members to both buy and sell from a wide array of devices. Currently 21% of members use multiple devices, accounting for 44% of eBay's transactions in 2012 and the mobile app has been downloaded more than 200M times.Nearly 6M listings are added a week through eBay mobile (there have been 405M listings posted in eBay mobile's history), leading eBay to believe that their mobile commerce volume (NYSE:MCV) will increase over 50% from 2012 to 2013, amounting to $20B this year.Mobile is useful for sellers in categories where items cannot be scanned and need specific photographs, like car parts, which sold 831,000 mobile items a week in Q3 2013.Once more, eBay is expanding to even more devices, including the newly released Samsung smart watch, designing a special app for the device.eBay MarketplaceeBay is one of the largest online marketplaces, which reported 124M active users in Q3 2013. One of the major advantages eBay has is its international presence. In Q3 2013, $11B of merchandise was sold across borders, representing 22% of its Enabled Commerce Volume (ECV).One problem I noticed while reading over the presentation, is that ECV increased 21% to $52B, while revenue increased only 12% to $2B. This leads to concern that while the marketplace may continue to grow, eBay's profit might not.PayPalPayPal is perhaps the leader in online ecommerce transactions, representing 137.4M active users and $43.8B (up 25%) in payment volume in Q3 2013 (and 42% of eBay Inc's revenue). PayPal supports more than 25 currencies in more than 190 markets (International sales represent more than half of PayPal's revenue), but also has localized special websites to 80 different markets.Paypal completed more than 700M transactions in Q3 2013, while losing only .3% of their members in the quarter (396,000) and adding nearly 5M new ones.eBay EnterpriseeBay Enterprise runs online shopping sites for brick and mortar stores, with more than $785M in merchandise sales in Q3 2013.ValuationI believe that there are several ways to value eBay Inc: either based on users or segment.eBay Inc. broken down by segment:(Includes marketing services and other revenue)Broken down by division, eBay has a Q3 2013 earnings of $1.1B. To annualize this number, we can multiply by 4.1 (as analysts believe Q3 represents 24% of yearly revenue). This gives us a 2013 earnings of $4.4B. While the growth and P/E change, I believe it is safe to assume that eBay will continue to trade above market averages.If we say that eBay is a technology stock, we can assume a forward P/E of 12, valuing eBay at $52.8B. This is more than 20% less than eBay's current market value of $66.74B.eBay Inc. broken down by users:*Includes all users, including prime membersTaking into account that Alibaba (owned by Yahoo! (YHOO)) is both a marketplace and an e-commerce processor, it could be considered closest to eBay inc. We don't have exact numbers yet, but it is safe to assume that they have 250M combined users. For eBay, the e-commerce and marketplace is mostly together, leaving me to wonder how dependent PayPal is on eBay's marketplace (i.e. If eBay members leave, they will no longer use PayPal either).We can use BrainTree, which eBay recently bought out for $800M, as an example for PayPal's 137.4M active users. Valuing each customer at $23, PayPal could be valued at $3.16B. The true value of eBay Inc. would come from eBay's marketplace.If we value each eBay user as compared to its American competitor, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), we would be valuing each of eBay's 124M users at $284.50. This would give eBay Marketplace a value of $35.2B. When we include current assets, investments, and property & equipment, while subtracting liabilities we get an extra $13B in value (being generous as other ecommerce sites may not have the same assets).Both of my methods of valuing eBay Inc. yielded similar results: I believe that eBay is over valued by more than 20%.When you take into account that more and more competitors are arising, it will be hard for eBay to continue to hold onto a large marketshare of customers. Not only are they competing with Amazon and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), but also with specialized online marketplaces.While eBay still has some cool features and useful tools, it is hard to compete with companies such as Google Wallet (NASDAQ:GOOG) which does not even charge merchants.All in all, I believe that while eBay can achieve its current evaluation if it continues to grow extensively, it is limited by several factors:-If they raise fees, many sellers will leave which we have already seen happen.-If they try and expand to different markets, they will be competing against already established marketplaces.In my opinion, it is not worth overpaying for eBay's potential growth. Valuing each eBay member at $285, means that each member needs to sell roughly $2850 worth of merchandise (not including eBay's costs, or lower fees for eBay store owners [who sell most of the goods on eBay]). While this might seem like a realistic number, we have to remember that the average eBay member is a buyer, not a seller. I believe that while eBay can increase revenue and profit, it will not be enough to support the current evaluation. I recommend not to Buy-It-Now.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1902991,57941,2013-12-17T11:47:40-05:00,,"The purpose of this article is to discuss why eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) appears as a good investment option right now. To do so, I will review the company's past performance and fundamentals, and analyze how they fit within the industry to determine where the stock might be headed from here.First, a little about the company. eBay is a global technology company that enables commerce through three main segments: Marketplaces (52% of total revenue), Payments (40% of total revenue), and Enterprise (8% of total revenue). The company provides online platforms, tools and services to help individuals and merchants around the globe engage in online commerce and payment transactions. eBay also generates revenue through marketing services, classifieds, and advertising.Let's start the analysis by examining eBay's performance over the past three years.eBay: Three-Year GraphSource: Google Finance.As can be seen in the graph, eBay had a remarkable year in 2012 (71.2% gain). However, the stock has had a rather disappointing 2013 (1.7% loss YTD). The following table helps visualize some of the drivers behind EBAY's performance.eBay: Three-Year EPS and RevenueSource: Nasdaq.com.In 2012, eBay experienced a 61% increase in earnings over the previous year (Q4 excluded due to extraordinary event, Skype sale). This was the main driver for the 71.2% price gain in 2012. From an earnings per share (EPS) perspective, one can say that the stock got 10% ahead of itself during 2012.For 2013, the story is different. Assuming that Q4 earnings will come close to the Nasdaq consensus EPS of $0.71, eBay would have gained 12.5% in earnings for 2013 over the previous year. Also, keep in mind that eBay is about 2% down YTD. The previous analysis leads me to the following conclusion: eBay got 10% ahead of itself during 2012, and it will recover about 12.5% by the end of 2013. This correction leaves eBay undervalued by 2.5%. Finally, when taking into account the 2% that the stock has lost throughout 2013, eBay appears to be approximately 4.5% undervalued.Last quarter, eBay reported an increase in revenue of 14%. Also, PayPal and eBay Marketplace saw double-digit growth in new users. Furthermore, eBay continues to lead in mobile, one of the fastest growing segments in the industry. These results lead me to believe that the growth outlook for eBay is positive. Moreover, technology continues to change how consumers shop and online shopping keeps gaining traction as a result. I believe eBay has the scale and experience, and the platforms and technology, to continue to grow at a good pace.Based on the previous results and growth prospects, I will discuss why eBay appears to be undervalued based on its price/earnings ratio (P/E ratio). eBay's current P/E ratio is 24.55. In general, a high P/E suggests that investors are expecting higher earnings growth in the future compared to companies with a lower P/E. However, the P/E ratio is not a meaningful measure on its own. It is usually more useful to compare a P/E ratio against companies in the same industry and the industry itself. The following graph highlights the P/E ratios of well-known technology companies as well as an industry average.Source: Nasdaq.com.As the graph highlights, eBay's P/E ratio is below the industry average and far below from Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN), one of its top competitors. So, has AMZN grown faster than eBay? Yes. Does it have higher growth prospects? Perhaps. But is AMZN really going to grow 55 times faster than eBay? I don't think so. In my opinion, the spread is caused because AMZN is overvalued and eBay is undervalued. Thus, this is another reason why I recommend a long position on eBay at its current price.Finally, it is important to keep in mind that the first part of this analysis could be undermined if eBay failed to meet earnings estimates for Q4 2013. However, I believe such a scenario is unlikely. The latest retail sales report offered good news for eBay in more than one way. First, it showed that the economy is gaining momentum, as highlighted by the overall sales growth. Second, it indicated that online sales continue to grow steadily. Finally, it also pointed out that the American consumer remains frugal, but overall is more comfortable with spending.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in EBAY over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1902761,57561,2013-12-17T11:00:05-05:00,,"eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) ""eBay Now"" service allows customers to order from local retail chain stores through its website eBay.com, and the product is delivered within an hour. Currently, this services is available in Chicago, New York, Dallas, and the San Francisco Peninsula region. eBay plans to expand this service to 25 other regions by the end of 2014. Shutl, which eBay acquired recently, will support its product delivery. Shutl has the expertise to deliver the products with its strong distribution network, which is leading towards quick delivery of products. Additionally, eBay is offering free shipping through Christmas evening, for which customer usually pay $5 for the delivery to their doorsteps. Free shipping will attract more customers to its website. This strategic expansion and free shipping will boost its revenue from the marketplace segment, which, is already witnessing a robust revenue growth rate, wherein its revenue grew 12% year over year in the third quarter.Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), is also adopting various strategies to engage more customers on its website. Currently, Amazon is working on a program known as ""Amazon Prime Air,"" which will deliver products that weigh up to 5 pounds with the help of drones. The company aims to make drone-based deliveries after 2015, delivering products to customers within 30 minutes of their order. The drones will carry the product within a 10 miles radius from the Amazon distribution center, which will limit the availability of this service. Currently, drone based delivery is a company vision and is in the development phase. The execution of this technology is expected by the end of 2015. Hence, in the short run eBay doesn't face any competition from the Amazon Prime Air service.PayPal - Main mobile softwareThe payment system is undergoing a transition from cash and credit cards to mobile payments. Globally, mobile payments are expected to climb 44% to $235 billion this year and are expected to reach $721 billion by the end of 2017. To capitalize on this trend, eBay aims to make its payment system, PayPal, the main platform for mobile transactions. For this, eBay has been adopting various strategies to prompt customers to pay from mobile using the PayPal system. The company launched a device known as beacon and acquired Braintree, which is expected to act as a tailwind for the company's payment system going forward. I think all efforts to encourage more customers towards mobile payment will fulfill its 2013 guidance of generating $20 billion in mobile commerce volume.Looking at the mobile payment future growth potential, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also developed a technology known as iBeacon, which is available in its software update iOS 7. This new feature will allow Apple users to make payments through their smartphones. Both iBeacon and beacon use bluetooth technology to transfer the payment, but I feel eBay's Beacon device has a competitive advantage over Apple iBeacon on the grounds of user base. PayPal Beacon is available on Apple iOS software as well as for Android users, whereas Apple iBeacon caters to the needs of Apple users only.ConclusionVarious strategies adopted by eBay to enhance its Marketplace and PayPal segment are expected to contribute towards its long term revenue guidance. The company aims to generate revenue in the range of $21.5 billion to $23.5 billion for the year 2015. In the trailing twelve months, its revenue has grown 14.90% to $15.51 billion. I believe the company's fundamentals are on track to achieve its long term revenue target.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1920491,57252,2013-12-30T06:09:55-05:00,,"Few companies I follow closely are executing as well as eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). The company has established one of the world's most successful online marketplaces while concurrently building an elite online payment platform in PayPal. Let's take a look at a few catalysts that could lie ahead for eBay in 2014.Catalyst #1 - Additional Payment ConsolidationOne of the largest risks to PayPal's business model over the past few years has been margin compression. eBay was the largest driver of PayPal's business (it still is), and it allowed PayPal to charge a high take-rate (percentage of transaction value) relative to competitors like Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA). As PayPal has reduced eBay to 30% of payment volumes, take-rates have fallen to 3.7%. Although there may be some more room to fall, the nature of payment systems leads me to believe the industry is ripe for consolidation.eBay recently completed its purchase of Braintree for $800 million. Braintree counts many web 2.0 clients like Uber, Air BnB, and OpenTable as clients. Competitor Square, which charges 2.75% on transactions, plans on doing a round of financing at a $5 billion valuation. Even though eBay just spent $800 million on Braintree, eBay's robust balance sheet, which will probably have somewhere around $10 billion in cash and equivalents sitting on it, gives the company to make the acquisition if it so desires. eBay could also take on more debt if necessary.A Square purchase gives PayPal access to a large network of small businesses in the bricks and mortar space-an area where PayPal is clearly lacking. Strategically, I cannot fathom a better buyer than PayPal, as it could then integrate its PayPal and Square customers onto one great platform.With Visa and MasterCard still dominating the industry payment, I believe eBay can (and will) become a driving force towards online payments consolidation. Realistically, PayPal greatly lags the Visa and MasterCard duo, so to become a reasonable competitor, I think US regulators would allow, if not encourage PayPal to purchase its competitors. Scale and network growth would be dually beneficial, as PayPal would have more customers paying with a lower cost structure.Catalyst #2 - eBay DominanceThe eBay Marketplace remains a dominant force on the net with $18.4 billion worth of goods sold on it during the third quarter, an increase of 13% versus the prior year. The network also added 4 million users during its last quarter, and its active user figure now stands at 123.6 million users. If eBay is able to grow its active users at a low-double digit pace next year, the network will have north of 135 million users.More telling, even Amazon's own user forums suggest that eBay might be the superior platform for sellers. Earlier this year eBay simplified its cost structure and its active user growth could lure over even more top-notch sellers. I have spoken with a few power sellers myself, and most seem to prefer eBay. One of the factors, in my view, is the gambling, entrepreneurial nature of eBay. Buyers love the idea of getting a deal, and sellers love the idea of upside. Are prices any higher than fair market prices? Probably not. But eBay taps into the gambling, entrepreneurial spirit of capitalists in America and abroad.Downside RisksNot even eBay is immune from global economic pressures. GDP growth in the US looked great in the third quarter. Oddly, this could pressure eBay's popularity. With employment on the rise, less people may look to eBay as a place for deals and a place to generate income.Further, any acquisition could turn out to be a disaster. Though I haven't seen Square's financials, my natural inclination is that the company would have to be acquired at a hefty premium that pressures earnings. eBay also runs the risk that a new startup competitor comes out with another new system that takes market share and disrupts the industry. Unfortunately, this is simply the risk of investing in any industry dependent on technology, whether it is horse carriages (made obsolete by the automobile) or PCs.Operationally, I do not see too many risks. PayPal and eBay are both riding strong secular tailwinds and have fantastic brand power behind them. Company-specific risk looks low, in my view.2014 Price TargetNet income highly underappreciates eBay's earnings power, so on a multiple basis, it might be fair to conclude that eBay isn't all that interesting. Shares currently trade at 20x the 2013 earnings estimate of $2.70 per share and 18x 2014 earnings of $3.14 per share.However, the company has already generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow compared to $2.6 billion in all of 2012. I think the company will generate in excess of $3.2 billion in 2013, with the potential for free cash flow in excess of $4 billion in 2014, giving eBay a forward free cash flow yield around 5.5-6%. For comparison, Visa trades at a free cash flow yield of 3.6%, and MasterCard trades at a free cash flow yield of 2.8%. These two payment providers also have considerable more legal and regulatory risk.Assuming eBay can get to a free cash flow yield of 4%, the company would have a market value of roughly $100 billion. This leads me to a price target of $77.50, with upside catalysts from market share wins and PayPal acquisitions. This translates into 40% upside from the current price.Disclosure: I am long V.

1919551,23479,2013-12-29T04:49:10-05:00,,"eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock more or less maintained its level in 2013 as the company carried the momentum throughout the year. The marketplaces business continued its recovery and PayPal gained an impressive number of active accounts worldwide. The international growth kept up with that in the U.S. as eBay expanded cautiously in Europe and some of the emerging markets in Asia. As we look back at 2013, we see eBay positioning itself strongly for 2014, despite some concerns around the slowdown of e-commerce growth in the U.S. Below we highlight eBay's notable achievements during 2013.Our price estimate for eBay stands at $54, implying a slight discount to the market price. PayPal Continued To Gain AccountsWe estimate that PayPal constitutes close to 45% of eBay's value. The service had 137.4 million active accounts globally at the end of Q3 2013, and this figure has grown at an impressive rate of 5 million per quarter in 2013. In addition to this, the number of payments made per PayPal account are increasing, which reflects the global growth in e-commerce. Excluding currency movements, PayPal's revenues grew between 18%-20% for each of the quarters in 2013. This can be attributed to strong growth in the total payment volume, partially offset by a decline in the average payment size which has been coming down in recent years. In addition to this, the business also found some support from an increase in its penetration rate on eBay.Mobile is going to be one of the key growth areas for PayPal, and the company is promoting mobile transactions as an alternative to payment by cards through its mobile app. The service works through the PayPal app that customers can use to check-in to the store. PayPal has partnered with point of sale technology companies such as MICROS, Island Pacific, Kounta and Vend and will soon add more retailers and hospitality partners into the mix. eBay expects PayPal to do $20 billion of mobile commerce and payments volume in 2013.International Growth Remained StrongeBay's international growth remained strong in 2013 as the company benefited from some economic tailwinds due to the eurozone and the U.K. that are slowly coming out of the recession, as well as from its continued investments in emerging markets. It signed a deal with Argos, a store chain in the U.K., to allow local shoppers to pick up their online purchases from eBay at ﻿﻿local Argo stores. It also invested $50 million in Indian e-commerce site Snapdeal. We believe that eBay will continue to focus on expanding its international presence and lay greater emphasis on PayPal's growth in emerging markets. The company's revenues from international markets grew by more than 14% in first nine months of 2013, keeping up with the growth in the U.S.Statistics from prior years show a similar trend for eBay. eBay's international revenues jumped from $4.6 billion in 2008 to nearly $7.3 billion in 2012, registering a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% (source: SEC Filings). Most of this growth came in the last two years, when the figure stood at 21.5%. While Germany saw a slowdown in the growth in 2012, other markets including the United Kingdom and the rest of the world continued to grow at 20%+ rate. Germany and the United Kingdom together accounted for over 48% of eBay's international revenues in 2012, and close to 25% of its global revenues. Clearly, these two markets are very important for the company.eBay Expressed Renewed Interest In ChinaeBay pulled out of China in 2006 due to tough local competition, but recently expressed that it has not given up on the market. The company mentioned that there is a huge accumulation of wealth in the country and Chinese consumers are going to be an important part of the global economy in the future. Therefore, it is imperative for eBay, or any other online retailer, to establish a presence in the regional market.eBay can add 10% to its value if it is able to increase its gross merchandise volume by another $50 billion over our current expectations. We currently forecast this figure for eBay to increase from $75 billion in 2012 to $130 billion over the next six to seven years. This may be achievable given the strong e-commerce growth in China, provided that the company is able to compete effectively against local online retailers. This incremental gross merchandise volume will imply another 70 million active users over our current forecast assuming that the average spend per user will not be meaningfully different. In reality, the figure is likely to be lower for Chinese consumers which indicates that eBay will need many more users in the country. It must be noted that the 10% upside estimate is just from the marketplaces business. The actual upside could be much more as eBay will also promote PayPal, which is an equally important business segment for the company.Disclosure: No positions"
1915911,56962,2013-12-25T06:53:36-05:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has acquired the payment startup company Braintree from its PayPal subsidiary which will give PayPal a strong foothold in the world of mobile app payments. This $800 million acquisition will also evolve PayPal from its roots as an online payments provider and expand its offline, mobile and online offerings to stores, restaurants and other business.Chicago-based Braintree provides web and mobile payment processing for popular startup companies such as restaurant reservations site OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN), vacation rentals site Airbnb, cab hailing app Uber and online retailer Fab. With Braintree, a customer of Uber or Fab can make repeated purchases on a mobile app with one click without having to keep entering their payment information or re-authorizing the payment through PayPal. Braintree charges businesses a fee of 2.9% plus $0.30 cents per transaction.Braintree has become a one-stop-shop for all the services a business needs to receive payments from anywhere in the world. It processes more than $10 billion in payments annually, including $2 billion from payments made on mobile devices. The company said that 25% of its payment volume comes from outside of the U.S. It also expects to process about $12 billion in payments this year, approximately one-third of which is expected to be made from mobile platforms.In addition, Braintree operates Venmo, a mobile payment solution that the company acquired last year for $26.2 million. Venmo allows people to pay and send money to each other for free. Some analysts said that this feature was a key part of what attracted PayPal to the company.eBay CEO John Donahoe is very confident regarding this acquisition. He believed that this acquisition would help accelerate PayPal's global leadership in mobile payments. Currently, Braintree's Venmo powers mobile payments for 40 million people across a number of mobile apps. Braintree also has a broad international reach with merchants in 40 countries accepting payments in 130 different currencies.Industry GrowthAdvancement in technology as well as speedy and highly protected transactions increase the demand for these kind of services. The attraction of an anytime or anywhere shopping experience via smartphones and tablets exerts a great force on a global scale. According to the newly published Internet Retailer 2014 Mobile 500, by the end of 2013 mobile commerce in the U.S. is projected to grow 63% to around $34.2 billion from $21 billion in 2012. Mobile purchases will account for nearly 13% of all U.S. e-commerce sales up from just over 9% in 2012.Mobile commerce companies also showed a tremendous growth internationally. According to Mobile 500, 107 European merchants will grow their combined mobile sales by 103% to 4.44 billion in 2013. And 19 Asian merchants will grow 84.8% to about $527.5 million.Similarly, according to the Gartner research firm, worldwide mobile payment transaction values will reach $235.4 billion in 2013, reflecting an increase of 44% from $163.1 billion in 2012. The number of mobile payment users worldwide will reach 245.2 million in 2013 up from 200.8 million in 2012. Money transfers and merchandise purchases will account for about 71% and 21% of total transaction values in 2013, respectively, and it is expected that merchandise purchases will account for about 23% of the total value forecast for 2017.From a regional perspective, Asia-Pacific's transaction value is expected to grow 38% in 2013 to reach $74 billion. Deployments in developed markets including South Korea and Singapore and in developing markets such as India are expected to drive healthy growth. As a result, in 2016, Asia-Pacific will overtake Africa to become the largest region by transaction value reaching $165 billion. Africa's transaction value is forecasted to reach $160 billion in 2016. While Africa will still experience strong growth through the forecasted period, companies are still searching for the most suitable business model for mobile money in their local markets. Therefore, the growth opportunity for the company is huge in these markets.Sensitivity AnalysisAs I mentioned earlier Braintree is generating its revenues from two sources: ((i)) a fixed rate charge (2.9% on transaction) and (ii) a 30 cent charge per transaction. So, in order to better understand how much it contributes to PayPal's revenue, I performed a sensitivity analysis of Braintree based on certain assumptions.For base calculation, pointed out in the above graph, I assumed an average transaction value of $100 per transaction based on the clients of the company. Using $10 billion in transactions processed with the 2.9% transaction charge the company managed to generate $290 million in revenues from fixed rate transactions and generated $30 million in revenue from 100 million transactions at the rate of $100 per transaction mentioned in the assumption above. Based on my assumptions, the company may have generated $320 million revenues in a year.If you look at the sensitivity analysis, in the best case scenario the company could generate $448 million in revenues with annual payment proceeds of $14 billion (140 million transactions at $100 per transaction). Similarly, in the worst case scenario, the company may generate $192 million in revenues with annual payment proceeds of $6 billion (60 million transactions at $100 per transaction).ConclusionThe acquisition would significantly add to PayPal's mobile-driven transaction volume. PayPal claims it will facilitate about $20 billion in mobile transactions during 2013. Braintree is set to do about $12 billion in total transactions for the year with about $4 billion of that coming from mobile devices.Paypal said in a statement that by adding Braintree to the company's portfolio, the mobile transaction volume for PayPal would increase to 170% year-on-year. The company's digital and mobile transaction volume would increase to $193 billion reflecting an increase of 33% over 2012. Without Braintree the company's volume would only increase to $181 billion or 25% over 2012. Moreover, with the addition of Braintree's transaction volume, PayPal will also get access to Braintree's network of clients and mobile payment software. This transaction will strengthen its foothold in the U.S. market and will help the company to expand internationally. Based on this deal, I strongly recommend buying stocks in the company.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Blackstone Equity Research research analyst.

1925041,53952,2014-01-02T09:06:07-05:00,,"eBay, Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is a commerce company well known for its online marketplace that provides both fixed price and auction style transactions, and also for PayPal, its fast-growing payment solutions service. The company reports its performance under three broad segments; Marketplace, Payments and GSI Commerce. Since Q2 2013 GSI has been re-branded as eBay Enterprise and accounted for approximately 5.5% of the company's net transaction revenue at $185 million, as of September 2013. Being a smaller and relatively newer segment it is somewhat less talked about than the other two, but is nonetheless an intriguing aspect of the business. My article today will focus on eBay Enterprise and try to evaluate its potential as a business driver for the company.Business & Recent Performance: eBay Enterprise offers e-commerce, marketing and omnichannel services to major retail brands. It provides a web platform that includes services such as site management, shopping carts, shipping and online marketing, among others. eBay enterprise was born in 1999 as Global Sports Inc., an e- commerce platform for sporting goods that expanded its partnerships to several other retail categories over the years. By the time it was acquired by eBay in 2011 its revenue had grown at a compounded annual growth rate of nearly 65% from $5.5 million in 1999 to $1.4 billion in 2011. Since the acquisition eBay has integrated and re-branded nine companies into eBay Enterprise that add marketing, search, mobile messaging and email among other capabilities to its managed services portfolio.Enterprise segment clients experienced same store year over year sales growth of 13% in Q3 2013, which was slower than the 19% growth rate in the previous quarter. Revenue was up 5%, offset by a lower take rate, client and channel mix and the impact of consolidating and re-branding the various businesses into eBay Enterprise. Margin growth also slowed due to lower rates and business mix. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was higher for the Enterprise segment as compared to the other two reported segments of the company. The company began migration of its business clients to a new suite of Commerce Technologies and continued to leverage PayPal to improve the performance of its Enterprise platform.Competition: The Enterprise segment faces intense competition from other commerce and technology companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The business customers it seeks to gain could opt to develop and use in-house e commerce platforms instead of partnering with the company.Appeal to Potential Clients: Given the availability of alternatives mentioned above, the question is what would prompt brands to become clients? There are certain benefits that eBay Enterprise brings to the table.Integrated Commerce Solutions: eBay Enterprise supports its retail partners in engaging a customer who utilizes various channels such as mobile, desktop, television, brick and mortar, and more, to shop. This is a customer empowered by technology who expects personalized customer service, consistent experience across channels and easy, secure transactions. One of the reasons an Enterprise partnership could be appealing to potential retail clients is because it promises holistic start to finish solutions for maximizing customer engagement. It takes the task of identifying and implementing the various technologies, delivery, distribution, supply chain, packaging, customizing, customer care, marketing and other solutions from its business clients and offers them an integrated ecosystem.Customer analytics is another valuable service that eBay Enterprise can offer its partners. It can utilize data from specific clients and general commerce trends from its marketplace and payments portals to provide actionable insights to businesses. For example, it can help identify trends such as shift to mobile by recording a 127% growth in mobile orders for its partners between Thanksgiving 2012 and 2013, and assist in tailoring their strategy to take advantage of changes in customer behavior.Strategic Alliances: Through its network of partnerships and suite of services the Enterprise segment can provide wide global exposure and economies of scope that may not be accessible to a retailer individually. It owns 3 million square feet in fulfillment centers including locations in the United Kingdom and Canada.It has formed an Alliance Network with key partners to bring together a suite of services that customers can utilize to sell their products and build their brands. For example, it partnered with Ordergroove to provide subscription commerce solutions to its clients like Grainger, Teavana and L'Oreal to name a few. Engaging customers in a subscription service can be instrumental for retailers to attract and retain clients at a lower cost, up-sell and cross-sell products and services and achieve more frequent transactions. It also formed a partnership with Mercent to offer analytics and marketing solutions to its clients.Omnichannel Retail: The enterprise solution can be of value to retailers in providing a seamless experience to its customers across various media. It seeks to assist brands in leveraging their existing assets like brick and mortar stores with the help of technology to maximize sales. For example, setting up tools such as tablets or kiosks in stores with databases of inventory, that sales associates can rapidly scan, and order items for customers from any store in their network.Another useful feature for retail clients can be supply chain solutions that enable items to be easily located and shipped among all of their stores that are connected on an integrated network. One such service is provided by eBay Enterprise through its partnership with VendorNet that allows deliveries to be routed to the optimal point of fulfilment and is used by clients such as Juicy Couture, Toys R Us and National Geographic.Advantage to eBay, Inc.: While currently the enterprise segment contributes a small percentage to total revenue of eBay, Inc., it presents some potential advantages for the parent company.Diversified Client Base: Having a diversified portfolio of customers can be a good hedge against volatility for any company. Within the retail industry eBay Enterprise serves over 1000 brands and retailers from a variety of sub sectors like Apparel, Beauty, Sporting goods, Toys, Consumer Electronics, Entertainment Media , etc. Some of its retail partners are popular brands such as Aeropostale, DKNY, Kate Spade, Babies R Us, Dick's Sporting Goods, NBA, Radio Shack, PBS and Godiva to name a few. Recently in Q3 2013 it added Sony to its list of major Enterprise clients. In 2012 Enterprise partners recorded approximately $4 billion of transactions.Conversion and Cross Sell: In Q3 2013, eBay Enterprise set up a test that provided free two-day shipping to customers who used PayPal when shopping with nine of its retail clients. Its analytics data showed that free shipping was the most popular promotion this holiday season among its Enterprise partners. This is an example of how the company can leverage its various assets to cross sell its different services. Not only is there the opportunity for PayPal to gain from handling transactions for Enterprise clients, there is also the prospect of driving these clients towards opening stores on the eBay marketplace forum.Overall: eBay Enterprise is a business that needs to constantly maintain superior technology, customer support and innovative partnerships for survival and growth. The services it provides are not unique and it faces competition from both service providers as well as in-house marketing and technology departments of retail brands. However, it does have the opportunity to identify gaps in the retail market through data from existing partners and effectively use that information to grow the business for itself and its clients. As long as eBay Enterprise stays on track with quality and innovation it could prove to be a valuable asset for the company.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1923161,55342,2013-12-31T13:05:14-05:00,,"The last year saw contrasting fortunes for leading e-commerce stocks. While Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK) have gained 58% and 107%, respectively, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has barely managed to gain 6%. Amazon had an LTM revenue growth of 22.5%, while Overstock grew at 16.5%. eBay had a similar growth of 15.2%, but the stock price did not see similar gains. We now examine whether eBay stock is being penalized by investors due to slower growth prospects or it is an opportunity to buy at current price levels.eBay's performance so far:eBay's revenues grew at a three year compounded annual growth rate of 18%, with an impressive net income margin of 20% for the same period. eBay reported revenue of $3.9 billion for Q3 2013 with a net profit of $689 million, and an operating cash flow of $1.3 billion.eBay has been maintaining a double digit revenue growth for last three years. Though the growth dipped in 2013, we expect the revenues to increase in the coming years. Expected revenue in 2015 is based on the management's revenue guidance of $21.5 to $23.5 billion. Interpolating these numbers, we are looking at a growth rate of 17%-20% each year. The chart below shows eBay revenue growth from 2010 to 2015 (expected).Source: eBay SEC FilingseBay derives revenues from two key segments: ecommerce (Marketplace) and payments (PayPal) with enterprise and others contributing a very small percentage. The chart below shows the revenue contribution of these segments to eBay's total revenue.Source: eBay SEC FilingsSegmental Analysis:We now take an in-depth look at eBay's two major segments: payments and marketplace.PaymentsPayPal has a dominant presence in payments with 137 million active registered users. eBay's acquisition of PayPal is said to be the most successful acquisition in the industry with the synergies helping both companies to grow faster. In Q3 2013, out of $20.1 billion gross merchandise value (GMV) in the marketplace, $13.1 billion were transacted through PayPal.Paypal currently generates 40% of eBay's revenues. It has been growing at a double digit revenue growth rate, with an annual 3.7% average take rate, which is the commission on the total transaction value.We expect two main revenue drivers for the PayPal segment going forward,1. Mobile: PayPal expects $20 billion in mobile payments volume by the end of 2013. This is expected to be achieved after the integration of its recent acquisition Braintree. PayPal's special focus on mobile, especially with the accelerating growth witnessed in the mobile segment, will be the key strategic growth driver for eBay.2. Users: According to a survey by comScore, PayPal is known to 72% of online shoppers with 48% actually using the digital wallet, way above its competitors - including Google Wallet at 8%. PayPal still has scope to increase its penetration among small retailers to widen its market.These factors will boost the Payments growth to above 20% going forward. However, emerging threats like Amazon's Login and Pay and Google wallet in the payments industry can affect PayPal's growth and profitability in the future.Source: eBay SEC FilingsMarketplace:In ecommerce, eBay is second only to Amazon. Marketplace contributes 53% of eBay's revenues currently. While Amazon has a higher market share and revenue growth, eBay enjoys higher profitability, with Amazon earnings almost non-existent. One important thing to note here is while Amazon reports revenues as the total merchandise sold, eBay reports revenues incorporating only the commissions generated from the merchandise sold. eBay's GMV increased by 10% on a Y/Y basis in Q3 2013, while its revenues went up by 16%. As reported in the Q3 2013 earnings call, the company expects ecommerce volume to reach the level of $300 billion by 2015, up from $175 million in 2012. Given the segment's healthy profitability, its expected growth will help eBay to maintain sustainable profitability.One concern here is the Q4 2013 guidance given by the company. The company expects a sluggish growth in marketplace revenues, leading to total revenues on the lower side of the FY 2013 guidance of $16 to $16.5 billion.Source: eBay SEC FilingsEarnings Surprise HistoryThe positive earnings surprises for three out of last four quarters seem to have gone unnoticed by many investors, with the stock price registering marginal gain in last one year.Source: Street Insider Analysts expectationsValuationeBay is currently trading at a price to earnings ratio of 19.78, based on LTM non-GAAP earnings. The ratio is lower as compared with its peers (Amazon: 1374.6, Overstock: 26.1). The stock price is yet to reflect the growth in revenues. In comparison, Amazon and Overstock stock price have more than compensated for their respective revenue increase, as shown in the table below.Source: eBay SEC FilingsNow we calculate the fair value per share for eBay. The table below shows our estimates of eBay's valuation. We assume that the earnings will grow at 15.5%, a midpoint of 14%-17% guided for 2015. Applying the current PE ratio to the 2015 expected earnings, we get the expected price of $71.1 per share in 2015. Discounting this with 8% (assuming 8% as minimum required return by investors), we get a value per share of $61.01 which is 18.8% above the December 12, 2013, price of $51.37.Keeping in mind eBay's future growth prospects, we believe that eBay is significantly under-priced at current levels. We believe eBay's expected growth potential along with its consistent profitability will derive value for the company and its investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1874991,25120,2013-12-03T16:57:29-05:00,,"Shares of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) saw a post Thanksgiving boost on the back of positive shopping data and an upgrade from analysts at SunTrust.Despite this short term momentum, I remain on the sidelines. The premium valuation of the business, combined with emerging competitive trends for PayPal might put long term pressure on the business.SunTrust Is BullishAnalyst Robert Peck at SunTrust is upgrading eBay from ""Neutral"" to ""Buy"". At the same time, Peck attached a $61 price target to the stock, suggesting some 21% upside from Friday's levels.Peck notes that the upgrade comes after the correction in the stock price. eBay is off 15% from April's highs and down 1% year to date, giving investors a much better risk/reward entry point to his opinion.On the back of this correction, consensus revenue estimates for 2015 are now below the low end of the guidance as laid out by the company on its 2013 analyst day. At the same time data from ChannelAdvisor suggests eBay had a strong holiday season, boosting the prospects for the fourth quarter which comes after a cautious tone on the conference call in the third quarter.2015 revenues are now seen at $21.2 billion at SunTrust, which compares to the guidance of $21.5 to $23.5 billion as provided by eBay. The timing of the upgrade might be a bit awkward as SunTrust still expects eBay to re-adjust its official 2015 revenue guidance downwards. It would be surprising to my opinion to see the stock react favorably to a downwards revision to the guidance.ValuationeBay ended its third quarter with some $13.0 billion in cash, equivalents an non-equity investments. Total debt held by eBay stands at $4.5 billion, resulting in a net cash position of some $8.5 billion.Revenues for the first nine months of 2013 came in at $11.5 billion, which is up by 14.3% compared to the year before. Earnings rose by 7.9% to $2.00 billion.At this pace, and given the outlook for the so-important fourth quarter, eBay is on track to report earnings of around $2.8 billion on revenues of $16 billion.Trading around $52 per share, the market values eBay at $67 billion, or its operating assets around $59 billion. This values operating assets around 3.7 times annual revenues and 21 times annual earnings.Despite the solid financial position, eBay does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveeBay's share price has peaked nearly a decade ago at levels in their high-fifties. Shares fell all the way to levels in the low teens by 2009, but ever since have roughly quadrupled, re-testing all time high levels in the stock.After setting highs of $58 in April of this year, shares have fallen back a bit to levels around $51 per share, resulting in roughly flat year to date returns.Between 2009 and 2012, eBay has seen very decent growth as annual revenues have increased by a cumulative 60% to $14.1 billion. Earnings rose by merely 9% to $2.6 billion over this time frame. Notably revenues are expected to rise further in 2013, while earnings growth will be limited.Investment ThesisInvestors are cheering on the back of the upgrade and promising transaction data for the so important shopping season. Yet investors have more concerns as the stock has failed to benefit from the strong market momentum at all this year. Top line revenue growth is slowing down, while earnings are not keeping pace with revenues.PayPal is the huge driver behind growth with a user base of 137 million worldwide, resulting in third quarter payment volume of $44 billion for the quarter, as average users send or receive some $320 by PayPal a quarter. While the business is very lucrative, with average commissions of around 4% per transaction, It might see increased competition from the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Square, or other emerging payment businesses. To fortify its position in the field, eBay recently announced the $800 million acquisition of Braintree, boosting its mobile payment offerings. According to Techcrunch, PayPal saw growth of mobile payment volumes being up 115% for Thanksgiving compared to 2012.The market place business moves along just fine as well, with 124 million customers, transacting for $18 billion worth's of goods over the past quarter, or nearly $150 per user for the period.Back in October when eBay released its third quarter results, I last took a look at the company's prospects. The company essentially has two large platforms in PayPal and its namesake business, being partially complementary. The huge customer base is crucial in the fight to boost its ""ecosystem"" against other huge platforms like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google, and indirectly Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).Despite these long term attractive prospects, eBay is seeing a deterioration in growth rates. Yet it remains committed to its long term target of $300 billion in Enabled Commerce Volume by 2015.I have to reiterate my stance. I like the long term prospects of the business, yet increased competition for PayPal and a premium valuation make me a bit cautious, despite the very modest momentum this year. Therefore I remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1876711,24348,2013-12-04T10:12:53-05:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), with its steady growth, consistent profit and low capital investment business model, is a prime candidate to institute a quarterly dividend program. As the company continues to pile up cash and increase cash flow from operations, management has given little indication that it has a firm plan to use cash for any major acquisitions. An effort has been made in recent years to return value to shareholders through a share buyback, but with the stock trading near a multi year high, management should be asking itself if that money cannot be better spent. In this article I will make the case that eBay will soon announce a dividend program and I will try to estimate what investors can expect in terms of payout.eBay - Not A Tech LeaderIn the early years of the internet revolution, eBay and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) were often referred to in the same sentence, as leaders in the nascent internet retail sectors. Currently, as the two companies continue to dominate the retail scene, their business strategies are almost completely different. Amazon has become a highly diversified technology company, using the cash flow from its retail operations to fund a host of parallel business lines. Rather than simply focusing on selling consumer goods online, the company has developed a dominant presence in online music downloads space and a top rate internet movie streaming service. Amazon developed the highly successful Kindle ebook reader which has revolutionized the ebook market and in many ways is a player in the fast growing tablet computer field. The company has a massive presence in the cloud computing sector through its Web Services division and there have also been persistent rumors that the company may be working on releasing a smartphone in the near future. Diversifying the business and becoming a leader in multiple internet sectors has been costly. While Amazon's revenue has been increasing at a massive rate, the company is also currently unprofitable. It seems that rather than focusing on short term profit, Amazon is focusing on the long term vision of being a leader in the internet services arena.eBay, has taken a remarkably different approach, both in regards to its business strategy and its financial performance. The company has focused its strategy on expanding its online auction business model to a global level rather than diversifying. The company's early acquisition of PayPal gave it a huge presence in the online payments market, but that line was mainly exploited to enhance the shopping experience of ebay.com users. In 2005 it looked like eBay might try to develop a larger technological presence by purchasing Skype, a fast growing voice over IP and messaging service. Despite expanding the company dramatically, eBay chose to sell off Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011 to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), in order to ""focus on its core e-commerce and payments businesses."" From a financial perspective, eBay has grown at a much slower pace than Amazon, however the company has been consistently profitable and has high margins, with low capital expenditures. While it may not be a technology leader, it is certainly a dominant force in internet retailing and a highly successful company.Stock PerformanceeBay's stock has been a great performer since bottoming out at about $10 in March 2009. Since then, shares have increased almost 400%, and currently trade at about $52. But looking at the performance from a longer term perspective, we can see that despite the recent run up, the stock is trading at a similar level that it was in 2004, almost a decade ago. By way of comparison, Amazon.com's stock value has increased ten-fold from the price it was at in mid 2004 and now trades at almost $400 per share, giving Amazon a market cap of $180 billion.Clearly, the investment community does not value eBay's business by the same metrics it uses to value Amazon, despite eBay being a far more profitable company. There is little buzz surrounding eBay and seemingly little reason for investors to drive the valuation considerably higher than it currently stands. The company has been spending cash in recent years on a share buyback which has had some success in supporting the stock price and increasing earnings per share, but ultimately the outstanding share count has remained roughly the same. According to eBay, the primary purpose of the buyback is simply to ""offset the additional shares being issued as compensation.""Instituting A DividendOn a fundamental level, considering the financial condition of the company, shareholders should be expecting a far greater payout. eBay is on track to generate more than $4 billion in cash from operations in 2013 and currently sits on a rather large reserve of cash and short term investments amounting to over $10 billion. For a company with a predictable business model, consistent cash generation and low innovation, shareholders should be questioning why the company is not returning cash via a dividend. As many other companies with large cash reserves, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) have recently instituted dividend policies, it will be only a matter of time before eBay is forced as well. And, while eBay has made some rather large acquisitions recently, issuing a small dividend will in no way preclude the company from future purchases. A carefully planned dividend, starting off small and growing consistently, has always been a great choice for increasing stock value and investor interest in a company.It's difficult to say whether a dividend will serve much purpose in invigorating eBay's share price; investors are usually far more attracted to high growth rather than payout. However, considering the company has little prospect of dramatically increasing growth in the near future, a dividend will at least provide some incentive for investors to hold and accumulate share as the company plans an expansion strategy.A payout ratio which would give eBay's stock a yield of about 2% has been mentioned in the past and would be an ideal way to start the dividend program. The yield would be smaller than that of Cisco and Microsoft, but roughly in line with Apple's. At eBay's current stock price, a 2% yield would equate roughly to a 25 cent quarterly dividend rate, or $1 per year. Based upon eBay's outstanding share count, this dividend would represent an expense of only $1.29 billion per year, or $325 billion per quarter. Considering that the company is expected to have a cash flow from operations of over $4 billion in 2013, and that number is seen increasing steadily well into the future, Ebay would still be able to bank almost $3 billion in cash per year for potential acquisitions, capital expenditures or share buyback initiatives.ConclusionThe key to any dividend plan is to make shareholders believe that the policy is simply an additional tool that the company is using to benefit shareholder interests. Despite the slow growth of late, eBay is an expanding company and investors will recognize that a dividend will be a reward for holding the stock, as the company implements its expansion plan. A fair and steadily increasing payout will also directly benefit the stock price, especially in our current low interest environment. As other companies have jumped on the dividend bandwagon lately, eBay will soon follow as well, and shareholders will have one more reason to like the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

According to the report, holiday sales this season will grow 2.4%, recording the slowest growth since 2009. The downturn in spending is already visible in other metrics. According to a comScore tracker, e-commerce sales in the US grew 13% in Q3 compared with 16% growth reported in Q2. Growth slowed in Q3 to just 13% growth from 16% growth in Q2.eBay’s FinancialseBay’s (Nasdaq: EBAY) Q3 revenues grew 14% over the year to $3.89 billion, falling short of the Street’s expectations of $3.91 billion. EPS of $0.64 was marginally ahead of the Street’s projections of $0.63 for the quarter.By segment, Marketplaces revenues grew 12% to $2 billion, with the number of active users growing 14% to 124 million. PayPal’s revenues grew 19% to $1.6 billion.For the current quarter, eBay projects revenues of $4.5 billion-$4.6 billion with EPS of $0.79-$0.81. Analysts were looking for revenues of $4.64 billion and earnings of $0.83 per share. eBay attributed the weak outlook to depressed macro economy and the recent federal government shutdown, events which have caused consumers to be more cautious of their spending.eBay expects to end the year with revenues of $16 billion-$16.5 billion with earnings of $2.70-$2.75 per share. Analysts were expecting revenues of $16.18 billion with EPS of $2.71 per share.eBay’s AcquisitionsAs part of its efforts to speed up product delivery, earlier this week eBay announced the acquisition of London-based Shutl. Shutl is a startup that uses an efficient network of couriers to deliver products within an hour. Shutl operates the service in New York City and Chicago in the US, and it offers 24/7 service in more than 50 towns in the UK. Last quarter, eBay announced a service that lets users pay a fee of $5 for same-day delivery for purchases of at least $25 from either one or more participating local retailers. eBay plans to use Shutl to expand these operations into Chicago. Terms of the acquisition were not announced.Earlier this month, eBay also acquired Braintree for an estimated $800 million. Chicago-based Braintree is known for its smartphone and tablet payment app, Venmo. Venmo enables single-click payment for transactions and does away with the need to re-enter payment details each time a user makes purchases on different mobile apps. Venmo also enables payments to friends using the social network. eBay will be able to leverage Venmo’s mobile payment processing capabilities to enhance PayPal’s offerings.Last month, eBay also announced the acquisition of Seattle-based Decide.com. Decide.com is an online shopping research service that analyzes data to predict price movements for retail products like consumer electronics and housewares. eBay plans to deploy Decide’s tools on its platform to help consumers make smarter purchasing decisions.Meanwhile, eBay continues to add site customization features, and as part of this effort, it announced the acquisition of Bureau of Trade for an undisclosed amount. San Francisco–based Bureau of Trade operates a curated online marketplace that offers unique products for men. As part of the acquisition, the company’s founder, Michael Phillips Moskowitz, will join eBay’s team to share his expertise and help eBay’s users discover products that are best suited to their tastes and preferences.The stock is trading at $51.83 with a market capitalization of $67.1 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $58.04 in April 2013."
1752692,25120,2013-10-17T20:34:14-04:00,,"Shares of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) fell some 4% on Thursday after the e-commerce market place and payment provider announced its third quarter results.Little convincing third quarter results and a cautious guidance into the all-important holiday season are the main reasons behind the correction.I remain on the sidelines on valuation concerns. eBay's valuation has been driven by the success of PayPal, which could face more competition with major competitors all eyeing the multi-billion market.Third Quarter ResultseBay generated third quarter revenues of $3.89 billion, up 14.3% on the year before, but slightly below consensus estimates at $3.91 billion.GAAP earnings rose by 15.4% to $689 million, as GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.53 per share. Non-GAAP earnings totaled $0.64 per share, beating consensus estimates by a penny.Looking Into The ResultseBay continued to show impressive growth, notably at its PayPal unit. Revenues at PayPal rose by 18.5% to $1.62 billion, as total payment volumes rose by 24.7% to $43.84 billion. PayPal still takes quite a high cut being the middle man. On average it receives 3.7 cents for every dollar transferred on the platform.Marketplace revenues were up by 12.2% to $2.03 billion, as gross merchandise value rose by 12.8% to $18.36 billion. eBay generates revenues equivalent to 11.04% of the merchandise value.The remainder of the revenues were being generated by solid, but no spectacular growth at the enterprise unit.OutlookFor the current fourth quarter, eBay sees revenues of $4.5 to $4.6 billion, up 14% at the midpoint of the range. Analysts were looking for fourth quarter revenues of $4.64 billion.GAAP earnings are seen between $0.67 and $0.69 per share, up from last year's earnings of $0.57 per share. Non-GAAP earnings are seen between $0.79 and $0.81 per share, below consensus estimates at $0.83 per share.ValuationeBay ended the quarter with $13.0 billion in cash, equivalents and non-equity investments. Total debt stands at $4.5 billion, for a net cash position of around $8.5 billion.For the first nine months of the year, eBay generated revenues of $11.52 billion, up 14.3% on the year before. Net earnings rose by 7.9% to $2.00 billion in the meantime.Full year revenues are seen around $16 billion as eBay is on track to report net earnings of $2.8 billion.Trading around $52 per share, the market values eBay at $67 billion, or its operating assets around $59 billion. This values operating assets around 3.7 times annual revenues and 21 times annual earnings.Despite the solid cash balances, eBay does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveUnlike most of the internet companies, eBay's share price didn't peak around 2000, but actually in 2004 when shares were trying to break the $60 level. Ever since shares sold off to lows of $12 during the 2009 crisis. In recent years they have seen a solid recovery again, trading as high as $58 earlier this year. Shares have retreated some 10-15% to current levels around $51-$52 per share.Between 2009 and 2012, eBay has seen solid growth. Annual revenues rose by a cumulative 61% to $14.1 billion, while earnings rose by merely 9% to $2.6 billion. Notably revenues are expected to rise further in 2013, while earnings growth will be limited.Investment ThesisSo eBay appears to be moving along just fine, yet investors are concerned a bit. Revenue growth is slowing down, and after years of investments, earnings growth is not really keeping pace with revenue growth in general, although third quarter earnings growth outpaced revenue growth.A crucial metric for the company is the ""Enabled Commerce Volume,"" or ECV, which grew by 21% to $52 billion, demonstrating the capabilities of Marketplace, PayPal and the Enterprise unit. eBay furthermore noted that mobile volume grew by 75%.PayPal remains the main driver behind growth, gaining 5.0 million new users, bringing the total active user base to 137 million, up 17%. Total payment volume grew even faster to $44 billion, suggesting the average user pays or receives about $321 via PayPal per quarter. With competitors like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Square among others targeting online and mobile payments, eBay might see increased competition.While payment volumes will undoubtedly increase, even with more competition, net revenues might be under pressure. One wonders how many people are willing to make big payments, while they have to pay an average commission of close to 4% per transaction.The market place business gained 3.9 million users to end up with a customer count of 124 million. In total they bought and sold for $18 billion worth of goods, an average of $145 per user for the three month period.eBay needs this large and growing customer base to compete with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Google, each having superior customer bases, and each capable of developing their own payment model. It seems that nowadays each of these tech giants is trying to boost their ""ecosystem."" To boost eBay's payment offerings in the field, and notably reinforce its positions for mobile devices, the company bought Braintree for $800 million last month.Still investors are not happy. eBay saw a deterioration in the economic environment throughout the quarter, partially due to the government shutdown. According to CFO Swan, e-commerce growth rates slowed down to 13% over the recent quarter, down from 16% in previous quarters. Surprisingly Europe and Asia were more stable and resilient during the quarter, while the US operations were the volatile spot. Swan saw a ""pretty rapid deceleration of the market, in a relative short period of time.""eBay reiterated its statements issued at the Analyst Day. It still sees $300 billion in ECV by 2015, up 70% from the expected $175 billion in 2012. Trailing commerce volume is already reaching $200 billion at the moment. Both PayPal and eBay are expected to do $20 billion in mobile volume this year.Back at the end of September, when eBay announced the acquisition of Braintree, I last took a look at eBay's prospects. I concluded that PayPal is integral to the company's success, in an attempt to transform the entire business into a technology company.At the time shares were trading around $56 per share, or 23 times earnings, which was a bit rich for my taste, especially with more competition for PayPal ahead. Ever since, shares have lost some 8% over the past three weeks.I concluded that I like the long-term prospects of the business. That being said, increased competition for PayPal while the stock trades at a premium valuation made me cautious. Shares have sold off even more, but I still don't find shares attractive at the moment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1752222,48311,2013-10-17T16:36:34-04:00,,"eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) owns the payment processor PayPal. Currently PayPal is the leading e-wallet with 137 million active accounts in 193 markets and 26 currencies around the world. PayPal enables global commerce, processing almost 8 million payments every day. PayPal expects to process $20 billion in mobile payments in 2013.PayPal, with its 137 million users, has dominated online payment services for about a decade now. Its growth has moderated in recent years, partly as a result of increased competition on mobile devices from smaller but nimbler rivals.In response PayPal bought mobile app developer Duff Research in March to add to its technology expertise. Just recently eBay acquired the payment gateway Braintree for $800 million in cash.Braintree is now seeing $12 billion in payments annually, with over $4 billion of that on mobile. The service is used by a number of start-ups and tech companies, including Airbnb, Fab, LivingSocial, Uber, Twilio, GitHub and others.Braintree operates Venmo, a mobile payments solution the company bought last year for $26.2 million. Venmo allows people to pay and send money to each other for free.Research firm IDC had last year forecast that worldwide purchases over mobile devices would exceed $1 trillion by 2017.The company has also been expanding into the much larger offline market, working on ways to convince customers to pay through PayPal accounts instead of credit cards or debit cards.This chart by comScore gives an idea of the strength of the PayPal brand:Leveraging First Mover AdvantagePayPal thanks its large market share to an early entry onto the scene and its partnership with eBay. The first to market or first mover advantage is not something I value very highly. By itself it does very little for a company and it can even be turned into a disadvantage.When you are first to market after large capital investments and a year later the competition comes to market with the same product but a more efficient production facility: you are screwed.The first mover advantage is often mistaken for a competitive advantage because it sometimes results in one. Or the company that is first to market also enjoys a real competitive advantage.For example sometimes the first to market advantage allows a company to set up a real sustainable competitive advantage like: economy of scale, network effect or customer captivity.I have no illusions of PayPal owning any proprietary technology or software that can't be matched by incumbents. The company will not keep the lead by investing in superior technology. Though it needs adequate technology for sure.It does have the strongest brand in online payments right now, but that isn't a competitive advantage by itself. However payment processing allows a company to secure two real competitive advantages: network effect and customer captivity.A payment processor needs a critical mass of merchants to accept it. One of the most important features of a e-wallet is that it must be widely accepted. It works exactly the same way as a credit card. Who is going to sign up with a credit card that's not accepted anywhere? This will also be true of mobile payment apps. Who is going to use a mobile payment app that doesn't work anywhere? No one, that's why this critical mass is really important.The second is customer captivity. Once you commit to one e-wallet you usually stick with it. I've used several e-wallets myself but I operated only one at a time. It's annoying to have your funds spread everywhere. And you don't want to learn a new interface just so you can pay. In addition some people want their payment history in one place. A large market share by an early dominant party can result in long-term customer captivity. If you already use the PayPal e-wallet for online shopping, you are more likely to use their app for mobile payment as well.That's why eBay's PayPal unit is very well positioned right now.ValuationEarnings per share of only $2 are not very impressive when you have to shell out over $50 to get it. Even after the recent pullback you have to pay up to get access to its modest current cash flow.However the company has $8 in cash per share on the balance sheet, which amounts to $10.4 billion. Total debt stands at just $4.53 billion.When you buy shares a significant amount is made up of cash. That puts the relationship between share price and earnings in a slightly better perspective.Now add to that eBay's track record of achieving growth and the $2 in earnings per share are starting to look a lot better. The company managed to grow net income with an average of 26% per year over the past 10 years. That included some pretty tough years.Data: MorningstarConclusionEarlier this year I recommended eBay in my article PayPal and GSI are eBay's Trump Cards. The recent pullback to $51.58 makes eBay an attractive buy again. All parts of the company have interesting growth prospects but PayPal is what makes it a really exciting investment.PayPal is well positioned to become one of the important mobile payment processors. A market estimated to be $1 trillion in size in 2017.If the company were to spin off the PayPal unit that could unlock some shareholder value right away. However there are no indications the company plans to do so.EBAY data by YChartsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1745072,38871,2013-10-15T03:39:16-04:00,,"PayPal still makes eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) a strong buy for the long term. PayPal has introduced some important innovations in the past few months that will make mobile payments easier for consumers. Also, it has made important acquisitions and partnerships that could secure its position as the dominate player in the mobile payments space.PayPal InnovationsIn my previous article on PayPal I wrote about the PayPal labs being a competitive advantage for PayPal. The company has proven me right in the past few months by introducing innovations in both customer experience and financial products.The first innovation is that of its QR code that will allow merchants to scan a QR code on the customers mobile device to make a purchase. This makes it easy for customers to pay in store for merchandise or services. Many consumers may already have their mobile device in hand at check out and would only have to open an app in order to pay.The second innovation introduced is called the PayPal Beacon. This device plugs into a USB port at a store that accepts PayPal. By checking into a location app such as Foursquare, the retailer has access to your funds in PayPal. When you are ready to check out, the retailer checks to make sure that the picture on your social media account looks like you and then you complete the purchase. You do not need to pull out cash or a card at all. Admittedly, this would take some getting used to and may need more checks and balances before it is widely adopted but it is still innovative.PayPal is not just innovating when it comes to technology but also financial products. PayPal has introduced small business loans for its customers. The loans are based on the amount of PayPal sales the business generates. There are no fixed monthly payments or late fees. Instead, the loan is paid back through a fixed percentage of the company's PayPal sales and a predetermined loan fee. With small businesses looking for capital and banks reluctance to loan funds, PayPal may see a new way to capitalize on well established existing customers.Acquisitions and Strategic PartnershipsPayPal not only has been innovative but has been active in making acquisitions and partnerships that will help secure its place as a dominate player in the mobile payments sector. Most notably its purchase of Braintree which has been used by many app developers to process payments for in app purchases. This is important because it makes PayPal the first choice of app developers. It also has a partnership with Discover card and is being adopted by Samsung for its app store.Valuation: PayPal Alone Makes eBay a BuyPayPal makes up 40% of eBay's revenue. PayPal is setting growth targets of between 15% to 18% over the next three years. PayPal also expects a 70% increase in revenue and the number of payments and total payment volume to increase. I believe PayPal will not only hit these targets but also surpass them. eBay's PEG ratio is only 1.22 and I believe is poised to see good growth in its other lines of business. If PayPal alone hits its growth expectation, I believe the stock will hit $61.The Bottom LinePayPal is the reason to hold on to eBay for the long haul. It is a strong growth story that is single handedly making eBay a very profitable company. Investors would be wise to add eBay to their well diversified portfolios.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1756462,28151,2013-10-21T04:59:11-04:00,,"This article is a continuation of a series in which I try to find stocks that are trading at prices well below the intrinsic value of that share of the business they represent. So far, I have identified Dr. Pepper Snapple (DPS) and Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) as companies that seem to meet the criteria required to qualify as Intelligent Investments, to use the phrase and method authored by the father of value investing, Benjamin Graham.In this article I will adapt this methodology according to the views of his most famous pupil, Warren Buffett, who has said that ""it's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price."" I have identified one such wonderful company and in this article will try to determine whether it's selling at a fair enough price to consider buying.eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is a leading global marketplace whose sites sell everything from textbooks on half.com to tickets through StubHub, not to mention pretty much anything else you can possibly think of from individual sellers around the world. eBay acts as a broker or auctioneer to link buyers with sellers, and in doing so avoids much of the downside of traditional retail such as dealing with excess inventory.Whereas Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) presumably has aspirations of selling everything to everyone, eBay has embraced a simpler strategy of only selling things they can actually make money on. As part of this strategy, they acquired a logistics company called GSI in 2011, which they have integrated into their Enterprise division to focus on e-commerce solutions such as managing the websites and inventory of brand name retailers ranging from Aeropostale to Zales.Instead of subsidizing the cost of providing personalized delivery to individuals' doorsteps through the ever more distribution centers required by Amazon, eBay Enterprise uses their scale and partnerships with leading stores and freight providers to fulfill orders. This can include shipping items for in-store pickup or delivering direct to consumers by presorting everything by customer zip code to expedite things through their ShipQuik program.eBay's traditional marketplaces could also be expected to be able to eventually piggyback on this distribution system to cost-effectively keep pace with Amazon's same-day shipping. It even has aspirations of being even faster, rolling out their eBay Now program in select cities. When coupled with their easy to use payment processing service, PayPal, this allows eBay to provide customers with a great shopping experience.In fact, I believe PayPal is the crown jewel in eBay's collection of synergistic businesses. It is certainly providing the most growth, now accounting for over 40 percent of eBay's revenue. This is likely to accelerate as they integrate another company into the already leading mobile payment provider, recently buying Braintree for $800 million to gain access to their expertise in collecting payments across a variety of platforms.While this eliminates one competitor, some might astutely point out that PayPal still has to contend with other competitors such as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) co-founder Jack Dorsey's Square, but I believe these fears are overblown because of both the ultimate size of the addressable market as well as PayPal's head start, established user base, and name recognition.PayPal has its own entrepreneurial pedigree, having been co-founded by Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) resident Renaissance Man Elon Musk. It has also benefited from being in eBay's capable hands for over 10 years, more than twice as long as Square has even been in existence. This first mover advantage is critical in both technology and payment processing, where ubiquity of acceptance benefits from the network effect and becomes more valuable as more people continue to adopt it.This article does a good job summarizing how far ahead PayPal is in the race to grab a share of the already lucrative and still fast growing mobile payments pie. Square already commanded an inferred market cap of over $3 billion last year on its way to a presumed IPO many multiples of that, with an annual revenue run rate likely approaching half a billion dollars this year based on the 2.75 percent fee they collect on the $15 billion in transactions they're expected to process this year, not even including payment from its deal with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).This sounds impressive until you consider that PayPal had revenues more than three times greater than this in just the past quarter alone. This amounts to an annual revenue run rate of over $8.5 billion assuming its 20 percent expected growth rate. If PayPal were to get the same price to sales multiple as Square got based on its likely now understated $3.25 billion valuation, this would be a valuation of about $55 billion, about 80 percent of eBay's $68 billion market cap.Considering that the company also has over $10 billion in cash and short term investments on their balance sheet, not even including another almost $4 billion in longer term investments like corporate and government bonds, this means you're essentially getting all the rest of eBay's excellent businesses for free. This provides a built in margin of safety even if one of their business lines slows down.PayPal certainly shows no signs of letting up, although the company recently warned of a possible slowdown in holiday sales in their traditional e-commerce business before backtracking slightly from those remarks. CEO John Donahoe actually used the unlikely excuse of cold season as an excuse for sounding too negative, but maintained that they ""try to under-promise and over-deliver.""Even with the conservative outlook, eBay expects fourth quarter earnings to come in between 79 and 81 cents, the midpoint of which would give them full year earnings of $2.70, good enough to give them a P/E ratio under 20. Considering that analysts, who have a good consensus track record of being within a penny of actual earnings for each of the last 4 quarters, forecast them to earn $3.14 next year and expect them to keep up this 16% earnings growth for at least the next five years, leaving them with a PEG ratio of about 1.2, very reasonable for an established but still fast growing company.These strong numbers seem to support the fact that eBay is doing an admirable job continuing to grow their businesses while maintaining profitability. This gives them the financial flexibility to continue to expand the reach of strong brands like PayPal, whether it be through acquisitions like we saw with Braintree, or internally developed innovations like PayPal Beacon, which expands the service into traditional retailers.This strong presence, both in stores and online, whether it be through one of their own web portals or one that they manage for others with their Enterprise service, gives eBay serious clout in the future of retail. While they're up against serious competition from the likes of Amazon, which seems determined to suck the margin out of everything like some evolved vampire squid, I believe eBay is managing their diverse collection of businesses very smartly, which should continue to benefit shareholders for years to come.If Amazon's predatory style sucks some of the life out of eBay's holiday numbers, investors should instead focus on the opportunity to pick up the rest of eBay's excellent businesses for a song. PayPal alone seems to have acquired the critical mass necessary to remain a disruptive force in the future of e-commerce, and the rest of eBay's businesses seem to have wisely focused on the more profitable niches necessary to put up a united front against Amazon's onslaught.Investors would be similarly wise to buy a share of the businesses that actually make money, at a much fairer price than the 3+ ""forward PEG"" (expected 2014 earnings divided by 5 year estimated earnings growth rate) or other nonsense metrics invented to justify buying Amazon. While both might be wonderful businesses, only eBay is selling at a fair enough price, and Intelligent Investors never pay retail, preferring the margin of safety that comes with scoring a deal from a seller who doesn't know how much what they're selling is really worth.Disclosure: I am long DPS, TEVA.

1730452,42201,2013-10-06T03:15:04-04:00,,"IntroductionIn today's article, I'd like to take a look at eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), the company behind eBay.com and PayPal. eBay was founded in California in 1995, and has since grown into an enormous auction website, selling millions of items a year and bringing in ever-growing revenues. I will be looking at eBay's revenue, earnings, balance sheet and valuation. I have chosen 2 companies to use for comparison, Overstock.com Inc. (NASDAQ:OSTK), an online retailer, and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), a financial services corporation.Revenue: Growing at a steady paceBetween 2008 and 2012, eBay's revenue has grown by an average of 13.3% per year. For the current fiscal year, analysts expect revenues to reach $16.17 billion, an increase of 14.9%. For comparison, its online retail competitor Overstock.com has seen its revenues grown by 7.1% per year on average during the past 5 years. Visa's 5-year average revenue growth rate is almost the same as eBay's, at 13.5%.Earnings have grown at a steady pace in recent years. EPS went down in 2012, compared to the previous year. This is because 2011's earnings were increased thanks to the sale of Skype. Still, between 2008 and 2012, the average annual EPS growth was at 10.0%. EBAY doesn't pay a dividend, so where does all this money go? Let's take a look at the balance sheet to find out:eBay's balance sheet: Swimming in cashAt the end of fiscal year 2008, eBay had $3.35 billion in cash. When the 2nd quarter of the current fiscal year ended, eBay reported it had a total $11.7 billion. A significant part of eBay's cash is being used to repurchase its own shares. In Q2 2013, eBay spend $466 million on share repurchases.To further illustrate eBay's financial strength, I have added a graph showing its current liabilities and current assets over the past 5 fiscal years. The current ratio (which is divined as current assets divided by current liabilities) has grown from 1.70 in 2008, to 1.96 in 2012. This is far better than OSTK, which had a current ratio of 1.05 in 2012.Valuation:Between 2008 and 2012, eBay's average price to earnings ratio was at 16.3. At the current price per share of $55.58, eBay has a p/e ratio of 27.5. However with expected earnings of $2.71 for the current fiscal year, it's forward p/e is at a much more reasonable 20.5. eBay's competitors are trading at much higher valuations, with p/e's of over 30.Conclusion:At 27.5 times 2012 earnings, eBay may seem expensive at first glance. However, considering the many positive factors for eBay, such as its large amounts of cash, and its low debt, combined with great forecasted earnings both the current and next fiscal year, I believe eBay is far superior to the other 2 companies in this article, and a great stock to own for anyone looking to add a stable, reliable business to their portfolio.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1742772,24491,2013-10-14T01:30:23-04:00,,"Recently, Best Ideas Newsletter portfolio holding eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) announced the acquisition of Chicago-based payment platform Braintree for $800 million in cash. Braintree is best known for accepting mobile transactions, and it is currently on pace to process $12 billion in net payment value for 2013.What is Braintree?Braintree is a fairly straightforward payment processing platform. While some processors demand variable fees and certain payment thresholds, Braintree is a simple 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction. Importantly, the transactions process in just two days, allowing small or capital hungry firms to access cash at a quick pace. Of the forecast for net payment volume of $12 billion in 2013, the firm expects $4 billion to be attributable to mobile payment processing.Why was eBay interested?Straightforward payment processing with a simple fee structure is an easy business model to mimic. What is difficult to do is steal customers from a platform that has already been fully integrated into the purchasing experience. Braintree's customers aren't a list of large retailers like J.C. Penney or Home Depot, but rather a new group of fast-growing start-ups like Uber, Air BnB, Livingsocial, Open Table (NASDAQ:OPEN), and Hotel Tonight.Though we doubt any of these firms will become the next Wal-Mart in terms of revenue, Braintree's major customers are all enjoying secular growth trajectories. Additionally, Braintree will be run as a separate entity, allowing eBay to maintain distinct pricing between PayPal and Braintree, giving the firm exposure to different clientele.Did eBay pay too much?Without specific financial details, it is difficult to discern whether or not the price eBay paid for Braintree was appropriate. Inc.com's 5000 list pegged Braintree's 2011 revenue at a paltry $9.9 million, though we think this figure will be closer to $40-$50 million in 2013. Still, eBay noted that the transaction won't be meaningful to revenue in 2013, and that it would also have a negative $0.01 impact on 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share, suggesting the firm isn't profitable at this point.Valuentum's TakeThough it is difficult (and perhaps irresponsible) to value the deal based on net payment volumes alone ($12 billion), we are confident in CEO John Donahue's capital allocation abilities. Plus, eBay made out pretty well when it acquired Elon Musk's payment processing company known as PayPal (Elon Musk is also of Tesla fame). We continue to hold shares of eBay in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1843372,56962,2013-11-15T12:29:53-05:00,,"eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) has become more than just an online auction site. The company is now a full service e-commerce operation. eBay provides services to big-name retailers by improving their online retailing business. The company also provides safe, fast and convenient methods for online payment to the masses and is continuously excelling in its traditional online auction business by adding new and innovative services.In this article I will discuss the recent developments in eBay's business and its PayPal payment services.After the acquisition of PayPal by eBay back in 2002, PayPal made simplistic changes to its operations. First the company improved its ability to cater to the transactions of eBay customers in the US. Afterwards the company improved service for eBay's international transactions. Once it established a strong foothold in the international e-commerce market the company shifted to an off-eBay strategy. Since then, the company has been continuously increasing the volume and amount of transactions completed using the PayPal platform.(Source: comScore)In the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 PayPal was successful in adding 5 million active registered accounts. The total number of registered accounts jumped to 137 million which is a 17% increase from what it was during the third quarter of fiscal year 2012.During the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 the amount of payments channeled through PayPal grew at a rate of 25% to $44 billion. This growth was fueled by increased usage of PayPal's services by consumers and merchandisers in order to receive and pay for goods and services directed from both eBay market places and third-party sales.Key Additions to PayPal's servicesPayPal routes approximately 1.1% of total global payments and I think this share can easily be doubled because eBay is doing everything it can to grab and retain a bigger market share. In pursuit of its goal the company has acquired complementary business, added new innovative payment solutions, and has forged ties with many retailers to accept payment via PayPal from consumers.The company is well aware of the increasing usage of mobile phones and has taken numerous steps to develop its capabilities in mobile phone payment services. Out of 137 million total users of PayPal 32% utilize mobile phone devices for purchases.Recently the company signed an acquisition contract with Braintree, a global payment platform. This complementary acquisition will add to eBay's PayPal services by refining and simplifying online and mobile payment methods. Currently PayPal accepts payments in 26 currencies in 193 markets over the globe but Braintree, which currently caters to 40 countries, accepts payments in more than 130 currencies. Adding a revolutionary company like Braintree to support PayPal's business will rapidly increase the user base and will show tremendous results in the near future.Additionally the company has enhanced PayPal's consumer app for iOS and android devices which will provide customers in the U.S. and Australia with convenient order-ahead and pay-at-table capabilities. Moreover it will offer customers the ability to check in and pay with their PayPal digital wallet at thousands of retail locations in the US, UK, Canada and Australia.eBay has also launched a fully localized PayPal offering in Russia. The company has also entered into Latin America's biggest economy, Brazil, by launching a Brazilian version of its Moda fashion app. The app is in Portuguese and features prices in USD as well as the BRL. This app is currently available on the iOS interface and its android version will be launched soon. The spending power of Brazilian consumers has increased and along with their awareness of fashion and luxury items, I think the move made by the company to expand its operations in the developing world will further strengthen the company's position and will provide a platform for PayPal's services to increase revenues. On the negative side, there will come a time when the company will have to compete with its partner MercadoLibre, an e-commerce company already operating in Brazil. If the company builds a strong enough grip in this new market then it can probably overcome the consequences of losing ties with its partner.PayPal's service is not limited to only online payments. The company also offers offline services to help shoppers save time and money through closed-loop offers where retailers can put vouchers directly into shopper's digital wallets.PayPal also offers a ""bill me later"" option which has increased the usage of PayPal services. The company currently offers 6 months interest-free financing for purchases exceeding $99. This option offers more flexibility for consumers to pay for their purchases.ConclusionIn my article I have tried to highlight the company's recent initiatives and what results they will produce in the coming future. I think these signs indicate that eBay's PayPal service will be its most pertinent source of revenue in the coming future.Before investing, investors should not only consider the company's future outlook because the current price of the stock is also important. So for that matter I have calculated the fair value of eBay's stock on the basis of the multiples-based valuation method.(Source: Morning star)In the table above I have used the multiple-based valuation method on the basis of trailing twelve months figures, Weights are based on survey estimates. My calculations show that the stock price is currently undervalued and has an upside potential of 33.12%. So keeping in view the company's future outlook and its attractive share price I give a buy recommendation.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Blackstone Equity Research research analyst.

1721642,38201,2013-09-30T17:02:10-04:00,,"eBay (EBAY) reported strong second quarter results; revenue increased 14% year over year to $3.9 billion. It generates revenue through two segments, Marketplace & PayPal, and both the segments witnessed strong growth. eBay is further adopting various strategies, which focus on enhancing customers' shopping experience. These strategies will act as a growth driver of the company's future incremental earnings.PayPal- A star performerIn the first half of 2013, PayPal added approximately 10 million additional accounts, reaching 132 million active users. PayPal accounts for almost half of the eBay's revenue, which is very significant for the company's growth. To increase its presence at traditional brick and mortar stores, it recently launched a device known as Beacon. This device will be installed in stores and will automatically connect with shoppers' smartphones. Customers only need to give a verbal sign to the merchants and payment will be initiated. Money transfer through PayPal requires a GPRS connection or Wi-Fi, but this device will use Bluetooth technology, enhancing its offline presence. This will improve PayPal users' shopping experience. With this, the company estimates to generate revenue of $20 billion by the end of this year.This strategy will act as a growth driver in the scenario of rapid trend shift towards smartphones and customers finding easy ways for electronic payments. We expect Beacon to increase the number of PayPal accounts, as only PayPal users will be able to access this device, providing an upside to its earnings.Apple (AAPL) has developed similar technology in its recent i0S 7 software update. Its updated software has an iBeacon feature, which also uses Bluetooth technology to transmit data. This new feature will allow Apple users to make payments in an outlet without using GPRS or Wi-Fi. iPhone users don't need a PayPal account, thus posing a risk for eBay.We believe eBay will have a competitive advantage over Apple's iBeacon since PayPal's beacon services will be provided to Android users as well as iPhone users, whereas iBeacon services are limited to iPhone users only. Since 70.1% of smartphone owners use Android devices, in comparison to 21% for i0S, eBay's PayPal will cover a larger customer base and will remain the dominant player in electronic payment system.Comparison of Same Store Sales, or SSS with its rivalIn August, the overall growth for e-commerce was 16%. However, eBay's SSS reported a 19% growth rate, better than the overall e-commerce growth rate. The company's marketplace segment is also contributing to strong growth in the near future. Its Marketplace segment represents approximately 50% of the company's total revenue. On its marketplace platform, eBay displays various companies' products, and eBay receives revenue for product sales. The company stated that it is expecting 30 more companies to have stores on its Marketplace platform by the end of this year. The inclusion of these companies' additional products will broaden customers' options, attracting more customers towards its website.The last quarter launch of Cassini, a specialized search engine, in North America will add to the growth of this segment. This search engine will tailor the search results to the customer's previous product preferences, easing the way customers purchase products. These factors will drive the Marketplace segment's growth and will have a significant impact on the company's revenue. Analysts expect its top line to increase from $16.17 billion this year to $18.81 billion.Its competitor, Amazon.com's (AMZN) SSS came out to be 24% in August, which is also more than the overall e-commerce growth rate of 16%. Despite its SSS higher than e-commerce growth rate, its SSS rate declined drastically from 40.4% a year ago. The reason behind this decline is increasing competition, which Amazon is countering by slashing prices. Amazon has cut the prices of its high margin web services, which will have a negative impact on the company's bottom line, leading towards lower returns to equity. This is an important valuation multiple for income investors as it represents the percentage of net income distributed to its shareholders. With its weak bottom line, Amazon currently has negative return to equity of 1.24%, implying a loss.Conversely, eBay generates strong free cash flows with its strong fundamentals, as discussed above. It generated $658 million of free cash flows in the second quarter of 2013. With its strong free cash flows, the company currently returned 13% of its net income to its shareholders, which is much higher than Amazon's return to its shareholders, making eBay a buy for income investors.Conclusion:With the adoption of various strategies, both segments of the company indicate high earnings growth potential. Its operations will enhance the customer shopping experience, leading towards incremental earnings, which are expected to upsurge from $2.35 per share this year to $2.78 next year. Along with this, its operations have competitive advantage over other competitors as discussed above, which will allow this e-commerce giant to continue its market dominance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1590382,48441,2013-07-31T15:07:40-04:00,,"Last April, I wrote about eBay's revenue growth being an indicator of Amazon's growth rate due to recent converging trends between the two companies. As it turns out, the predictive value of eBay's results held in Q2.The Relationship RevisitedPrior to 2011, there was not much of a distinguishable relationship between eBay and Amazon growth rates. Since then, however, there has been a pretty tight relationship between growth rate movements - albeit on slightly different scales.Without going into as much detail as the previous article, the updated equation used to calculate Amazon's Q2 growth rate is shown above. The goodness of fit metric (R2) actually increased from .63 at the end of Q4 to .71 when including Q1 data. Including the most recent Q2 data (which would be used to predict Amazon's Q3 growth rate when eBay reports Q3 earnings) increases the R2 to .75.The PredictioneBay reported revenue growth of 14.1% on July 17th. eBay's results (plugged into the above equation) implied a 22.8% growth rate for Amazon, which was on the high end of Amazon guidance (13% to 26%) and just a nose hair above revised consensus (22.4%). Roughly a week later (July 25th), Amazon reported Q2 revenue growth of 22.4%, in line with revised consensus and just a bit below the results predicted by eBay's growth rate.The below chart shows actual Amazon growth rates over the last eight quarters compared to the predicted rates from the relationship to eBay over the same time period.The ImplicationsIt's no secret that Amazon does not trade on actual earnings, rather the stock seems to follow topline growth and 'future expectations'.*YChartsThough I would not use this approach as a standalone prediction of Amazon's growth rates, it can certainly be used as a sense check against other predictions. (Amazon guidance, consensus estimates, channel advisor reports, etc).Having a well-rounded point of view on top-line growth is a good arrow to have in the quiver. Signs of slowing revenue growth could raise the risk of Amazon not being able to grow into its investments, which could impact the 'future expectations' portion of the stock price. Granted, Amazon's stock has continued to increase in the face of slowing revenue growth, but the company has continued to outpace overall e-commerce growth. Should Amazon ever fall below total e-commerce growth, the stock would likely come back down to earth.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1677902,51222,2013-09-06T10:52:45-04:00,,"As the world continues to embrace technological advances, there will be winners and losers that emerge from the drastically changing landscape of payment processing. eBay, Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) stands to gain market share and revenue growth through its PayPal segment as more consumers and businesses embrace electronic payment methods. The dramatic shift from traditional payment methods (i.e. checks, debit/credit cards, cash) to electronic payment forms has been rapid and wide-reaching. The upward trend began in the early 2000s with Person-to-Person and Consumer-to-Business payments transitioning to less traditional methods and later shifted to major growth in Business-to-Business payments. eBay benefits from all three of these transaction groups through PayPal.eBay Inc.Though eBay began as a wildly successful online marketplace, the purchase of PayPal in 2002 launched the company into an entirely new world of growth potential through online payment services. Since then, the revenue growth rates in the Payments segment have been exponentially greater than that of the growth in the Marketplaces segment. The Marketplaces segment on its own is a successful business for eBay with revenue growth averaging nearly 7% over the last 5 years and total revenue exceeding $7 billion in 2012. The Payments segment, however, has experienced an average annual revenue growth of more than 23% over the same time period.*Data Sourced from Morningstar.com*Data Sourced from Morningstar.comWhile it is evident that both segments have grown significantly over the last five years, the Payments segment may soon overtake the Markets segment as a percentage of total company revenue. In 2007, Payments revenue accounted for just 25% of total revenue, whereas Marketplace revenue accounted for 70%. By the end of 2012, Payments revenue accounted for 46% of total revenues and Marketplace revenues accounted for 52.5% of the total. Further, PayPal has grown its active user base from 5 million accounts in 2001 to 128 million accounts at the end of 2012.*Data from eBay, Inc.Much of this growth in the Payments segment can be attributed to the increased adoption of electronic payment methods by businesses and consumers, a trend that will likely continue. eBay's future growth will surely come from the Payments segment, and recent research reports estimate strong future growth rates in the adoption of electronic payment methods.Changing Payment Methods Leading to Opportunity for eBayAs more consumers and businesses have adopted electronic payment methods over the last 15 years, payment processing and other payment facilitation companies have benefited. Recent research covering these changes in payment trends also suggests that the upside for continued growth potential in electronic payments is incredible. And eBay will benefit. There are three major transaction segments that use payment services like PayPal; Person-to-Person (P2P), Business-to-Business (B2B), and Consumer-to Business. Prior to the late 90s, P2P payments were almost entirely by cash and check. With the advent of online shopping and e-retailers, that quickly began to change. A recent report put out by Dovetail in conjunction with Radix Consulting Corporation estimates that there are still over 25 billion checks written annually in the U.S. today. That number will continue to decline as more people move from checks to electronic payment forms. From 2006-2009, checks dropped from 30.5 billion to 24.5 billion. Some of those transactions spread into debit card and other card purchases while others flooded other e-payment services like PayPal. Over the same period from 2006-2009, a Federal Reserve study showed that ACH payments (including online payment systems and other electronic payments) increased at a 9.4% compounded annual growth rate. By the end of 2009, electronic payments exceeded three quarters of all noncash payment transactions.*Source: 2010 Federal Reserve Payments Study*Source: 2010 Federal Reserve Payments StudyThe two charts above show the distribution of each payment method as a percentage of total noncash payment transactions from 2006 to 2009. ACH is the most important method to note, as this includes online and other payment services like PayPal. A more impressive chart below shows the growth of the dollar value of ACH payments from 2009. While ACH payment made up only 18% of the total transactions in 2009 as indicated in the pie chart above, those payments accounted for 51% of the total dollar value of noncash payments.*Source: 2010 Federal Reserve Payments StudyClearly, as ACH transactions continue to grow, consumers and businesses are also willing to complete significantly larger transactions through ACH methods than in the past. This is good news for PayPal. A second Kansas City Federal Reserve report also evaluated P2P payment methods and concluded that, due to the unique characteristics of electronic payment methods (i.e. speed, payer control, security, and universality) will likely lead to continued growth in this space. While all of this speaks to the macro backdrop leading to a long-term benefit for PayPal and other payment services, it is just as important to note eBay's strengths as a company.eBay's Financials Indicate a Solid OpportunityAside from the favorable revenue growth numbers already discussed, eBay, Inc. has a number of other financial aspects worth delving into. As the company has grown revenues, it has also maintained a strong return on equity, great profit margins, and notable free cash flow. Further, at the current P/E, it seems to be a good value considering the continued growth of the Marketplaces segment and potential exponential growth of the Payments segment.With a solid 18.5% net profit margin in 2012, eBay has proven itself as a well-run and profitable company. While the net margin tends to range between 18% and 27% across different years, it has maintained a healthy average net margin of 22.8% over the last five years.Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is perhaps eBay's closest competitor in the online marketplaces space. A quick look at some key stats on eBay vs. Amazon shows eBay as the more solid company.In addition to management effectiveness and the company's profitability, eBay's free cash flow is indicative of its ability to carry out the company's approved stock repurchase plans, which will offset dilution from equity compensation programs. This will add additional value to shareholders over the long run. In 2010, the board approved a $2 billion stock repurchase program, and by the end of 2012, the company had repurchased the full amount permitted under the program. Again June 2012, the board approved an additional $2 billion with no expiration date. At the end of 2012, $1.98 billion remained for ongoing repurchases. Of course, a stock repurchase program doesn't mean anything if the company cannot afford to repurchase shares. With eBay, that isn't the case.Not only does the company have very strong current free cash flow, but it has grown its free cash flow numbers tremendously over the last ten years. With annual free cash flow of $2.5 billion, the company has ample funds to service debt, invest in growth opportunities and repurchase shares.With a current trailing twelve month P/E of 25.5 times earnings vs. its five-year average of 16.4x, the current price seems somewhat high on the surface. However, taking into account the growth potential inherent in the payment services and the industry average P/E of 47.4x, the current price looks better on a relative basis.Current Valuation*Source: Morningstar.comFurther, the recent 9.6% drop in the stock price from its high of $57.38 in July due to an earning miss presents a great buying opportunity.While the company did miss earnings estimates, it still posted very strong results with second quarter revenue growth of 14% vs. the same quarter in 2012. PayPal alone showed a 20% growth in revenue over the same quarter in 2012 as well as an addition of 4.7 million active registered accounts during the quarter. PayPal's net payment volume also increased 24% to $43 billion.RisksAs with any publicly traded company there are always risks that must be evaluated, however, eBay has specific risks that not all companies face. As an online merchandiser, eBay's revenue would be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions which would drive transaction volumes and payment volumes lower. Evidence of this appeared in 2008-2009 when eBay's Marketplace segment revenues declined due to poor economic conditions and a decline in consumer spending. Secondly, the nature of eBay's technologically driven business means the company will have to continue to innovate to keep up with advances in other e-commerce methods as well as rapid changes in B2B and P2P payment processes. Banks and other financial institutions will continue attempting to develop more user friendly ACH and other electronic payment methods that could compete with PayPal and gain market share. Even with the usual risks, eBay seems to be in a position to deliver continued growth.Delivering Return to ShareholdersAll in all, eBay has shown stellar growth and should continue to perform well under the current circumstances. The company itself is a well-run organization with a good business model and a strong financial foundation. In addition, the tailwinds approaching from the shifting payment trends should give PayPal continued opportunity to post strong results as more businesses and consumers abandon traditional payment methods in favor of easier, faster, and more convenient electronic payments.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1657672,20411,2013-08-26T15:26:22-04:00,,"By Neal RauThe market for mobile payment transactions is predicted to rise 44% this year to over $235 billion, which includes merchant purchases, money transfers and bill payments. PayPal, owned by eBay Inc. (EBAY), is the best known mobile online payment option. PayPal is extremely important to eBay, as it accounted for about 40% of eBay's 2012 revenue. PayPal hasn't had much competition but recently big names have been surfacing as potential competitors. How much would eBay's stock be affected if a big competitor stepped in?Security is the biggest concern for consumers who want to use digital wallet providers, which might be why PayPal has been successful in fending off some smaller challengers up to this point. Only about 12% of consumers surveyed say they have used a digital wallet service other than PayPal. However, with the explosion of mobile merchant transactions, bigger players are starting to surface and eBay shareholders should take notice. Stock Traders Daily has EBAY neutral long-term, thus far the stock has held support through a tight trading range over the last six months.Competition:Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) confirmed that it was preparing to test a mobile payment service that allows purchases to be made with just a Facebook login. The company has millions of gamers who spend money buying in-game virtual goods while playing on top of the Facebook platform. While the company has been clear to say they are not looking to replace PayPal , with this test run it isn't a stretch to think they might at some point in the future.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), who is rumored to be starting a mobile payment service called iWallet, might be an even bigger threat to PayPal. The key factor is Apple's iTunes, which the company said has more than a half-billion active iTunes accounts linked to credit cards. Another advantage is its existing partnerships with some of the biggest retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT) and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY). Apple could leverage those relationships to help its own iWallet service get started. Apple has been working on iWallet for the past two and a half years and a fingerprint technology to go along with it. Apple bought fingerprint and secure solutions specialist Authentec last year for $356million.The next generation iPhone is expected to be released next month, and is rumored to include a fingerprint sensor and a near-field communications chip for mobile payments.Google Inc.'s (GOOG) product, Google Wallet, makes sense for the company because it can add purchase behavior to its already massive stockpile of data. Despite some major advantages, like Android, the company has yet been successful in making Google Wallet a household name yet.PayPal might finally see some real competition in the mobile payment service business, as bigger names like Apple and Facebook move in. Any business lost from PayPal would certainly be bad for eBay's stock. Shares of eBay have been in a tight trading range over the last six months, so right now there is no immediate concern, but if support breaks all that would change. At Stock Traders Daily the discipline is to sell/short if support levels break or resistance levels are tested, but neither has happened yet, so according to our observations EBAY should be monitored for opportunity, defined catalysts exist, but no actionable triggers are occurring for longer term trades in EBAY quite yet.

1716112,25120,2013-09-26T18:06:14-04:00,,"Shares of eBay (EBAY) jumped up over three percent after the internet marketplace and payment provider announced the strategic acquisition to buy Braintree.I applaud the deal, yet refrain from investing in eBay considering that I think shares trade around fair value. Yet this deal and continued growth has the potential to send shares to fresh all time highs during this holiday season.The DealeBay announced that has agreed to acquire Braintree for $800 million in cash.Braintree is an innovative payment platform focusing on online and mobile startups. While Braintree itself might not be so well known, the businesses who use the platform are. Key users include Airbnb, OpenTable, TaskRabbit and Uber, each of them disrupting traditional business models.Braintree will remain a separate unit within eBay's PayPal business, with the current management team remaining in place. Braintree is known from Venmo which is its mobile application, making payments through mobile devices easily across social networks.Braintree has been founded as recent as 2007 and is based in Chicago, having little over 200 employees.Excluding Braintree, eBay expects that PayPal will handle $20 billion in mobile payment volumes for the year. Braintree projects $12 million in payment volumes for the year, one third to be driven by mobile payments.The deal will lead to a $0.01 per share dilution to non-GAAP earnings, and impact GAAP earnings by one to three cents per share.The deal is subject to normal closing conditions, including regulatory approval . The deal is expected to close in the final quarter of this year. PayPal itself has 132 million accounts, processing 7.7 million payments every year.ValuationeBay ended the second quarter with $10.4 billion in cash, equivalents and short term investment. The company has $4.5 billion in total debt outstanding, for a net cash position of $5.9 billion. As such, financing the $800 million deal should provide no difficulties.Revenues for the first six months of the year came in at $7.62 billion, up 14% on the year before. Earnings rose by merely 4% to $1.32 billion. The company guided for full year revenues of $16 to $16.5 billion, while full year earnings could come in around $2.9 billion.Trading around $56 per share, the market values eBay at some $73 billion, or its operating assets around $67 billion. This values eBay's operating assets at 4.1 times annual revenues and 23 times annual earnings.eBay does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveLong term shareholders in eBay have seen very decent returns. Shares rose from merely $10 in 2009 to recent highs of $58, as shares currently trade at $56 per share.Between the calendar year of 2009 and 2012, revenues rose by a cumulative 61% to $14.1 billion. Earnings rose by 5% to $2.6 billion in the meantime.Investment ThesiseBay is traditionally best known from its marketplace, but the brilliant acquisition of PayPal for $1.5 billion a decade ago has paid off handsomely. Payment services are complementary to eBay's marketplace thereby boosting growth. Yet PayPal growth has been much more rapid than eBay's marketplace, as the business stands to overtake marketplace revenues at some point in time, which could come rather soon.The latest deal with Braintree shows the focus on, and the ambitions of the company in the field. Braintree's technology and focus on mobile phone payments, could bolster PayPal's offering for online payments. The deal could be crucial going forward as competition with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Square will be intense.Back in December of last year I took a look at eBay's prospects. I concluded that the PayPal acquisition has been integral to eBay's success and will be the focus of the company going forwards, as eBay might transform into a technological payment company with the marketplace as a side business.At the time I concluded the stock has moved too far, too fast in 2012. Note that shares rose from $30 to $50 in 2012. So far in 2013 the stock has mostly consolidated, trading in a $50-$58 trading range, currently around $56 per share. As earnings steadily rose, the price-earnings multiple dropped from 25 to 23 times earnings, still a bit rich.So I like to think most of eBay's future growth and value is being represented by its PayPal unit, which might be seeing tougher times ahead as more companies will focus on the growing market.The company has a prominent position on desktops, yet it faces regular complaints from vendors regarding excessive fees and transaction costs. Succeeding in mobile is another story as competition is starting to come in, which might put pressure on fees. Note that the company on average makes about 4% in commission on payment through website.I remain on the sidelines, liking the long term prospects of the business. At the same time, competition might intensify, a reason why I like the aggressive move to buy Braintree to bolster the competitive position. At 23 times earnings, I think the business is somewhat fairly valued, and therefore remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1647002,52172,2013-08-20T13:32:41-04:00,,"If you'd be asked to come up with things that are related to online shopping, then you'll eventually mention eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Well, it's safe to say that the company really has become synonymous with the web-retail scene, and that's why some investors don't even think twice before adding eBay to their portfolios. Since you're among those who analyze their ""opportunities"", you're still pondering one important question: is the online-shopping giant really an excellent pick?What's Obvious EnoughTo make a proper decision about eBay, it's crucial to first think about its capability to grow. After all, even though the biggest companies aren't expected to be at par with startups when it comes to boasting sales-percentage improvements, such key industry players still need to prove that they're steadily expanding. Currently, eBay has a YoY Growth of 14.10%. While that might seem good enough, it's important to highlight this fact - its competitors have much better numbers. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for example, has a YoY Growth of roughly 22.00%.Rest assured, eBay has lots of supporters among investors. That's why many would probably say that the company has an impressive P/E Ratio - much more remarkable than that of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). While that's true (since eBay's P/E Ratio is currently at 26.25), it wouldn't be fair to compare the online-retail firm with one that's not among its closest rivals. So, instead of comparing its P/E Ratio with Google's, it's much more suitable to see how it matches up to Overstock's (NASDAQ:OSTK). Well, Overstock's 31.96 does look nicer than eBay's 26.25.About the Selling GameAt this point, one thing should already be clear. Despite eBay's record as a highly-recommended choice for investors, it's no longer at the top of its industry in certain aspects. The once unrivalled champion of the online-shopping world is finally facing stiff competition. Aside from having to contend with Overstock and even Etsy (a private firm that's pretty much like eBay during its early days), the web-retail giant might soon have to go face to face with a much bigger threat - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Simply put, the king of social media might soon reveal its PayPal alternative.You're probably wondering why that would be a problem. Just so you know, eBay owns PayPal. That means that if ever the payment-processing business would suffer a serious blow - from being left out of the countless transactions that happen across Facebook - then its parent company would end up getting hurt as well. Even if the social site's PayPal alternative wouldn't materialize (or ends up being something different from what's mentioned in rumors), it's obvious that more and more people are trying to avoid the payment processor after reading frightening (but familiar) tales.Thinking of Stock WoesIt's only appropriate to say that eBay (and even PayPal) probably lacks direction when it comes to tackling its toughest competitors and satisfying its clients. Obviously, that's not a good sign. While the online-shopping giant isn't just failing to effectively compete, it's also having a hard time pleasing investors who really think about what they should be getting and what a company shouldn't be doing. To be a bit more specific, some are beginning to notice eBay's underhanded buybacks, which clearly aren't for boosting value but are actually for employee compensation.As you might already know, distributing stocks in that manner would cause two kinds of problems for those who'd choose to invest in eBay. First, people who'd put their money into the web-retail firm won't get what they deserve, especially since the net income wouldn't be solely divided among them - the employees are also added into the equation, thus lowering the resulting Earnings per Share. In addition, eBay's employees have better risk protection than investors do, since the company lets their own people trade valueless stocks for those that still have worth.On the Right Thing to DoAfter reading about all those things, you've now realized that the often buy-rated eBay isn't as impressive as many believe it to be. Even its stability might soon be in question, especially since its rivals in the e-commerce industry are beginning to step up. Of course, there's also the possibility that Facebook might fight PayPal for payment-processing supremacy. So, while it's still right to say that eBay isn't the worst choice for investors like you, it's also true that looking for another long-term option might be a much smarter move for now.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1712232,24491,2013-09-25T07:46:33-04:00,,"RJ TownereBay's PayPal (NASDAQ:EBAY) released its updated version of its iOS and Android mobile application. This release marks the latest attempt for a digital wallet to usurp the importance of the credit/debit card and ""simplify"" payments.By no means is this the first attempt for a company to push a digital wallet. Google Wallet (NASDAQ:GOOG) has failed to gain much traction, not because it is exclusive to Android, but mostly because it isn't a very intuitive program and awareness isn't high.Apple's Passbook (NASDAQ:AAPL) has sneaked into the marketplace to become the fourth most popular mobile commerce app. Passbook differs from Google Wallet in the sense that it isn't used much for payments, but rather for boarding passes, sports tickets, and company loyalty cards. This is where the app actually adds value: consumers do not have to worry about printing a ticket or cluttering a wallet with a loyalty card.So What About PayPal?The new PayPal app has already garnered both positive and negative reviews. Overall, the product is definitely an improvement over previous iterations. New location services allow users to see what businesses nearby accept PayPal payments. A new photo feature lets users upload a photo for merchants to confirm purchases. Transferring money remains relatively straightforward.As great as the new features are, the usefulness of the new features may be lacking. We tested out 'location services' to find local businesses, but we had a few issues. The most obvious issue was the wild measurement inaccuracy-off by several miles. The subsequent suggestions then became hard to identify. By comparison, Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) check-in feature suggested more relevant (and closer) locations.Unfortunately, the other issue could do much more damage to the attractiveness of PayPal's digital wallet-acceptance remains low. Although this is likely to change, we think PayPal will still have a difficult time convincing retailers and consumers that a change from the status quo is necessary. This is one reason why we remain bullish on Best Ideas Newsletter portfolio holding Visa's (NYSE:V) long-term prospects: the current system works exceptionally well, and there is no clamoring for change.That's not to say change can't occur. No one really thought the CD player was so bad, but the MP3 and iPod quickly changed everyone's mind. The problem, in our view, is that the digital wallet simply isn't an upgrade from the existing payment infrastructure.Some consumers will flock to the new payment system, and PayPal may even provide retailers with great incentives to accept mobile wallets, but the system simply isn't better than the tried-and-true credit card. Plus, consumers cannot stop carrying wallets since they need identification and (often) cash anyways, so the incremental impact of carrying a credit or debit card is extremely small. We won't dismiss the possibility of digital wallet success, but it may take a new form factor (smartwatch?) to make it a relatively more attractive alternative.Valuentum's TakeThe digital wallet could be the future of payments, but we do not believe the future is now. The existing payment infrastructure remains superior, in our view, so we do not see a mass exodus away from card payments anytime soon. The system isn't perfect (think splitting a check), so there could be opportunity for the digital wallet to compensate for the card's shortcomings. Of course, PayPal payments online continue to grow at a rapid clip, and PayPal seems likely to continue to dominate the space. Because we think the movement away from cash payments remains a powerful trend, we continue to hold shares of both eBay and Visa in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter.Disclosure: I am long AAPL, V.

1585082,24063,2013-07-30T15:25:17-04:00,,"By Matt DoironA Form 4 filed with the SEC has revealed that Kathleen Mitic, a member of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)'s Board of Directors and a former executive at Facebook, purchased 5,000 shares of eBay on July 24th at an average price of $51.61 per share. She had not owned any shares directly prior to this purchase. Investing over $250,000 in eBay is an increase in her company-specific risk, and economic theory states that company insiders should generally prefer to diversify their wealth unless they are more confident than usual in the stock's future prospects. Insider purchases are therefore often treated as bullish signals, and in fact studies generally show a small outperformance effect for stocks bought by insiders (read our analysis of studies on insider trading).In the second quarter of 2013, eBay experienced 14% revenue growth versus a year earlier led by strong results in the payments segment (which includes PayPal). Margins did shrink, however, and so operating income only grew by 8% (reported earnings were lower than in Q2 2012 due to a gain on sale in the prior year period). Following a strong first quarter of the year operating income is now up 15% year to date.With a market capitalization of $66 billion, eBay is valued at 25 times its trailing earnings. That valuation certainly prices in high growth over the next few years, although Wall Street analysts do expect the company to do well going forward. In fact, the forward P/E is only 16. We would note that the payments business tends to have a lower operating margin than the marketplace operations, and so if eBay's revenue growth continues to be driven by that division of the company we would expect operating margins to continue to decline- therefore increasing the levels of sales growth the business has to achieve in order to generate enough future earnings to justify the current valuation.In addition to insider trading activity, we track quarterly 13F filings from hundreds of hedge funds and other notable investors. We've found that this information can be useful in developing investment strategies (for example, the most popular small cap stocks among hedge funds earn an average excess return of 18 percentage points per year). According to our database, EBAY was the 9th most popular stock among the 500 hedge funds we are tracking (see the most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of March).Peers for eBay's online auctions business include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK). Amazon is valued at about 100 times forward earnings estimates, and just reported an unexpected quarterly loss; the company has now missed consensus earnings in three of the last four quarters. Expenses continue to rise, casting doubt on bulls' insistence that Amazon will soon be able to trim many of its costs and immediately realize high profits. As a result we would avoid the stock. Overstock has been delivering high growth on both top and bottom lines, going by recent reports, and is up over 300% in the last year. Those are eye catching returns, though they have brought the company's earnings multiples up fairly high and 28% of the float is held short as many market players expect that growth rates will soon fall.Paypal can be compared to more traditional money wiring services including Western Union (NYSE:WU) and Moneygram International (NASDAQ:MGI). Western Union's business has been weak recently, with earnings down over 10% from their levels a year ago off of modest declines in revenue. The stock is priced in what would be value territory (for example, the forward earnings multiple is 11) if management was keeping the financials steady but even the sell-side is predicting further decreases in profit. Its smaller peer Moneygram is priced at a small premium to it on a forward earnings basis, with a P/E of 14, and while sales have actually been up according to that company's recent results we are skeptical that this would continue for the longer term given shifts in the industry.As a result we are skeptical of the value proposition that many of these peers offer investors, although Western Union would certainly be appealing if the company managed to cut costs enough in the future to hold earnings steady. eBay itself, even with the insider purchase, seems a bit pricey at current levels and while we do like the prospects of the payments business we've mentioned our concerns that a shift in revenue mix towards those operations may reduce margins.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: This article is written by Insider Monkey's writer, Matt Doiron, and edited by Meena Krishnamsetty.

1688372,23479,2013-09-11T15:47:23-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has taken several initiatives to make its service more widespread, attractive and simpler. There are some tailwinds to its key businesses as global e-commerce volume continues to expand and mobile payments grow.As a result, the company has set aggressive targets for the next 2-3 years. eBay expects earnings growth of 15% to 18% over the next three years (including 2013) with revenues expected to jump by almost 70% during the same period. The current trends indicate that this may be achievable. PayPal is performing strongly and the marketplaces business is gaining momentum.Here are some ways the company can boost its earnings growth in the near term.Star Performance From PayPal PayPal has been going strong with the number of active registered accounts rising from 57 million in 2007 to 123 million in 2012. The company added another 9-10 million accounts in the first half of 2013, taking the total to 132 million. The number of payments and the total payment volume are also growing thanks to the explosive growth in global e-commerce. PayPal continues to expand its global footprint and is benefiting from increased merchant coverage and a higher share of checkout. This means that more customers are buying goods and services through PayPal, and many merchants believe that integrating PayPal has been helpful in acquiring new customers.Mobile GrowthMobile is going to be one of the key growth areas for PayPal, and the company is promoting mobile transactions as an alternative to payment by cards through its mobile app. The service works through the PayPal app that customers can use to check-in to the store. PayPal has partnered with point of sale technology companies such as MICROS, Island Pacific, Kounta and Vend and will soon add more retailers and hospitality partners into the mix. eBay expects PayPal to do $20 billion of mobile commerce and payments volume in 2013. [1] Tie-Up With Discover Financial ServicesPayPal announced an arrangement with Discover last year under which PayPal has been issuing payment cards to its active users in the U.S. The new card will have a Discover Issuer Identification Number which is a code that identifies the card holder,and will allow users to buy from merchants that are part of Discover’s network. We expect the enhanced ubiquity of the payment service will positively impact the number of transactions per PayPal account.‘PayPal Here’ As A Replacement For Cash RegistersPayPal launched a point of sale solution PayPal Here in 2012. The solution will serve as a replacement for cash registers. It enables merchants to use a card reader attached to a mobile device to accept payments. The card reader device is aimed at small businesses who are unwilling to bear costs associated with keeping cash registers. With several big brands such as Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF), Jos. A Bank (NASDAQ:JOSB), etc. integrating PayPal into their existing payment platforms, the future for PayPal, subject to an effective implementation of the technology, looks promising. In Q2 2013, RadioShack (NYSE:RSH) implemented PayPal’s point of sale options in a majority of its U.S. locations.Growth In Marketplaces BusinessThe marketplaces business continued to grow at a healthy pace in the first half of 2013, and the company attributes the strong performance to continued site improvements as well as growth in global e-commerce volume. We expect eBay to enable more than $200 billion in commerce volume in 2013, up from $175 billion in 2012. Going forward, the company can complement its efforts and maintain the momentum by better leveraging social networking platforms and expanding in emerging markets.Leveraging Social Networking SitesAlthough eBay has its own platform for goods transaction, it can leverage social and professional network platforms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter and LinkedIn (LNKD) to promote its marketplaces business. The company can use these sites as marketing channels to draw in more customers.Facebook, in particular, has demonstrated that its advertisements are highly targeted and offer attractive ROI (return on investment) to marketers. eBay will not only get more customers through Facebook, but there is also a good chance that these customers are more inclined towards buying online. In fact, eBay India gets 14% of its site traffic from Facebook. Additionally, LinkedIn can be used as an effective marketing tool to find merchants that can tie up with eBay to sell their products through its platform. In essence, the company can harness the power of social networking to boost its marketplaces ecosystem, especially as it expands in new markets. Expansion In Emerging Markets eBay’s marketplaces business will benefit from international expansion in BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries. Foreign retailers are showing interest in these regions due to an increasing market size, a growing number of aspirational buyers, rising personal income and the lack of organized retail penetration. The company officially launched its localized website in Russia in Q1 2013 and a full marketing campaign, which includes TV, was launched in Q2. In India, it lowered its fee to attract sellers and recently invested $50 million in Snapdeal.com, which is India’s largest online marketplace. The move coincided with Amazon’s launch of its Indian website and showcases the growing interest of online retailers toward the Indian market. Let’s take a look at what India can offer eBay.According to research conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in 2012, the retail market in India stands at over $350 billion and is growing at a healthy compounded annual growth rate (OTC:CAGR) of 15-20%. As far as the online retail market is concerned, it is still at a nascent stage but seems to have picked up significantly in the last couple of years. Consulting firm McKinsey expects India’s e-commerce market to grow at a rapid pace for the next few years amounting to $2 billion by 2015. [2] The firm also estimates that the country will have roughly 38 million active online shoppers by then. [2]Looking at the long-term potential and current growth in India’s e-commerce market, it appears that there may be enough room for several retailers, and competition shouldn’t be a big concern. eBay has had a presence in the Indian market for a while and already dominates the U.S. market when it comes to the marketplace model where it acts as a medium between individual buyers and sellers (including businesses).Our price estimate for eBay stands at $57, implying a premium of 10% to the market price.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
1584172,24491,2013-07-30T13:26:21-04:00,,"E-commerce giant and one of our Best Ideas Newsletter portfolio holdings eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) announced solid second-quarter results. Revenue jumped 14% year-over-year to $3.9 billion, roughly in-line with consensus expectations. Earnings were also in-line with consensus estimates, growing 13% year-over-year to $0.63 per share on a non-GAAP basis. Free cash flow for the quarter was wonderful at $658 million, approximately 17% of revenue. Enabled commerce volume, a metric specific to eBay, registered $51 billion, a 21% increase over the same period a year ago.Image Source: EBAY Q2 FY2013 Earnings PresentationPayPal continued to be a stellar performer for eBay, with payments revenue surging 21% year-over-year to $1.475 billion, driven largely by international growth, which totaled 51%. The firm is aggressively rolling out PayPal's point-of-sale (POS) capabilities in order to take market share, giving merchants huge transaction fees. This explains why total payment volume growth of 25% exceeded revenue growth. Take-rates, the percentage of value PayPal receives from a given transaction, remains relatively robust at 3.79%. This metric is sure to decline slightly as PayPal tries to become more competitive with the likes of Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA). Nevertheless, we're not too worried as long as volume growth remains robust.eBay's core marketplace business slowed slightly from the previous quarter with revenue expansion of 10% year-over-year to $2 billion - slightly below the 13% revenue growth achieved in the previous quarter and the 16% growth achieved in the fourth quarter of 2012. We think this is likely a secular issue, but eBay's move to change its fee structure also contributed to the slight underperformance relative to GMV growth (shown above). Management noted that some geographies were underperforming, particularly Europe. But, CEO John Donahoe had some positive commentary on the U.S., saying:""We came into the year feeling like the U.S. economy and e-commerce market was going to be solid. And I'd say it's performing probably at or maybe even a little bit better than we would have guessed.""We're pleased to see a CEO acknowledge the improving U.S. economy rather than blame it for all hardships. Although we anticipate other marketplaces to attempt to develop into competitors, eBay and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are still the best places on the Internet to get your products in front of consumers and the best place for consumers to find products they want. Donahoe added some very positive commentary on power sellers, saying:""Top rated sellers continue to deliver a great experience and outpace e-commerce growth, accounting for 45% of US GMV in Q2. Their same-store sales grew 22%.""Looking to the third quarter, eBay guided slightly below Street expectations of $3.97 billion of revenue and $0.65 per share of earnings, forecasting earnings of $0.61-$0.63 per share driven by revenue of $3.85-$3.95 billion. In our view, this small miss relative to consensus expectations by no means warrants the stark sell-off we saw in shares of the e-commerce giant. In fact, we'd hardly consider the guidance ""light"" at all.Our TakeAll things considered, we thought eBay's second-quarter performance was fantastic. We continue to believe shares of the e-commerce giant look undervalued, and we're holding onto our position in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter. Shares have increased 73% since we established our position.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1560712,50602,2013-07-22T04:52:38-04:00,,"On July 17, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported its most recent quarterly numbers to the public, and proceeded to get crushed in the next market session. The stock traded down more than 6% on an EPS number one cent below analyst expectations and guidance near the low range of their projections. This shareholder reaction to a very minimal earnings miss in an otherwise solid quarter shows a potential opportunity to step in and start a position in eBay.The company has a strong track record of growth in the past, both from an expanding online marketplace and a growing impact from PayPal and its extensions. eBay also has large insider ownership and upcoming catalysts that could help drive earnings and share prices up over the medium and long term. Buyers who have been looking for an entry point should take this opportunity to go long a popular tech stock that has more factors in its favor than its recent performance would suggest.OverviewTo get everyone on the same page, eBay is a global online marketplace established in 1995 that allows both buyers and sellers to meet and exchange products smoothly and efficiently. The company has expanded to enable online commerce in almost every country on the planet, with a huge variety of products. If you haven't heard of eBay, you've probably heard of PayPal, a subsidiary of eBay which allows individuals and businesses to quickly and securely send and receive payment online. PayPal currently accounts for 42% of eBay's revenue, with 132 million active users in 193 global markets. Growth in this area has been very strong for eBay, with total payment volume for PayPal coming in at $43 billion, up 25% from the same period in 2012. eBay also operates in other online markets, such as Shopping.com and StubHub, which provides event tickets. These business segments complement each other to progress eBay's strategy of providing a growing commerce experience to customers around the world and make global transactions easier for both people and businesses.ManagementeBay is currently led by CEO John Donahoe, who has held this position since March of 2008. Donahoe has an extensive resume, with a degree in economics from Dartmouth and an MBA from Stanford Business School. After college, Donahoe became successful through Bain & Company, rising from an associate consultant to become the firm's President and CEO in 1999. In 2005, Donahoe joined eBay as the President of eBay MarketPlaces, where he was in charge of growing the company's core business segments. During his time in this division, Donahoe oversaw the acquisitions of both Shopping.com and Stubhub, which contributed greatly to eBay's overall success and outreach and saw the Marketplaces division's revenue double in three years. In 2008, Donahoe took over as CEO and has since led the company through many challenges, including the financial crisis and Great Recession thereafter. Donahoe's experience from his time at Bain and at eBay shows his knowledge of the company's strategy and his ability to drive growth, which should bring steady gains for shareholders in the months and years to come.Insider OwnershipOne of eBay's strengths as an attractive investment is the number of shares owned by eBay executives and employees. High insider ownership in a company is a very bullish sign because it shows that the people who are responsible for the company's success have a vested interest in the performance of the stock. eBay's insider ownership currently stands at over 10% of the company, which means that insider interest is very similar to the interest of shareholders. CEO John Donahoe alone has over 511,000 shares in the company, which amounts to over $26 million of his own wealth riding on the success of eBay. On July 18th, eBay's 6% drop meant that Donahoe incurred a loss of $1.6 million, something worth noticing. If the CEO's large stake in his own success doesn't contribute to the company's performance, I don't know what will. Investors should feel comfortable in the fact that if they have a bad day and lose money in eBay, management does too.Another pattern that should impress buyers is the steady rise in insider buying over the past few months:Since March of this year, net insider ownership has increased by almost $65 million at current prices. When insiders are buying their own stock, so should other investors, because company employees know the future of their success better than others do, and are willing to put their money where their work is, so to speak.CatalystsLooking forward in eBay's future, there are a couple factors that can contribute greatly to the company's bottom line. The largest potential growth opportunity for eBay is its alliance with Discover (NYSE:DFS) to provide PayPal services to thousands of small businesses nationally. By the end of 2013, eBay expects PayPal to be accepted as a form of payment in over 2 million stores through their partnership. This will increase PayPal's store presence by a factor of eight by the end of the year, which could mean an explosion of growth in cash flows coming from the increased traffic in physical commerce, not just online transactions. This partnership shows that PayPal is tightening its grip and expanding its reach into mobile payments with businesses and customers, which will provide a larger and larger income stream for eBay's balance sheet.At current levels, eBay trades at 26 times earnings, which means that investors are valuing the company's strong growth at a healthy level and are willing to pay up for a fast grower such as eBay. In its earnings call, eBay reported that the company expects EPS to be anywhere from $2.70 - $2.75 a share. At current multiples, this puts eBay's year end price at around $70 a share, 33% higher from where it stands now. This means that the growth investors are valuing is still very real, and could boost the share price tremendously going into the second half of 2013.ConclusionAs the United States economy starts to steadily show signs of progress, consumers and businesses will start to venture out and spend more money. eBay has positioned itself to benefit greatly from this surge in transactions, and has enabled people to buy and sell faster and easier than ever. This advantage will help the company secure more customers and partners to raise its profits and its share price. The drop on July 18th was a momentary hiccup, one that should be met with enthusiasm, not panic. Buyers can now pick up a fast growing company at a reduced price and can see the outsized returns over the coming months. Investors will see the extraordinary growth of both eBay's online marketplace and PayPal's financial service and pay up to have a piece of the success. With management motivated to succeed and an eager customer base willing to use its services, eBay has a bright future ahead.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in EBAY over the next 72 hours.

1515822,50662,2013-06-22T08:30:00-04:00,,"IntroductioneBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) probably doesn't need to be introduced anymore to investors, as the name is a 'household name' in lots of investors' portfolios.As probably the largest internet auction company, the company is very well known all over the world and enjoys a dominant position in the internet auction sector. eBay's revenue increased by almost 54% in just two years as total revenue in 2012 came in at $14.1B, versus $9.2B in 2010. eBay expects to continue to grow and has provided a revenue guidance of $16B for 2013.In this article, I'll briefly look back at the 2012 and Q1 2013 numbers, after which I'll focus on the longer-term outlook for the company, which will lead to my conclusion and investment thesis.The 2012 financial numbersFor the entire year 2012, eBay posted a net profit of $2.61B on a revenues of $14.1B. The profit was a bit down from 2011, when the company made $3.3B in profit on $11.55B in revenues, but if you look at the non-GAAP numbers, the 2012 profit was almost 20% higher than the 2011 profit.Although the company is currently trading at around 26 times the 2012 GAAP profit, it's still relatively decently priced, as eBay is one of the best examples of a growth company on the market.Free cash flow in 2012 was approximately $2.6B from $3.8B generated operational cash flow, which is a pretty good result.The Q1 2013 financial updateAfter releasing the FY 2012 numbers, eBay announced it expected net revenues of $3.6-3.75B and GAAP profit estimate of between $0.48 and $0.50/share for the first quarter. eBay's guidance was­ right on, as the company released results on the upper side of the guidance, announcing $3.75B in revenue and a $0.51/share profit. eBay also reiterated its FY 2013 profit guidance of $2.23-2.29/ share.At a current share price of $50.74, eBay is trading at approximately 22 times the estimated profit for 2013. Whilst this might sound expensive, eBay is a cash flow growth stock, so let's have a look at the longer- term outlook for the company.OutlookThe company continues to be the mobile payment leader as PayPal handled almost $14B in payment volume in 2012, and this number is expected to increase by 40% to $20B this year. A year-on-year growth of 40% would be an exceptional achievement, and it shows how important PayPal is for eBay as a whole.As we noticed in the financial statements of the previous years and Q1, the net margins are increasing and according to analyst expectations, they'll continue to do so. This table provides a schematic overview of the net profit margins from 2010 on towards 2015.eBay might look expensive based on the 2013 Price/Earnings ratio, but as the profit margins will improve, this company is something for investors with a longer investment horizon. The following table gives the analyst expectations for the next five years.The company currently keeps all accumulated earnings on its balance sheet, but I expect we will see a policy change within the next few years. As eBay will make a profit of roughly $5B in 2016 with an extremely robust balance sheet, I wouldn't be surprised if the management will return more cash to its shareholders. If eBay would pay out 50% of the NPAT as a dividend and use 25% for further share buybacks, the dividend per share from 2016 on might be close to $2, which would result in a 4% dividend yield.As I expect the company to continue (and increase) its share buybacks, this number should go up year after year as not only will the profit increase, it'll also have to be divided over fewer shares which has an incremental effect on the dividend payout per share.Investment thesis and strategyIn conclusion, eBay is an interesting company for people with a 5yr+ horizon, as I've got the impression this cash flow machine will continue to reward its shareholders. As I'm also aiming for a dividend later on, eBay might be a good investment for people who are looking for a growth stock which will distribute a part of its income amongst its shareholders.I'm usually not very keen on buying companies with a double-digit price/earnings ratio, but eBay will be an exception. I am planning on buying the stock and writing put options. At this moment, Put 40's with an expiration date in January 2014 have a premium of $1.37/share, so if eBay is trading below $40/share by January 2014, I'll very likely be forced to buy the shares at an average price of $40-41.37 or $38.73/ share. If the share price is trading above $40/share, I can keep the option premium but will obviously not be assigned shares.eBay isn't cheap right now, but every investor should keep the company on his/her watch list to dip their toes in when the markets are weak.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in EBAY over the next 72 hours.

The global technology company enables commerce through three segments; marketplaces, payments and GSI. eBay provides online platforms, tools and services to enable individuals, along with small and medium business merchants around the world to engage in online and mobile commerce and payments. In 2002, Paypal became a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay which now facilitates easy payments and has become the backbone of eBay's success.Whilst many believe eBay sits in Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) shadow, these two companies should not be compared like for like. eBay has an uncanny ability to trump the market and aid consumers with innovative business ideas such as Gift Finder and Item Locator. This has helped develop and expand business operations to achieve consistent double digit growth, while looking forward to capture further market share as e-commerce evolves.Source: eBay Earnings ReportRevenue has continued to expand, and 2013 Q1 year on year growth was 14%, which was helped by increasing penetration into mobile driven e-commerce. Paypal has been key to the growth of mobile driven revenue as it offers an easy and secure payment system. The number of global active accounts and users has also increased, again in the double digits, and this is not only due to the mobile driven market place, but expansion into emerging markets.The website and mobile platform are very adaptable, as such provide a wide market for the company to expand into. Now, over a quarter of revenue is generated outside of eBay's three largest markets; the US, UK and Germany. This number is sure to expand and the relatively low infrastructure spending needed to launch this platform in another country will allow eBay to maintain the double digit growth rate going forward.From a recent survey by Jana, a specialist research firm that looks into how mobile technology is transforming emerging markets, eBay was the only company that scored in the top 5 out of all countries polled. This is encouraging and highlights how their platform is accepted and is fast becoming an e-commerce powerhouse. Scoring second in India, is a great sign for eBay investors, with a population 4 times the size of the US, this could become a very profitable avenue going forward, especially when Amazon has failed to crack this fast growing consumer driven market.Source: wired.comThe global e-commerce marketplace is expected to reach $1.5trn by 2015, and eBay's innovative business developments leave them in a prime place to capitalize on this ever expanding sector.Capital expenditure is relatively low compared to the likes of Amazon, and with good profit margins, free cash flow shows the success and profitability of eBay. This provides a nice cushion for further investment into marketing and product development to facilitate expansion.The share price is currently trading around $54 and at this level still offers a brilliant long term investment. Year to date it has returned a fairly modest 6%, however it has seen steady growth in the share price since 2008, and returned over 35% last year.Source: Google FinanceMany would look at the price of eBay and think it is fairly expensive relative to the S&P 500 average, however it is hard to quantify value when companies are in their growth phase and are yet to reach market saturation. That said, eBay has a P/E currently of 26 (nothing compared to Amazon at 85), and a forward P/E of 16.75. As double digit EPS growth looks to continue, the share price has great potential to exceed $65 this year and continue upwards. Out of the 55 brokers that cover eBay, the lowest share price recommendation is $55, and the highest is $75.What makes this company so attractive is their ability to generate a strong free cash flow, which is core for a successful and growing businesses. Strong Free cash flow is an integral part of stable businesses and will enable the company to reward shareholders further down the line when growth becomes less of a priority.SummaryeBay's consistent double digit revenue growth and innovative business development and platforms put them well placed to capitalise on the growing sector and the rise of emerging market consumer demand. Their cash generative business and low CAPEX will allow them to penetrate new markets easily and maintain growth. So for those investors looking for growth over the long term, eBay is a powerhouse and should reward shareholders handsomely going forward.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1406731,35611,2013-05-06T16:05:25-04:00,,"In today's rapidly changing business and technology world, a company can redefine itself and take a different identity if you don't pay much attention to it for a while.Take the case of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Yes, it still runs an online auction service where people can buy and sell old baseball cards, used cars and assorted oddities. But as Fortune magazine referred to eBay in an article in its February 25, edition, the company is now ""... a full-service e-commerce operation that helps big retailers such as Home Depot... and hundreds of others navigate the complex world of mobile payments, online comparison shopping and same-day delivery.""The company takes its new identity a step further by no longer thinking of itself as just an e-commerce enterprise, but as a global commerce leader, without the e-.Among its assets is PayPal, which enables users to send and receive digital payments; and GSI, which facilitates e-commerce, multichannel retailing and digital marketing for global enterprises. The company also reaches millions through specialized marketplaces such as StubHub, the world's largest ticket marketplace, and eBay classifieds.Aggressive Growth StrategyeBay recently outlined a three-year aggressive growth strategy based on its belief that mobile technology is leading a ""commerce revolution"" that will create significantly different consumer and retail experiences worldwide. What differentiates its plan from the plans of some other companies is that eBay has a reputation for execution. The details of its plan include:While eBay's management instills confidence that it can reach these aggressive targets, it is by no means a foregone conclusion. First, there is the unknown about how an Internet sales tax provision being proposed in Washington, and which eBay is combating, would impact its business. Second, there is no guarantee that the economy will grow enough to make these plans occur. Finally, eBay will meet strong resistance from equally well-managed companies like Amazon and Google.Robust Shareholder ReturnsAt the present time, eBay has been rewarding investors for the past year, climbing from $38 to a recent 52-week high of $58. Since its earnings announcement on April 17, in which its guidance for upcoming quarters somewhat disappointed analysts and investors, shares have fallen to about $52. The stock is selling at a price-to-earnings ratio of 25.7.In that earnings release, the company is forecasting second-quarter revenue of $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion. While that would constitute a 13.3% increase from the second quarter of 2012, consensus analyst expectations were for quarterly revenue to hit $3.95 billion. More importantly, its expectation of generating earnings per share of $0.46 to $0.48 on a non-GAAP basis was well short of the $0.57 estimate by analysts.Solid First-Quarter NumbersFor the first quarter of 2013, eBay's revenue increased 14% to $3.7 billion, compared with the same period of 2012. The company reported first-quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $677 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income of $829 million, or $0.63 per diluted share. The year-over-year increase in first-quarter GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was driven primarily by strong top-line growth.Downloads of eBay's suite of mobile apps expanded the company's overall commerce footprint, surpassing 162 million since launch in the third quarter of 2008. eBay gained approximately 2.8 million new customers in the period through mobile, driving double-digit growth in active users at both PayPal and Marketplaces.The company's PayPal business delivered strong first-quarter performance with revenue increasing 18% to $1.5 billion. PayPal gained 5 million active registered accounts in the period and ended the quarter with 128 million, a 16% increase.The company's Marketplaces business also delivered strong first-quarter performance with revenue increasing 13% to $2.0 billion. Marketplaces gained 3.9 million active users in the period and ended the quarter with 116 million, a 13% increase.GAAP operating margin increased to 21.3% for the first quarter of 2013, compared with 19.9% for the same period last year, and eBay generated $937 million of operating cash flow and $638 million of free cash flow during the first quarter of 2013.eBay's asset base almost doubled from 2011 to 2012, from $12.66 billion to $21.4 billion, which included an increase in cash and equivalents from $4.69 billion to $6.82 billion. At the same time, the company has recently taken on a larger amount of debt, from $1.53 billion in 2011, to $4.11 billion at the end of last year.It's little wonder that of the company's 38 analysts listed on Reuters, only eight rate the stock as a hold, while 16 have it listed as a strong buy and the remaining 14 rate it a buy.eBay's business continues to show all signs of improvement. It would seem that eBay has taken all the necessary measures to grow. It has augmented its auction business with a regular online store similar to Amazon. It is attracting big name buyers and sellers. It has improved its technology, navigation and fulfillment services in the process.And you can still find a watercolor portrait of a frog in bamboo for $50.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: This article was written by an analyst at Catalyst Investments.Disclaimer: Catalyst Investments is not a  registered investment advisor or broker/dealer.

1510162,50592,2013-06-19T10:16:34-04:00,,"I recently wrote an article discussing Jim Cramer's recommendation of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock in his Mad Money Lightening round program, but wanted to further discuss my analysis.eBay is one of the leaders in online commerce, in respect to both eBay's online marketplace, and the PayPal.com payment processing system. eBay also made an acquisition of GSI Commerce, which helps brick and mortar businesses run their online storefronts. The company has been pursuing growth in many different areas, including new ways to pay in retail stores using PayPal, and more.CatalystseBay is making significant strides in acquisitions, innovation, and smart investments. Recently eBay has poured $50 million in SnapDeal.com, which is India's newest online marketplace. With India's significant economic and population growth, this could be a great investment for eBay. As part of the deal, eBay will also get access to its registered users, as well as software and distribution networks used by SnapDeal.Another major potential winner for eBay is its PayPal system's mobile growth. Mobile payments should see significant increase in usage, as more users are shopping on their phones and tablets. This also opens up opportunities for in-store purchases using your mobile phone as a ""virtual wallet,"" and makes currency exchanges while traveling much easier.Growth on existing business models is also doing well. PayPal is expected to grow at 22% annually, GSI Commerce is expecting growth of 14%, and eBay's marketplace is expecting growth of 14%.As stated in my previous article, eBay does trade at a fairly large multiple of around 25, but is trading at about 1.4 times its growth rate.ConclusionIn conclusion, I think eBay is a fantastic company, which is run extremely well and has a history of performing well for its shareholders. At current levels, eBay is fairly valued. The stock is up about 12% since this time last year, but I think it has a lot more room to grow. The median 12-month price target is around $64, which is a return of 21%. Any purchases made at or under $50 should perform well over the next year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1377771,48441,2013-04-26T16:50:29-04:00,,"Right or wrong, eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) quarterly results are often used as a barometer for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) results. While Amazon is a more diversified company, both companies rely heavily on the business model of matching buyer and seller without actually purchasing inventory. Further, the collision course between eBay and Amazon has been well documented, especially as it relates to eBay's attempts to poach Amazon 3P sellers. Do these similarities actually show up in results?Comparing Quarterly GrowthLooking back 14 quarters (prior to the latest Q1 results), there does not appear to be a strong correlation between the two companies. A ""best fit"" line is flat and the goodness of fit measure (R2) nonexistent. This is largely a result of the 2009/2010 period when eBay was sputtering along with negative to positive single-digit growth while Amazon was humming along with growth in the 20-40% range.Comparing the six quarters leading up to Q1 results looks a bit different, however. Visually, there is a more defined relationship between quarterly revenue growth rates and the R2 measure rises to a more respectable level.If you forecast Amazon's Q1 sales growth based on eBay's 14% Q1 growth rate, Amazon's rate would be ~23% - a reversal in the declining growth of the prior six quarters. (Acknowledged that this is only six observations and other caveats are included below.) Sure enough, Amazon announced Q1 net sales growth of 22%; 24% without the foreign exchange rate impact.The Nitty GrittyIf you regress Amazon's growth rate on eBay's, you get a line equation of: y = .74% * x + 13%. Evoking grade school math, a line equation is y = m*x + bAn intercept of 13 in the above equation means Amazon's growth rate would be 13% if eBay's was 0%; the slope of .74% means that Amazon's growth rate increases by .74% for every 1.00% increase in eBay's growth rate. eBay reported a 14% growth rate, so that would add ~10 percentage points to Amazon's base growth rate of 13%... equating to a predicted growth of ~23%.Original equation:Y = .74% * x + 13%Equation with eBay's growth rate of 14% plugged in:23% = .74% * 14% + 13%The CaveatsOf course, there is a range of confidence with any prediction. Just because the prediction was right in line with actuals this quarter doesn't mean the same will be true next quarter.Technically speaking, the R2 number of .63 is the percentage of variability in Amazon's growth explained by eBay's growth, which is a loose testament to the notion that many things already impact eBay and Amazon differently. In addition, the 95% confidence range of the slope coefficient is -.04% to +1.52%. In other words, the degree to which Amazon's growth rate moves with eBay's could vary between those two values at the 95% confidence level.ConclusionThough topline is an important part of the equation, Amazon is probably less focused on the growth rate than investors. The company seems to be satisfied with being able to kick off enough operating cash flow to fund its capex requirements for the time being. After all, Jeff Bezos's favorite financial metric is free cash flow and the company is very clear that its goal is to 'optimize' free cash flow - a subtle difference from 'maximizing' free cash flow.From the long-term investor standpoint, though an interesting stock to follow, I'm staying on the sidelines due to the unknowns around when it will stop trading on emotion and start trading on fundamentals.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1499072,35191,2013-06-13T05:41:24-04:00,,"We are all aware of the obvious consumer trend that has been around for years now. Mobile has been a dominating factor in many different aspects. Whether it be finance sites, technology blogs or holiday gifts, smartphones and tablets have been (and remain) a huge topic. That's no surprise considering the incredible capability they have and their tremendous growth.There are a lot of companies that will benefit from the continued flow into mobile -- and there a lot of companies that will not as well! While some may benefit more than others, one name that I think will do really well is eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). I wrote about eBay earlier this week and why I think the recent selloff is an opportunity for long-term investors.eBay is more than just an online marketplace like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon has done an incredible job of expanding its business segments, digital media content and brand awareness. However, eBay has strolled down a different path. Instead of focusing on streaming music and video (which is also gaining a lot of steam), it chose to stick with what it knew: Online auctioning.However, the one wild card eBay holds comes from 2002, when it acquired PayPal. The business segment now accounts for over one-third of eBay's revenues and is the fastest growing part of its business. The Marketplace segment accounts for roughly the other two-thirds of eBay's revenues and by 2015, the company expects PayPal to match those numbers.This means that each segment will account for about half of the company's revenues. PayPal is the reason that eBay has a chance on mobile, but the Marketplace just makes it a bit easier. The Marketplace still faces stiff competition from Amazon, which has made it extremely simple to make purchases and have them quickly shipped to consumers' desired location. Amazon Prime makes this task even easier.And don't get me wrong, I'm not taking anything away from Amazon. Although the valuation seems extremely steep, it's a different situation than that of eBay. While both companies thrive with their own online market, the addition of PayPal has not only left the market in place, but allows eBay to profit from the transactions as well. It would be as if Amazon owned the credit card company that was used to pay for items off the site.PayPal finds room as the middleman, by becoming the facilitator of online transactions and transfers. Now eBay doesn't have to sell anything from their site or mobile app, as long as the consumer is using PayPal to pay for whatever it is they're purchasing -- although buying something off of eBay using PayPal certainly helps!PayPal will see most of its competition from a couple of different players. Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) new Gmail Wallet feature might seem threatening at first, but so far has not been able to gain traction. Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) also compete with PayPal, but more so on the physical front of payments, (for example, with credit cards).There will likely be increased pressure from all three of these different sources. Google certainly has the user base to roll out a plan that many could quickly adapt to. However, when so many people already use PayPal for simple (and often times free) money transfers between one another or to easily and securely pay for something that directly links to their credit card or bank account, why would they want to switch?After all, it's the seller that pays the fees on PayPal, not the buyer. So again, I must ask, what will compel consumers who are happily using PayPal for online purchases to stop? Just like how more consumers are switching to plastic instead of using cash or check, online payments and money transfers are becoming more and more prevalent in today's world.There's no reason to think that should slow down either. PayPal already has 128 million active users and that bodes well for the company, as this number is expected to increase going forward. It's not just buying something on eBay and paying for it with PayPal. Small business can accept credit cards through PayPal's card reader and send out invoices via email. Parents can transfer money to their kids in college and friends can pay each other back with a few flicks of the thumb on their smartphone.CEO John Donahoe recently emphasized the importance of mobile and continued innovation at eBay. He stressed that the company would continue to pour money into these initiatives so that they would constantly be ahead of the curve on both the competition and consumer front. Below are some excerpts from the 2013 annual shareholder meeting pertaining to this:I highlighted these comments, as well as several others, in my article that's referenced above. But the purpose isn't to be redundant. It's to show that eBay is actually focused on innovation. They have been saying this -- rather, screaming from a mountaintop -- for quite some time. It's not as if eBay simply missed the boat and are trying to play catch up. No, they are the boat. Here's some more insight from the 2013 first quarter conference call:Based on what's above, we can assess that PayPal is beginning to do more and more of its business through mobile. Of the 5 million users that were added in the first quarter, nearly 3 million of them came via mobile signups. In other words, nearly 60% of new signups did so through their smartphone or tablet.So given that Donahoe told investors the company was investing heavily in mobile and doing so early, one would estimate that this is going to be a very important business segment for eBay going forward. As a shareholder I am looking forward to see how eBay can continuously stay ahead of the pack and continue to grow their PayPal and mobile segments of their business.I think the current share price of eBay offers a nice entry for long-term investors. As of Wednesday, eBay closed for trading at $50.75. I think that shares may work their way lower ahead of the next earnings report, which is on July 17th. eBay may also continue lower if the general market continues to correct.I believe that below $50 per share eBay offers a reasonable entry for long-term growth investors. With revenue growth estimated to increase by 60% by 2015, (this was mentioned by Donahoe in the shareholders meeting), I think it's incredibly reasonable to pay today's prices for a piece of the pie. Keep in mind that a poor report in July could further hurt the stock.Note: eBay provided guidance slightly below analysts' expectations for the second quarter, during its first quarter conference call. Fiscal year estimates remained unchanged and in-line with analysts' expectations.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1492102,35191,2013-06-10T15:33:21-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) share prices continue to take a beating and many investors aren't sure why. Along with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay is one of the web's largest online shopping networks. It's still experiencing strong growth, both from its Marketplace and from the PayPal division. So where's the love from shareholders?On Wednesday's session, we saw eBay dive straight through its 200-day simple moving average. Although this is typically seen as support, we saw that it certainly did not hold up. Without terrible guidance (second quarter estimates were a little sub-par, but not horrid), bad earnings report, or awful PR stunt, it's hard to imagine what could push the stock down this hard.eBay has largely under-participated in the strong rally in equities this year and it's beginning to puzzle investors, including myself. It could be that investors are worried about Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) new Gmail money transferring system. While PayPal is a huge part of eBay's business model, (about one-third of revenues), it's somewhat unlikely that the stock would sell off this hard on this news.Then again, it could be worrisome, no? If you were running a local business and a new competitor moved in with the possibility of eliminating 33% of your business's revenue, there is no doubt you would be quite worried.But the truth is, no matter how great the new Google Gmail product is, it won't totally derail PayPal's role in online transfers and payments. I'm not saying that it couldn't take significant market share -- which I do doubt -- I'm just saying that it won't eliminate PayPal's large market presence.(Click to enlarge)So every investor is probably asking themselves, why such a sell-off? Even on Friday, with a steady rally in the broader indices from the mediocre nonfarm payrolls report, eBay actually closed in the red, down 13 basis points. eBay is up approximately 2% year-to-date compared to the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY), which is up over 15%.Are investors becoming worried by increased pressure from MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V)? Perhaps. While Visa was able to capitalize better than MasterCard last quarter, which was apparent during the earnings reports, I still think PayPal has a unique and different approach to online payment.Even so, eBay has begun to make the push into storefronts and now features a new window shopping experience. In times of uncertainty, I like to turn to management. As you will read below, the company is very focused on long-term growth and staying ahead of the curve by investing heavily in mobile. Here are some snippets of what CEO John Donahoe had to say during the recent annual shareholders meeting in April:Also, Donahoe mentioned on the call that that the company expects to see revenues between $21.5 billion and $23.5 billion in 2015. In 2012, eBay had revenues of $14 billion. If we take the middle of that estimate ($22.5 billion), investors are looking at revenue growth of about 60%.60% is pretty darn good if Donahoe's forecast is correct. It's clear that eBay is not going to be -- or at least try not to be -- one of the companies that falls behind the next trend and fails to ever catch up. It is doing its absolute best to stay at the forefront of the leading consumer trends and as Donahoe said, ""our company is investing heavily.""So What Do We Do?eBay failed to close above its 200-day simple moving average and the price action is looking a little bearish. For short-term bulls, this is not good. But for long-term bulls, this could be a great entry. While the time eBay has spent this year in the lower-$50 range has proved rewarding, we may see the stock trade down into the upper- to mid-$40's.It's especially likely that eBay will trade down ahead of its second quarter earnings report, since they guided below estimates for both earnings per share and revenue. Analysts expected $0.66 per share on revenues of $3.95 billion. eBay guided slightly below that, with an EPS in the range $0.61 - $0.63 on revenues of $3.8B - $3.9B.While it is unfortunate, the pain is likely temporary for bulls. The full year guidance remained unchanged and eBay doesn't think the lower numbers will be something to worry about going forward.I am actively looking to add to eBay on dips below $50 and will likely add on a sharp sell-off after earnings, pending the conference call and the results. Second quarter earnings are scheduled for July 17th.Disclosure: I am long EBAY, V, MA. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1466781,48641,2013-05-29T09:53:02-04:00,,"Some investors may be wondering if eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is as safe as bet as it seems, following the stock price's decline from a 52-week high of $57 in February 13 to its current level of $54.64, a 4% decrease. Is this a negative sign for the online e-commerce company?eBay FundamentalsThe release of eBay's first quarter 2013 results in April highlighted what will surely be the future of the company, which will be in mobile payment solutions. PayPal, eBay's payment solution subsidiary, added some five million active accounts from all over the world during the first quarter, bringing the total number of users to 125 million, and generated revenues of $1.5 billion, an 18% increase. Its marketplace customers, meanwhile, grew by nearly four million to 116 million users. The increasing use of PayPal by consumers and merchants both on the eBay site and offline drove net total payment volume to $41 billion, a 21% increase. The share of PayPal to eBay's total revenue was 41%, a figure that is expected to rise further in the future.But eBay's core businesses also saw growth during the quarter. Revenues increased to $3.8 billion, or a 15% increase from the $3.3 billion reported in the same quarter last year, while profits grew to $829 million for the period, a nearly 28% increase. Earnings per share grew by 14% to $0.63 from $0.55 in the same period last year. However, revenues missed analysts' estimates slightly by $20 million. It is worth noting that the company is gradually moving away from auctions to fixed price transactions as the value of goods sold through Marketplace increased 13 percent.Domestically, eBay hopes to increase its active user base by allowing third-party sellers to list their products for free on the site and then pay the site a flat sales fee on the final sales price of the item sold. Possibly as a result of this strategy, the company was able to increase the base by 3.9 million new users. As part of its medium-term goals, eBay hopes to reach $300 billion in sales and payments processed through PayPal by 2015.There was some slight bad news in that eBay's second quarter guidance failed to live up to analysts' expectations. Its Q2 2013 guidance estimated revenue at $3.9 billion and EPS of $0.61-$0.63, which were lower than analysts' forecast of $3.95 billion revenue and $0.66 EPH. This caused stock prices to drag down slightly, despite the fact that guidance for the full year 2013 remained unchanged.eBay Future InitiativesEBay is also looking to the future with a whole range of innovative initiatives designed to win market share and strengthen its position in the market. For example, the e-commerce site expected to handle more transactions through mobile devices in the coming years. For 2012, for example, some 4.3 users were introduced to eBay through mobile devices, while eBay mobile transactions reached $13 billion during the year, more than double that recorded in 2011. PayPal, meanwhile, processed close to $14 billion in mobile payments last year, which was almost triple that of 2011. For 2013, eBay and PayPal are expected to handle over $20 billion each in mobile transactions, or a total of $40 billion. The mobile market is a rich one for the company, since consumers are more likely to make impulse purchases online on their smartphones or tablets, since they are always carrying them around.Mobile devices also provided eBay with a way of penetrating into new emerging markets, as well as those in the so-called BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India and China). Cross-border transactions currently make up some 20% of eBay's business, although the company has not done anything to actively court it. EBay's English language site is also the largest e-commerce player in Russia. In the coming years, eBay is exploring ways to make shipping to international destinations easier in order to increase its cross-border transactions.PayPal is also exploring ways to expand overseas. At present, for example, close to 3,000 Japanese retailers are using PayPal Here, a mobile credit card-reading device, to accept payments. The payment solution has also been included as one of the features of Korean brand LG's smart TV platform, which is available in North America and the UK. In addition, the payment solution wants to increase its offline presence, so that customers of brick-and-mortar stores can also use PayPal to make transactions. It has already entered into an agreement with credit-card issuer Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) that would allow Discover's network of over seven million merchants to accept PayPal. In addition, PayPal also has agreements with sixteen national merchants, including Home Depot and Barnes & Noble, to implement an in-store service that would allow customers to pay for their purchases by typing in a PIN and entering a phone number on payment terminals, rather than having to swipe a card.The Bottom LineThere really is no reason why you should not buy into eBay now, given how solid its fundamentals are. And it still has a huge potential to grow its business, as there are still many unexplored markets that it can penetrate. The only real concern about the company is that it may have trouble keeping up the pace of its growth. But if it can do that, and there is no reason to believe that it can't, then eBay would make a great addition to your long-term portfolio.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1477701,47651,2013-06-03T15:43:43-04:00,,"In 2002, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, a ""modest"" 15 percent premium based on Paypal's July 2002 stock price. At the time, PayPal was used primarily as a means for eBay buyers and sellers to exchange funds for online auctions. Still, the service accounted for only 25 percent of eBay's closed auction payments.Fast-forward 11 years, and PayPal has become a global e-commerce payments provider, allowing more than 128 million active users to do business with hundreds of online merchants outside of eBay. In 2012, the service accounted for $175 billion in commerce. And here's the kicker: Remember the $1.5 billion price eBay paid for PayPal? Well, revenue from PayPal matched that figure in Q1 2013 alone.Now, Paypal is expanding its presence in the offline marketplace, as well. On April 19, PayPal's partnership with Discover (NYSE:DFS) officially kicked in, meaning that by the end of the year, PayPal users will be able to pay with a PayPal card, via mobile device, by check-in or by entering a phone number and a PIN at roughly 2 million stores currently accepting Discover.These retailers currently include Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF), Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Foot Locker (NYSE:FL), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and J.C. Penney (JCP), among others. Last month, PayPal announced a partnership with RadioShack (NYSE:RSH) that brought Paypal into all 7,000-plus of the retailer's stores. And by the end of the year, additional merchants such as Burger King (BKW), Sephora and Brookstone will be accepting PayPal in stores.PayPal's agreement with Discover is significant not only for the impact of the retailers immediately added to the PayPal network, but also for the benefit of the clout Discover has with more than 1,500 of the largest retailers in the U.S. Discover has been negotiating with these retailers to accept PayPal, and recently signed Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) to accept PayPal in-store payments.It also appears that Discover and PayPal are aiming high by negotiating with big-box chains such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). However, a Wal-Mart spokesman recently told Reuters, ""The added complexity at the point of sale does not justify acceptance of PayPal."" However, Wal-Mart has previously shown willingness to work with PayPal by accepting it as a form of payment on walmart.com. If the stumbling block is ease of use at checkout, as the Wal-Mart spokesman claims, expect PayPal and Discover to work on making PayPal checkout more streamlined and user-friendly to satisfy high volume retailers like Wal-Mart.eBay certainly appears to be optimistic about the prospect of PayPal's growth. Last month, PayPal opened a new data center, increasing its IT capacity by one-third to support its growing business. At least one analyst, Gil Luria of Wedbush Securities, saw the move as a sign of optimism for things to come: ""PayPal could stretch their existing IT capacity or rent extra capacity, but they have the confidence to build a whole new data center.""And PayPal president David Marcus announced the company will increase marketing later this year to support its move into physical stores. However, Marcus also noted the potential issue of convincing consumers to abandon their decades-old habit of swiping a credit or debit card to pay for a retail transaction. To that end, PayPal recently revealed the results of a survey of debit or credit card holders across five countries. An overwhelming majority (83 percent) of respondents said they wished they didn't have to carry a wallet; 29 percent of Americans surveyed said they would choose a smartphone over a wallet if they could only choose one item to take with them when they go out. And more than two-thirds (68 percent) of American respondents said they have been in a situation where they couldn't pay for something because they didn't have cash on them.ValuationeBay currently trades at $54.10, based on the 5/31 closing price. The trailing P/E is 26.26, which might seem high, but is comparable to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which trades at 26.07 times earnings, and relatively modest compared to Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK), which trades at a 31.57 P/E.Analysts expect eBay to earn $3.23 per share next year, which amounts to a very attractive 16.75 forward P/E. The company is also expected to grow earnings at an annual 15 percent clip over the next five years. Assuming an average P/E in the range of 16, that would put eBay's value around $90 by 2018, a 66 percent gain on the current price.ConclusioneBay and PayPal have been at the forefront of e-commerce payments and the mobile e-commerce revolution. As I've stated before, I believe the growth we've seen in PayPal thus far is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg.PayPal's foray into offline payments in retail stores might not work out in the long run. But its history of growth and innovation, along with its 128 million strong user base gives the company a distinct advantage over any of its current online competitors.Disclosure: I am long EBAY.

1370301,48311,2013-04-25T09:34:29-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) owns the payment processor PayPal. PayPal (40% of eBay's 2012 revenue) is a popular payment method or e-wallet. It's also very well positioned to become the dominant payment processor in the global e-commerce industry and what is even more important: the global mobile shopping payment processor. That does not just entail online shopping done from your phone; it includes shopping in the high street or in restaurants, using your mobile device to pay.Image credit: Q1 Results eBay's BlogBusinesseBay essentially consists of three separate main businesses. The auction and marketplace business, the GSI business and the e-wallet business. The marketplace business has been instrumental in getting PayPal at the key strategic position it is in right now.There are still advantages to this alliance for both parties, but in my opinion it's not impossible PayPal will be sold in the future, at a point in time that does not pose a strategic threat to either business. Skype has been sold by eBay in the past, although it clearly does not have the same relationship to the core business as the e-wallet. Don't expect this to happen in the next five years, though.Over the first quarter, sales in the marketplaces division rose 13 percent to $1.96 billion. According to Bloomberg, CEO John Donahoe has been whipping that segment back into shape, which brought in 54% of 2012 sales.At PayPal, revenue rose to $1.55 billion in the first quarter. The unit gained 5 million registered users, bringing the total to 128 million. Total value of all transactions processed, rose 21 percent to $41 billion. Q1 2013 Financial highlights can be found here.The GSI business is a business-to-business service provider that was acquired in 2011. GSI is the leading provider of e-commerce and interactive marketing services to enterprise clients (including big name brands). It's not very large in terms of sales compared to the other pillars but it could turn out to be an interesting strategic acquisition. Let me return to that subject in a moment.MarketOver half of eBay's revenue comes from abroad since 2010. They do face headwinds in Europe, with consumer spending down on the continent, but even so, foreign markets are very important to eBay.eBay serves markets globally, but there is still a lot of room for growth. They move carefully but deliberately and try to keep solid margins up while materializing growth.Relatively recently they have started moving into the BRICs. Revenue coming from these countries might not always be attributed to international business on their earnings reports. At the first stages of entering a market, eBay focuses on import, and because consumers from newly penetrated markets sometimes use the .com, .uk, and .de domains to buy.These markets are very promising, though. They're still heavily focused on cash payments in general, which is one of the reasons why there is still an enormous growth potential there, but also with fast growing economies and broadband access that isn't yet fully developed.Donahoe sounds genuinely excited on the Q1 earnings call about the recently launched Russian language portal (focused on fashion), and he thinks PayPal as a technology is very well suited to overcome payment difficulties Russians face, which is promising for the rate of adoption of the e-Wallet there.Why Invest in eBay Now?Mobile e-commerce is growing incredibly fast. Both eBay and PayPal serve this market and are well positioned to take large market shares.Appcelerator found that nearly two-thirds of developers believe that consumers will make more purchases via their mobile phone than their credit card in 2013.Consumers will not want to carry an app for every merchant out there.If eBay and PayPal manage to become consumers' preferred apps, that will prove to be very profitable. They both have what it takes: eBay with its wide selection of products and competitive pricing, PayPal with its key position as a payment processor that is user friendly, safe and reliable.Having more than one e-wallet is not convenient at all, and PayPal is in the strategic position of processing 25% of US e-commerce and equally dominant market shares in many foreign markets.At the same time, PayPal is just starting to get serious about moving into brick and mortar stores in the US. This will help to establish the trustworthiness of the brand. As trust is a very important factor in consumers' adoption rate of mobile or e-wallets this looks to be a timely move, now the battle who becomes the dominant e-wallet will be played out.It's very important for PayPal to serve a large user base and capture market share because it derives its wide economic moat from the network effect. The more people who use PayPal the more attractive the product becomes to merchants and consumers.eBay also recently revamped its e-commerce website, which in my opinion was needed, and they have started personalizing users' homepages based on their shopping patterns. How they missed the opportunity to do the latter for so long is a mystery, but the fact they are doing it now is a good thing.eBay's Secret WeaponDuring the Q1 2013 earnings call, Donahoe made an interesting remark about the company's access to data:On the surface of this, it sounds like he is talking about the data e-commerce websites gather on their clients, but in the light of the 2011 acquisition of GSI and PayPal processing 25% of US e-commerce, there could be more to this.eBay has access to vast amounts of detailed market data (on consumers and competitors) in the e-commerce space and soon on brick and mortar spending as well. The data from GSI and PayPal can be used to analyze competitors, market trends, consumer spending habits and more.I'm sure not all of it is accessible, given legal and privacy concerns but still this could turn out to be a secret weapon for eBay's e-commerce business, going forward. Enabling them to create an edge on more traditional online retailers.What are the Risks of Investing in eBay?eBay reports revenue in dollars. They receive approximately half of their revenue in foreign currencies. Pressure on the Euro might put pressure on the EPS over the next few years. When it's the other way around, eBay profits from this. In the short term it introduces additional volatility but in the long term it's not something to worry about.eBay faces some intense competition in the e-commerce space and on the e-Wallet front there are several competitors fighting for their market share. Square or Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Checkout, for example, could turn out to be fierce competitors. It's too early to tell if they win significant terrain. Currently they are behind.eBay faces constant litigation in many jurisdictions. I do expect that ultimately they will have dealt with the majority of these cases, either by learning from the outcome of court cases and implementing changes or by having won the cases.Both the auction business and the payment processing business encounter a lot of legal problems by their nature. I expect the legal fees to rise as the business expands globally, but go down as the company gains experience, foreign bodies establish clear e-commerce laws, and eBay deals with the issues that have arisen.Also, interest rates will probably remain low in the foreseeable future, which hurts PayPal.InsidersAccording to Morningstar: Executive officers and directors are required to own eBay's common stock valued at 3 times their annual base salary (5 times in the case of the CEO). Management and the board own 12% of the stock. Although Donahoe owns less than 1% of outstanding shares, his stake is valued at almost $100 million, sufficient to align his interests with those of shareholders, one would think.ValuationeBay is not a typical e-commerce store, but a facilitator of business. 100% of products sold are actually merchandise owned by other companies or individuals, who eBay views as partners. This sets them apart from the typical e-commerce store.To make things more interesting, in addition, only about 50% of their revenue is actually coming from their eBay domains. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a competitor that is often used to benchmark against in the financial press, but Amazon is as much of an e-commerce company as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a computer manufacturer.They don't look alike all that much. Having said that, eBay trades at a P/E of 26 right now. Amazon trades at a negative with a much larger P/E going forward. Neither of these is a great benchmark. Other stocks that eBay competes with: Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK) trades at a P/E of 23 and Google at 22.If we take a look at payment processors like Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) - DFS is a partner of eBay in their brick and mortar rollout - we see P/E ratios of respectively 64, 24 and 10.eBay is currently still closer to an e-commerce company than to a financial company but it's already a much closer call between the two than most investors realize. The gap in growth rate between these two pillars of the company only emphasizes this.The company is in excellent financial shape with a low debt to cash flow ratio and a low debt to equity ratio. In case of opportunities, eBay has the ability to raise their debt and remain in sound financial shape.eBay currently trades at $51 a share and a TTM P/E of 26. Forward P/E is closer to 18. Depending on how the battle for mobile payment plays out, and with it the profitability of eBay's future, the stock will fluctuate in price.At $51 a share and up to approximately $56, as matters stand now, I estimate this to be an investment with above-average returns. Keep in mind that the volatile near future makes this stock a less than attractive pick as a typical buy-and-hold investment.ConclusionThe reason I think the stock is currently undervalued is that the sound e-commerce business lays a foundation under the stock price while the PayPal business is a 'hidden' or at least an underestimated asset that once it takes off, could be a strong driver of the stock price.At the same time, eBay's strategic maneuvering into a position to get access to vast market data might give their e-commerce business that seems more fairly priced, an interesting edge.If PayPal fails in a big way, I estimate the stock is going to lose 65%-85%.If the e-wallet space becomes fragmented with PayPal growing at its current rate, the stock price will not move substantially, but if PayPal ends up dominating the e-wallet space in the future, this stock has the potential to become one of those rare home runs.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: As an online publisher I receive advertising compensation from Google, Amazon and eBay. My business with eBay or Google is not substantial, but Amazon is important to my publishing business. I'm compensated for products sold through their affiliate program. I believe my familiarity with these companies helped me understand them and write this article but did not bias me."
1359081,40021,2013-04-22T14:49:19-04:00,,"eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) recently reported first-quarter earnings results on April 17. Fueled by growth in its two major business segments, the company's Q1 results were impressive and indicate that eBay has gotten off to a very solid start in fiscal 2013. The company earned $829 million, or $0.63 per share (GAAP: $677 million, $0.51 per share), on net revenue of $3.748 billion. Year-over-year, first quarter non-GAAP earnings grew 14.5% (from $0.55 in 2012 to $0.63 in 2013) and first-quarter revenue grew 14.37% (from $3.277 billion in 2012 to $3.748 billion in 2013).As impressive as revenue/earnings per share growth was for eBay, the stock has dropped over 6% since earnings were reported last week for several reasons; the company failed to beat the EPS whisper number of $0.64 (the first time in a year eBay failed to do so), the company's reported Q1 revenue of $3.748 billion was slightly below the average analyst estimate of $3.765 billion and management's revenue/EPS guidance for the second quarter as well as for full-year 2013 was slightly below the average analyst estimate.Despite the perceived negative earnings and guidance, the recent drop in eBay's share price presents investors with a nice opportunity to purchase a stock with a terrific long-term growth story at compelling valuation levels.The CompanyOriginally founded in 1995 by Pierre Omidyar as a personal auction site, eBay Inc. has since grown into a global leader in e-commerce and payment solutions. While initially known only for its namesake auction site eBay.com, the San Jose, California-based company has branched out into multiple business segments over the years with a myriad of brand names including eBay, PayPal, StubHub and Half.com. Currently, eBay Inc. breaks its business into three main segments:The GrowthI own eBay primarily for its 'Payments' business segment, which is where the company derives its more robust growth. However, most segments have been growing well as of late. Let's take a look at each business' growth performance and the portion of total revenue they comprise so we can have a better understanding of how each segment impacts eBay Inc.'s total growth rate.The following table will break down the performance of each of eBay's main business segments by calendar year: 'Payments,' 'Marketplaces' and 'GSI Commerce.' For easier reference, I have included eBay Inc.'s total revenue generated on the far right for the stated time period.(All numbers from eBay Inc.'s 10-Q, 10-K, found here)*Number includes only full three quarters, as reported by eBay Inc.**Growth rate derived from GSI revenue for only three full quarters, as reported by eBay Inc.The above table best illustrates how the 'Payments' portion of eBay Inc. has been propelling the company's growth over the last few years. While the results from the prior two years are slightly skewed due to the introduction of GSI Commerce in Q2 of 2011, the overall trend is clear: the 'Payments' segment is leading eBay Inc.'s growth and is becoming a larger part of the overall company's business. As long as the growth driven from 'Payments' outpaces that of 'Marketplaces,' the former will continue to steadily become a larger and more important part of the company's total business.To get the most recent look available at how each segment has been performing, I have included a three-year comparison of the company's 2011-2013 first-quarter performances:(All numbers from eBay Inc.'s 10-Q, 10-K, found here)Since Q1 of 2013 was just reported, we now have a very recent picture of how well all businesses stack up against one another. Not surprisingly, the 'Payments' segment is still growing the fastest, although growth has slowed noticeably from the more robust 2011/2012 levels of over 30%. The segment has grown into a larger portion of eBay Inc.'s total business each successive first quarter for the last three years. At 41.3% of the company's total Q1 revenue in 2013, 'Payments' now makes up the largest percentage of revenue that it has for eBay Inc. in recent history. As long as the growth rates remain significantly above that of 'Marketplaces' this transition is beneficial to eBay Inc. as a whole on a revenue growth basis.'GSI Commerce' has been growing the slowest out of all three segments but is at this time not a significant enough portion of revenue to be overly concerned with. As growth in the other segments continues to outpace GSI, the segment will become less significant to eBay Inc.'s growth rates as a whole. Q1 revenue for the segment in 2013 was actually down less than 1% from comparable 2012 levels.Growth CatalystsSince eBay's 'Payments' segment has been growing the fastest, driven by the rapid adoption of PayPal both domestically and globally, it can be considered the dominant driver of growth for the foreseeable future. Therefore, I will focus mainly on the 'Payments' portion of the company's business with regard to growth catalysts going forward.When viewed on a year-over-year basis, the 'Payments' segment grew 18.25% in the first quarter of 2013 on revenue of $1.548 billion, up from $1.309 billion in 2012. Q1 of 2013 represents PayPal's fourth successive quarter of new user growth. PayPal ended the most recent quarter with approximately 128 million active accounts and added 5 million new users in the last three months alone, an increase of 4.06%. Even more impressive is that PayPal has grown its global active accounts year-over-year well over 10% for the last six quarters consecutively.Breaking the PayPal unit into sub tiers allows us to see what is driving the new user growth. The three main drivers are mobile, in-store point of contact and international. In the most recent conference call, President and CEO John Donahoe stated, ""one out of every four PayPal account holders made at least one purchase through mobile."" This is encouraging and, when coupled with the fact that eBay claims to have added almost 3 million new users directly through mobile devices alone in Q1, indicates that management is utilizing the rapidly growing mobile market well and that there is still significant room for growth in this area.The in-store PayPal solution is now available in almost 20,000 locations domestically. Additionally, the company's deal with Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) to issue payment cards, which will further expand PayPal users' payment options by effectively opening up Discover's 7 million retail locations, is set to go live in the second quarter.PayPal has been gaining traction internationally as well. eBay, via joint venture with Softbank, released its 'PayPal Here' program in March across Japan, which follows on the heels of previous releases in Canada, Hong Kong and Australia. Additionally, eBay is preparing a chip-and-pin version of its 'PayPal Here' program for small businesses in the United Kingdom set to launch in the summer.While not dealing with the 'Payments' business exclusively, it is extremely important to mention management's recently released three-year growth strategy, which was described in detail at the company's investor's conference [pdf] in late March. CEO Donahoe expects eBay to enable a staggering $300 billion in global commerce (includes commerce and payment volume across all three business segments) by 2015, a 71.42% increase in three years (eBay enabled $175 billion in global commerce in 2012). This jump in global commerce is expected to raise eBay's revenue by over 50% in the same time period, to approximately $21.5 billion in 2015 (eBay generated $14.1 billion in revenue in 2012). The following is a breakdown of what management expects in the following three years:These estimates are certainly encouraging. However, we can gain even more useful information by analyzing the expected growth trajectory of the 'Payments' segment. In 2012, the segment generated $5.574 billion in net revenue. If we take management's conservative revenue estimate for 'Payments' of $9.5 billion in 2015, this would mean an increase in revenue of $3.926 billion over the next three years, a gain of 70.43% (equal to 23.47% revenue growth per year on average). If the upper end of management's guidance were achieved, the segment would increase revenue by $4.926 billion, a gain of 88.37% (equal to 29.46% revenue growth per year on average).Either scenario is very impressive for the rapidly growing segment and should serve as relative confirmation that it is most likely only a matter of time before the 'Payments' segment makes up the majority of eBay Inc.'s total revenue, not 'Marketplaces.'ValuationIt is difficult to compare eBay to its closest marketplace competitor Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) because, quite frankly, it is difficult to reasonably compare Amazon's valuation to anything. In order to best provide perspective on eBay's current and future valuation, I think it is best to compare the stock to payment rivals Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and MasterCard Inc. (NYSE:MA). However, valuation by itself is relatively useless so for better comparison I have added the projected revenue and earnings per share growth of all three companies along with their trailing twelve-month and future twelve-month valuations.(Numbers from Yahoo! Finance, as of 4/21/13)*P/E ratio reflects one-time settlement charge in 2012All three companies are projected to grow at relatively comparable rates. However, with regard to revenue eBay is growing the fastest and by a significantly wide margin, above 4% that of both MA and V's projected revenue growth rates in 2013 and 2014. In terms of earnings per share, eBay is projected to grow approximately 16.8% over the next two years on average, which is slightly lower than both MA's projected two-year average EPS growth rate of 17.05% and V's estimated two-year average rate of 17.6%.When it comes to valuation, eBay appears a bit expensive to MA on a trailing twelve-month basis but significantly less expansive than V, although Visa's trailing twelve-month P/E is more of an abnormality than anything else. However, on a forward-looking basis eBay appears cheap when compared to its payment rivals, with a future-twelve month P/E ratio of 16.27, lower than both MA and V. When viewed historically, eBay appears fairly priced going forward, as its forward P/E of 16.27 matches very close to its five-year average P/E of 16.08.In summation, eBay's growth performance is very close to that of MasterCard and Visa, which is impressive considering the high quality of MA and V's sales and EPS growth as of late. However, eBay separates itself a bit when it comes to forward-looking valuation.RisksOne of the risks for eBay Inc.'s PayPal service, and other digital wallet platforms like Google Wallet, is the delicate alliance that exists with the major credit card network operators. Recently, MasterCard management expressed frustration with PayPal and announced that it would begin charging fees over the summer on PayPal transactions that occurred via the MasterCard operating network. The 'Staged Digital Wallet Operator Annual Network Access Fee,' as eBay management called it, is not expected to significantly impact eBay's earnings (some analyst estimates are for an approximate $0.04 hit to EPS on MasterCard fees alone, based on PayPal usage last year). However, the impact to the company's overall EPS could be amplified if rival payment processor Visa also decides to raise fees on digital platforms like PayPal.Additionally, while eBay is a major player in the payments space, the company is still very much an auction-retailer and with this comes the usual risks associated with major consumer trends. Any serious downturn in consumer/business spending will most likely have a negative impact on eBay Inc.'s 'Marketplaces' business segment, which still accounts for over 50% of the company's total revenue. As much as I like to think of eBay Inc. as a payments solution provider first and foremost, the reality is that the company still has to be viewed as an e-commerce auction-retailer despite what the growth numbers say to the contrary. This dynamic is definitely in the process of shifting but currently investors have to pay careful attention to eBay's 'Marketplaces' segment and the larger macro trends that can impact it.Another note worth mentioning is that in the company's investor presentation [pdf] eBay reported its 'Marketplaces' segment margin at 42.1% in the first quarter, which was up from 38.7% in 2012's comparable quarter. This compares favorably to the 'Payments' segment margin which eBay reported at 24.1% in the first quarter, down from 26.4% from the same quarter of 2012. This is a bit concerning considering that the 'Payments' portion of eBay Inc. is the fastest growing business. The segment has lower overall margins than 'Marketplaces' and they have decreased in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. The recently reported Q1 'Payments' margin of 24.1% is, however, up from the two prior quarters (Q3, Q4 of 2012, at 22.6% and 23% respectively). Although still strong, it would be ideal to have the company's fastest growing business also steadily growing its margins.ConclusioneBay Inc.'s future growth will most certainly come from what CEO John Donahoe described in the latest conference call as ""a commerce revolution"" that the company ""is well-positioned to capitalize and lead in."" However, when management refers to 'commerce' they are not speaking just of the company's namesake auction site, they are also referring to customers' newfound ability to conveniently make purchases from anywhere and everywhere and it is eBay's PayPal unit that is at the forefront of this remarkable change in consumer spending habits.With regards to future growth, I tend to think of eBay as more of a competitor to Visa and MasterCard than to Amazon.com and other retail/auction sites. The company is certainly a major competitor to retailers like Amazon and a massive presence in the retail arena in general, the biggest by some metrics, but the more interesting and rapidly evolving growth story for the company as a whole is tied to its 'Payments' division and the widespread adoption of PayPal and related services. The commerce revolution is a viable growth trend that shows no signs of stopping anytime soon and eBay should remain a leader in the space for the foreseeable future. In fact, I own eBay alongside Visa and MasterCard in my portfolio for this very reason: eBay, with its new technology innovations that integrate seamlessly with its well established marketplace offerings, is a nice complementary investment to the credit card issuers/payment processors.The fact that eBay Inc. reported solid growth numbers in the first quarter of 2013, which all seem to validate a continuation of the company's growth story, and still managed to drop 6% over the next two days, currently off 9.73% from all time highs, is a blessing in disguise for investors. The stock's negative reaction to management's guidance may be more a case of excessive and lofty analyst/investor expectations than any negative aspects of eBay's projected growth. While a victim of its own past success and outperformance, management at eBay is still projecting, perhaps conservatively, revenue growth of 14%-17% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 14%-16% in 2013, which is healthy by any standard.The stock has sold off but the chart's long-term uptrend, the company's revenue and EPS growth and most importantly, the growth story are still very much intact. Investors now have a chance to purchase shares of eBay Inc. at a discount to the company's most likely main future competitors, Visa and MasterCard. I plan on taking advantage of this buying opportunity in the upcoming week by adding significantly to my long position.Disclosure: I am long EBAY, MA, V.

We ask, how reasonable is it that a recommendation has such gravitas, and let's be honest, how can we profit from it.One recent example is eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Notice the peak on April 1st when the stock jumped 3.5% with a trading volume of 20,619,900 almost twice the average volume of eBay shares. No, it is not an April Fool's joke.But what happened on April 1st that made eBay so attractive?eBay held its analyst day, which immediately got them an upgrade to Buy from Hold by Canaccord Genuity's analyst Michael Graham, raising eBay's price target to $67 from $56.For the record, R.W, Baird, Needham & Co & Cowen's also maintained their positive predictions.Looking at analyst Michael Graham's accuracy report, we measured that out of 26 Buy/Sell recommendations, only 9 outperformed the S&P 500 (35%). Is his prediction worth 100%?April 17th, eBay reported higher first-quarter profit, but posted a weaker-than-expected forecast, causing the stock to fall more than 5%. 35%-Michael indeed predicted growth, but eBay took a dive. Recommendations solely based on analyst days such as eBay hosted, motivate a peak, a one hit wonder, rather than providing a solid recommendation for investors which includes a thorough market analysis ahead of time.Can an investor benefit from hitting the stock just in its peak or rather receiving recommendations prior so that investors reap the fruits of the peak itself? We think the latter.eBay, of course, is not the only stock that was easily influenced by Michael's recommendation. The same can be seen in Michael's rating history making another overoptimistic recommendations on Zillow (NASDAQ:Z), September 2012, that eventually fell more than 30%. That is to say, an analyst recommendation history may benefit us in understanding the quality, beyond timing, of the recommendation itself.The best recommendation timing for eBay came from Evercore's analyst Ken Sena who on March 13 (only 2 weeks before Michael) reiterated an Outperform.Sena maintained his rating and price target on April 18, largely because of the company's main growth drivers: Marketplaces, the main auction and retail business, and PayPal, its payment service. Provided his positive outlook, the stock outperformed the S&P 500 by 10.6%. Sena's thorough analysis provided investors with ample time and knowledge to base their investments on and actually profit from them. Ken's recommendation was based upon solid market developments, rather than company advertising to analysts. Indeed, as investors or stocks are influenced by company analysts-day, so are investors affected by sudden peak of analysts' interest in a stock. While the vicious cycle continues, the market behaves independently with some benefiting from such developments. Perhaps it is not thinking out of the box, but rather out of the cycle.eBay will, most likely, climb to see the $60 stock price in the near future and PayPal will most probably remain eBay's main growth engine, but if you are not a very long-term investor, then catching the stock in the right timing is everything in this case.While most individual investors might make decisions that are based on market sentiment and financial experts' outlook, the more sophisticated one might wonder how accurate is the recommendation he is listening to.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in EBAY over the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Contributed by TipRanks product manager.Additional disclosure: all statistics measured here are based on TipRanks financial accountability engine."
1355631,23479,2013-04-19T19:56:06-04:00,,"eBay  (NASDAQ:EBAY) continued its strong performance in the first quarter of  2013 as growth in new users lifted net revenues by 14% y-o-y to $3.7  billion. The trend was helped by the ongoing adoption of m-commerce and  the company’s expansion into international markets. It added over 2.8  million new users to eBay and PayPal through mobile devices in Q1. The  digitization of local storefronts presents an enormous opportunity for  the company, and we expect it to continue its impressive run in the near  term. This should help eBay achieve its target of $300 billion in  commerce volumes by 2015, up 70% from 2012. It took its first steps in  this direction by registering $49 billion in commerce volumes in Q1, up  19% y-o-y.The company’s recent performance was  helped by its continuing push for global expansion. More than half of  its users and commerce volumes now comes from outside the U.S. The  company plans to continue focusing on emerging growth markets such as  Russia, Brazil, India and China. It is working to expand PayPal’s  offline presence to drive future growth. PayPal’s tie-up with Discover Financial Services  (NYSE:DFS) will come into effect in Q2 and its collaboration with ATM  Company NCR will expand its presence to restaurants and gas stations. [1] We  expect PayPal to lead revenue growth for eBay in 2013 and soon overtake  Marketplaces to become the largest revenue contributing segment. Here  we take a look at how eBay’s primary businesses performed in Q1 and the  trends that will affect them in 2013.eBay competes primarily with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Square, Intuit GoPayment and few other companies in the payments space, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in e-commerce. PayPal Drives eBay’s GrowthPayPal had a strong quarter with revenue  up 20% to $1.5 billion driven by PayPal’s adoption as a reliable  payment gateway. Expanding merchant coverage through hardware launches  to support offline presence and global expansion supported the rapid  growth in PayPal’s adoption. It finished the quarter with 128 million  active accounts globally, adding 5 million new active accounts during  the period. eBay stated that over the past 12 months, one out of every  four PayPal account holders made at least one purchase through mobile.  We expect PayPal’s adoption growth rate to accelerate as its in-store  point of sale solution becomes available in more stores beyond the  almost 20,000 retail locations currently and the Discover partnership  goes live in Q2. The growth will be helped by global expansion as the  chip and pen version PayPal Here becomes available across Europe.eBay’s other payment service, Bill Me  Later, also had a good quarter. Standalone, Bill Me Later enabled Total  Payment Volume of $849 million, up 31% y-o-y. The service’s penetration  as a funding source in the Paypal Wallet was ~4% share on eBay and ~2%  on merchant services. This helped improve PayPal’s funding mix and  reduce funding costs. We expect Bill Me Later’s increasing relevance to  further help PayPal reduce costs.Marketplaces Keeps Pace With PayPal’s GrowthIn Q1, eBay’s core Gross Merchandise  Volume (GMV) grew 13% y-o-y to $18 billion. In the U.S., core GMV was up  16% to $7.4 billion. Global active users increased 13% to 116 million.  The company attributed the strong performance to continued site  improvements such as streamlined registration and checkout and the full  launch of a new look and feel in the U.S. and select international  markets.The quarter further underlined eBay’s  growing emergence as a retail destination - pitting it as an alternative  to Amazon.com. During the quarter, fixed price listings accounted for  68% of global GMV. eBay also announced a simplified pricing structure  for U.S. sellers, including free listings for customers and eBay  store sellers in Q1. We expect the benefits of the new pricing structure  to become evident in Q2. Besides the effect of a new pricing structure,  marketplaces’ performance in Q2 will also be helped by the company’s  push in BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries. The company  officially launched its localized website in Russia in Q1 and a full  marketing campaign, which includes TV, is set for launch in Q2. In  India, the company recently reduced its fee to attract sellers.GSI Commerce Matches Steps Towards GrowthGSI’s ability to enable its clients to  grow faster than the e-commerce market has led leading retailers and  brands like Kate Spade and Dick’s Sporting Goods to sign up for its  services. The segment recorded revenues of $236 million in Q1, flat over  last year while same-store sales grew 16%. This was due to the combined effect of strong volume growth and a lower take rate. eBay  now expects the continued integration of GSI and its ability to deliver  innovative omni-channel solutions to support similar growth in the near  future. The company expects to add 30 new clients by the year-end.We believe that GSI’s popularity with  retailers will help eBay’s plans for PayPal. PayPal’s coverage is  currently more than 90% of GSI’s client volumes and its share of  checkout was 14% during the quarter. With GSI leveraging eBay  technologies such as Red Laser and Magento to build solutions for  clients, we expect GSI’s popularity to increase in the near term.We currently have a $54 price estimate for eBay which is being revised.Disclosure: No positions."
1352791,24408,2013-04-18T16:29:13-04:00,,"Another quarter, another big win for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). On Wednesday, the company reported Q1 earnings of $677 million, or 51 cents per share - up 19 percent from $570 million, or 44 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Adjusted earnings were 63 cents per share, up from last year's 55 cents, slightly above analysts' expectations of 62 cents. How does eBay win?In four ways. First, through economies of networking. Typically, economies of networking are the benefits associated with a larger and larger number of consumers buying a certain product - the larger the number of people using the product, the more valuable the product to each user, as they apply to software usage. Economies of network in eBay's model arise as the number of people who participate in online auctions grows, either on the sell side or the buy side increases.Second, through innovation. The company has been expanding to new business that support and re-enforce its core business, like online payment systems, with the successful acquisition of PayPal. Third, aggressive overseas expansion, as close to 60 percent of the company's growth comes from emerging economies. Fourth, collective entrepreneurship, a business model whereby big online companies work together with small vendors to discover and exploit new business opportunities. eBay, for instance, is currently working with retailers to install multi-screen terminals at the point of sale to entice online shoppers.ebay's winning model has caught the attention of Wall Street with its stock up 3,000 percent since it went public in the late 1990s. This means that the expectations have been high going into the last earnings report, and that can explain why the stock took a hit after the report. Nevertheless, we still believe that the stock is a buy, as it is undervalued compared to other online companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). ebay, for instance, trades at a forward PE of 18.10 compared to 73.64 for Amazon.com. Ebay's operating margins are 20 times higher than those of Amazon.A few words of caution: Online auctions and online payments are sensitive to technological innovations and business cycles that can have a negative impact both on the short-term and the long-term performance of eBay. Hype should never be a substitute for due diligence.Disclosure: I am long EBAY. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1352591,47041,2013-04-18T16:07:32-04:00,,"eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) forward thinking mindset has never been more evident than in the past few years and this trend still continues today with the announcement of Q1-2013 Earnings. The company, by a hair of $.01, continues its streak of now nine consecutive quarters of beating earnings. The stock however has taken a hit due to the squishy Q2-13 forecast of $.61-.63 Non-GAAP EPS compared to analyst expectations of around $.66 a share, due mainly to a weak euro and British pound and increased CAPEX. These forecasts spooked many investors today that perhaps the company's bottom line growth may be slowing and that the company won't be able to meet full-year targets. However I interpret this in the opposite direction. I believe ebay is not a company that is a penny wise and pound foolish, it is looking to sacrifice today to capture the growth it seeks for the future. Just look at the ambitious plans in its Analyst Day press conference (Analyst Day). I will discuss some of eBay's long-term initiatives and show you why I believe it is simply positioning for long-term growth.""From an eBay Inc. perspective, we believe our addressable market has expanded and is now significantly larger, and we are increasing our investment to capture this growth opportunity."" - CFO Robert Swan on guidance2012 Q4 & Full-Year ReviewEBay had a wonderful end of 2012 year quarter with Q4 revenue up 18% and EPS (Non-GAAP) up 17% compared with last year. Sequentially revenue was up 17.27% from Q3 compared to an increase of only 13.96% during the same period last year. It is on pace to exceed its three-year growth goals 2011-2013 of growing the PayPal business segment. In 2012 the company enabled more than $175 billion in commercial volume globally. This represents 19% of the total global e-commerce and almost 2% of total retail. Over the past three years the company has seen an average organic revenue growth of 16.5% Y/Y per quarter.Analyst Day and Q1 2013 OverviewAt Analyst day in March eBay outlined its three-year growth strategy. It reiterated its intent to grow the core Marketplace, PayPal and GSI Commerce businesses. In 2015 it intends to facilitate over $300 billion of global commerce. This represents over a $125 billion increase in global merchandise volume (GMV) over the next three-year time period. Over this same period it intends to grow revenue 50% to at least $21.5 billion by 2015. An expanded addressable market, mobile commerce technology and a strong portfolio of technology assets and capabilities will drive growth for the company over the next three years. Specifics on these momentum drivers are listed later on in this review.During the company's Q4 2012 conference call it gave guidance for Q1-2013 of $3.65 - $3.75 billion in revenues, representing growth of 11% - 14%. Non-GAAP EPS of $.60 to $.62 representing EPS growth of 8% - 12%. Actual results for the quarter were revenue of $3.7 billion, up 14% year-over-year and EPS of $.63, up 14% from Q1-2012. Paypal and Marketplace both saw accelerating user growth enabling over $49 billion in global commerce, up 19% from $41 billion in Q1-2012.Source: Capital IQSource: Capital IQMomentum DriversMobileGrowth in the Mobile segment has been a very strong driver for the company and I think the most important for the company in the future, namely with PayPal mobile. Total mobile transaction volume in 2012 was $13 billion, well ahead of the $10 billion forecast for the year. This represented twice the volume compared to 2011. The mobile app attracted over 2.8 million new users in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 4.3 million new users in 2012, and has been downloaded over 100 million times worldwide. The company has revamped the mobile app a number of ways, making it more attractive to new users. Through the partnership with RedLaser consumers can now use their eBay app to scan barcodes of products in person, which then looks for product listings online to find better deals, driving more traffic to the website. The new app also allows users to easily upload new auctions and snap pictures of the product right from their smartphones. Users also can receive alerts and notifications when they have been outbid, making for a much more convenient eBay experience and allowing for on-the-go users to be much more competitive in the bidding process. Fees on these transactions are higher because of the convenience and benefits the customers receive by getting alerts and notifications. Currently sellers are listing over 2 million products a week through the mobile application. eBay continues to leverage its mobile presence further through strategies, similar to Craigslist (In which eBay owns a 25% stake) allowing for more convenient local buying and selling of products through eBay Now. It is under testing and has been launched in New York, and San Francisco.PayPal mobile enabled over $14 billion in mobile payment volume in 2012, nearly a threefold increase from the previous year. PayPal has 128 million active global users currently, with 5 million of them being added in Q1 2013 alone, representing the fourth-consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. Mobile payments accounted for nearly 10% of PayPal's total payment volume in 2012. The company looks to continue to leverage PayPal into a larger mobile presence with the entrance into new point of sale solutions. PayPal has recently partnered with Discover card to launch new POS solutions to nearly 7 million merchant locations nationwide. It has signed on with over 23 major retailers so far. It is currently in use at almost 20,000 retail locations across the U.S. in Home Depot, Foot Locker and Jamba Juice. An example of the capacity of this feature has allowed a Jamba Juice location in California to allow customers to order ahead, pay with PayPal and skip the line all through their mobile phones. The company views its PayPal mobile solutions as an enormous opportunity, in recent conference calls CEO John Donahoe and management have stressed this opportunity multiple times.""PayPal intends to be everywhere consumers need an easy, safe, secure way to pay online, from your phone, favorite neighborhood store and at major retailers."" - Q3 2012 Conference Call""PayPal will be the only option out there that allows you to have your full wallet there, where you can pay with any financial instrument you want. You can put your loyalty cards, your coupons. And so much like you have one physical wallet, we think PayPal, our intent is to drive it to be the digital wallet. But that's going to play its way out over the next 6, 12, 18 months as we drive forward. We think our starting point is strong. And I'll just remind you, I've said it before, if we get 1% of offline retail, it doubles the size of PayPal. So we like our leadership position. We think it's an enormous white space, and we'll go after it aggressively."" - John Donahoe - Q4 2012 Conference CallManagement predicts that eBay Mobile and PayPal Mobile will each generate $20 billion in transaction volume. The company is also expanding its PayPal mobile presence globally with its PayPal Here announced in Europe, and Japan. In Q1 PayPal Here became available to more than 2,700 retail locations in Japan.Click here for more information regarding PayPal mobile solutionsInternational ExposureeBay leverages its platforms and mobile capabilities to connect buyers and sellers globally. eBay continues to expand internationally with large opportunities in Brazil and Russia. It has recently launched eBay Style in China, which gives U.S. fashion sellers access to Chinese consumers. International Payment (PayPal) Sales represented 53% or $814 million of total payments revenue for the PayPal segment in Q4 2012, compared to $647 million in Q4 2011. This represents growth of 25.6% Y/Y for the international portion.The company has also taken a number of strategic acquisitions in Asia, particularly in Korea, Japan and Singapore. Each country is expecting double-digit e-commerce growth over the next couple years. eBay has acquired Korean auction site Gmarket for $1.2 billion and has announced partnership with the founder to start operations in Japan and Singapore. eBay acquired ZONG in 2011, a mobile payment service provider, in order to tap the growing Chinese e-commerce market. It is unclear currently how this strategy has paid off.""Consumers like Choices""Unlike its competitors eBay offers consumers choices. Whether you want to buy it now or get bid hungry in an auction, consumers enjoy the flexibility that eBay offers. Since reorganizing the structure of the website the fixed price format now accounts for nearly 70% of Gross Merchandise Volume globally in 2012. This was up from 63% in 2011, 60% in 2010, 53% in 2009 and 45% in 2008. Consumers and large sellers enjoy the flexibility and speed associated with the fixed price offerings. Leveraging these fixed price offerings with a barcode scanner on the mobile app and consumers could find themselves going to the mall trying out new cloths, products, books and purchasing them right off eBay mobile simultaneously. More intriguingly consumers may not even have to wait a single night for delivery with eBay's new experimental mobile app ""eBay Now."" Being tested in San Francisco, and New York, consumers can purchase products straight from their phone from stores like Macy's, Target, and Walgreen. This may challenge Amazon Prime, Amazon's unlimited free two-day shipping program, which lets users buy millions of items with two-day shipping for $79 a year.Stewardship and Sustainability (ESG)While this section may be atypical to some investors, I think it is important for a long-term approach to understand what steps a company is taking to implement Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) practices into its businesses. I have written another article briefly outline what it means for a company to be social responsible and perhaps some competitive advantages that these ESG functions might offer in (My previous article).Sustainability at eBay has had an ever growing presence within and out of the company. First off the company is inherently a promoter of good environmental practices. Its core business model is the trading of pre-owned, used products. What's more sustainable than reusing what is already made? While clearly I think that this is a prime example of sweet serendipity, or a ""happy accident"" the company has furthered its efforts substantially to promoting good ESG practices. Ebay created the first of-its-kind Cradle-to-Cradle Box. This 100% recycled material box enables users to use and reuse the same package for multiple shipments and is created with water-based ink. The boxes are designed to encourage sellers to reuse their boxes and for buyers to become sellers.The company has been implementing sustainability into new building design and data centers. The company has been recognized with multiple awards for its LEED Gold facilities (Award Article), most namely Green IT Magazines award for ""Environmental Project of the Year"" with its Topaz data center in Utah (Green Data Center). The company has implemented energy savings initiatives into its data centers, which have had the combined impact of reducing the net energy per transaction by 55% since 2008. That's some good stuff! eBay is also a member of multiple advisory groups such as the Green Grid End User Advisory Council and Data Center Pulse.The company also implemented the ""Green Team"" within the organization with about 2500 employee members that seeks to facilitate sustainable practices and promote education amongst buyers/sellers and local communities about the impacts of their actions.These practices and policies are enforced all the way from the top by CEO, John Donahoe.""In 2009, at the request of CEO John Donahoe, eBay Inc. established a cross functional Global Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC) comprised of functional business leads who own the company's energy footprint. The SSC is chartered with the responsibility to establish goals regarding eBay Inc.'s greenhouse gas (NYSE:GHG) emissions and other sustainability issues, ensure that plans are in place to achieve these goals, and monitor the company's progress on an ongoing basis."" -Company WebsiteSummary and OutlookTo many investors and myself it is clear that eBay is a forward thinking company that is doing the right things today for growth tomorrow. Its mere squishy guidance numbers appear to me nothing more than just a weaker-than-expected euro and a little more capital expenditures to capture eBay's addressable market. As the CFO concluded in the Q1-13 Conference call.""Marketplaces is strong, particularly in the U.S., driven by investments in buyer and seller experiences. And GSI is performing in line with our expectations as we continue to invest in technology and growing the client portfolio. We are investing in our business for the long term, and we are focused on delivering the next generation of global commerce and payments capabilities.""- CFO Robert SwanDisclosure: I am long EBAY.

1350011,45761,2013-04-18T05:22:17-04:00,,"Background and ThesisWe believe that at current levels, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is significantly overvalued. Don't get me wrong, eBay is a great company, and it is not because earnings will not grow (they will), but the multiple you are paying right now is very stretched at 28x trailing 12 month EPS.Company OverviewA long-term cash flow generator...Consistent investments in growth through Acquisitions, Capex and R&D....Below one can see how cash is deployed. 19% of cash generated returned to shareholders through buybacks to cover stock compensation....Consistently growing levels of invested capital.... Revenues/Invested Capital growing 1-2% per annum....Margins around 5-year average levels, could expand a little bit....ROIC slightly below average levels, possible room for improvement....Fair ValueThe stock is right now trading off its 5-year highs in terms of relative P/Es to the market. Paying an 80% premium to the market seems extremely risky to us....Using eBay 's maximum, minimum and average historical Returns On Invested Capital, we have calculated based on the historical levels of invested capital possible ranges for where NOPAT could be (see below). Right now, NOPAT is slightly below average historical ROIC levels. Please note that this is based on current levels of invested capital and we expect invested capital to continue to grow going forward that should result in higher NOPAT.Our EPS estimates....ConclusionOur price forecasts suggest $56 to $68 in 5 years. If eBay is still trading on 28x EPS in 5 years then the stock would hit $100, but this would seem extremely unlikely.Assuming eBay reverts back to its average Relative P/E of 1.2 x S&P 500 = 18.67x EPS, then we get an IRR of 5%. Reversion to a market P/E would give us an IRR of 1.4%. If you are delusional enough to believe that eBay will still trade on 28x EPS in 5 years then your IRR would be 13.3%. We do not believe that this makes for an attractive investment.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

After the close on Wednesday, eBay released 2013 Q1 earnings, reporting EPS of $0.63, which beat estimates by $0.01, and revenues of $3.75 billion, missing estimates slightly by $20 million. The company also lowered its guidance for 2013 Q2 to $0.61 to $0.63 EPS and $3.8 to $3.9 billion revenue, below consensus estimates of $0.66 EPS and $3.95 billion in revenue.Investors were not impressed with the report, sending eBay's stock price down 2.6% in after hours trading. When a growth company like eBay misses revenue estimates and adjusts guidance downward, it is certainly understandable that investors might be skeptical of future growth prospects. But before dumping your shares, consider some highlights from the Q1 2013 earnings call.Over the past year, eBay has grown EPS 14.5%, from $0.55 in 2012 Q1 to $0.63 in the last quarter. Similarly, revenue has grown 14.5%, from $3.28 billion in 2012 Q1 to $3.75 billion in 2013 Q1.eBay has been at the forefront of the mobile E-commerce revolution. In Q1, the company added 2.8 million new users to eBay and PayPal through mobile devices. The company reports that more than half of users and volume come from outside the United States, and it sees tremendous growth opportunities in emerging markets such as Russia, China, India and Brazil.PayPal finished the quarter with 128 million active accounts globally, an increase of 5 million over the quarter. Revenue from PayPal reached $1.5 billion, an 18% increase from 2012 Q1. Over the past 12 months, the company reports that one out of every four PayPal users has made at least one transaction via a mobile device. Projecting this ratio over 5 million new users accounts for 1.25 million account holders utilizing a mobile device to make some kind of payment, and that only includes new account holders for this quarter.PayPal is also expanding globally. More than 2,700 retailers in Japan are now accepting payments through PayPal Here, the company's mobile credit card reader. PayPal has also been integrated into LG's smart TV platform, now available in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.Marketplaces, eBay's core business, increased revenue by 13% from 2012 Q1. The number of active users also increased by 13%, to 116 million. Marketplace sold items increased by 11.7%. Bill Me Later, which offers consumers the opportunity to make purchases through a line of credit, rather than a credit card, increased payment volume by 31% from 2012 Q1 to $849 million.At the company's analyst day late last month, CEO John Donahoe predicted eBay would enable $300 billion in commerce in 2015, a 71% increase from $175 billion in 2012. In 2013 Q1, eBay enabled $49 billion in commerce in various ways, including Marketplace sales and PayPal transactions, an increase of 19% over 2012 Q1. Projected over four quarters, this would account for $196 billion in commerce for 2013. Projecting this figure over four quarters is problematic, however, for a number of reasons, such as the potential for consumers to cut spending in light of some unforeseen macroeconomic factor(s).However, I believe the $196 billion projection will prove to be quite a bit lower than the actual total, simply because of the ever-increasing numbers of users of both eBay Marketplaces and PayPal. Also, the partnership between eBay and Discover (NYSE:DFS) is set to go live in Q2, giving PayPal exposure to millions of U.S. retailers just in time for the holiday season.Conclusion: With a forward P/E of 17.37, eBay's stock is primed for growth over the next couple of years. I believe we've only seen the proverbial tip of the iceberg when it comes to PayPal's growth. eBay has proven to be a market leader when it comes to mobile E-commerce and is just now expanding into several key emerging markets. Investors will likely punish the stock for missing revenue and lowering guidance for Q2. Long-term growth investors would be wise to pick up shares on the dip.Disclosure: I am long EBAY.

Revenue was up 14% to $3.7 billion, compared to the same period of 2012. The company reported first quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $677 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income of $829 million, or $0.63 per diluted share. Analysts expected eBay to post earnings of $0.62 with revenue of $3.77 billion (eBay missed on revenue but beat earnings).""We had a strong first quarter, with accelerating user growth across both Marketplaces and PayPal, and with GSI enabling their retail clients to grow faster than e-commerce,"" said John Donahoe, eBay's president and CEO, in a release. ""Technology is creating a commerce revolution, and we are in the forefront with strong mobile leadership and a focus on helping retailers and brands engage consumers anytime, anywhere.""The company said that eBay gained approximately 2.8 million new customers in the period through mobile, driving double-digit growth in active users at both PayPal and Marketplaces.PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) revenue was up 18% to $1.5 billion, and the payments giant gained 5 million active registered accounts in the period and ended the quarter with 128 million, a 16% increase. PayPal's net total payment volume (TPV) grew 21% to $41 billion, driven by consumer and merchant use of PayPal both on and off eBay.Marketplace revenue increased 13% to $2 billion with marketplaces gaining 3.9 million active users in the period, ending the quarter with 116 million, a 13% increase. Gross merchandise volume (GMV), excluding vehicles, increased 13% to $18 billion, reflecting the continued improvements to eBay's core technology designed to make it easier and faster for consumers to shop and buy. Marketplaces continues to invest in innovation and expanding its addressable market both locally and globally.Because the company has seen strong growth in PayPal, mobile sales and marketplace, investors have been bullish on eBay and its stock. During the first quarter, the company reorganized its mobile group and released a number of new apps and expanded its same-day delivery service. During its analyst day a few weeks ago, eBay revealed that it plans to enable at least $300 billion in global commerce across its businesses, up from $175 billion in 2012.The Race Against AmazonAfter over a decade of living in the shadow of 'e-tail' giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the perennial second-place sales site is starting to get a bigger slice of attention from Wall Street and the tech press. And why not? For the first time in years, second-place eBay is taking first place in the race for returns:EBay is moving in the right direction, but it's too soon to claim that the company is about to beat Amazon at its own game. Although eBay has pushed hard into mobile commerce, and now sees almost a third of its purchases come from mobile devices, that segment will still only account for about 15% of total e-commerce revenue this year. Of course, that's expected to rise in the future as more consumers shift their primary browsing and shopping habits from desktop to tablet or smartphone, but it would be rash to count Amazon out of this race.Should You Buy?The one thing eBay undoubtedly has going for it over Amazon is valuation. Compared to Amazon's negative P/E (and 76 forward P/E), eBay looks downright cheap. Furthermore, the companies 50 and 200 day moving averages are climbing, indicating a bullish trend, as pictured in the chart below.The share price of eBay has steadily returned 56% over the past 12 months and the stock is trading near within 2% of its 52-week high. Fundamentally, eBay is relatively solid. The company's debt level is fairly in line as reflected by its on-par leverage ratio. The firm's gross and operating margins of 70.04% and 20.53% are in 85th and 98th%iles, respectively, for the retail industry. Late last month, eBay set aggressive three-year growth targets, based on international expansion plans and more focus on mobile commerce. The company is investing heavily in these initiatives and such spending may be behind the weaker second-quarter profit forecast.Though Amazon's significant lead in e-commerce could make its future more certain than eBay's, the market has definitely already priced this benefit into Amazon's stock. eBay, on the other hand, offers benefits that do not seem to be recognized by the market -- at least not to the extent that they have been for Amazon, and with positive growth initiatives and solid fundamentals, eBay is a stock I would definitely consider in the near future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in EBAY over the next 72 hours.

1355681,24491,2013-04-19T21:04:38-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) announced solid first quarter results. Revenue jumped 14% year-over-year to $3.7 billion, slightly below consensus estimates, but not materially, in our view. Earnings per share rose 16% year-over-year to $0.63, a penny above consensus expectations.The firm saw solid results across all of its major business segments. The Payments segment, which includes PayPal and Bill Me Later, saw revenue increase 18% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. We saw the power of PayPal's network expand during the quarter, with total transaction volumes rising 21% year-over-year to $41 billion. Total accounts were 16% higher than a year ago, and the payment service added 5 million accounts sequentially. We're not surprised by the growth, and we still believe the network has some expansion ahead of it, particularly internationally. However, we're seeing take rates fall and margins compress. Transaction take-rates declined 10 basis points to 3.77%, leading transaction margins to fall 120 basis points year-over-year to 64.4%. We see further compression ahead as competition intensifies, but as we've see from the Visa (NYSE:V)/Mastercard (NYSE:MA) duopoly, there could be plenty of room for industry economic profit generation. Although online payment competition could intensify, we believe barriers to entry remain high.Among our favorite aspects of the PayPal business is management's willingness to push for unconventional payments growth. During the quarter, PayPal announced a partnership with LG to integrate payments into smart TVs. Additionally, the firm's alliance with Discover (NYSE:DFS) will likely go online in the second quarter, which will materially boost PayPal's bricks and mortars acceptance. As long as the company spreads the message, we think PayPal will see some share gains against the larger players.As for the online marketplace, eBay's revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $1.96 billion. Gross merchandise volume also increased 13% year-over-year, totaling $18.3 billion. This occurred in spite of weak currency and traffic in Europe. We remain pleased with eBay's ability to revamp its marketplace into a destination and successfully compete with the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Although eBay recently altered its fee structure, we don't believe it had any material impact on first quarter results, but we do think it could lead to long-term market share gains. The move to change the seller fee structure is very positive, in our view, as we think it can help drive a stronger network of fixed price sellers to eBay. After becoming associated with auctions since its inception, eBay is in the process of becoming a destination for buyers of everything, much like Amazon has done successfully over the past several years. While Amazon may look slightly more attractive in the near-term because more buyers are on the site, we believe the cost savings at eBay could help drive sellers to the eBay marketplace.Strong earnings growth flowed into eBay's coffers as the firm generated $638 million in free cash flow, 120% higher than during the same period a year ago. As a result, the firm aggressively repurchased 8.5 million worth of stock for $476 million. Both of eBay's businesses benefit from operating leverage which we think will drive free cash flow growth in the coming years.Looking ahead, the company held firm with its guidance of 14%-17% revenue growth, driving earnings per share growth of 14%-16% ($3.8-$3.9 billion and $2.70-$2.75, respectively). We believe management guides conservatively, but regardless, we're pleased with eBay's current growth trajectory, and we believe its long-term growth story is full intact.

By now, most of you must have read about my blown call on Infosys (NYSE:INFY) last week. Our proprietary model was advocating going dark (short) on the shares before their earnings report. However, in the two days prior to the report, shares rallied about INR 250 or so in India and here Stateside on almost 2x the average 10-day volume, which led my team and I to wrongly conclude that sentiment had changed or information was out in the Indian market that favored going long despite what our model was telling us. Bad call which hit us hard in the pocketbook. Having said that, it's easy to pontificate after the earnings on how right one's call was and how vindicated one might feel after the results are out, however, you will never see that with me. Right or wrong, I will always tell you what I am doing with a particular investment/trade prior to the call and in addition, if I am advocating a short or a long, why would I not have my own money where my mouth is? Having said that, I am moving on to my next recommendation and I hope you will move on with me too.eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), the online auction giant, is set to report earnings for its March quarter after the close of regular market trading this afternoon followed by a conference call at 5 pm eastern. Current analyst consensus calls for earnings of $$0.62/share on revenues of $3.77 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2013. The range on earnings is $0.53/share to $0.65/share with revenue range of $3.68 to $3.9 billion. For the current June quarter, consensus is earnings of $0.66/share on revenues of $3.95 billion. For FY13, sellsiders are modeling revenues of $16.4 billion and earnings of $2.75/share.In March, eBay had their analyst day where they guided non-GAAP earnings growth of between 15-19% for the years 2013 through 2015 and revenues of at least $21.5 to $23.5 billion for FY15. Must be nice to have a crystal ball, no? Seriously, for a company that operates on the cutting edge of technology to guide three years out is incredibly reassuring from an investment point of view since the management team does not have a reputation for wild statement ala Steve Ballmer et al.Our proprietary model called for a no trade on YHOO and all we did was sold calls against our long held shares. The model is bullish eBay and that's how we are positioned through a combination of shares and calls.Until the next time, safe and happy investing.Good luck going into eBay's ER tonight, long, short or agnostic.Disclosure: I am long EBAY, GOOG, INFY, YHOO.

The company is focusing on leveraging its global mobile ecommerce leadership and technologies for new customer and retailer experiences. To accomplish this, eBay is creating a new web-enabled retail interface that is intended to be a new seamless, multiscreen commerce experience. At the end of 2012, eBay had over 112 million active users.The company has a goal of enabling $300 billion of global commerce by 2015. eBay achieved a global commerce volume of $175 billion in 2012. All three business segments are included in these figures. The company expects revenue to grow to $21.5 billion in 2015, as compared to $14.1 billion in 2012. The use of mobile devices is a growing opportunity where eBay expects to generate $20 billion of mobile commerce in 2013.The Marketplaces segment includes the standard and mobile app version of ebay.com. It also includes StubHub.com, Fashion, Motors, and Half.com. PayPal offers a practical way to pay and to be paid between the various eBay sellers and customers. GSI, which was acquired by eBay in 2011, enables companies to operate ecommerce businesses and integrates their ecommerce with other retail offerings.Healthy growth is expected in all three of eBay's business segments. The company expects a compound annual growth rate of 14% through 2015 for the Marketplaces and GSI Commerce segments. PayPal is expected to achieve a compound annual growth rate of 22% through 2015.From a valuation standpoint, eBay looks fairly valued with a forward P/E of 17.49, a PEG of 1.35, and a price to book ratio of 3.44.eBay's gross margin of 0.70 for the past twelve months is higher than Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) gross margins of 0.25 and 0.59 respectively. eBay achieved a profit margin of 18.54% for the past twelve months, while Amazon achieved -0.06% and Google achieved 21.4%. The company has a healthy operating cash flow of $3.84 billion and free cash flow of $1.3 billion.The largest risk to the company in my opinion is competition. Amazon is a huge force in the online ecommerce realm and could eat into eBay's market share. Ultimately, many other retailers, mail-order companies, shopping websites, search engines, shopping channels, etc. are competition for eBay. eBay does have a unique experience, however, with its bidding system. The company needs to continue to engage its buyers and sellers to further its growth for the future.eBay beat its earnings expectations in all four quarters of 2012. It is expected to grow earnings annually at 14.7% for the next five years. This growth is significantly above the expected annual growth of the S&P 500 of about 8.9%. Therefore, eBay should outperform the market over the next five years if the company meets or exceeds its earnings expectations for the majority of quarters in that time period.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The numbers are typically released at 4:15 p.m. EST and will be followed by a conference call at 5:00 p.m. EST.Outliers And StrategyBack in January, eBay gave the following guidance for 1Q2013Recent NewsTechnical RevieweBay shares are up approximately 56% over the past 12 months, thanks to consistent upside earnings surprises. There continues to be solid momentum, with shares trading well above (~12%) the 200-day SMA. If earnings surprise to the upside, look for initial resistance at the most recent highs near $58, followed by the all-time highs of $59.21. If results disappoint, the first area of support is the 50-day SMA near $54.65, which also corresponds to the highs of the day from the overnight gap on 03/28. There is also further downside risk to the $53 area (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com).SummaryExpectations for eBay's 1Q2013 release are high, with the company well positioned to take advantage of the evolving payments space and an aggressive three-year growth plan. With the recent advance, and the steady earnings beats, any missteps can have severe consequences for eBay.

1337791,23479,2013-04-12T11:52:19-04:00,,"eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) capped off a great year with a spectacular holiday season quarter. Increased adoption of mobile devices for e-commerce and payment purposes saw the company beat its own estimates for the year. Buoyed by the performance, the company set aggressive targets for 2015.At the recently held eBay annual investor day, the company announced a target of growing annual earnings in the 15-19% range over the next three years. It is also targeting an increase in revenue by about 70% for the period from $14 billion in 2012. The first hints about the company’s initial success will become evident when it releases its earnings for the January-March quarter on April 17. We expect it to continue its rapid growth helped by the growing adoption of m-commerce and PayPal. We also look forward to the company’s plans toward supporting expansion into emerging markets, particularly the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries.eBay competes primarily with Google (Nasdaq: GOOG), Square, Intuit (Nasdaq: INTU) GoPayment and few other companies in the payments space, and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) in e-commerce.Expansion Into Emerging Markets To Drive Marketplace's GrowthIn order to meet its target of having 25% of active users and more than 12% of global sales from BRIC countries and emerging markets, the company has been aggressively pushing for expansion in these regions. In Q4 2012, it launched eBay Style in China, giving U.S. fashion sellers access to Chinese consumers. Recently, it launched a Russian version of its marketplace to support the growing adoption of its service in Russia. With the new site, eBay is pooling listings from sellers around the world that are available for shipping to Russia and inviting Russian shoppers to search the site either in English or Cyrillic, with payments processed through PayPal. eBay Russia had registered 54% growth in user spend in 2012 even as the number of active users grew almost 75%. In India, eBay currently has 5 million users and recently reduced sellers’ fee by as much as 80% for some categories to shore up interest.Besides promoting the marketplace to sellers through fee reduction and aggressive promotion through television customers, the company also invested in its largest competitor in the country, Snapdeal. We will look for any hints of a shift in Marketplace’s revenues in terms of geography. Net revenues outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 52% and 53% of eBay’s net revenues in 2012 and 2011, respectively.Popular eBay Apps Will Help Marketplace's Cause ChannelAdvisor assesses that Marketplace's sales growth dropped to the lowest levels in almost two years in February. This was in contrast to its performance last year when total gross merchandise volume increased by 15% to more than $75 billion. This growth was primarily a result of the popularity of eBay’s mobile apps, site enhancements and growth in emerging markets.Driven by eBay Mobile apps crossing the 100 million downloads threshold, m-commerce volume in 2012 was a healthy $13 billion. Mobile also attracted over 4.3 million new users to eBay in 2012, prompting sellers to list almost 2 million items per week from their smartphones on eBay. We expect that the growing smartphone penetration rate in the U.S., still at about 54% of the mobile market penetration and growing at 5% on a sequential basis, and the popularity of eBay’s mobile apps to support an acceleration of Marketplace’s revenue growth in the near term. Our expectations are supported by eBay’s efforts to become more user friendly through initiatives such as reduction of selling fees and free listings. We will also look for hints about the company’s expectations about its sales from the Americas.PayPal To Continue Marching On Its Growth PathPayPal accounts for about 40% of eBay’s revenues and about 50% of our price estimate. Revenues from the division have grown at about 26% during 2012 with the international business outpacing overall growth [PayPal Q4 2012 Fast Facts, PayPal, April 2013]. The international business accounts for slightly more than half of PayPal’s total revenues. With the service still having a limited international presence, we expect the international business to be the major contributor in the coming years. The division has outgrown its dependence on eBay with Total Payment Volume on eBay constituting just 33% of the overall Total Payment Volume. This has been made possible by PayPal expanding its presence offline through PayPal Here devices and mobile apps. A tie-up with Discover Financial Services will come in force in the second quarter of the current financial year. We expect PayPal to keep growing at Q4 levels and will look for growth in its offline presence.The growing popularity and adoption of PayPal Mobile bodes well for the company and will support its growth outlook.We have a $54 Trefis price estimate for eBay, which is 5% above the market price.Disclosure: No positions"
1325921,30811,2013-04-08T03:12:00-04:00,,"The share price of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has steadily returned 56% over the past 12 months and the stock is trading near its 52-week high of $57.26. Based on the following 4 reasons, I believe the price momentum will likely persist for a while and the stock remains a solid buy at this level.1. eBay shares are still priced attractively based on the company's solid financial performance relative to its primary internet peers' (see chart below). The firm's consensus 2-year revenue, EBITDA, and EPS growth estimates are notably below the averages for the interest services peer group which contains some high-growth comps. Similarly, eBay's long-term earnings growth estimate is also below par. On the profit side, however, eBay demonstrates a better performance as the company's various profit margins and capital return metric are above the peer averages. In terms of debt and liquidity, eBay's debt level is fairly in line as reflected by its on-par leverage ratios. The firm's trailing free cash flow margin is below the average, but due to the stronger profitability, eBay was able to maintain a lofty interest coverage ratio. Both the firm's current and quick ratios are below par, but they remains at a healthy level on an absolute basis.eBay's current price multiples at 12.3x forward EBITDA and 20.2x forward EPS (next 12 months) are at a large discount to the same peer-average multiples, reflecting eBay's below-average growth potential. However, after accounting for the long-term EPS growth estimate, eBay's PEG ratio of 1.2x is still 25% below the peer average, suggesting that market has likely not given sufficient credits to eBay's robust profitability and hence the shares are valued at a modest discount on a relative basis (see chart above).2. From a historical standpoint, eBay's long-term PEG ratio is fairly in line with its level in a year ago (see chart below).In my view, the stable PEG trend implies a reasonable valuation development provided that 1) eBay has been able to produce a slightly higher return on invested capital over the past 2 years as reflected by its ROIC uptrend; and 2) the company has also managed to sustain profitability and free cash flow margins over the same period (see charts below).Moreover, eBay's long-term PEG ratio at 1.2x is currently below the average long-term PEG of 1.8x (forward P/E of 14.6x and long-term earnings growth rate of 8.2%) for S&P 500 Index. Given the company's healthy profit and liquidity condition which is above the market level, I believe this below-market valuation presents a great buying opportunity.3. Market sentiment on the stock is very positive. The market's consensus revenue, EBITDA, and EPS estimates for 2013 and 2014 have all been raised markedly over the past 6 months. In addition, analysts' long-term earnings growth estimate has also been boosted from 12.9% to 16.4% since a year ago (see charts below).4. Of the 40 analyst ratings compiled by Thomson One, there are 11 strong buy and 21 buy ratings. eBay recently held a investor meeting, and in a research note dated April 1, Doug Anmuth at JP Morgan commented on his take-way and the company's growth prospects, which I tend to agree on (sourced from Thomson One, Equity Research):Bottom line, despite the significant price run-up, eBay stock remains a solid buy given its attractive risk/reward profile as supported by the company's healthy financials, continued growth momentum, and inexpensive valuation.All charts are created by the author except for the consensus estimate tables which are sourced from S&P Capital IQ, and all financial used in the article and the charts is sourced from S&P Capital IQ unless otherwise specified.Disclosure: I am long EBAY.

FB had been trading in the range of $17.55-$45 in the past 52 weeks. FB has a market cap of $63.25B.On March 19, 2013, JMP Securities initiated coverage on FB with a market perform rating. Analysts currently have a mean target price of $33.44 and a median target price of $34.00, suggesting 25.95%-28.06 upside potential. Analysts, on average, are estimating an EPS of $0.13 with revenue of $1.45B for the current quarter ending in March 2013. For 2013, analysts are predicting an EPS of $0.57 with revenue of $6.66B, which is 30.90% higher than 2012.Facebook on Tuesday announced ""Lookalike Audiences,"" a new feature for advertisers. The company claims the new targeting technique offers lower cost per checkout, lower cost per acquisition, larger purchase size, as well as faster and increased return on investment.Fundamentally, despite the recent pullback, FB's valuation remains unreasonably high with P/E of 2655 and P/FCF of 167.76. However, if FB can achieve its estimated long-term annual EPS growth of 29.04% for the next 5 years, the valuation will become more justified. On the positive end, FB has a total cash of $9.63B with a total debt of $2.36B. FB generates a positive operating cash flow of $1.61B with a levered free cash flow of $412.38M.Technically, the MACD (12, 26, 9) is showing a slightly bearish trend, and the MACD difference continues to diverge. The momentum indicator, RSI (14), is indicating a bearish lean at 39.00. FB is currently trading below its 50-day MA of $28.86 and above its 200-day MA of $25.47, as seen from the chart below.Source: StockCharts.comHow to InvestFB is not for conservative investors at this moment, and it is hard to evaluate FB from the valuation perspective. However, FB remains one of the best bet for social media trend. For bullish investors, a credit put option spread of June 22, 2013 $20/$22 put can be reviewed, which will allow investors to gain some upside credit premium or to acquire FB shares at a price below $22 upon options expiration. Investors can also review the following ETFs to gain exposure to FB:eBay Inc.EBAY was up 1.97% and closed at $51.10 on March 19, 2013. EBAY had been trading in the range of $35.31-$57.26 in the past 52 weeks. EBAY has a market cap of $66.25B with a beta of 1.43.EBAY had received multiple upgrades recently. On March 19, 2013, JMP Securities initiated coverage on EBAY with a market outperform rating and a price target of $67.00. On the same day, Cantor Fitzgerald upgraded EBAY from hold to buy with a price target of $56.00 saying the risk/reward is attractive following a 13% pullback from the multi-year high set back in February. The analyst Youssef Squali said,Analysts currently have a mean target price of $60.29 and a median target price of $62.00 for EBAY, suggesting 17.98%-21.33% upside potential. Analysts, on average, are estimating an EPS of $0.62 with revenue of $3.76B for the current quarter ending in March 2013. For 2013, analyst are projecting an EPS of $2.73 with revenue of $16.34B, which is 16.10% higher than 2012.As reported, EBAY is launching a new fee structure and incentives for sellers to remain the most competitive commerce platform next to e-commerce marketplace Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It is the first time that eBay is launching free listings for both non-stores and stores on the platform, as well as simpler pricing. The fight between EBAY and AMZN is intensifying as EBAY is offering incentives to some of Amazon's merchants to make the switch.Fundamentally, there are a few positive factors for EBAY:Technically, the MACD (12, 26, 9) indicator is showing a bearish trend. RSI (14) is picking up but still indicating a selling momentum at 37.57. EBAY is currently trading between its 50-day MA of $54.40 and 200-day MA of $48.60, as seen from the chart below.Source: StockCharts.comHow to InvestUnlike FB, EBAY's valuation can be better analyzed. With expected 14.63% long-term EPS growth for the next 5 years, there is more upside for EBAY. With a healthy balance sheet and strong cash flow, along with a wide economic moat, EBAY remains a long-term buy. For bullish investors, a credit put option spread of June 22, 2013 $45/$50 put can be reviewed.

1287251,40641,2013-03-19T16:33:35-04:00,,"Analysts have been widely inconsistent by accepting the use of some company's non-GAAP earnings per share accounting for estimates, such as eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and then holding other companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to a higher standard by using straight GAAP earnings for estimates. Using eBay as an example, their CY13 non-GAAP EPS estimate is 20% higher than the GAAP estimate. This translates into a 17% lower forward P/E estimate (currently 18.5 vs. 22.2) on all financial websites and discussions about the stock by writers and reporters. This 20% inflation of earnings is highly misleading and can lead to poor investment decisions/comparisons if the investor does not know the estimate is non-GAAP or what non-GAAP excludes vs. other securities.Non-GAAP (also to referred to as pro-forma or adjusted results) reporting is not new and has been utilized by companies for a long time to remove large one-time items (like restructuring, discontinued operations, acquisition expenses, etc..) that skew GAAP results from quarter to quarter in order for the investor to better track the on-going operations of the company. It was never meant to be a continuous operating reporting result. To compound matters, each company that reports non-GAAP earnings can exclude different expenses, as non-GAAP is defined by the individual company. That means that the if you want to compare non-GAAP results of Google and eBay for example, they may still be apples to oranges. One expense that is almost always excluded in non-GAAP results is employee stock compensation expenses.Non-GAAP results became very popular for Tech companies during 2006 as FAS 123((((R)))) became effective on the start of a public company's fiscal year after June 15, 2005. FAS 123((((R)))) outlined the SEC's new stock compensation expensing requirements and had a major impact on companies that utilized stock options and RSU's as a significant portion of their employee's overall compensation. Tech companies fell right into the sweet spot of impacted companies due to the practice in Silicon Valley of using piles of stock to attract and retain key talent. Based on the significant discontinuity in earnings FAS 123((((R)))) created, many companies reported pro-forma results initially to help analysts understand the impact of the new rule.FAS 123((((R)))) essentially requires companies to estimate the potential total compensation an employee will receive from the stock grant and then amortize quarterly that non-cash cost as an expense (either in cost of sales or operating expenses) over the lifetime of the grant. While I have my thoughts on stock compensation expensing, this article is not meant to take a position on it one-way or another, but to point out the large inconsistency in analyst estimates as they include it for some companies and not for others.Figure 1: eBay Non-GAAP Expense ExclusionsFigure 1 displays what costs eBay excludes in its non-GAAP reporting. There are essentially two main exclusions: stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets. As you can see, neither of these expenses is a one-time expense - they are both recurring and significant. They both hold in common that they are non-cash charges, but both do have impacts on cash position and/or dilution. Stock compensation either increases dilution or requires the use cash to buy back the shares. Even if the shares are not bought back, I would suggest stock compensation is a real cost, as the company could have issued that stock to the public and retained the cash rather than pay it to the employee. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is the result of paying a premium for a company (or Intellectual property) with either stock or cash, so this is a catch up charge that gets expensed over the useful life of the assets so the company does not get a large charge at the time of acquisition.While Amazon details the expected stock compensation charge in their quarterly guidance, they do not provide a non-GAAP table and analysts do not back it out of their earnings projections. While I have been extremely critical of Amazon's business plan and transparency, they at least focus and report consistent with GAAP. If Amazon had similar non-GAAP reporting to eBay, Analysts would have had them earn about $950 million in 2012 instead of reporting a $40 million loss. No one can tell me eBay's stock compensation expense is less relevant than that of Amazon or Apple.In my research, it appears clear that analysts simply follow the company's reporting preference. If the company focuses on GAAP, analysts use GAAP, if they focus on non-GAAP, analysts use non-GAAP. It has been eight years since stock expensing went into effect, and there is no longer a need to show the difference in earnings with and without stock expensing. It is readily available in the cash flow statement. We should be able to expect a level of consistency within an industry, but apparently that is asking too much.ConclusionAnalysts typically follow a company's lead in what costs they include in their earnings forecasts rather than maintain a consistent approach to earnings forecasts across all companies within an industry. This leads to misleading comparisons of company valuations due to some stocks having inflated past and forward EPS forecasts.Disclosure: I am short AMZN.

1341451,47561,2013-04-15T09:15:53-04:00,,"With over 100 million active users, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is the world's largest online marketplace. Founded just 18 years ago, the company has made strategic acquisitions, formed partnerships, and struck deals to allow for continued growth. The stock started off slow in 2013, but has since rallied and could continue on much higher.The year that wasIn January, eBay released its fourth quarter and annual earnings for 2012 [see call transcript]. It was an impressive year and management had positive guidance going forward. Take a look at the highlights from the report.Fourth Quarter 2012 Results (year-over-year comparison):2012 Annual Results (compared to 2011 annual results):2012 was clearly a strong year for eBay. The $175 billion of commerce volume is the total commerce and payment volume across all of its business unit and this far exceeded expectations. The majority of growth occurred in the fourth quarter and has carried over in to 2013.Mobile growth and PayPalManagement said it best when they stated, ""Mobile continues to rewrite the commerce playbook."" It is for this reason they have placed more focus on its growth and the development of new ideas to grab more of the market. eBay's mobile payments exceeded $13 billion in 2012, more than double the volume of 2011.PayPal was even more impressive than mobile, with $14 billion in mobile payment volume, tripling the prior year. Management expects both units to reach $20 billion in 2013. PayPal, who was acquired by eBay in 2002, has become one of the main catalysts of growth. It currently has about 123 million active users, with 6 million of those being added in the fourth quarter.Check out PayPal's key statistics from 2012:In-store solutionsSince the start of 2011, PayPal has been working diligently to increase its presence both online and offline. It recently reached a deal with Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS) to allow consumers to pay for products in-store using their PayPal accounts. Discover is a direct banking, payment solutions, and credit card provider. By partnering, PayPal now has access to millions of merchants nationwide while giving customers another speedy checkout option.The cost of the in-store payment process is minimal to both companies, as it will not require any new software for merchants. The President of Discover Payment Services stated, ""This initiative will result in real change and innovation for the industry by bringing new technologies to the point of sale that benefits merchants and PayPal customers."" I think both PayPal and Discover will experience substantial payment growth from this partnership.2013 expectationsFor the full year 2013, eBay expects the following results:From these projections, earnings would rise a solid 15.7% while revenues increase 15.5% The most important statistic to note is the $200 billion in expected total commerce volume. This would be a 14.3% increase year-over-year and would put the company about two years away from achieving a quarter of a trillion dollars in total volume.Stock snapshotIf eBay traded at the same multiple of 28.8 after reporting 2013 numbers, it could rise above $78 by next January based on expectations. I do not think it will appreciate that quickly, but I do see a rise above $65 by the conclusion of 2013. The $65 level is very attainable for a company of this caliber.Bottom lineeBay is experiencing worldwide growth thanks to its marketplace and PayPal's growing account base. The stock has risen over 10% in the last month, so it would be smart to wait for it to pull back before buying in. It also reports earnings on April 17, so you may want to wait to read over the report before making a decision. I currently own a position and will continue to add to it on any weakness.Disclosure: I am long EBAY. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1275831,29121,2013-03-15T00:17:25-04:00,,"Past Performance: Over the past four years, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has been a chronic ""under promise and over deliver"" company. eBay has not missed EPS expectations in a single quarter the last four years. A major driver for growth has been the mobile payment system PayPal, owned by eBay. First quarter EPS expectations have consistently grown by ten percent or more over the last four years. That type of growth is impressive during what is widely considered as one of the slowest consumer shopping quarters of the year.Fundamentals: Currently, eBay trades with a P/E of 21.6, a Forward P/E of 18.7, a P/S of 4.70, and a PEG of 1.28. Compare those metrics to that of the consumer services sector and the S&P 500 average. The consumer services sector trades with a P/E of 21.3 and a Forward P/E of 25.5. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is trading with a P/E of 20.5, and a Forward P/E of 17.7.No matter how you look at those fundamentals, eBay looks overvalued at this point in time. The fundamentals show that the recent pullback from a 52-week high of $57.27 on February 1, 2013 was warranted. While eBay decidedly has an edge over retailers with less of an online presence for the consumers, such as Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), EBAY simply can't compete with other online retailers that are a bit more product diversified like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).The Story: PayPal, PayPal, PayPal. It really is that simple. PayPal needs to continue to dominate the mobile payments market for eBay to warrant such overpriced fundamentals. Rumors surrounding the latest iPhone from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have NFC technology being a major selling point of the phone. NFC technology has the potential to make the everyday wallet obsolete, allowing individuals to use their mobile devices such as phones and tablets to pay for items, check out a library book, or store their state IDs on their favorite mobile platforms.EBAY would be directly impacted if NFC technology takes off like many analysts expect. PayPal could face stiff competition from NFC technology and possibly Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) if it ever branches out to develop its own payment system. Also, direct competitor Amazon is developing a cult following for the products it offers. Amazon's CEO has been quoted on numerous occasions stating that he wants to take over the tech world. That isn't exactly a person I want to bet against in the short term.How To Play It: While eBay may be slightly overbought right now, the valuations on a fundamental basis confirm that opinion as well, past earnings releases show it could be a good short term play. eBay recently pulled back from a 52-week high of $57.27 to current levels of just $51.72 at the time this article was written. That pullback may represent an opportune time to get in the stock before earnings are released strictly as a short-term play. After earnings, I would be looking to sell the stock before a correction in price brings the fundamentals back in line (a Forward P/E less than the S&P 500, and a PEG closer to 0.90). My 52-week price target: $61.18.Disclosure: I am long AAPL. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

I've generally been bullish on eBay but I thought it would be interesting to take another look at the stock.Much Of eBay's Value Lies In PaypalThis is no surprise and it's something I've been saying for years. eBay was able to leverage its position as an auction leader to get a solid customer base on Paypal and secure its spot as the default online payment method. That continues to be the case years later. Could Paypal improve? Yes, no doubt about it. But I would argue that Paypal has done a solid job in keeping up with the competition by launching platforms for offline transactions, decent mobile apps, etc. On Wednesday, Paypal launched an iPad version of its ""Paypal here"" product to better compete with Square, one of its main competitors. Of course, many players continue to compete in the space including formidable ones such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) even though it's not clear how their strategies will play out. How far could Facebook credits evolve? What are Google's plan with its wallet? And how will it leverage its Android platform to do so?The main point though remains. Paypal remains by far the most used product and I don't think that is likely to change anytime soon. Through my online company as well as my personal use, I do many transactions every day with consumers and other businesses. In almost all cases, both parties assume that the payment will be done through Paypal. It creates a network effect similar to what Facebook has been able to build where it becomes very difficult to leave and start paying through another method. Possible of course. But difficult.eBay Marketplaces Are Not DeadWhile it has certainly been a more challenging environment, I don't think there's any doubt that CEO John Donahoe has done a good job reviving that part of the business and while it's not clear to me that there are as many growth opportunities, eBay is certainly getting the most out of its marketplaces and is clearly #2 to Amazon in terms of ecommerce. Not a bad place to be in an exploding market. Just take a look at revenues in the past few years in eBay's 2 main segments:Red line: marketplace revenuesBlue line: payments revenuesOverall, both the revenues and earnings per share are growing at very healthy paces which I don't see changing anytime soon. Just look at the past and expected (assuming flat growth) EPS numbers:ValuationThat certainly brings up a good question in my opinion. If I expect close to 20% or so of EPS growth for the next 5 years for eBay, that would put the EPS at around $6 by 2018 and at a 13 P/E or so, I get a price of $78. While that is a 50% increase over its current price, it is over a few years so the actual expected return is much closer to 10% per year. It's not bad and I certainly think that eBay is worth buying but I do think there is more upside in some other names such as Facebook and Google.One of the benefits of eBay though is the limited downside in my opinion. As long as no competing services to Paypal gain significant traction, it will be able to increase revenues quite easily and maintain its pricing. Even big players are struggling to find a strategy that would help them become the ""default"" payment method.Overall A Solid Stock To HoldI would not describe eBay as my top pick but I do think it's a solid holding at this point given the upside limited risk involved. I do expect its Paypal unit to continue driving solid growthDisclosure: I am long FB, EBAY, GOOG. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1158321,24063,2013-02-05T16:38:13-05:00,,"By Matt DoironeBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is up 74% since a year ago, with a remarkably steady increase in its stock price over that time, and is now valued at a market capitalization of almost $75 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2012, eBay experienced an 18% increase in revenue compared to the same period in 2011. The growth rate was particularly high in the Payments business, which includes Paypal and is now responsible for 36% of revenue. For the year as a whole, total sales for the company were up 20% so there seems to have been a slight deceleration but still a very strong performance on the top line. eBay has controlled the increase in operating expenses to the point that operating income was up 16% in Q4 2012 versus a year earlier. While on paper the earnings number was down, this was due to extraordinary nonoperating items in the third quarter of 2011, which caused net income to be abnormally high.With the strong business and the rise in the stock price eBay now trades at 29 times trailing earnings, suggesting that the market expects its strong growth to continue. Wall Street analysts expect $2.74 in earnings per share in 2013 (which would make for a current-year P/E of 21) and $3.20 on a forward basis. That makes for a forward earnings multiple of only 18, and presumably if the company was on this trajectory some level of improvement would continue beyond that point. We would like to see a cheaper price in terms of historical performance, but the growth rates have been impressive and it may be worth considering eBay as a potential ""growth at a reasonable price"" stock.Billionaire Stephen Mandel's Lone Pine Capital owned almost 13 million shares of eBay at the end of September (see Mandel's stock picks); Mandel is a Tiger Cub, having previously worked at legendary investor Julian Robertson's Tiger Management. Another Tiger Cub, Rob Citrone, manages Discovery Capital Management. That fund increased its stake in eBay by 62% during the third quarter of 2012 to a total of 5.5 million shares (check out more stocks Discovery was buying). SAC Capital Advisors, managed by billionaire Steve Cohen, was also buying shares of eBay during the quarter and closed September with 2.5 million shares in its portfolio (find Cohen's favorite stocks).The closest peer for the e-commerce portion of eBay's business is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon's profits are very low, and were actually strongly negative in the third quarter of last year. Consensus is for $1.48 per share this year, which implies a current-year P/E of 179. Bulls insist that the company is electing to focus on revenue growth and initiatives such as same-day delivery rather than immediate profitability, but we would still avoid the stock at that pricing.We can also compare eBay to Visa Inc (NYSE:V), Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), since we've observed that payments are a growth driver of its overall business and may become the primary source of revenue in the near future. The forward earnings multiples of Visa and Mastercard are in line with eBay's in the high teens. Mastercard stands out for having a trailing P/E of only 24, but that company - while it did see an extraordinarily high growth rate in earnings last quarter - has had modest revenue growth that significantly trails that at eBay and certainly trails the payments business. American Express carries trailing and forward P/Es of 15 and 11, respectively, but top-line growth has been very low there and its net income was actually down sharply in its most recent quarter compared with the same period in the previous year.eBay is expensive in terms of its trailing earnings. However, we do see that it isn't much more expensive than its peers - if at all - and it certainly may be worth it to research the company to see if it can sustain its current growth rates. We would note that it would have to produce earnings growth in line with what it has done in recent quarters, for quite some time, in order to prove undervalued at the current price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: This article is written by Insider Monkey's writer, Matt Doiron, and edited by Meena Krishnamsetty.

1255531,41741,2013-03-07T11:36:35-05:00,,"With eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) up 50% over the last 12 months, is the stock getting a bit ""toppy?"" Not by valuation standards. Based on a sum of the parts valuation it appears that eBay still has room to go higher.The real investment thesis for eBay is the fact that its current multiples are being unfairly held down due to its primary classification as an e-tailer or e-commerce company, which is low-margin, macro-economic sensitive. However, I don't believe investors are appreciating the fact that nearly 40% of eBay's revenues are derived from its payments segment (namely PayPal) which has the opportunity for margin expansion and higher growth. Part of the real beauty of eBay is that the Marketplace (eBay.com), what you know as the auction site, is a cash flow generator, which in turn funds the growth and expansion of PayPal.Sum Of eBay's PartsFor the SOTP valuation, let's break down its two key segments to better calculate eBay's appropriate multiples. So let's find some peers. eBay has two key segments - Marketplace and Payments.For the Marketplace segment, three of the best competitors are Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Overstock (NASDAQ:OSTK) and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). For the Payments segment top peers are Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA).Both Visa and MasterCard have plans to enter the mobile payments market, with Visa teaming up with BlackBerry and MasterCard with ING. eBay and PayPal's big move into mobile payments includes partnering with Discover to give retail outlets the ability to accept PayPal in store via Discover terminals.For eBay's Marketplace peers, Groupon is a relative newcomer that is shaking up the e-commerce market (see if Groupon can turn around without Mason). Amazon continues to be the undisputed leader in the e-commerce market, and Overstock is a smaller e-commerce peer, but a peer nonetheless (check out other e-commerce newcomers).The multiples for the major competitors are outlined below:Blending these multiples based on eBay's sales breakdown gives us the following:Price to Sales. Applying the sales breakdown - 61% for the Marketplace and 39% for payments, and we get a theoretical comparable P/S multiple of 4.5x. The 2014 sales estimates by Wall Street comes out to $18.73 billion, which at the blended P/S multiple of 4.7 puts the potential stock upside at 22%, or to $64.85 per share.Price to Earnings. Applying the sales breakdown - 61% for the Marketplace and 39% for payments, and we get a theoretical comparable P/E multiple of 25x. The 2014 EPS estimates by Wall Street comes out to $3.18, which at the blended P/E multiple of 25 puts the potential stock upside at 50%, or to $79.50 per share.Price to Cash Flow. On a price to cash flow basis, eBay is well below its various competitors, where eBay trades at 19x cash flow, and its peer (blended) P/CF comes in at 32x.eBay is cheap. Based on the brief SOTP valuation above, eBay is indeed cheap, but it also appears to be a compelling ""growth at a reasonable price"" opportunity. Wall Street estimates for long-term earnings growth at 15%, the price to earnings to growth ratio comes in at 1.27, with a ratio below 2.0 being a solid opportunity (read more about eBay's GARP).News of late includes eBay's fourth quarter earnings results, which included EPS in line with estimates, but its balance sheet remains very healthy - cash on hand is upwards of $9.4 billion after the company managed to generate $1.09 billion in free cash flow for 4Q, up 265% quarter over quarter. eBay is quite a compelling investment. The stock is one of the under-appreciated online retailers with Amazon getting the blunt of the attention. eBay's strength is in part coming from a turnaround in its Marketplace segment, but will be driven longer-term by its Payments segment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1199961,41941,2013-02-18T03:35:43-05:00,,"Executive Summary:We believe that eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is a medium quality company with a Business Quality Score of 6 based on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 is best). Also, shares of eBay appear to be overvalued based on a discounted cash flow analysis. eBay stock would need to fall 40.4% to reach fair value based on the closing price of $56.70/share for eBay shares on 02-15-2013.Business Quality Analysis:eBay has a Business Quality Score of 6 out of 10 based on an analysis of historical data. We assign a Business Quality Score to each company undergoing analysis. The score is based on a scale of 1 to 10 with a value of 10 indicating the best possible Business Quality Score. Our Business Quality Score is a proprietary metric which takes into account the 10 year historical performance of the company. Performance is measured considering the absolute performance (and trends) in revenues, earnings, profit margins, and returns on assets/equity.Low Business Quality Scores (3 or lower) indicate companies that are in a cyclical or commodity business. These businesses have erratic revenues and earnings with associated low profit margins and poor returns on capital. Low quality companies operate in highly competitive/cyclical businesses where consistent profits are nearly impossible to achieve.Medium Business Quality Scores (4 to 6) indicate an average quality business that operates in a business environment that is not overly cyclical in nature. Also, the products or services these businesses provide are not yet commoditized but do operate in a highly competitive business environment. Moreover, these businesses do not have durable competitive advantages that will allow these businesses to earn consistently high returns on capital. Companies with a medium Business Quality Score can sometimes be good investments if bought at deeply discount prices and sold at fair value. This is in contrast to investments in businesses with high Business Quality Scores where paying fair value for shares can yield good returns if held for the long term.High Business Quality Scores (7 or higher) indicate companies that are in high quality businesses with some type of durable competitive advantages that keep competitors at bay. These businesses typically have steadily rising revenues and earnings with associated high profit margins and high returns on capital.Revenue:eBay's revenues have had good performance over the last 10 years growing at an annualized rate of 20.6%. We consider this to be great performance. Also, we believe that revenues will grow steadily albeit at a lower annualized rate of 12% in the next decade.Earnings Per Share:eBay's earnings grew at an annualized growth rate of 19.3% over the last decade. However, the earnings were not consistent with huge earnings shortfalls in 2007, 2010 and 2012. In fact, earnings dropped 68.4% in 2007, 25.7% in 2010, and 19.1% in 2012. Wide variation in earnings is not indicative of a high quality business with strong competitive advantages. eBay's performance in this regard is one reason we gave eBay a medium level Business Quality Score of 6. However, we believe that eBay has solved many of its problems and that eBay will have annualized earnings growth of about 12% in future years.A company's earnings per share is a measure of profitability for a company. The earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net income attributable to the common stock by the average number of common shares outstanding. One drawback in using earnings as a profitably measure is that it does not consider the amount of assets needed to generate the earnings. Earning the same profit using fewer assets is more profitable but this is not captured in the earnings per share calculation.High quality companies will have steadily rising earnings that do not vary greatly through a full business cycle (expansion-recession-expansion). Investing in high quality companies is fairly easy assuming an investor has realistic profit expectations and has the patience to wait for a reasonable stock price relative to the company's value.Lower quality (cyclical) companies will have earnings that vary greatly over a business cycle. Often these cyclical companies will experience a drastic reduction in earnings during economic recessions. Investment profits can be had with investments in cyclical companies but the timing of the buying and selling of the investment must be in sync with the ebb and flow of the stock market. Typically, the stock market will start to recover about 6 months before the economy comes out of recession. However, this point in time is not obvious in the moment and is only known latter with the benefit of hindsight. Furthermore, timing when to sell a cyclical stock is even more difficult. Timing the stock market is a matter of luck so it is best to stick with the higher quality stocks where market timing is not as critical to investing success.Net Profit Margin:eBay has had net profit margins in the range of 4.5% to 27.7% over the last 10 years with an average net profit margin of 20.6%. eBay's net profit margin was above 18.5% in 9 out of 10 years. We expect the net profit margin to hover around its long term average of 20% in the coming years.The net profit margin is net income divided by net revenues. For non-retailing companies, a consistent net profit margin of 7% or higher is an indicator of a good company with some type of durable competitive advantage. In the retailing sector a net profit margin in the range of 2.5% to 5% is the norm even for the best companies. Ideally, the net profit margin should be steady or rising over the past 10 years.Return On Assets:eBay has had a return on assets in the range of 2.4% to 14.1% over the last decade. eBay's performance in this regard is pretty good considering that the return on assets was above 8.1% in 9 out of 10 years. We expect the return on assets to hover around eBay's long term average return on assets of 10% in the coming decade.Return on assets is a measure of how much profit is generated from a company's assets independent of how much debt is used to finance the acquisition of those assets. The return on assets is sometimes a better measure of profitability than return on equity because the return on equity can be significantly increased by adding more debt to a company's balance sheet. Adding more debt to a company can inflate profits but comes at the price of a greater risk of bankruptcy.Measuring profitability using the return on assets does not have this problem because to calculate the return on assets the net income plus the interest expense net of income tax savings is divided by the average total assets of the company. Thus, by dividing the net income (adjusted for the affects of debt financing) by the total assets (debt + equity) of the company it cancels out the positive effects of debt.The return on assets is great for comparing the profitability of companies with different levels of debt in their capital structures. Generally speaking, a consistent return on assets of about 7% or more is a good indication of a good business with some type of durable competitive advantage. One exception to this rule of thumb is the banking sector where a return on assets of just 2% is considered exceptional.Return On Equity:eBay has had a return on equity in the range of 3.1% to 19.4% during the last 10 years. eBay's performance in this regard is quite poor considering that the return on equity was below the critical 15% level in 7 out of 10 years. We believe that eBay's return on equity will continue at its long term average of about 13% for the foreseeable future.Return on equity measures a company's performance in financing and using assets to generate earnings. In contrast to the return on assets, the return on equity considers the affect of financing in generating profits. To calculate the return on equity the net income (minus dividends paid on preferred stock) is divided by the average common shareholder's equity. As a rule of thumb, a consistent return on equity of 15% or more (assuming a reasonable level of debt financing) is an indicator of a good company with some type of durable competitive advantage.Valuation:A discounted cash flow analysis revealed a fair value for eBay shares of $33.78/share. We use the percent of revenue method in our discounted cash flow analysis. The model assumes an average weighted cost of capital [WACC] of 9.1%. Our WACC is calculated using a proprietary formula unique to our firm. An average annualized revenue growth rate of 12.0% is projected over the next 10 years. An average annualized revenue growth rate of 3.0% is assumed for every year thereafter.Conclusion:eBay appears to be a medium quality company with an overvalued stock price. Based on a fair value of $33.78/share and the eBay closing stock price of $56.70/share (on 02-15-2013) the stock must fall 40.4% to reach fair value.Disclaimer: Ulfberht Capital is not an investment advisor.

1262271,37511,2013-03-11T07:33:11-04:00,,"eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) has returned 46.57% in the last 52 weeks, trades at 26X PE, with an annualized average revenue growth rate of 24% in the last 3 years. It owns a premiere online marketplace and market leading payments systems in PayPal and Bill Me Later®. In most cases, it is a good thing to have at least one cash cow, and in eBay's case, even better to have two. If you are wondering why all this positivity scares me, it is because, in my opinion, what has taken them here will not necessarily take them there. It bothers me even more, because the stock is trading at a level that assumes that their growth rate, relevance, and competitive position will continue to drive similar levels of revenue growth, which I just can't see.My overriding worry is that the company has not innovated enough within its business environment and against its competitors in core revenue generating areas. For a tech company, inadequate innovation can take a company from dominance to irrelevance in a very short time frame with very little opportunity to catch up once users move on.Payment Systems:If necessity is the mother of invention, there has been a lot of necessity in the payment systems sector. The necessity has been the need to adopt new technologies [NFC] to embrace the inevitable and rapid transition to mobile platforms which have presented new payment opportunities. Another catalyst was the antitrust lawsuit between the National Retail Federation VS. Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA). Though this settlement of $7B is still playing out, one of the outcomes has been an agreement between Wal-Mart, Target and other big retailers to create their own payment systems, and this cuts off a critical growth area for PayPal.Payment services accounted an average of 38% of total revenue for the last 3 years for eBay Inc, which underscores its importance to the company. PayPal was the first viable online alternative for carded or paper money transfers. By becoming more secure and easy to use, it expanded internationally, including Australia and China, through partnerships and increasing services to current users. It has not evolved with newer technologies like NFC or provided an alternative to brick-and-mortar stores that they can rely on to escape transaction fees with cards that cut into their profits. To understand how fast this sector is changing, I will add a short list of some emerging concepts poised to impact eBay's payments revenue and growth potential: Square, Google Wallet, MasterPass digital payments from MasterCard Inc., Isis, and Visa payWave from Visa Inc. (V).Marketplaces:The marketplace platforms owned by eBay Inc. brings together buyers and sellers for fixed price or auction items. eBay Inc. has invested and modernized its marketplace access point experience to ensure that the platforms are equally functional through traditional or mobile devices. It has also used its payment systems to complement the shopping experience. To expect that eBay Inc.'s marketplace will continue to grow briskly is like arguing against the growth of online technologies, the importance of social media and the ability of sellers and buyers to find other ways to connect online. It is also like arguing that the ""free shipping"" phenomenon that is gripping Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a gimmick, even though they offer competitive prices and near instant gratification that an auction process delays.The ability of established brands to reach consumers through other channels like Facebook and Twitter also enables them to close their eBay stores and drive traffic directly to their sites. I always thought it was a stupid idea for eBay to allow established brands to open eBay stores, since it diluted the adventure of finding unique items. But, their departure from eBay came with a business lesson for me. It demonstrated that as sellers got bigger and more established on eBay, they would be inclined to leave so they can maximize the revenue opportunities on their own platforms.Revenue GrowthFor companies that are expanding internationally and actively acquiring other companies, it is important to understand the makeup of their revenue. eBay Inc. has been active in both areas, and acquisitions in the last 3 years have contributed its revenue growth rate. Some of the more recent acquisitions include shopping.com, Zong, GSI Commerce and Hunch. Without adding International revenue U.S. sales growth, which is the core of the business, actually dropped from 30% growth from 2010-2011 to 24% from 2011-2012.Total International revenue was $7.3B and GSI alone was 5% and 8% of total revenue in 2011 and 2012 respectively. In 2011 eBay Inc. also accounted for a onetime gain of $1.6B for the sale of Skype. These are good but indicative of a subtle struggle to grow revenue organically which will be exacerbated as payments systems and marketplace revenue slows down against competition.Conclusion:The market has been too bullish on EBAY, pushing it above its 50 and 200 day averages of $45.29 and $38.51 respectively. With a DCF calculation assuming a growth rate of 18%, which I think is generous going forward, you get a fair price of about $39. eBay Inc. was an early entrant into the online marketplace industry and was able to build a leading market share position, but I think the stock is due for a pull back. The lack of significant entry barriers, low setup costs, and emerging technologies are changing the way buyers and sellers relate and pay for transactions.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1143271,42171,2013-01-30T10:19:00-05:00,,"There's no denying the growing trend towards online shopping. The US online sales grew 17.3% Y/Y and account for 5.2% of the total retail sales according to data from the United States Census Bureau. Similarly, e-Commerce in Europe is estimated to have grown 20% in 2012. In developing countries, especially the BRICs, the growth rate is expected to be much faster due to increasing internet penetration. According to Forrester, over the next five years the e-commerce market in India and China is expected to grow at compound annual growth rates of 57% and 25% respectively.In my opinion, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is well positioned to grow with the market as well as increase its market share for the next several years. Here's why:Strong and Consistent Growth in Core Marketplaces BusinessDuring the last couple of years, eBay has made a number of changes to its platform to revamp its image and improve buyer and seller experience in Marketplaces. The changes in the new user interface include prioritizing top sellers in its search engine, adding the shopping cart feature for buyers as well as rolling out a new eBay logo. These changes have helped improved eBay's image from just an auction website for second hand merchandise to a one stop online retail shop with a wide selection as well as competitive prices. The results appear to be showing in its earnings over the past few quarters. eBay's Q4 earnings presentation showed that the revenue of its Marketplaces business grew 16% (fx-neutral) Y/Y to $2.05B. Within Marketplaces, the Fixed Price Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) which now accounts for 68% of total Marketplaces GMV has been growing at a rate of more than 20% (fx-neutral) over the last three quarters. The Auction GMV has also continued to grow at a rate of around 4-5% on an fx-neutral basis.Many people have questioned if eBay can continue with this exceptional growth now that it has 'fixed' its Marketplaces business with site enhancements. In my opinion, eBay's Q4 earnings suggest that this growth can continue:Source: Company ReportsMultiple Opportunities for PayPaleBay's acquisition of PayPal in 2002 for $1.5B continues to pay dividends. Q4 earnings release shows that Total Payment Volume (TPV) on eBay grew 18% Y/Y (fx-neutral) whereas the merchant services TPV grew 28% (fx neutral) over the same period. Within Merchant Services, the Bill Me Later (BML) TPV grew 31% Y/Y.I believe that PayPal can continue to show strong revenue growth combined with expanding transaction margins. Here's why:The Latest Trend: M-CommerceeBay has established a strong foothold in mobile e-commerce. In the Q4 2012 conference call, CEO John Donahoe told us that eBay's mobile apps have been downloaded up to 120 million times. This accounts for more than 50% of a total of around 234 million combined Marketplaces and PayPal active users. In 2012, the mobile e-commerce grew 120% Y/Y to $13B which accounts for 19.2% of the $67B non-vehicle GMV. This is very impressive considering that right now m-commerce accounts for just 9% of the e-commerce in the U.S., according to comScore. Moreover, mobile payments through PayPal grew to $14B, a Y/Y growth rate of 250%. These mobile payments account for around 9.7% of PayPal's $145B TPV which is also quite remarkable. In 2013, eBay expects the mobile e-commerce to grow to $20B from $13 billion, a growth rate of 46% whereas the mobile payments are also expected to grow to $20 billion, a growth rate of 42%. These statistics confirm eBay's status as the market leader in mobile e-commerce.ConclusioneBay has turned its self around remarkably in the past couple of years and the stock price reflects that. Throughout this rally investors have had concerns about valuation and were proven to be wrong time and again. With most of the enhancements on its website now complete, eBay has established a solid platform from which to grow on. The Marketplaces user base is expanding rapidly which, in my opinion, will bring long term benefits for both Marketplaces as well as providing tailwinds for the payments business. The GeC business, which I haven't touched upon earlier, has been growing at a stable but solid rate as well. eBay has firmly established itself in mobile which is expected to be the next big thing in e-commerce. With growth prospects bright, I would value the eBay stock at 20 times the consensus 2014 EPS estimate of 3.20 which turns out to be $62. I also expect strong user growth in 2012 translating into growth in GMV/user ratio in years to come driving strong revenue growth. This revenue growth will drive operating leverage thereby expanding margins across the board. This leads me to believe that there could be potential upside to this consensus EPS estimate.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: This article was written by Dividend Pros' Analyst covering technology."
1144441,30811,2013-01-30T15:32:49-05:00,,"Shares of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) have appreciated significantly by 75.7% over the past 12 months. At $55.66, the stock is trading near its 52-week high of $56.66 attained just recently. Should investors ride on the uptrend momentum? In this article, I will elaborate on my stock valuation analysis which may assist you in formulating the appropriate investment decision.Relative ValuationSell-side analysts on average predict the firm's revenue, EBITDA and EPS to grow at solid CAGRs of 15.6%, 16.0% and 16.0%, respectively, over the current and next few years (see comparable analysis chart below). The consensus estimates outperform the averages of 14.3%, 14.7%, and 15.4%, respectively, for a group consisting of eBay's primary peers. However, the firm's EBITDA margin is forecasted to expand by only 0.3% over the same period, compared to the group average of 0.8%. On the profit side, eBay has demonstrated a superior margin performance as all of the company's margin metrics are considerably above the par. The firm's capital return measures, however, are below the peer averages. eBay carries a relatively higher level of debt as reflected by the firm's above-average debt to EBITDA and debt to capitalization ratios. In terms of liquidity, the company's free cash flow margin is below the par. Both its current and quick ratios are just slightly below the peer averages, reflecting a somewhat healthy balance sheet performance.To summarize the financial comparisons, eBay's above-average growth potential and superior profitability should be the primary support to the stock valuation. However, given the company's mediocre performance in capital return and liquidity, I believe the stock's fair value should not be significantly above the peer-average level. eBay is currently trading at 12.6x forward EBITDA and 20.5x forward EPS, compared to the peer-average multiples of 9.8x and 24.8x, respectively, indicating a fairly in-line valuation level. A further look at the stock's PEG ratio, which is at 1.4x compared to the markedly higher peer average at 2.7x, however, would suggest eBay's valuation remains somewhat attractive after the significant price appreciation.From a historical standpoint, eBay's valuation appears to be somewhat rich. The stock's trailing EV/EBITDA multiple of 16.5x is now trading at 50.2% premium above its 5-year historical average of 11.0x (see chart below) despite the fact that 1) eBay's capital return metrics including ROE, ROA, and ROIC have all experienced a downtrend over the past 5 years; 2) the firm's various profitability margins have remained flat over the period; and 3) the market's estimated revenue and EBITDA growth rates for the next few years are slightly below the level in 5 years ago (see charts below).DCF ValuationI also performed a DCF valuation which incorporates the market's consensus revenue and EBITDA estimates from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2017 (see DCF chart below). The purpose of this analysis is not aimed to derive the fair value but to gauge the various assumptions embedded in the current share price and perform a ballpark reasonability check.The terminal revenue growth rate is set at 3.0%, which is slightly higher than the estimated US long-term inflation rate. The terminal EBITDA margin is assumed to be consistent with the market's estimated margin for fiscal 2017. Other free cash flow related items including tax expense, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditure, and non-cash working capital investment are projected based on their historical figures relative to the total revenue as those ratios have been trending steadily over time. A company-specific risk premium of 2.8% is applied in the cost of equity calculation to account for the financial forecast risk. As such, based on a WACC of 10.0%, a terminal growth rate of 3.0%, and an implied terminal EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.9x, the DCF model yields a stock value of $55.93, which is quite close to the current share price at $56.66. Since the key assumptions (i.e. WACC, terminal growth rate, terminal EBITDA margin) used in the model are fairly reasonable, the analysis suggests eBay is now appropriately valued. Based on the sensitivity tables and a fixed terminal growth rate at 3.0%, a slightly higher WACC at 11.6% would drag down the stock value to $46.06 or a lower terminal EBITDA margin of 32.2% would imply a stock value of $51.41. Both scenarios would suggest an average downside of approximately 14.0% from the current share price. Given that those less favorable assumptions are not really unrealistic, the margin of safety on eBay's valuation appears to be mediocre.On the qualitative side, eBay's fundamentals remain solid. Except for Q3 2012, the company has consecutively beaten revenue and EPS estimates over the past 8 quarters (per Thomson One). After the recent Q4 2012 earnings release, brokers including Wedbush, Stifel Nicolaus, and Needham have all reiterated their buy ratings on the stock and raised their price targets to above the $60 level. In a recent research note, Morningstar's research analyst, R.J. Hottovy, elaborated on his long-term view on the company (sourced from Thomson One, Equity Research), which I tend to agree:Bottom line, I expect eBay's healthy business fundamentals and strong market position would continue to drive solid growth down the road. However, given that the stock's valuation has picked up significantly, I recommend establishing a long position by selling out-of-money put options to either collect upfront premium or take an opportunity to acquire the shares at a lower valuation level.The comparable analysis and DCF charts are created by the author, all other charts are sourced from Capital IQ, and all historical and consensus estimated financial data in the article and the charts is sourced from Capital IQ unless otherwise noted.Disclosure: I am long EBAY.

1130471,24480,2013-01-24T10:20:24-05:00,,"eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) fan club is celebrating not just solid holiday quarter earnings announced last week, but the emergence of the online auction house and retailer as a viable rival to the all-powerful Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).While it survived the dot-com collapse to become part of our cultural landscape, eBay ran into tougher waters a few years later, as Amazon ramped up its own merchant marketplace and consumers found all kinds of rivals springing up promising that they, too, could deliver great online deals. With Amazon nipping at its heels among consumers who favor doing their shopping on a single site, and smaller, niche websites attracting those with an interest in finding fashion bargains, art and antiques, or home furnishings, eBay was struggling, reporting double-digit declines in shopping revenues.Today, that seems to be a thing of the past. True, the company's net income looks low compared with the fourth quarter of last year, when eBay benefited from a big gain on the sale of Skype to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). But investors - correctly - are looking past that tough year-over-year comparison to see what's happening to eBay's revenue, and finding a lot to love. PayPal, which eBay snapped up a decade ago, is proving to be a cash cow. Its revenue jumped 24%. At its current rate of growth, PayPal's electronic payments business may even outstrip the original online auction and retailing segments to become eBay's single-largest division. As a cashless society takes shape, it's conceivable that PayPal could become the tail that wags eBay's dog.While that transition to e-payments builds gradually, eBay is making a success of another transition that's further along: the shift to mobile. PayPal is a key ingredient in this, with the company's strategy revolving around convincing consumers to use a PayPal app as an alternative to cash or a credit card for everything from picking up a coffee and a bagel to paying for a dinner. The mobile payments world is still taking shape - only 10% of PayPal payments were processed by mobile users - but PayPal's pioneering status in the industry and its relationship to eBay gives it an edge, and this is a business that is only going to grow. eBay isn't squandering that: New initiatives include mobile ""check ins"" that speed up service and minimize time spent trying to pay for goods or services and the introduction of a new kind of cash or debit card tied to PayPal accounts.eBay's strategy is winning new fans. The company isn't trying to cling to its original business model, but has shown itself to be willing to branch into uncharted waters. It is proving it can respond effectively to new trends, such as the transformation created by smartphones. Moreover, its success in mobile and in the payments universe means that its future won't be shaped as dramatically by a head-to head rivalry with Amazon, as might otherwise have been the case.It's already clear which of those two companies investors would prefer to own. Over the last 12 months, eBay's stock has soared about 80% while that of Amazon has climbed 43%. eBay trades at just over 27 times trailing 12-month earnings; Amazon, which has reported losses of late, has a P/E ratio that is, for all intents and purposes, irrelevant. Looking at the rate of revenue growth at the two companies is more relevant: While it's higher at Amazon, on a year-over-year basis it is growing far more rapidly at eBay. That's a pattern that investors like to see.Both companies are e-commerce behemoths, and that isn't likely to change any time soon. The two companies - born in the same corner of Silicon Valley in the same year, and part of the same crop of Internet start-ups - make for an intriguing rivalry. The decision by eBay CEO John Donahoe to build up fixed-price sales reduced the company's reliance on auctions and brought the company into more direct competition with Amazon.But eBay has one major foe, while Amazon must fight a two-front war, fending off challenges from eBay to its core retailing business while chipping away at Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) dominance in the tablet market. On balance, look for investors to give eBay more benefit of the doubt than Amazon in coming quarters.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1117921,22762,2013-01-17T12:57:39-05:00,,"By Leena RaoeBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) Q4 and full-year 2012 earnings hit yesterday afternoon,  with revenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2012 increasing  18 percent to $4 billion, compared to the same period of 2011. The  company reported fourth-quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $751  million, or $0.57 per diluted share, and net income on a non-GAAP basis  of $927 million, or $0.70 per diluted share. Net income was up 22  percent for the quarter.Analysts expected eBay to post earnings of $0.69 cents a share, on revenue of $3.98 billion.eBay says the increase in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was  driven by double-digit user growth across the portfolio, strong gains in  mobile adoption, and accelerating growth in the company’s Marketplaces  business, reflecting a 19 percent increase in U.S. gross merchandise  volume (GMV), excluding vehicles.For the full year, revenue increased 21 percent to $14.1 billion,  compared to 2011. The company reported net income on a GAAP basis of  $2.6 billion, or $1.99 per diluted share, and net income on a non-GAAP  basis of $3.1 billion, or $2.36 per diluted share. eBay says that it  enabled more than $175 billion of commerce volume (ECV) in 2012,  representing growth of 18 percent. ECV is the total commerce and payment  volume across all three business units consisting of Marketplaces GMV,  PayPal merchant services net total payment volume, and GSI global  ecommerce (GeC) merchandise sales.“We had a great finish to an excellent year, with fourth quarter  results exceeding our expectations,” said eBay’s president and CEO John  Donahoe in a release. “eBay Marketplaces in particular had a terrific  fourth quarter, with growth in the U.S. accelerating three points,  outpacing ecommerce.”“Mobile continues to rewrite the commerce playbook, and we continue  to be a mobile commerce and payments leader,” Donahoe added. “eBay  mobile finished the year with $13 billion in volume – more than double  the prior year – and PayPal mobile handled almost $14 billion in payment  volume, more than triple the prior year. In 2013, we expect each to  exceed $20 billion.”PayPal’s active account growth accelerated to 15% and ended the year  with approximately 123 million registered accounts. PayPal added nearly 2  million accounts a month in the fourth quarter, representing the  company’s fastest active account growth rate in years.Payment volume increased 24 percent, producing revenue growth of 24  percent, thanks to merchant and consumer adoption coupled with  geographic expansion. PayPal’s mobile payment volume reached nearly $14  billion in 2012, up more than 250 percent over the prior year, as more  consumers used their smartphones and tablets to pay online.The company’s Marketplaces business delivered a record $2 billion  revenue in the fourth quarter. Active user growth was up because of  mobile site enhancements designed to streamline the shopping experience  on eBay and emerging markets. Mobile commerce volume in 2012 grew more  than 120 percent to $13 billion driven primarily by increased adoption  of eBay’s mobile apps and increased engagement from product innovation.  eBay’s suite of mobile apps attracted more than 4 million new customers  in 2012.GSI revenue for the quarter increased 10 percent to $398 million  driven primarily by a 17 percent increase in GeC merchandise sales.  Same-store sales grew 19 percent.The theme of the quarter (and the year) for eBay was mobile. eBay and  PayPal had a very mobile holiday this year. PayPal said that Black Friday global mobile payments volume were up 193 percent from last year and eBay’s total mobile volume in the U.S. was up 153 percent on the day. Thanksgiving also saw similar jumps in spending for the company.Beyond just being the holiday shopping season for eBay and PayPal,  the fourth quarter also brought a few new product additions to the  marketplace, including a redesign. The company expanded its same-day shipping service called eBay No to New York, and partnered with FedEx on shipping for merchants.At the start of the quarter, PayPal CEO David Marcus continued the company’s reorganization and restructuring. The company also rolled out a number of payments pilots in international markets, including mobile check-ins. Additionally, PayPal debuted  a branded cash loading card, called the PayPal My Cash Card, which  allows users to load up their PayPal accounts using cash instead of bank  transfers."

Neiman Marcus was among the first ""Fashion Outlets"" eBay launched in the U.S. in 2011, selling clothing shoes and accessories under its off-price brand, Last Call By Neiman Marcus.Ginger Reeder, Vice President of Corporate Communications for Neiman Marcus Group Services, said the closure of the Last Call By Neiman Marcus eBay store was permanent. The last orders were taken from customers on January 7, 2013.""We are always trying new partnerships and this is one where we felt we learned a great deal, but it did not meet all our expectations,"" Reeder told me. ""We parted on good terms with eBay, but we will not be reopening in the future.""In addition to its flagship stores, the retailer operates 33 Neiman Marcus Last Call stores that average approximately 28,000 square feet each in size, according to its annual shareholder report. The Last Call brick-and-mortar stores offer off-price goods purchased directly for resale as well as end-of-season clearance goods from the Neiman Marcus stores, Bergdorf Goodman stores and online operations. The Last Call stores, along with six stores operated under the CUSP name that targets younger customers, generate less than 10% of the retailer's total revenues.The retailer's online sales made up 20.2% of Neiman Marcus' total revenues in fiscal year 2012, 18.9% in fiscal year 2011 and 18.5% in fiscal year 2010. It launched a website under the Neiman Marcus Last Call brand in 2011.Wes Shepherd, CEO of Channel IQ, told me he couldn't speak specifically to the departure of Neiman Marcus from eBay but said a lot more brands are accepting of eBay and the idea of their authorized dealers selling there. Sheperd's company works with manufacturers and retailers and helps manufacturers monitor channels for pricing, policy and trademark infringements on channels, including eBay.eBay launched 20 fashion outlet stores in 2011 as part of its focus on creating tailored vertical shopping experiences in key categories. What did brands want when they came to the eBay channel? eBay CEO John Donahoe promised incremental sales - access to its millions of shoppers.At the time, Donahoe said eBay was working with brands on special promotions, flash sales and ""some other things"" to drive incremental volume for the brands, specifically mentioning Coach (COH) and telling analysts that eBay was working with the Neiman team. ""I feel good about our ability to sign additional merchants,"" he said, and was making ""good steady progress.""

1154181,42981,2013-02-04T10:39:17-05:00,,"The promising trends seen in recent global economic data provide a backdrop for what could be a good year for equities. The United States drew down inventories in the fourth quarter while consumer sentiment and cautious optimism pushed higher. Companies are poised to place new orders and restock those shelves. This is great news for the intermediate-term and could spark sustainable long-term economic growth. Given this environment, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is strategically positioned to acquire a larger portion of the benefits relative to peers.Moreover, eBay will steal market share from major credit card companies, such as Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA), as the company penetrates the offline payment market. eBay CEO, John Donahoe, mentioned on the recent Q4 earnings call that the company ""enabled"" 19% of global e-commerce and 2% of global retail. These facts are exciting because it demonstrates the company's growth potential. The three most important drivers of eBay's continued success are: marketplaces, payment processing and mobile. This company also has a very strong fundamental foundation and an attractive technical backdrop.MarketplaceseBay first hit the scene in 1995 with the popular auction site that blossomed into a thriving market for retailers of all sizes. The company has since expanded to offer more specific markets to buyers and sellers around the globe. StubHub.com is one example of these specific marketplaces. This site facilitates sporting and entertainment tickets' transactions. The Marketplaces segment of eBay brought in $2 billion in revenue during Q4 2012. The company's traditional auction methods have taken the back seat to fixed-price sales instead. The fixed-price listings accounted for 70% of global merchandise volume during the previous quarter. Also, eBay's Marketplaces contributed to a 20% increase in same-store sales for top sellers on the sites. Top sellers attributed 42% of merchandise volume during the quarter. Margins in the Marketplaces segment remained flat over the year but up 90 basis points during Q4.PaymentsThe Payments segment, notably PayPal, will continue to propel eBay into the 21st century and is truly a trailblazer in the transactions game. This company enables users to seamlessly conduct transactions without sharing financial information. The buyer in the transaction can use a variety of accounts to accommodate the sale. Also, the seller can accept these payments at very little cost. This attribute enables small businesses to become more efficient in processing transactions. It is for these reasons that PayPal will ultimately become the preferred method of conducting transactions.There are currently 123 million active PayPal accounts and 5 million of them were opened during the previous quarter. PayPal handled about 700 million payments in Q4 of 2012. PayPal registered $1.5 billion in revenue for the last quarter. Revenue was up 24% from the same quarter a year ago. The transactions margin was flat over the year but remained at 64.7%. PayPal's margin was down 170 basis points to 23% over the year due to increases in marketing related investments. Basically, PayPal has a lot of room to grow and it is prudent for the company to invest in the future. Long-term shareholders will be handsomely rewarded.PayPal's earnings growth will be driven by the fearless plunge into offline payments. These are transactions that are conducted at the physical business rather than online. This technology is in its infancy and has been adopted by 23 large retailers, such as Jamba Juice. eBay CFO, Bob Swan, described this seamless payment system as relieving ""consumer pain points."" Consumers are able to place orders and pay with a mobile device and ditch the hassle of waiting in line. Another partnership enables consumers to pay for restaurant checks when they finish eating without having to wait around after the meal. These subtle conveniences become adopted quickly once a norm has been established.eBay has been strategically deploying resources to create a seamless payment system with ample options for buyers and sellers. This may be costing a small amount of margin today, but the investment is necessary to create a solid network of users. The point-of-sale payment system will only become truly convenient when consumers can use it everywhere. A recent deal with Discover will open up 7 million locations to offline payments in addition to the current 18,000. Morningstar's reported TTM sales for Visa, American Express (NYSE:AXP), and MasterCard are $48,828 million combined. PayPal is coming for a piece of that pie and could catch them asleep at the wheel. Time will tell, but we should expect to see some market penetration by 2014.MobileeBay has put a multiplier effect on Marketplaces and Payments revenue by embracing the mobile platform. John Donahoe points out that the company monetizes mobile the same way that it monetizes the web so there is an advantage over many technology companies that must derive methods of mobile monetization. Furthermore, users on mobile devices are generally connected 24/7 and are typically more engaged than a user who can only access the site on a computer. PayPal Mobile experienced $14 billion in mobile payment volume during 2012. This is an extraordinary increase of over 300% of volume in 2011. PayPal Mobile will play a critical role in the success of the offline payment systems. The mobile platform was responsible for about 10% of PayPal's total volume last year. The mobile platform also brought 4.3 million new users to eBay and experienced over two times the volume seen in 2011. The company is also beginning an effort to use the mobile platform to bring local buyers and sellers together based on geographic location.Fundamental ValuationeBay booked $1.99 EPS on about $14 billion in revenue during 2012. The historical EPS are displayed in the chart below. eBay's EPS exploded following 2007 and again during 2010. Analysts' current EPS expectations for this year and next year are about $2.40 and $2.84, respectively.The spread between revenue and income reflect a potential for rapid increases in future income. The chart below shows this spread.Huge increases in revenue have hardly trickled into the bottom line mostly as the company continues to invest in future earnings. Although margins have come in somewhat, the company has succeeded in keeping costs in line with peers. eBay's current net profit margin and return on equity are better than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK).Relative price comparisons show that while not expensive, eBay is by no means a cheap stock. eBay has a PE ratio of 19.34, which is less expensive than Google at 23.42. Amazon has a ridiculously high PE ratio so the relative price metrics shown in the chart below provide a better comparison between all of these companies.eBay is priced attractively based on book value but investors have been paying up for sales and cash flow relative to Google and Overstock.com.Technical BackdropThe 5-year chart below illustrates eBay (the white line) vs. the NASDAQ (the blue line). The stock lagged the overall market until about a year ago when it broke out above the [30, 32.5] range. This yearly chart shows a slightly rising triangle pattern (yellow lines) after pivoting off $10.00 in Jan. '09. The triangle becomes squeezed around $31.00 in Feb. '12 and subsequently breaks out to the upside. The stock has simply been channeling a narrow range upward (red lines) since the breakout but is currently testing some levels at the top of the channel.A clearer picture of the near-term action in eBay's stock price is depicted in the six-month chart below. The red lines still indicate the channeling path of the stock. It is clear that investors have been enthusiastic about this stock. The daily price candles reveal two gap-ups in the stock since the beginning of the year and buying volume has outpaced selling volume in both frequency and magnitude over the last six months. Momentum in the stock is currently breaching the upper range of the last six months and has only increased higher than this level one time before. This does not necessarily mean that the stock will fall; it simply means that it will be harder to sustain the strength in upward price movements. The MACD is also contributing an overbought signal. The Bollinger Bands establish a trading range [53, 58] so it would not be surprising to see eBay trade to $58.00 without hesitation. Also, notice that at the beginning of August, the MACD and momentum indicators were acting very similar to how they are acting now and the stock drifted more than 13% higher over the following couple of months.ConsiderationseBay will be a productive growth stock in any investor's long-term portfolio. This is a good time to initiate a position but it would be prudent to leave some cash available to add to the position when/if the market pulls back.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in EBAY over the next 72 hours.

1121301,24491,2013-01-18T17:52:42-05:00,,"Not surprisingly, fantastic growth continued during the fourth quarter at Best Ideas Newsletter holding eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Revenue surged 18% year-over-year to $4 billion, a touch better than consensus expectations. Earnings per share, on a non-GAAP basis, grew 17% compared to a year ago to $0.70.The continued resurgence of the core eBay business continued uninterrupted, as revenue surged 16% year-over-year to $2 billion, which coincided with 16% gross merchandise volume growth ($19.1 billion). While PayPal grabs all the headlines, the performance of eBay's marketplace has been fantastic over the last several quarters. The eBay marketplace, in our view, has reached a similar positioning as Amazon (AMZN) - a testament to how much the site has evolved. The growth of fixed payments, power sellers, and the need for people to generate extra income has certainly been a factor in the growth, but it seems that mobile is having a better-than-anticipated impact on the business. Not only does the mobile application allow consumers to comparison shop, but we think it also spurs spontaneous bidding - a surprisingly effective revenue driver.CEO John Donahue provided some interesting commentary on mobile:Mobile is bringing new users to eBay and delivering strong growth. For 2012, mobile attracted over 4.3 million new users to eBay and generated $13 billion in mobile commerce volume. That's well over twice our volume from the previous year and well ahead of our original $10 billion forecast for the year.PayPal growth was spectacular, as we've come to expect during the past few years. Revenue surged 24% year-over-year, to $1.5 billion, on 24% total payment volume growth that represented over $41 billion in transactions. PayPal's network effect seems to be strengthening, as account openings accelerated during the fourth quarter to the fastest pace in years. PayPal's partnership with Discover (NYSE:DFS) is set to launch in the second quarter of 2013, and we think payments growth could experience a nice boost from physical acceptance. With innovations like pre-ordering that will allow consumers to skip lines, we can see this partnership being highly successful.While competition from PayPal continues to mount with services like V.me from Visa (NYSE:V), as well as Square, we think the growth of the broader electronic payments market will allow PayPal to endure its current growth trajectory.Looking ahead, eBay offered in-line guidance for the first quarter of $0.60-$0.62 in earnings on $3.65-$3.75 billion in revenue. We're not worried that guidance didn't come in ahead of consensus, as we think management is being conservative to temper expectations. 2013 guidance was also in-line with consensus as the company expects revenue of $16-$16.5 billion driving earnings per share of $2.70-$2.75.Overall, we like what 2013 has in store for the firm. Payments growth should remain robust, and the resurgence of the eBay marketplace is a trend we think will prevail.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1114731,24051,2013-01-16T09:43:18-05:00,,"eBay, Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is expected to report fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, Jan. 16. The whisper number is $0.69, in line with the analyst estimate. Whisper numbers range from a low of $0.67 to a high of $0.71. EBAY has a 65% positive surprise history, having topped the whisper in 35 of the 54 earnings reports for which we have data.Earnings HistoryThe average price movement (starting at the next market open) within 10 trading days of all earnings reports is -1.1%. The strongest price movement of +5.6% comes within 30 trading days when the company reports earnings that beat the whisper number, and -3.9% within 10 trading days when the company reports earnings that miss the whisper number.Last quarter, the company reported earnings one cent short of the whisper number. Following that report, the stock realized a 4.0% loss in 20 trading days before turning and seeing a 9% gain in 30 trading days. Enter your expectation and view more earnings information here.Knowing how likely a stock's price will move following an earnings report will help you make better trades. Many investors believe that beating or missing the whisper number has the greatest impact on stock movement. If the number is exceeded, the stock is rewarded and prices move higher. If the number is missed, the stock is punished and prices move lower. Unlike the analyst estimate, the ""whisper number"" from WhisperNumber.com has actually been proven to have a greater impact on stock movement.Since 1998, WhisperNumber.com has been tracking and publishing ""crowd sourced estimates"" for earnings. We call these earnings expectations whisper numbers. The ""crowd"" that provides us with whisper numbers is primarily individual investors and traders just like you who have registered with our site.We are an independent financial research firm. We have no affiliations with investment banks, investment management, or corporate organizations that could compromise our data or analysis. So no relationships with the bad guys or so-called professional analysts.As for our data collection, methodology, and price reaction accuracy: For the past 15 years we have remained consistent with data collection and methodology, and our data has proven itself over that time. We also have two independent academic studies supporting the premise that investor expectations for quarterly earnings (our whisper numbers) provide greater returns when used as an investment vehicle, and have a greater impact on stock movement than analysts' consensus estimates.A company's ""price reaction"" to the whisper number expectation is the key -- on average, companies that exceed the whisper are ""rewarded,"" while companies that miss are ""punished"" following an earnings report. According to the Wall Street Journal, ""positive surprises are becoming so common they are nearly universal. They are predetermined in a cynical tango-clinch between companies and the analysts who cover them. All the numbers are gamed at this point."" This is why the proprietary whisper number we provide is a more useful and viable alternative to analysts' estimates.All trading involves risk and the information presented is not intended to be a recommendation of any kind.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1101401,26891,2013-01-08T18:08:14-05:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has been a huge player in the online market for consumers. Though not as large as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay has been able to stay relevant, to say the least. The acquisition of PayPal has been huge and has boosted eBay to new heights. But is the growth real? Today, I want to take a look at eBay and see if its growth is the real deal. First, let's take a look at the one-year and three-year charts:Click to enlarge images.One-Year ChartSource: Stockcharts.com.Three-Year ChartSource: Stockcharts.com.On the one-year chart, we used the 20-day, 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. We did this because it is a shorter time frame than that of the three-year chart. But it looks great. The chart is strong, with eBay finding strong support from the 50-day SMA and has not tested the 200-day SMA once.The three-year chart is slightly more troubling. While the chart has recovered nicely in the last year, in 2011 eBay struggled mightily, violating the 200-day SMA many times over an eight-month time frame. Aside from that, eBay has been very strong and while it doesn't have the prettiest long-term chart, I still think it shows strength.The next step is to really take a look at the growth. The best way to analyze a company's growth is by looking at the growth of revenues and earnings per share (EPS). The following two tables will do just that. First, we're going to take a look at eBay's revenues for the previous three years (2009-11), the current year estimates (2012), and the next two years based on estimates (2013-14):Revenues in Millions(*) = Indicates that these are estimates for the fiscal years of 2012, 2013 and 2014.Earnings Per Share(*) = Indicates that these are estimates for the fiscal years of 2012, 2013 and 2014.After looking at the two tables above, there is a lot of information to digest. First, looking at revenues, we can see that eBay has been growing rapidly since 2010. Before that, revenues were extremely low, only growing 2.2% and 4.9% in 2009 and 2010, respectively. I expect revenues to continue increasing, but slightly more than the estimates have called for.Turning to EPS growth, the picture gets a little fuzzier. Growth has been anything but consistent, as it has been negative in two of the past six years and had one year with 80% growth. This is something that we don't typically like to see, however, there are exceptions.I think this would be a bigger problem if eBay had an overly inflated P/E ratio. The P/E ratio alone does not tell much of a story, but can aid a potential investor when searching for proper investments. eBay is currently trading with a 2012 P/E ratio of 22.5. Typically, we'd like to see this a little lower, but seeing the 2013 and 2014 P/E ratios is a bit more comforting. eBay trades with 2013 P/E ratio of 19.3 and a 2014 P/E ratio of 16.7. These levels are more reasonable, especially if eBay is able to grow both revenues and earnings per share at the respected estimates.To take the P/E ratio one step further, we're going to analyze the PEG ratio. The PEG ratio shows us the growth, relative to the valuation (P/E ratio). A reading of 1 is considered fair value, under 1 is considered undervalued and a reading over 1 is considered overvalued. The PEG ratio is equated by dividing the P/E ratio by the EPS growth. Let's look at the 2013 PEG ratio:19.3 (2013 P/E ratio) / 16.5 (estimated annual EPS growth) = 1.16A PEG ratio of 1.16 would suggest that eBay is slightly overvalued. It doesn't imply that owning or purchasing the stock is bad, just that it may be slightly overpriced when considering next year's future growth. A quick look at Yahoo Finance will show a five-year PEG measurement of 1.57, again suggesting the stock is a little overvalued. However, if growth is stronger than the estimates, these figures will come down, as the price will better fit future earnings. It's also important to remember investors are paying up for the growth. It's an extreme rarity to find a growth stock with a low P/E or PEG ratio.So what's the big catalyst for eBay? That's easy, PayPal! Paypal revs are up 23% when compared to that of last year. With such a strong increase, it now accounts for 40% of eBay's revenue, with nearly $1.4 billion in the third quarter. 2012 has been a year of experimenting when it comes to the use of offline PayPal. To gain more insight on the Paypal unit, here's what John Donahoe, the CEO, had to say during the most recent conference call:Personally, I recently started using PayPal Mobile for payments with other people. Simply put: I love it. It's quick, it's easy, and I can do it from my phone. I think that as this service continues to grow, it could eventually be eBay's biggest revenue generator, (currently eBay's Marketplace is the biggest revenue generator). As more and more people adapt to its simplicity, I think they will use it more between themselves and with merchants.While I really like eBay, I question its value compared to the growth it will be able to generate. I think that over the next several years, we will see more growth than the projections suggest, but perhaps not enough to validate such a high valuation. Still, I like the company and think the growth is worth paying up for right now. Investors should pay attention to the next couple of quarters to see if this growth still justifies the valuations. In my opinion, it currently does, but eBay will have to keep its numbers up, if it wants to keep its investors on board. I am bullish eBay, and will look to add when the stock retreats to around $50 per share, or its 50-day simple moving average.Note: eBay reports fourth-quarter earnings Jan. 16, 2013. This report will include the results for the fiscal year 2012.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in EBAY over the next 72 hours.

1112731,24706,2013-01-15T11:22:59-05:00,,"By: Brendan GilmartineBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is scheduled to report 4Q 2012 earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, January 16. The numbers are typically released at 4:15 p.m. EST and will be followed with a conference call at 5:00 p.m. eBay is expected to deliver solid results for the recent 4Q on strength in the PayPal and Marketplaces segments.Outliers and StrategyBack in October, eBay gave the following guidance for 4Q 2012:With 4Q 2012 results potentially priced in, much of the focus will center on the outlook for 1Q 2013.Any adjustments to the outlook for FY2012 could also have consequences for eBay shares. Back in October, eBay said it expects net revenues in the range of $13.95 bln to $14.1 bln with non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.32 - $2.35.eBay is seen posting solid results for 4Q 2012, thanks to ongoing strength in the PayPal business and its expanding leadership position in global payments, along with a pickup in the Marketplace segment.eBay recently hit a 52-week high of $54.20 and is up more than 25% since late summer. Following the advance, eBay is now trading at 5.2x sales and 20.5x cash flow, well above the 5-year averages (3.6x & 15.1x, respectively), implying the bar is set pretty high ahead of 4Q earnings.Recent NewsTechnical RevieweBay shares are trading at the highest level since early 2005, recently touching a peak at $54.20 (1/8/2013). In recent weeks, however, the shares have eased into a narrow trading channel between $52.00 and $54.00. Using the February $52.50 Strikes, equity options are implying a 6% - 8% move off the earnings release. With that said, the shares are vulnerable to initial support near $52.00 (20-Day SMA) in the event that earnings disappoint, followed by the 50-Day SMA near $50.50 and $49.00. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com).SummaryeBay shares are trading near the highest level in eight years, benefiting from rapid growth in the PayPal business, coupled with expansion in the Marketplaces segment, following a number of product enhancements, enabling it to compete more effectively with the likes of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). But eBay is now trading at 18.4x earnings, well above the 5-year average multiple of 14.7x and 5.2x sales (5-year average is 3.6x), leaving the shares vulnerable to even the slightest misstep when it reports earnings on Wednesday.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

1039931,38871,2012-12-02T09:27:43-05:00,,"The malls are filled with people shopping for the coming holidays. While the natural inclination would be to expect the big winners of this shopping season to be the major brick and mortar retailers. In reality, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) may actually be the big winner this holiday season. And the reason is not what you would normally think. So what is eBay's not-so-secret weapon? PayPal. PayPal is a cash cow for eBay and will be the engine for eBay's revenue growth for the foreseeable future. Why is PayPal so important? Because mobile payments are becoming the wave of the future and PayPal is already proving it is more than ready to be the big boy on the block.PayPal's ProfitabilityPayPal is already incredibly profitable. In eBay's third quarter, PayPal's revenue reached $1.4 billion and its total payment volume grew to $35.2 billion. That represents a 24% increase in PayPal's revenue and made up 41.1% of eBay's Q3 total revenue. Those numbers are staggering. By the end of fiscal year 2012, eBay expects over $10 billion in mobile payments alone. PayPal also has very healthy merchant transaction margins of 64.8%.PayPal is obviously still growing. According to the Q3 conference call, PayPal had 117 million active users with account growth accelerating by 1% to 14% in Q3. Remember, these numbers were before the holiday shopping season. The most recent numbers from eBay reports that PayPal saw an increase in mobile payments of 133% during Thanksgiving Day, 153% on Black Friday, and 196% on Cyber Monday. Consumers are not just doing their holiday shopping using their credit cards but are using PayPal for mobile payments.EBAY's PayPal is well Positioned to Dominate the Mobile Payments MarketThe mobile payments market is expected to grow from $240 billion to $640 billion by 2015. This growing market is already attracting the attention of Square Inc., Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), and financial institutions such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). With the potential growth in the market, competition is building and PayPal is well positioned to dominate the mobile payments space.The reasons PayPal is well positioned to benefit from the growth of mobile payments have a lot to do with what banks call ""share of wallet"". Share of wallet is a term used by retail banks when discussing the cost to their customers to switch banks. Many retail bank customers will endure high fees and dissatisfaction with their bank due to the number of products and services they have with the bank. For example, if a customer has a checking account, direct deposit, a car loan, and credit card with a bank, the customer would rather just stay with that bank than try to move all those products to a new bank. As mentioned before, PayPal has 117 million active users. If these users use PayPal for the mobile and online purchases as well as their Bill Me Later service, customers may find it easier to stay with PayPal instead of switching.Share of wallet does not just apply to personal accounts but also business accounts. Many of the 117 million users were small online businesses that use PayPal as their payment processor. PayPal is not satisfied with just small businesses. In Q3, eBay reported 10 major retailers who have PayPal live in over 7,000 locations. That number is expected to grow to 20 major retailers using PayPal for their point-of-sale operations by the end 2012. EBay also entered into a strategic partnership with Discover (NYSE:DFS) which would give them access to over 7 million merchant locations in the U.S. by next spring. All this leads to more businesses seeing PayPal as an important part of their day-to-day operations. Many of these businesses would see switching to another payment processor as an unneeded hassle or cost.The share of wallet concept becomes far important when you consider the fact that PayPal is dedicated to innovation and growing PayPal. Currently PayPal is spread over 9 product operations. EBAY has decided to consolidate all these operations into one product operation. This would allow PayPal to become even more profitable as overhead and other expenses are reduced. This will also increase innovation as less bureaucracy will encourage communication and problem solving. The move toward innovation is evident in PayPal labs where the company states their mission is, ""trying to rapidly bring significant benefits to our customers and partners through quality research, collaboration, and innovation"". The PayPal labs approach is reminiscent of Google Labs. If PayPal is able to create compelling products and services that expands share of wallet, PayPal may create an incredibly large barrier to entry for any competitors who are late to the game.Another reason PayPal is well positioned to dominate the mobile payments space has a lot to do with the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill. PayPal's greatest threat is that of large financial institutions crowding them out of the mobile payments market before they are able to solidify a large enough market share. Fortunate for PayPal, the liquidity risks many financial institutions are facing due to the uncertainty created by the new regulations have made many financial institutions hesitant to expand operations. Many large financial institutions are still waiting for aspects, such as the Volker Rule, to be written and interpreted. Because PayPal is not considered a large financial institution, it will avoid most of the effects of Dodd-Frank in its current state.Risks Facing PayPalWhile PayPal is well positioned to greatly benefit from the growth of mobile payments, it still faces some risks to its business. The largest risk has to do with future regulations. At the moment PayPal is largely unaffected by the bulk of Dodd-Frank. This does not mean it will always continue to be this way. If regulators turn their attention toward mobile and online payments, PayPal may have to change large aspects of its business model. PayPal has taken a proactive approach in trying to conform to many financial regulations that deal with electronic payments. However, some of the issues they have faced in California reveal the risks PayPal is exposed to when it comes to regulation.Another risk is PayPal's ability to innovate. If PayPal's consolidation does not produce the hoped for synergies fast enough, the dominance of PayPal may be short lived. PayPal does have serious competition from Square Inc., Intuit, and Google Wallet (NASDAQ:GOOG). However, Square Inc. has shown that it is serious about competing against PayPal with its Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) partnership. Also, some financial institutions are starting to wade into the mobile payments water, despite the current regulatory uncertainty. The most noticeable financial institution is Bank of America which will launch its mobile payments program in December. If PayPal is not quick enough in innovating and expanding its mobile payments operations, it could quickly be overtaken.PayPal Could Equal Serious Profits for InvestorsEBay's PayPal will continue to be the revenue generator it has been for the past few years. In fact, there is a case to be made that EBAY's continued growth can be directly tied to the growth of PayPal. Investors should give EBAY serious consideration when looking for a way to benefit from this holiday season and the growth of mobile payments. Any weakness may be a great time to buy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1040461,25120,2012-12-03T06:24:24-05:00,,"Shares of eBay (EBAY) rose almost 8% over the past trading week. The operator of the same name online market place, and the owner of the fast growing online payment service PayPal benefited from strong Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales.Strong Online Sales SeasonOnline sales on Cyber Monday rose 24.1% according to IBM which tracks transaction data from 500 US retail websites. This compares to growth of 15% last year. IBM notes that online sales growth mostly represents additional online sales, rather than cannibalization of sales during the rest of the season.Market researcher ComScore estimates that online sale on Monday came in at $1.5 billion. ChannelAdvisor estimates that sales by third party merchants on eBay in specific, rose by 57% on Cyber Monday. This growth was roughly 5 times the growth rate of 2011. eBay's numbers are incredible, driven by a strong marketing campaign and consumer's desire to do more shopping online.PayPalRather than just purchasing more gifts on eBay's website, consumers are also using eBay's PayPal unit to pay for their purchases. Total payment volume rose by 44% on Cyber Monday, driven by a 190% increase in mobile payment volumes.Rather than just making PayPal more available in the online world, eBay also made PayPal available in over 17,000 stores including Home Depot (HD) and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF). A deal with Discover Financial Services (DFS) will make PayPal available in many other physical store locations.Division director Marcus points out that PayPal's success ultimately does not depend on a focus on payments. Rather, PayPal is focused about ""providing an entire shopping experience and ensuring people get relevant offers for what hey are buying"". To do this, PayPal is focusing on data it receives from the transactions of its 117 million active users.ValuationeBay ended its third quarter with $9.1 billion in cash and equivalents. The company operates with $4.5 billion in short and long term debt, for a net cash position of $4.6 billion.eBay is on track to report annual revenues of roughly $14 billion. Full year earnings could come in around $2.6 billion, with GAAP earnings per share coming in at $1.95-$1.99 per share.The market currently values eBay at $68.3 billion, which values operating assets at $63.7 billion. This values operating assets at roughly 4.5 times annual revenues and 24-25 times annual earnings.Despite the significant financial strength and flexibility, eBay does not pay a dividend.Some Historical PerspectiveYear to date, eBay's shares have risen an astonishing 72%. Shares are currently exchanging hands at all time highs of $53 per share. The 8% gains over the past week come on the back of a strong recent performance after the third quarter earnings in October.Revenues rose some 65% between 2008 and 2012, as eBay is expected to report annual revenues of $14 billion this year. Growth is driven by both the marketplace business, as well as the PayPal payment division. The payment unit grew 23% in the third quarter, making up 43% of total revenues. Marketplace revenue growth came in at 9%, and payment revenues could reach 50% of total revenues in the coming quarters.Investment ThesisIn hindsight the $1.5 billion acquisition of PayPal a decade ago has been a crucial move for eBay. The payment division is driving growth at the company and integrating all the data between the payment and merchandise division could spur future growth. It might very well be that eBay could be transformed into a technological payment company altogether in the coming years, as the traditional eBay website diminishes in relative importance.I am really optimistic about the prospects of eBay as a company, but the stock has moved too far, and too fast for me this year. Valuation multiples have increased to 24-25 times 2012s expected earnings, driven by accelerating profit growth. Shares definitely do not provide a compelling short opportunity, given that eBay could simply ""grow"" into its valuation in the coming years.I reiterate my stance and remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1004831,22762,2012-11-13T18:14:27-05:00,,"By Leena RaoIt looks like it will be a very mobile holiday season for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) this  year. The e-commerce company is releasing new numbers today around its  mobile growth. Specifically, eBay mobile-only dollars transacted  increased more than 200 percent in Q3 2012 over the comparable 2011  period.As revealed earlier this year, eBay mobile expects to transact $10 billion in volume in 2012, which is more than double the transactions in 2011. As eBay’s VP  of Mobile, Steve Yankovich, tells us, through the first nine months of  2012, more than 1.8 million new users made their first eBay purchases on  mobile. In Q3, more than 800,000 new users made their first eBay  purchases on mobile.eBay is unveiling a number of mobile-only initiatives designed to  engage shoppers on their smartphones. For example, the company is  debuting an exclusive mobile gift guide and will also feature  mobile-only special inventory and deals.“The mobile business has gotten big enough so we are seeing similar  behavior in terms of what people are buying on phones to what people are  purchasing on the site,” Yankovich explains. In the future, he says,  eBay will continue to focus on letting people buy “anytime, anywhere and  anyplace,” via their mobile phones. The company is trying to think  creatively about how to surface products on the site, as well as how to  get that product into users’ hands.eBay made a big bet on mobile last holiday shopping season, and it  paid off. It should be interesting to see if the growth in mobile  accelerates this year and what features consumers respond to.Original post"
1112091,39301,2013-01-15T06:53:18-05:00,,"IntroductioneBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is a great investment going forward due to growth in its core businesses, improving economic conditions, and cost-cutting. The stock is likely to appreciate, due to its ingenious business model, and its ability to acquire businesses.Qualitative AnalysisSource: Information pertaining to eBay came from the shareholder annual report, with additional information from the quarterly report.eBay continues to optimize the website in order to remain competitive and as a result, global active accounts have grown by 13% on average throughout 2012. In the PayPal division, the net number of payments grew by 28-31% throughout the 3-quarters represented in the graph below.Total payment volume has grown by 15.66% (average) for eBay, while PayPal merchant services grew total payment volume by 24.66% (average) in 2012. These growth figures imply that eBay is still growing, and is making an effort to maintain competitiveness in the market place.The company has authorized a program of repurchasing $2.0 billion in common stock to off-set the dilution caused by share-based compensation programs for its employees. This should help to smooth EPS figures over a long-time period. eBay can generate higher returns on capital by investing the capital back into its business, rather than rapidly retiring the shares through buy-backs. This can be proven with its recent acquisition in GSI.Capital expenditure has increased due to its acquisition of GSI commerce in 2011. The deal was worth ($2.4 billion), and is a segment that is dedicated to helping brick and mortar stores better compete and operate in the online web space.The GSI division has been able to grow revenues by 12% on average throughout 2012. The recent acquisition in GSI further establishes eBay's successful track record in its investment savvy. Over the past ten years, eBay has been exceptional at investing in unique investment opportunities (PayPal). Over the next 5-years, I anticipate eBay will be able to find lucrative business opportunities to acquire, adding another upside catalyst for the company going forward.Overall I remain optimistic on eBay because of its ability to successfully buy-out companies, continued growth in its core business divisions, along with improving economic conditions internationally.eBay competes with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Visa (NYSE:V), Master Card (NYSE:MA), American Express (NYSE:AXP), among others.Technical AnalysiseBay has been a continuous up-trend since December 2011. The technical analysis indicates that eBay is in a long-term up-trend and is trading in a narrow upward channel.Source: Chart from freestockcharts.comThe stock is trading above the 20-, 50-, and 200- Day Moving Average. The stock is in a confirmed up-trend (higher highs and higher lows), the up-trend further supports my buy-thesis.Notable support is $35.00, $40.00, and $47.50 per share. Notable resistance is $60.00, $70.00, and $74.00 per share.Street AssessmentAnalysts on a consensus basis have reasonable expectations for the company going forward.Source: Table and data from Yahoo FinanceAnalysts on a consensus basis have a 5-year average growth rate forecast of 14.56% (based on the above table).Source: Table and data from Yahoo FinanceThe average surprise percentage is 3.7% above analyst forecasted earnings over the past four quarters (based on the above table).Forecast and HistorySource: Table created by Alex Cho, data from shareholder annual report, and price history is from Yahoo Finance.The EPS figure shows that throughout the 2003- 2006 period, the company was able to grow earnings. Throughout 2007 earnings contracted. The contraction in earnings was due to the great recession, but following the recession the company was able to grow earnings. The earnings in 2009 suddenly contracted due to an increase of $805 million in operating expense, but earnings have stabilized since.Source: Table created by Alex Cho, data from shareholder annual reportBy observing the chart we can conclude that the business is cyclical and is affected by macroeconomics. Therefore the largest risk factor to eBay is the slowing of international gross domestic product growth. So as long as the global economy continues to grow, the company will generate reasonable returns over a 5-year time span based on the forecast below.Source: Forecast and table by Alex ChoBy 2018 I anticipate the company to generate $6.69 in earnings per share. This is because of growth in core businesses, business acquisitions, and improving economic outlook.The forecast is proprietary, and below is a non-linear chart indicating the price of the stock over the next 5-years.Source: Forecast and chart by Alex ChoBelow is a price chart incorporating the past 10 years and the next 6 years. Detailing 16 years in pricing based on my forecast and price history on December 31st of each year.Source: Forecast and chart created by Alex Cho, data from shareholder annual report, and price history is from Yahoo Finance.Investment StrategyEBAY currently trades at $53.18. I have a price forecast of $73.86 for December 31st 2013. Generally undervalued stock will experience sudden rallies in order to fetch a reasonable premium relative to historic valuation, or growth. I factored that into my price forecast, making it an important component behind the sudden jump in stock valuation despite the reasonable improvement in anticipated earnings.Short TermOver the next twenty-four months, the stock is likely to appreciate from $53.18 to $73.86 per share. This implies 39% upside from current levels. The stock is in an up-trend, which further supports my investment thesis.Investors should buy eBay at $53.18 and sell at $73.86 in order to pocket short-term gains of 39% during 2013 through 2014.Long TermThe company is a great investment for the long-term. I anticipate EBAY to deliver upon the price and earnings forecast despite the risk factors (competition and economic environment). EBAY's primary upside catalyst is improving economics, successful acquisitions, growing revenues, and managing costs. I anticipate the company to deliver upon my forecasted price target of $149.20 by 2018. This implies a return of 180.5% by 2018. This is a phenomenal return.A higher yielding investment opportunity albeit having higher risk is to buy the Jan 17, 2015 calls at the $55.00 strike. The call premiums trade at $9.75. The price forecast for the end of 2014 is $85.01. The rate of return if the calls expire at $85.01 is 208%, the option will break-even when the stock trades at $64.75.The call premiums are cheap because investors who are short EBAY calls anticipate the stock to break out into new all-time highs, hence the more expensive premiums. Despite this fact, the risk to reward ratio on the option strategy remains high. The high-returns comes with moderate risk (5-year beta of 1.4)eBay has a market capitalization of $68.8 billion; the added liquidity makes this an investment opportunity appropriate for larger institutions that require added liquidity.ConclusioneBay has a great track-record of buying out companies, plus its revenues and earnings continue to grow. What more is there to ask for?The conclusion remains simple: buy eBay.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1113411,34821,2013-01-15T16:15:44-05:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) will disclose earnings after the close on Wednesday, January 16th. This is the time when eBay stockholders hold their collective breaths in hopes that the company will continue its upward trend.The company is clearly on a roll. The stock has moved up 74% over the past year compared to the S&P 500's 14% gain. Its earnings growth rate (21.60%) is greater than its trailing p/e ratio (18.1), one of my personal favorite measures of what constitutes a fairly-valued stock.According to WhisperNumbers.com, over the last 10 years, eBay has exceeded the whisper numbers on 35 occasions and fallen short of whisper numbers 15 times. That is more than a 2 - 1 margin for the company exceeding expectations.For the last two quarters, eBay has exceeded expectations by a large margin and the stock has spiked accordingly. In July, the stock shot up by nearly 10% and in October, nearly 5%.This time around, both the analysts and the whisperers agree on a $.69 earnings number. (In October, the company gave guidance of $.66 - $.69). With such a strong recent history of exceeding expectations, we would expect whisper numbers to exceed analyst projections, but that is not the case.The reason is probably due to the prevailing belief that eBay's primary auction business has reached a plateau (and is possibly declining). Of course, this possibility is offset by the strong growth in the PayPal service (growing at 15% a year) and the recent establishment of a greater Marketplace presence (it purchased GSI for $2.4 billion in 2011) which has become an increasingly important part of the company's business).In the October 2012 conference call, John J. Donohue, CEO at eBay, spoke glowingly of the company's prospects in ecommerce. What seemed significant to me was the fact that over half their PayPal business comes from outside the U.S. (and is just getting set up in Brazil and Russia). PayPal Mobile seems to becoming the preferred choice paying bills for increasing numbers of people - ""10 major U.S. retailers now have PayPal live in store at more than 7,000 locations. And we expect to have 20 major retailers signed up for PayPal's point-of-sale solution by year end,"" Mr. Donohue reported.While this is a purely anecdotal experience, my daughter is developing an exercise device which uses elastic straps and yoga mats that she is sourcing in China. When she finally selected a manufacturer and placed her first order, she (and I) was a little surprised that they asked to be paid through PayPal. She expected to have to wire a deposit but the manufacturer preferred PayPal. It seems significant that a Chinese manufacturer would have such a preference.What would happen to the price of the stock if eBay instituted a dividend? No one seems to be speculating on that possibility, yet the company is sitting on $9 billion in cash.The company has authorized a program of repurchasing $2.0 billion in common stock to off-set the dilution caused by share-based compensation programs for its employees. This should help to smooth EPS figures over a long-time period.The stock is trading comfortably above the 200-day and 50-day moving averages so there is no major concern on these popular technical measures. The latest RSI number is 55, a neutral reading on the over-bought - over-sold scale.In contrast to this long list of positive indicators, there are some valuation concerns. While the earnings growth rate currently exceeds the p/e ratio, both revenue and earnings are expected to grow at about 15% compared to the 18.1x p/e ratio, which would mean that the growth percentage trails the p/e ratio.Another concern is that the current p/e ratio is well above the 5-year average multiple of 14.7x. This suggests that a 5% or 10% increase in the stock price is far less likely after this week's earnings announcement. We should probably not expect the stock to pop like it did after the last two announcements.So what should you do if your outlook for the company is generally positive, but you don't expect a big move higher, at least in the short term?Going into earnings, Implied Volatility (IV) of the Jan-13 options (66) is greater than the Feb-13 options (35) due to the uncertainty of the earnings numbers. This gives calendar spreads a considerable IV advantage.Today, with eBay trading at $53.00, I bought 20 each Feb-13 - Jan-13 calendar spreads at the 50 and 52.5 strikes (using puts) and at the 55 strike using calls. In addition, I bought 10 uncovered Feb-13 57.5 calls just in case recent history does manage to repeat itself and the stock pops higher.One of the persistent problems with placing calendar spreads in advance of earnings is that the IV of the long side falls after the announcement. I suspect that this will not be much of a problem this time around. I checked back a month ago and saw that IV for the Jan-13 options series with four weeks of remaining life was 33, which is only marginally lower than today's Feb-13 level 35. So the Feb-13 option prices shouldn't plummet after the January options expire.Here is the risk profile graph for my positions:These are the positions I have: For those of you who prefer seeing these trades as I placed them, here they are:BTO (buy to open) 20 EBAY Feb-13 50 puts (EBAY130216P50)STO (sell to open) 20 EBAY Jan-13 50 puts (EBAY130129P50) for a debit of $.50 (buying a calendar)BTO 20 EBAY Feb-13 52.5 puts (EBAY130216P52.5)STO 20 EBAY Jan-13 52.5 puts (EBAY130129P52.5) for a debit of $.56 (buying a calendar)BTO 20 EBAY Feb-13 55 calls (EBAY130216C55)STO 20 EBAY Jan-13 55 calls (EBAY130129C55) for a debit of $.54 (buying a calendar)BTO 10 EBAY Feb-13 57.5 calls (EBAY130216C57.5) for $.58These positions cost $3780 to place and commissions worked out to $162.50 at thinkorswim for a total investment of $3942.50. I placed these trades when eBay was trading right at $53. According to the graph, the stock can fall over $4.00 before I lose anything on the downside, and a profit will result no matter how much it moves higher.The graph shows that if eBay closes at any point between $52 and $56 on Friday, these positions could make as much as 100% (including commissions, my best goal should be in the 70% to 80% range, however, especially if I close them all out before waiting until the last minute).The big risk is on the downside. If the stock falls more than $4, a loss would occur. If you wanted to expand the downside break-even point you would buy additional spreads at the 50 strike.As usual, a caveat, even though I am bullish on eBay (or at least don't expect it to trade lower after the announcement Wednesday), I am only investing money that I can afford to lose.Disclosure: I am long EBAY.

1113291,23479,2013-01-15T15:22:26-05:00,,"eBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock price has risen by almost 80% from its January 2012 levels of ~$30 to ~$54 currently. [1] The growth was driven by the strong performance of its marketplace business coupled with the outstanding growth of PayPal. This growth relies heavily on the popularity of eBay’s mobile app suite which crossed the 100 million downloads threshold in September. [2]The popularity of the eBay app suite can be gauged from the fact that 25 million of these downloads came in the preceding six month period. The company expects to transact $10 billion in mobile volume in 2012, twice that in 2011. With mobile commerce growing from a $3.4 billion market in the U.S. in 2010 to a projected $119 billion across the globe by 2015, the company is well poised to reposition itself as a significant competitor to Amazon’s dominance of the e-commerce universe. [2]Traditionally Q4 growth has outpaced other quarters on a sequential basis. Below we take a look at the factors that defined eBay’s performance in 2012 as well as our expectations from Q4 results scheduled to be released on January 16th.Check out our complete analysis of eBayMarketplaces Growth To Complement That Of PayPal’sMarketplaces contributes slightly more than half of eBay’s total revenues and nearly half of our $50 price estimate. During the third quarter, marketplaces’ total gross merchandise volume including vehicles increased to more than $18.3 billion, growing at about 9% year-over-year. The number of active users grew 10% year-over-year to 108 million, the fastest growth since 2007. Traffic from mobile devices was the major contributor within marketplaces with 800,000 new users making purchases on eBay mobile during Q3.With sellers now listing 2 million items per week from their smartphones on eBay and the quarter spanning the holiday season, we expect the gross merchandise volume and the number of active users to continue the strong growth from the third quarter.The United States contributes ~48% of total eBay revenues and our expectations are backed by the company performance in the country during the holiday season. It reported ~150% year-on-year growth in mobile transaction volumes during Thanksgiving, Black Friday and later in December. [3] [4] The traditional retail calendar seems to be reshaping itself with holiday shopping surge on mobile devices occurring later than Cyber Monday and Black Friday.The company’s mobile penetration should help it maintain its growth rate over and remain on top of the changing retail calendar over the coming years. One in three global purchases on eBay involve a mobile touch point, and the growing popularity of mobile devices as Internet access points could see the ratio go up in the coming years. [4]PayPal To Lead From The FrontPayPal accounts for about 40% of eBay’s revenues and about 35% of our price estimate. Revenues from the division have grown at about 25% during 2012 with the international business outpacing the overall growth. [5] International business accounts for slightly more than half of PayPal’s total revenues. With the service still having a limited international presence, we expect the international business to be the major contributor in the coming years.The division seems to have outgrown its dependence on eBay with Total Payment Volume on eBay constituting just 33% of the overall Total Payment Volume. This has been made possible by PayPal expanding its presence offline through PayPal Here devices and a tie-up with Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS). We will look for the growth in PayPal’s offline presence and expect it to define the segment’s growth in the coming years.The number of active accounts on PayPal jumped 14% to 117 million, and we expect it to reach nearly 121 million by the end of 2012. The holiday season saw PayPal mobile payment volume growing at about 200%. [3] [4] [4] The company expects to do over $10 billion of mobile payments volume in 2012.The growing popularity and adoption of PayPal Mobile bodes well for the company and will support its growth outlook.A great performance in Q4 2012 will lead us to revise our $50 price estimate for eBay which is in line with the market price.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
963191,25036,2012-10-30T18:05:14-04:00,,"In our recent article, Bulking Up for Earnings, A Protected Play for GNC, we presented a protected stock position prior to an upcoming earnings event. Due to the effects of Hurricane Sandy, GNC Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNC) has postponed its earnings release from Tuesday morning to Thursday morning, November 1st. In that previous article we said that we would present a comparison of the married put setup vs. an in-the-money long strangle position for stocks that have an upcoming earnings event.If you have been following our posts you have seen a few articles that discuss the married put initial setup following the RadioActive Trading techniques. Many investors have asked: ""Why put up all that capital to buy the stock and the protected put? Wouldn't we do better by purchasing an in-the-money long call instead of the underlying stock?""We have presented several examples of this comparison, but we wanted to share another example as well as show the comparison trade to the GNC Holdings Inc. married put that was already presented.eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) comparisonDuring a live webinar on October 16th we were asked the question about substituting an in-the-money long call in place of the long stock, effectively creating an in-the-money long strangle. The investor assumed that by putting less money into the trade and using leverage they were bound to have better profits after an earnings event. Long strangle positions, whether using out-of-the-money or in-the-money options, are usually proclaimed as the best options strategies to take advantage of an upcoming earnings event. We took the challenge and identified a married put position that matched our criteria and had an upcoming earnings event. We then identified an the in-the-money long strangle to compare the two positions. On October 17th our Search tool identified this potential married put:EBAY Married Put 10-17-2012Buy 100 shares of EBAY @ $48.20Buy 1 Buy 1 April 50 strike put @ $ 5.40Total Invested = $53.60Guaranteed By Put = $50.00Total At Risk = $ 3.60, or 6.7%This married put position offers us a single digit risk amount if the stock moves against us, with an unlimited upside if the stock takes off due to a positive earnings event. This setup is preferred to simply buying stock and placing a stop-order as the put option guarantees that our risks will not exceed 6.7% in this case. A stop-order can be violated if there is a large gap down in the stock price. Here is the profit and loss of the EBAY married put position prior to earnings release:In-the-money long strangle comparisonAt the same time an investor could have substituted an in-the-money long call in place of the stock to create an in-the-money long strangle. We compared the married put position above to using a long call that was roughly the same distance in-the-money as the put option that was selected for insurance. This gave us:EBAY ITM Long Strangle 10-17-2012Buy 1 April 50 strike Put @$ 5.40Buy 1 April 46 strike Call @$ 5.70Total Invested = $11.10Maximum Risk = $ 7.10, or 64%Maximum Profit = InfiniteHere is the profit and loss chart of the in-the-money long strangle for EBAY:The assumed benefits of this position are:The actual cons of this position are what we have noticed before:What happened after earnings?Ebay Inc. reported earnings at the close of business on October 17th. The morning of October 18th eBay Inc. shares increased. At market close of October 18th, the liquidation values for both positions were:Closing values for EBAY married put position (10-18-2012):Sell to close 100 shares EBAY @ -$50.83Sell 1 April 50 strike put @ -$ 3.90Total Liquidation Value = $54.73Liquidation Gain = $54.73 - $53.60 = $1.13 profit, or 2.1%The RPM could be liquidated for a profit of 2.1% in 1 day. There was an opportunity to cancel the risk on the EBAY position or to cut the risk by more than half using the RadioActive Trading income methods after the earnings event. How did the in-the-money long strangle compare?Closing values for EBAY in-the-money long strangle position (10-18-2012):Sell April 50 strike put @ -$ 3.90Sell April 46 strike call @-$ 7.25Liquidation Value = $11.15Liquidation Gain = $11.15 - $11.10 = $0.05, or 0.45%The in-the-money long strangle produced only a $0.05 gain compared to a gain of $1.13 on the married put position. If earnings had disappointed and the stock had collapsed, the strangle may have shown a profit where the married put would have been in the negative. This of course depends on the amount of the decline.On Thursday morning we will look to follow up the GNC Holdings Inc. married put position from October 24th, 2012 as listed in the previous article to this in-the-money long strangle that could have been opened on the same day:GNC Holdings Inc. in-the-money-long strangle, GNC @ $37.98 (10-24-2012):Buy 1 March 35 Call @$ 5.20Buy I March 40 Put @ $ 4.90Total Invested = $10.10Maximum Risk = $ 5.10, or 50.5%Maximum Profit = InfiniteLook for our follow up article on these two positions after earnings are released for GNC Holdings Inc. on Thursday morning.Disclosure: I am long GNC.

936941,24491,2012-10-20T16:11:01-04:00,,"On Wednesday, global commerce and payments company eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported solid third quarter performance that showed accelerated growth in both Marketplaces and PayPal. We continue to like the company and hold shares in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter. In fact, we said the company was an outright steal when it was trading in the low $30s last year (it's now over $50 per share). Please take a read of our nothere. At the time, the company also scored a rare 10 on our Valuentum Buying Index (our stock-selection methodology).Revenue for the third quarter increased 15%, while GAAP and non-GAAP net income jumped 22% and 14%, respectively. The firm's consolidated operating margin advanced 150 basis points from the same period last year (100 basis points on a non-GAAP basis), as segment margin in each of its three business segments expanded on a year-over-year basis. Cash flow was robust, with eBay pulling in $1.2 billion in operating cash flow and $792 million in free cash flow during the third quarter.PayPal continues to do well, with active registered accounts advancing 14% from the same period a year ago, to 117.4 million. PayPal revenue increased 23% while net total payment volume advanced 20%. PayPal continues to expand its addressable market to offline, a move that is a natural extension of its existing payments platform. We continue to expect PayPal to continue its strong upward trajectory in revenue and profits, the latter bolstered in part by job cuts.As we had highlighted earlier in the quarter, the firm's Marketplaces business continues its resurgence. Gross merchandise volume (GMV) increased 11% (19% in the US; 8% internationally), while overall Marketplaces revenue advanced 9% year over year. The company noted that active user growth accelerated during the period and that the pace reached levels not seen since 2007. Importantly, eight-hundred thousand of new users came from mobile. Targeting convenience and customer service via a site redesign and a relationship with Geek Squad (NYSE:BBY) has resonated with users. The firm's GSI revenue jumped 12% from the same period a year ago thanks primarily to strong performance in global ecommerce merchandise sales. We think the win rate for new clients at GSI continues to track well.Looking ahead, eBay thinks full-year 2012 net revenues to reach $14.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to reach $2.35-both measures at the high end of the guided range. Though its holiday outlook disappointed some investors, we continue to like eBay and think the company is a core holding in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter. The firm's business segments continue to expand at a nice clip with respect to revenue and profits, and eBay's cash-flow generating capacity remains top notch. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was 23.3% during the third quarter, an excellent conversion rate. We may add to our position on any material market pullback.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

935691,27691,2012-10-19T13:34:28-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock has been on quite a run as of late. After hitting a low of $28.15 a little less than one year ago to stock has roared back, nearly doubling to $50.83 per share.EBAY data by YChartsI wrote an article on eBay in June putting the fair value at about $43 per share, a bit more than the stock was trading for at the time. Since then the stock has rocketed past that value. If you're an eBay shareholder you may be thinking about selling your shares after the meteoric rise in share price. Instead of simply selling your shares now one way to not only choose your selling price but to also get paid for it is to sell LEAPS call options.Selling Call OptionsBy selling a call option you sell someone the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock from you at the strike price on or before the expiration date. LEAPS, or long-term equity anticipation securities, are simply options with a long time until expiration, typically 2 years or more. Using LEAPS allows you to collect a larger premium since the expiration date is so far away. However, it obligates you to hold onto the stock until either the option is exercised or the option expires. You could, of course, always buy the option back at a later date.Let's take a look at a few LEAPS call options available for eBay with an expiration date of January 2015, 820 days away.When you sell one of these call options there are two possible outcomes:This strategy is great for a shareholder who wants so sell out of the stock. It allows you to be paid for setting your own selling price. For example, let's say you're looking to sell your shares of eBay and want a price of at least $60 per share. If you sell the January 2015 $60 call option you receive a premium of $690, which is 13.57% of the current market price of 100 shares ($50.83). In other words, you immediately receive a 13.57% return on your shares. If the option is then exercised on expiration your shares will be called away at $60 per share, representing an 18.04% increase over the current share price. The total return, including both the premium and the stock appreciation, totals a 31.62% return over 820 days, or 14.07% annualized.ConclusionIf you're looking to sell your shares of eBay then writing LEAPS call options allows you to set your desired selling price and receive a premium for doing so. With eBay stock having risen substantially over the past year the stock is far less attractive than it once was. Use this strategy wisely, though, because if you sell an option with a low strike price and the stock rockets above that value then you miss out on those gains.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Revenue grew 15% year-over-year to $3.4 billion and net profit increased to $718 million, up 14% year-over-year. The company credits its m-commerce and mobile payment initiatives as the primary driver of growth. Payment revenue once again led the growth with a 23% increase while marketplace followed at 10%. eBay competes primarily with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Square, Intuit GoPayment and other competitors in the payments space, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in e-commerce. PayPal leads from the frontU.S. accounts for almost 48% of total PayPal revenue, which increased by 23% to $1.4 billion. It was partly due to a 20% rise in TPV (Total Payment Volume) to $35 billion. The number of active accounts on PayPal jumped 14% to 117 million. We expect it to reach nearly 121 million by the end of 2012. PayPal Mobile also continued its strong momentum in Q3, and the company expects to do over $10 billion of mobile payments volume in 2012.The company has been testing offline modes through its PayPal Here device and announced a tie-up with Discover Financial Services in Q3. It is currently present across 10 major U.S. retailers and 7,000 locations and is targeting 20 additional major retailers by year-end. The growing popularity and adoption of PayPal Mobile bodes well for the company which has often being accused of not being innovative with its products. PayPal is currently working to accelerate innovation by simplifying its product organization and creating more agile development teams. A recent announcement of it trimming its workforce by 400 was another step in this direction [eBay’s PayPal Said to Cut as Many as 400 Jobs, Bloomberg, October 2012 ].Marketplaces pick up pace Though Marketplaces still contributes a majority of eBay’s total revenue, it has been overshadowed by PayPal’s blinding pace of growth. Marketplaces’ total gross merchandise volume including vehicles increased to more than $18.3 billion, growing about 9% year-over-year. The number of active users grew 10% year-over-year to 108 million, the fastest growth since 2007.Mobile was the fastest growing segment within Marketplaces with 800,000 new users making purchases on eBay Mobile during Q3. Downloads of eBay Mobile apps topped 100 million, and the number of items listed on eBay via Mobile also surpassed the 100 million milestone during the quarter. Sellers are now listing 2 million items per week from their smartphones on eBay.In order to get rid of its image as an unorganized marketplace and project itself as a provider of personalized, curated, consistent and contemporary shopping experience, the company recently refreshed its website and launched a new logo. The new website contains innovative new features such as the eBay Feed, which provides personalized recommendations and we’d be looking for its impact during Q4.We currently have a $50 Trefis price estimate for eBay, which is being revised.Disclaimer: No positions"
981571,33881,2012-11-06T05:40:20-05:00,,"Although many investors pay close attention to the bottom line number when earnings are reported, this number can often be misleading. Net income and earnings per share can be drastically affected by differing accounting methods used for depreciation, amortization, restructuring charges, goodwill impairment, and asset sales to name a few. Other than depreciation and amortization, most irregular income statement line items are one time charges and should not be factored into your analysis of the particular company. When pulling data off many finance websites, you will be viewing ""as reported"" numbers and this may not reflect the true growth of a company.One of the most popular stocks in today's market is eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Investors who glance at earnings per share from major finance websites may be scratching their heads when eBay reports Q4 earnings. Using data from Yahoo Finance, eBay currently has trailing twelve month diluted earnings per share of $2.93. You can also see a trailing P/E of just 17x earnings, not bad for a fast growing tech company. Assuming you use this data and factor in a conservative earnings per share growth rate of 20%, you would expect last year's earnings of $2.46 to grow to $2.95. Why not load up the boat in this undervalued security?Do your HomeworkThe type of five minute financial analysis mentioned above is what leads investors to make poor decisions time and time again. If you take time to read the company's financial statements in detail, especially the footnotes at the bottom of the companies 2011 10-k, you would see the following statement:The Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011 includes a loss on divested business of $256.5 million and a gain on the sale of our remaining 30% equity interest in Skype of approximately $1.7 billion . See ""Note 3 - Business Combinations"" and ""Note 4 - Skype Related Transactions"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.eBay took a gain from the sale of Skype during the last quarter of 2011 and included it as a gain on their income statement. This is appropriate accounting, no red flags being waved here, but by not factoring this ""one time item"" into your analysis, your data will be drastically skewed. Looking back to the 2009 10-k filing and you see a similar footnote:The Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes a $343.2 million charge related to the settlement of a lawsuit between Skype, Joltid and entities controlled by Joltid's founders and a $1.4 billion gain on the sale of Skype. See ""Note 4 - Skype Related Transactions"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.AdjustmentsBelow is my adjusted data for eBay's income statements in 2009 and 2011. As you can see I subtracted the non-recurring items mentioned above, and added back in the taxes that would have been paid from these long term gains. We now have an idea of how eBay's core businesses are performing. This data compares with reported diluted earnings per share of $2.46 in 2011 and $1.83 in 2009.Source: eBay SEC Filings and my adjusted resultsAs of the company's third quarter earnings announcement, management provided full year diluted EPS guidance of between $1.95-$1.99. By taking the time to read through eBay's 8-k filing, you may have picked up on the TTM EPS drop.Valuation ChangesThe table below shows diluted EPS as reported and diluted EPS factoring in my adjustments. The adjusted results paint a much clearer picture of how the core businesses of eBay are actually performing.Source: eBay SEC Filings and my adjusted resultsIf we plot the price-to-earnings multiples for eBay over the past four years, a very different story is presented. The Blue line depicts the companies P/E ratio using reported earnings, you can see we trade slightly above the four year average, but still at very low levels given the EPS growth rate of eBay. The green line is the companies P/E using my adjustments. If the company reaches the lower end of its 2012 EPS guidance, share will trade significantly higher than their four year average. While I am not debating whether or not the company should trade at 26x earnings, I am trying to illustrate that the 17x earnings multiple reported by most sources may not be as cheap as you would expect.Source: eBay SEC Filings and my adjusted resultsSince the gross profit and operating profit margins are unaffected by these specific income statement line items, we will focus on net profit margins. Using eBay's reported net income and my adjusted net income; you see a very different story with regarding to net profit margins. Simply relying on ""as reported"" data can lead you to make some very inaccurate conclusions about this company.Source: eBay SEC Filings and my adjusted resultsConclusionI am very excited about the growth eBay has the potential to deliver over the next few years. The tremendous growth in PayPal could be a significant game changer for this company. What I would caution investors is to do your research before buying a company appears to trade too cheap. The difference between 17x earnings and 26x earnings can drastically affect your investment returns.Additional Notes:*Although not significant, I would also watch for the $15 million restructuring charge the company will take this quarter with regards to its staff reduction in the PayPal Business Unit.*All data reported and graphed is pulled directly from eBay SEC filings (10K's and 10Q's) then ran through proprietary valuation models.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Revenues were roughly in line with analysts expectations of $3.41 billion.The company boosted its net profits by 22% to $597 million. Earnings per diluted share rose 21% to $0.45. Non-GAAP earnings per share rose 14% to $0.55, beating analysts consensus by a penny.The company's PayPal unit was the driver behind growth, making up 43% of total revenues. The unit registered 14% more users to 117.4 million. Despite the growth at the payment unit, President Marcus will consolidate product groups and reorganize the business, leading to modest job losses among the 13,000 employed at PayPal.CEO John Donahoe commented on the results,Segmental InformationPaymentsThe payment division, ""PayPal"", performed very strong during the quarter. Net revenues rose 23% to $1.37 billion, on the back of a 20% growth in net total payment volumes to $35.2 billion.

Gross merchandise volumes rose 11% to $16.3 billion. US gross merchandise volumes rose 16% to $6.5 billion, while international gross merchandise volumes were up 8% to $9.8 billion.OutlookFor the fourth quarter of 2012, eBay expects revenues to come in between $3.85-$4.0 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to come in between $0.66-$0.69 per share. GAAP earnings are anticipated to come in between $0.55-$0.58 per share.On average, analysts expected eBay to guide for fourth quarter revenues of $3.94 billion, on which they expect eBay to earn $0.68 per share, on a non-GAAP basis.For the full year of 2012, revenues are expected to come in between $13.95-$14.10 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to come in between $2.32-$2.35 per share. GAAP earnings are anticipated to come in between $1.95-$1.99 per share.The full year non-GAAP earnings outlook is in line with analysts expectations of $2.34 per share.ValuationeBay ended its third quarter with $9.1 billion in cash, equivalents and short term investments. The company operates with $4.5 billion in short and long term debt, for a net cash position of roughly $4.6 billion.For the first nine months of 2012, eBay generated revenues of $10.1 billion. Net income came in at $1.86 billion, or $1.42 per diluted share.The market currently value eBay at $62 billion. Excluding the net cash position, the market values the operating assets at roughly $57.5 billion. This values the firm at 4.1 times annual revenues and 22-23 times annual earnings.Currently, eBay does not pay a dividend.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of eBay have risen almost 60%. Shares started the year at $30 and steadily rose to highs of $50 in recent weeks, on the back of a strong full year outlook. Shares are changing hands at $48 at the moment.Over the past five years, shares have returned some 20%. Shares traded as low as $10 in the beginning of 2009 and steadily rose to levels around $50 in September of 2012. The company has aggressively boosted its annual revenues from $8.5 billion in 2008 to an expected $14.0 billion in 2012. Net income rose from $1.8 billion to $2.6 billion, in the meantime.Shares of eBay had a great run so far this year. The company's PayPal division has driven results and growth. Yet investors are slightly disappointed by the third quarter report, which was in line with expectations. Most likely expectations for an earnings beat have risen too high in recent weeks, as shares continued to make new highs.Back in April, I took a look at eBay after the company published strong first quarter results. I applauded the company for the $1.5 billion acquisition of PayPal and thought shares were trading at fair valuation levels around $40 per share. Shares have risen another 20% since that point in time, boosting the valuation to 22-23 times earnings. While the company's balance sheet is rock solid, the company has not engaged in share repurchases, or paid out dividends to shareholders.Given the cautious outlook and the rich valuation, I see few short term triggers for the stock.

The numbers are typically released at 4:15 p.m. EST and will be followed with a conference call at 5:00 p.m. eBay is expected to deliver solid results for the recent 3Q on strength in the PayPal and Marketplaces segments.Back in July, eBay gave the following guidance for 3Q 2012:With 3Q 2012 results potentially priced in, much of the focus will center on the outlook for 4Q 2012:eBay is seen posting solid results for 3Q 2012, thanks to ongoing strength in the PayPal business and its expanding leadership position in global payments, along with a pickup in the Marketplace segment.eBay recently hit a 52-week high of $50.65 and is up 57.8% YTD. Following the advance, eBay is now trading at 4.8x sales and 20.3x cash flow, well above the 5-year averages (3.8x & 12.1x, respectively), implying the bar is set pretty high ahead of 3Q earnings.Recent NewsTechnical RevieweBay shares are up nearly 60% YTD and recently touched a 52-week high of $50.65 (9/14/2012). Since then, the momentum has faded, with the MACD pointed downward and the 20-Day SMA beginning to signal another move lower. The shares just slipped below the 50-Day SMA ($47.50) and are now sitting on support at $46.00 - a level going back to mid-June. Below that key level is downside risk to $44.00. Conversely, resistance is at $48.00, followed by the aforementioned peak of $50.65. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryeBay has been on a tear this year, rising close to 60% en route to a peak of $50.65 on September 14, the highest level since early 2005. Strength in the PayPal segment, coupled with improvements in the marketplace division fueled much of the growth that catapulted the shares to these levels. Against this positive backdrop, the bar is set pretty high for eBay ahead of its 3Q earnings, leaving eBay vulnerable to any missteps. With 3Q results largely priced in at these levels, investors are more likely to focus on the outlook for the fourth quarter and balance of 2012.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis and or data in this report.

934501,22148,2012-10-19T02:02:04-04:00,,"After reporting earnings on Wednesday night, eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) initially jumped nearly 5%, as investors were impressed with mobile growth and international expansion opportunities. The company is a global commerce platform and payments leader.Unlike Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), eBay sees mobile as a game changer. The shift towards smartphones and tablet usage provides consumers with more access to utilize the services of eBay.Q3 2012 HighlightsThe company reported the following highlights for Q3 2012:The company reported earnings of $0.55 barely beating analyst expectations of $0.54.Business OutlookAnalysts expected earnings of $0.68, so the guidance of a mid-point of $0.675 was inline with expectations.PayPal Q3 HighlightsPayments revenue increased 23% over last year to hit $1.37B. PayPal now accounts for over 40% of total revenue. Payments revenue though continues to decelerate now down to only 23% year-over-year growth. As recently as Q1, the division was reporting consistent 30% growth rates.PayPal Mobile still expects over $10B of mobile payments volume in 2012. The payments division continues to make huge inroads to the offline retailer community now, with more than 10,000 locations allowing PayPal. The company expects to more than double the major retailers utilizing PayPal from 10 to 20 by the year-end.ConcernsOne of the biggest concerns for eBay is that revenue growth has flat lined since Q4 2011. In 2011, the company saw strong sequential growth throughout all of the quarters. This year, revenue remained virtually flat with Q4 2011. If this pattern continues, revenue growth in 2013 will be very low.Another big concern had been the lack of free cash flow growth. The last two quarters had seen the lowest free cash flow totals in the last few years. The substantial increase to $792M in Q3 should help with those concerns. See chart below from the investor presentation:Click to enlargeStock PriceThe price remains near 52-week highs at $50. At this level, the stock trades at more than 18x 2013 earnings.1 Year Chart - eBayConclusionThe company continues to provide solid growth with the expansion of PayPal and the mobile initiatives. Unfortunately, new investors will now have to pay up for those growth initiatives, with the stock up 60% in the last 12 months.While Google accidently released disappointing earnings early on Thursday, eBay continues to show solid growth. The shift to mobile continues to harm users reliant on the desktop advertising model, while others such as eBay benefit from the incremental revenue opportunities.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

910711,22762,2012-10-08T12:34:33-04:00,,"By Leena RaoIt’s not easy for a $63 billion company to make a successful pivot,  but if eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) manages to pull it off, it will be one for the history  books. The e-commerce giant has been shifting focus from being primarily  a marketplace to a mobile commerce giant with a dash of  personalization. And there are serious signs of life. eBay did a  staggering $5 billion in mobile commerce last year and expects to see $10 billion in transactions on mobile devices this year.Then there’s eBay-owned PayPal, which has a 100 million-plus active  user base, but has not been known as being the most innovative payments  company, especially with competitors like Square and others in the mix.  But with a new president at the helm, PayPal is shifting product development and looking to bring more innovation the the payments giant.As Gartner analyst Gene Alvarez says during an interview, “eBay is  not just a marketplace anymore. With the acquisitions of GSI, Milo, and  Magento, the company is looking to bring together a broad set of  ecommerce capabilities.” Through these acquisitions, as well as the  purchase of Hunch, Svvply, Card.io (PayPal) and others, it’s clear that  eBay has a broader vision for its future beyond simply auctions.We also sat down with eBay’s Vice President of Mobile, Steve  Yankovich; eBay’s Chief Marketing Officer for North America, Richelle  Parham; and PayPal President David Marcus to discuss the company’s  future strategy and product innovations when it comes to mobile,  personalization, and payments.MOBILESteve Yankovich, eBay’s vice president of Mobile, actually started  eBay’s mobile efforts back in 2009. He says that across all products at  eBay now, product managers and engineers are instructed to “think mobile  first.” “We are constantly thinking of how we can promote and build  products around mobile. First and foremost, we ask how do we surface  this experience on mobile,” he explains.In 2009, eBay was contemplating whether to invest in the mobile web  or native apps. Yankovich pushed to do it all, and it seems to have paid  off. The company just crossed 100 million downloads  of its mobile apps, which include the basic buying and selling  marketplace app, barcode scanning app Red Laser, dedicated apps for  verticals (i.e. eBay Motors, fashion) and more.The  company has been adding some compelling features to its mobile apps to  boost engagement. For example, eBay just added geofencing to its Red  Laser apps to allow retailers to deliver deals and information to  consumers based on whether they are close to a physical store. eBay also debuted a new iOS app called eBay Now that will let users get $5 same-day shipping on products from local stores.And Yankovich says that we’re going to see even more hyper-geofencing and location capabilities added to mobile apps.eBay is also looking to use mobile phones’ cameras in more advanced  ways when it comes to identifying products via image recognition. eBay  is also exploring how to use voice to reduce friction with mobile  purchases.“We are moving at racetrack speed to keep innovation going on mobile  and we are going all in, not toe dipping,” says Yankovich. He’s focused  on creating snack-size experiences for users, executing design of the  apps with speed and simplicity. Sellers need to be able to triage an  offer on the go, and buyers need to receive alerts of items on sale at  optimal times to their schedules. Part of this involves personalizing  the experience for the user, he explains.PERSONALIZATIONWe all know that Amazon has been at the forefront of personalization.  Industry rumors point to 25 to 30 percent of Amazon’s sales coming from  recommendations. Last quarter, Amazon saw nearly $13 billion in sales.  Clearly the opportunity to lift revenue through thoughtful  personalization is huge.eBay hasn’t yet launched Amazon-style personalization, but we can be sure that this will happen soon. Last November, eBay acquired Hunch, a service that provides a “taste graph” of personalized recommendations based on users’ interests. A few weeks ago, eBay acquired  personalized and curated shopping site Svvply, to “advance more  personalized experiences and merchandising options on eBay.com.” eBay  plans to use their newly acquired data capabilities to drive more  personalized, relevant shopping experiences.However, central to creating a more personalized experience is being  able to mine data from customer interactions. Hunch’s technology can  clearly help with this. But you can see that eBay is also thinking of  alternative ways to track user shopping behavior. This past week, eBay  launched a Pinterest-like product, called Setify,  which allows people to track, flag, like and collect various products.  The goal is to multiply the number of user events or signals the  business can use to score products and serve recommendations. For now,  it is limited to collections of items like coins and comic books, but  you could see this emerging into a more open platform.Alvarez agrees that personalization is going to be a key driver for  sales and engagement for eBay in the future. “Personalization still  contributes to the average basket size for many companies, but if you  bring this to mobile, you get contextual personalization, and there’s a  lot of potential in combining location technologies with  personalization.But the other piece to personalization is timing. Parham says that  the company is focused on continuing to serve up the right inventory at  the right time based on data eBay is collecting. They also recently  launched a new automated return center for buyers and sellers to  streamline the returns process. eBay has been promoting its buyer  protection promise against any fake or misrepresented goods on the site.eBay has also debuted a new slogan in its TV commercials. The old  slogan was “When it’s on your mind, it’s on eBay.” The new slogan is  “From the new to the hard to find, when it’s on your mind, it’s on  eBay.” Parham says that this description more accurately lets shoppers  know that the site has a wide variety of merchandise on the site,  whether it is brand new items with tags or used items.PAYPALAnd then there’s PayPal. While the payments business has  traditionally been the crown jewel in eBay’s pocket, the payments  company has been overshadowed by some of the new entrants in the mobile  and digital payments space, including Square and Stripe. But it’s clear  that with David Marcus at the helm, PayPal is going through its own  pivot. In a response to complaints on Hacker News a few weeks ago,  Marcus posted on the forum, “There’s a massive culture change  happening at PayPal right now…If we suck at something, we now face it,  and we do something about it.” He’s also responding to frustrated users personally. This sort of direct attention is more common among startups than public companies.It turns out Marcus is directing that attention inward as well.  Marcus, in a conversation with TechCrunch, acknowledges that a  reorganization is taking place at PayPal. “We are reorganizing product  groups in a meaningful way. We used to have multiple product groups, and  engineering was disconnected from product. This is changing,” he  explains.Marcus  is literally gutting PayPal’s offices, removing all dividers and  cubicles, enabling a more open work environment among product, design  and engineering teams. The idea is for engineers, designers and product  managers to be in one place. Marcus, who is a serial entrepreneur and  has founded and sold multiple startups, says this way of development and  operation is the only way he knows how to iterate successfully.“We’re trying to enable people to iterate and innovate and are  putting more of an emphasis on A/B testing products, accelerating  product buildups and more. The idea is for PayPal to function more like a  startup.”That’s no easy feat for a massive company that has 13,000 employees.  Marcus acknowledges this, saying that the ability to build products fast  enough and reorganizing the company keeps him up at night. But he has a  plan.In terms of structure, Marcus is dividing product by a number of  sectors, including checkout (includes online and mobile device  payments), wallet (this includes mobile apps, APIs for third parties),  business (solutions that are merchant facing such as PayPal’s Square  competitor, PayPal Here). Notably missing—a mobile group. Why? Because  Marcus says that now, everything at PayPal starts with mobile. “Whatever  product we are designing now, we now always start with mobile first.  This applies to all products.”He adds that he is aggressively hiring designers and ramping up work  on making PayPal a beautifully designed payments experience across all  platforms. Marcus points to the company’s newest version of its iOS app,  which was redesigned for a more personal, wallet-like feel. And Marcus  says that for the first time Apple is actually featuring PayPal’s app.  “It was cluttered and we made it simple and easy to use,” says Marcus.As for what’s next feature wise, PayPal will be doubling down on  location-based payments, a functionality in which Marcus is a “big  believer.” Both small and large retailers want the ability to allow  payments via a consumer’s phone, but with an enhanced experience  specific to where they are, he explains. And these payments can cater to  both the consumer and merchant.Personalization is also key for PayPal in terms of future product  strategy from a wallet perspective, says Marcus. And PayPal is going to  be aggressively pursuing expansion in international markets. Already,  the company launched PayPal Here in Canada, Australia, Honk Kong, and  Japan. In fact, over 50 percent of PayPal’s payments volume is coming  from outside the U.S. PayPal is focusing on bringing seamless payments  to emerging markets. For example, in Brazil, PayPal is debuting a  feature-phone enabled payments product that helped yield the company  close to 1 million customers.PayPal, which recently acquired Card.io, a  company that allows developers to capture credit card information by  using a smartphone’s built-in camera, is going to be making more talent  acquisitions. “Talent is very important to us. It is key to have  founders and young engineers be part of PayPal,” says Marcus.Alvarez believes that PayPal has an advantage over other payments  players because of its installed base of over 230 million account  holders. He says that some of the areas where PayPal can potentially  disrupt the arena is by lowering the costs of credit card processing,  and location based payments. “PayPal can do what what EasyPass has done  for car travel in payments for tolls and bring that frictionless  payments environment to the shopping experience,” Alvarez explains.Marcus believes PayPal can live up to this potential and more. “This  is just the beginning for PayPal. And this is a great place for  entrepreneurs to be,” he adds.It’s clear that in an Amazon-dominated world, eBay has been looking  beyond auctions to find meaningful revenue and engagement.  Interestingly, Alavarez believes that while the auction model on eBay  will never go away, the real growth is in the BuyItNow side of the  business, which offers items at a fixed price, and is more similar to  Amazon’s marketplace. “Amazon, Groupon, and others are competitive in  the marketplace, but one of the things that eBay can do that others  can’t is to sell the selling functionality to its Magenta or GSI client  base of retailers and merchants.Strategy wise, eBay seems to be dabbling in all the right areas —  mobile, personalization, payments — but execution will be the  determiner. Large, public companies always face threats from startups  because their leaner competitors can iterate faster and more  efficiently. If eBay and PayPal can buck that trend and innovate like a  startup, then they unlock a universe of potential and profit.Original post"
827161,24491,2012-08-24T15:00:19-04:00,,"Payment processor PayPal, a unit of Best Ideas portfolio holding eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), inked a deal with Discover (NYSE:DFS) to gain access to its network of merchants. PayPal will now issue cards to its 50 million users in order to perform point of sale transactions at Discover's 7 million+ merchant network. In return, Discover will receive a small fee from PayPal on transaction processing.It goes without saying that this deal is a step in the right direction for PayPal. However, it is a somewhat shocking admission that perhaps cards will remain the preferred payment solution rather than mobile devices. However, this deal could also be viewed as Discover partnering with PayPal in order to establish a partnership in the mobile payment space.Recently, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) announced it is testing PayPal payments in France to reduce order and wait times, but we're uncertain about the degree of acceptance. We think PayPal still has a long way to go. It has 50 million accounts compared to the billions of Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa cards (NYSE:V) in circulation. Still, we like PayPal's potential opportunities.Ultimately, the PayPal-Discover deal could be an acknowledgement that a hybrid mobile and card model may be the correct method for the industry. Considering that not all cell phone users will make the transition to mobile transactions, there will still be a tremendous amount of users unable to access mobile payment networks. Though we think mobile payment adoption will be relatively fast, it will still take some time. For one, it took a long time for credit card networks to gain widespread acceptance. In fact, some places still only take cash. Credit and debit card payments aren't going away anytime soon, and that's why we're still comfortable holding Visa in our Best Ideas portfolio. The payment processing space is an industry with tremendous growth potential and significantly high returns on invested capital, and we think eBay and Visa are the two best ways to capitalize on these strong industry fundamentals.All things considered, PayPal's online transaction processing business is growing at a nice clip, and the platform offers users a safe, convenient online transaction system. eBay's fixed-price Marketplace also has been recently competing more effectively with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), making the fundamentals of the entire company quite attractive, in our view. eBay scores a rare 10 on our Buying Index (our stock-selection methodology), so we think shares remain incredibly attractive at this juncture.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

932681,25381,2012-10-18T12:48:56-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) announced its earnings for the last quarter. The company earned 55 cents per share, which is slightly above the 54 cents per share expected by the analysts. In addition, the company was somewhat cautious for the holiday season as it expects to earn between 66 and 69 cents per share whereas analysts expect the company to earn 68 cents per share in the next quarter. Furthermore, the company expects to generate revenue between $3.85 billion and $4 billion in the next quarter, which may end up being below the analyst estimate of $3.94 billion.It looks like eBay has been investing a significant amount of money and other resources to make its website easily usable through mobile platforms. The company has been redesigning its website, making it more smart phone-friendly, marketing itself more heavily, signing up partnerships with other retailers and working on improving the search capabilities within the website. The company has also been spending resources on making PayPal more flexible for the needs of consumers, which is important for eBay because PayPal accounts for nearly half of the revenues generated by the company.Of course, every change comes with some risk factor and things might backfire in the short term for the company, but this is not very likely. I believe that the company's investments will pay off greatly in the future and its double-digit annual growth rate will be sustained for the time being. Many investors were expecting eBay to increase its outlook significantly as the company has gained a lot of momentum in the last several quarters. However, the company remains cautious given the slowing economy and increased competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).The company has announced that in the last quarter, there were 800,000 consumers who bought did their first eBay shopping ever. If a good portion of these consumers continue to use the company's services, this is promising for the company's future. The company's CEO John Donahoe, whose leadership helped it see strong growth in recent years after lagging behind Amazon for several years, commented that he ""didn't see why the company couldn't double its user base within the next 3-5 years."" As the current users spend more and new users are added, growth should be solid for eBay in the medium and long term.For the full year, eBay expects to earn between $2.32 and $2.35 per share on revenue of $14 billion. This is roughly in line with the analyst estimates. If they materialize, these numbers will give the company a forward price to earnings ratio of 20 and a forward price to revenue ratio of 4.4. These are valuations I would expect from a company that is expected to grow at a rate of 10-15% annually, and eBay actually meets this criterion. After being up by 58% year to date, eBay looks fairly valued. Of course, this doesn't mean eBay is a bad investment. A lot of companies that are fairly valued turn out to be great investments over time.In the last 2 earnings reports, investors have reacted very positively. In April, the company's share price jumped from $35.87 to $40.62 after the earnings announcement. In July, the company's share price jumped from $38.60 to $44.85 within a matter of days once the company announced earnings. This time, I don't expect such a big jump. In fact, the company's share price might take a breather for a while and trade either flat or downwards. If the share price falls below $40 again, this company will become a great buy.In the short term, the company's online marketplace business might continue to lose market share to fierce competition which includes but is not limited to Amazon, while PayPal fuels most of the company's growth. At the moment I wouldn't sell eBay but I wouldn't buy it either. I would simply wait for a better entry point that is closer to $40 for nice returns.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

923571,24631,2012-10-15T07:08:19-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) will report Q3 results on October 17th.The Street expects:Heading into earnings, investors can expect continued turnaround of Marketplaces and momentum from PayPal. According to ChannelAdvisor, eBay sales for the quarter could see a slight upside, given its 24% growth compared with 22% growth in Q2.In my view, eBay's Marketplaces is on a steady turnaround path after the company invested heavily on improving user experience (eg. 14-day returns, fixed price items, mobile), search algorithm, fee structure and security. In addition, the enhanced product selections, free shipping and superior search results have translated to accelerated active users growth (+8% y/y) and items sold (+20% y/y) in 2Q12.Aside from Marketplaces, PayPal has emerged as a formidable force in the global online payment markets despite rising competition. The platform has achieved mid 20% FX-adjusted total payment volume in the past 10 quarters and its 113 million active accounts generated 565 million payments valued at $34.5 billion in Q2.According to management, PayPal is growing at least twice as fast as Marketplaces and its momentum is unlikely to slowdown anytime soon due to the upcoming products such as PayPal Here and redesign of Bill Me Later. Looking into 2013, PayPal's partnership with Discovery (NYSE:DFS) will give PayPal the access to another 7 million merchants who accepts Discovery credit card and be accretive to PayPal's proliferation. Hence, I am extremely positive on eBay's growth and its turnaround story is quite compelling for long-term investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The growth was primarily driven by PayPal which added one million new active per month in Q2 even as the Total Payment Volume (TPV) grew to $34.5 billion, up 20 percent year over year. Meanwhile, the gross merchandise volume on Marketplaces grew at 15% year over year. The 15% growth excludes the vehicles segment and effects of foreign currency.In the Q3 earnings call due October 17th, we will be watching closely how eBay plans to extend its lead in the payments space as well as grow its e-commerce businesses. We will look out for any announcements regarding performance in the last quarter of Paypal Here, its mobile card payment offering which enables small businesses to accept card payments. eBay competes primarily with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Square, Intuit GoPayment and other competitors in the payments space, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in e-commerce.MarketplaceseBay continues to improve its Marketplaces and recently launched a new logo and a redesigned interface. The new site draws inspiration from social photo-sharing site Pinterest. The most noticeable new feature is the eBay Feed, a section dedicated to providing improved product discovery features. The company has acquired some start-ups to supplement its efforts in this direction, the most notable being Hunch in 2011 and Svpply in September this year.The company has also increased its efforts in the direction of mobile commerce with its apps reaching the 100 million download milestone last month. Available in eight languages, and in more than 190 different countries around the world, eBay apps have been downloaded 25 million times in the last six months alone, making them some of the most popular and successful shopping apps anywhere. The growth of eBay’s mobile properties also aligns with the milestone of 100 million listings via mobile, as a record number of sellers choose to list their products on eBay through devices that didn’t exist just a few years ago. We will be watching the earnings call closely for any hints related to eBay’s growth strategy in the m-commerce space.PayPalPayPal delivered a strong second quarter performance with revenues rising 26% to $1.4 billion. The growth was driven primarily by increased penetration on eBay as well as continued merchant and consumer adoption and strong growth in Bill Me Later. The number of active paying accounts grew to 113 million in Q2.It continued its efforts to expand its offline presence through a tie-up with Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) which gives it access to nearly 7 million merchant locations in the U.S. and potentially many more worldwide in the future. The “PayPal Here” device continues to make in-roads as a replacement for cash payment registers. Cross selling is also helping PayPal push it services. For example, Office Depot not only signed up for PayPal’s point-of-sale, but also signed up for PayPal Online and PayPal Mobile.We currently have a $50 Trefis price estimate for eBay, which is at a 5% premium to the market price."

You can run out of it. It wears out. It can get lost or stolen. In the twenty-first century, people need a form of money that's more convenient and secure, something that can be accessed from anywhere with a PDA or an Internet connection.""This statement was made by Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, over thirteen years ago. To think that in 1999, when the top selling cell phone was the Nokia 3210, a guy named Peter Thiel was onto something. Fast forward to 2012 and his words still ring true as competition in the mobile commerce space intensifies. With the recent announcement of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Square working together, the mobile payments industry is buzzing. Starbucks practically has a store on every major intersection in America, if you can easily pick up your morning coffee using only your mobile device, imagine what else you can do.PayPal has gained a significant advantage; however, rivals like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Visa's (NYSE:V) ""V.me"", Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) ""Wallet"", Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) ""Passbook"", American Express's (NYSE:AXP) ""Serve"", and Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) ""Credits""  are all looking to gain market share in what may be a game changer for how consumers pay for purchases.

The company created a ""Mobile Payments Readiness Index"", which measures 34 different countries' readiness to shift from plastic to mobile devices. They rank the countries on a scale of 0-100, any score over 60 (the inflection point) indicates the country has reached the stage where mobile devices account for a major component of payments. Currently, not one country has progressed past the inflection point. We are in the early stages of mobile payments and different markets will bring a multitude of opportunities to companies that are positioned appropriately.So why choose eBay Inc.'s (NASDAQ:EBAY) PayPal over any of the other competitors? PayPal has been around since 1998 and is currently available in 190 markets supporting payments for 25 major currencies. The company has been adding an average of 1,000,000 actively registered accounts per month (see chart below). In the second quarter of 2012 PayPal customers made 565 million transactions, roughly 6.2 million per day! As you are reading this article, a few thousand transactions around the world have occurred. We are not talking about a company in its infancy, this is a well established brand that is driving the growth story for eBay.Source: eBay Quarterly Press ReleasesThe revenue growth rate PayPal delivers has been tremendous (see table and chart below). Growth is coming from more than just online transactions. In March, the company released ""PayPal Here"" - which turns any iPhone or Android phone into a mobile credit card terminal. Merchants who use this service are charged a flat 2.7% fee. Additionally, sixteen retailers, including Home Depot, Abercrombie and Fitch, and Office Depot, have PayPal on their point of sale terminals at the checkout register. Many others allow users to pay for online purchases using PayPal or directly from their mobile device.Source: eBay 10-k's and 10-q'sPayPal is quickly becoming a major source of revenue for eBay. In the chart below, you can see PayPal's contribution to net revenue. During the first six months of 2012, PayPal already accounted for 39.9% of eBay's top line. Although eBay has denied spinning off the PayPal division and has no intentions of initiating a dividend, I would argue that both may be likely over the next five years. In the meantime, the company is returning capital to shareholders through a $2-billion stock repurchase program.Source: eBay 10-k's and 10-q'sAs the mobile commerce industry takes off, we will eventually see who the winners and losers are. With so many companies competing in this space, I think PayPal is the most reputable and secure provider available. Industry site PYMNTS.com recently named PayPal the ""Most Disruptive"" company during their Innovator Awards. To many companies, this awards title would be insulting, but in the world of mobile payments, it is a complement. Shares of eBay currently trade at 18X forward earnings - fairly inexpensive, given the growth opportunities that lie ahead.*Note: All data reported and graphed is pulled directly from eBay's SEC filings (10K's and 10Q's) then ran through proprietary valuation models.

Once you hit the ""Bring It"" button, your personal eBay shopping valet will pick up the signal and deliver the item to wherever you are-the office, home or the nearby coffee shop. The delivery fee for your first three purchases (which can't cost less than $25) will be waived, after which point a $5 surcharge will be tacked on.It's still in beta mode as of yet. We might expect something from eBay very soon though.""Same-day services are satisfying both the convenient need of online shopping and immediacy factor of offline,"" says Scot Wingo, chief executive officer of ChannelAdvisor, a global e-commerce software provider.Though previous attempts at same-day delivery didn't come to fruition, will eBay be any successful at it?Understanding the Business Dynamic of eBayIf we look at the business dynamics of eBay, it is not very hard to understand that eBay mainly connects retailers with online shoppers.When that is the case, it's pretty easy to imagine that all eBay has to do now is sell through the local stores of Target (NYSE:TGT), Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) and Walgreens (WAG). Nevertheless, this will lead to even increased consumer spending online and higher revenue for those above-mentioned retail stores.In fact, if we look at it from this viewpoint, most of these retail sites are actually competitors of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). I don't know whether this will turn out to be bad for Amazon or not.The ecommerce market is worth over $43 billion last quarter in 2012. So, there's place for everyone. But when eBay is gearing up so hard, it's best for Amazon to take some counteraction measures.A Glimpse of 2011's eBay AcquisitionsIs it really important to know about the acquisitions? Is there any relation with the above news? Well, knowing what eBay is up to will definitely give you an edge in making an intelligent decision like the smart investor.On January 14, eBay completed the acquisition of Brands4friends, Germany's largest online shopping club with approximately 3.5 million registered club members, for around $200 million.On June 20, eBay completed the acquisition agreement of GSI Commerce (NASDAQ:GSIC), a leading provider of ecommerce and interactive marketing services, for approximately $2 billion.On August 11, eBay bought Zong, a leading provider of payments through mobile carrier billing, for approximately $240 million.On August 17, eBay bought Magento, a leading open source ecommerce platform, and a year back, it already bought Milo, on which this same-day delivery service would be based.It seems that eBay has spent a lot of money for better market reach enhancement, easier mobile payment facilitation and aggressive acquisition of potential clients.The more clients it acquires, the better experience it offer to the users, the wider it spreads the wings…the better for their bottom-line.Does It Show On Its Financial Sheets?Sure, it does. Quarterly revenues increased to $3.4 billion last quarter this year from $2.2 billion during the second quarter in 2010, for the ninth time at a stretch. Just going by this information, eBay seems to know what it is doing. More revenues always signify business growth, good for us, investors!Quarterly operating income rose to $695 million last quarter this year compared to $485 million same quarter in 2010. Operating income says whether the company is performing positively or negatively.eBay recently sold Skype for over $2 billion. This is just another part of the business streamlining process, for better operating profit margins.eBay has spent a lot of cash till the second quarter of 2011, and that certainly showed in the cash flow statement. But as the balance sheet shows, cash and cash equivalents have been piling up fast since then, and to follow that, eBay has recently announced the pricing of a $3.0 billion underwritten public offering of its senior unsecured notes due 2015-2042.I can sense something is up eBay's sleeves, and I supremely believe that we will see further developments in the coming few years ahead.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
852711,29461,2012-09-07T06:21:51-04:00,,"eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) has impressive fundamentals, and is the world's favorite place where buyers and sellers converge to exchange a variety of goods. In addition to ebay.com, EBAY operates other online commerce platforms like Half.com, Rent.com, classified websites, and global payment platform PayPal that offers a convenient, yet secure way to make online payments.PayPal, a market leader in the online payment idustry, provides a convenient way for users to make online payments, and for merchants to receive payments. EBAY's stock is bound to get a boost in light of the recent developments relating to PayPal's partnership with Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), which will give the company substantially wider access to physical retailers around the country. Discover Financial Services operates the Discover Network (its credit card network). Recently, in a study by J.D. Power and Associates, Discover's cards were second only to American Express in overall customer satisfaction. The collaboration will give PayPal access to Discover's 7 million U.S. retail locations. PayPal currently boasts a total user base of $113 million. Considering the aforementioned developments, and the current attractive valuations that we provide at the end of this article, we recommend that investors long the stock.The partnership will work this way; PayPal's U.S. accounts will eventually be eligible for a PayPal card, which will allow cardholders to transact at stores (using their cell number and PIN code). This presents a huge opportunity for merchants, since the deal will give the 50 million active users of PayPal the option to pay at retail stores that already accept Discover's cards. This comes at no initial incremental cost for retailers, since no new hardware needs to be set up to accommodate transactions. For Discover, which will enable PayPal on its already existing network, the advantage comes with the collection of Network Switching/Processing fees on PayPal transactions.We expect healthy increases in transactions per account once the system is fully incorporated with the existing Discover networks. Beginning in the second quarter of 2013, the initial roll-out will include 1,500 merchants, and the rest will be implemented over the course of the year. To make the adoption of the plans more successful, PayPal will launch an aggressive campaign along with Discover, resulting in expenses without revenue increments. PayPal also estimates that the business will have higher margins, and a lower revenue take rate (commission eBay charges). These are indeed massive opportunities, but PayPal will face mounting pressure from other credit card issuers like Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), which have many more customers compared to the 50 million that PayPal has.PayPal also intends to shift to card-free solutions using mobile devices. Shifting to a card-free system presents a lucrative opportunity for retailers around the globe, since sales are bound to increase with the adoption of the payment system. But PayPal and Discover aren't the only ones counting on the system for increased profitability. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and other large retailers have founded a joint venture called Merchant Customer Exchange, the purpose of which is to enable smartphone-based transactions.Recent Financial PerformanceEBAY registered an earnings surprise of 1.8% in the last quarter, with EPS of $0.56. Analysts expect EPS of $0.56 and $2.34 for the next quarter and full year ending December 2012, respectively. PayPal accounted for 55% of total revenues for the quarter. The Marketplace segment saw a sequential increase of 2% in active users, and a YoY increase of 8%. Gross merchandise volume grew at 10% YoY, but fell by a marginal amount sequentially. Gross margins are expected to remain stable over the years, as table (1) below shows. Revenues have shown a consistent upward trend and are expected to touch the $16b mark by the end of 2013.Table 1:ValuationsSince 2005, the company has never missed analyst expectations, and the stock has on average shot up 10.5% after an earnings release. It is currently trading at 17x its forward earnings (2013), against its five-year historical average of 20x. Furthermore, it also trades at 4.5x its sales, below its seven-year average of 6x. Long-term earnings growth rate is estimated at 13%. The PEG ratio stands at 1.3. Its competitors, MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), are trading at 28x and 104x, respectively.Based on historical averages, the recent encouraging developments with Discover Financial Services, and its comparison with its competitors, we consider the stock to be attractively valued at the moment, and recommend it as a buy. Although we believe the partnership with Discover will ultimately expand PayPal's addressable market, the company hasn't provided any guidance on the potential financial impact. Hence, there remains a potential risk in the performance of the stock should the company fail to realize the benefits, as is currently expected by the market.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Technology Analyst.

882311,22148,2012-09-22T13:51:35-04:00,,"Just about every day, a company releases news regarding the mobile payments area. Unfortunately for investors with only access to the public markets, the news tends to be from a private company and more importantly, the focus is usually on Square.For investors, a few opportunities exist via PayPal, a division of eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU). See original article from April regarding the different investment options. PayPal appears to have the best plan, but do investors get enough exposure from an investment in eBay with a market cap of $64B?PayPal Q2 HighlightsThe company reported the following Q2 highlights for the PayPal division:PayPal revenue accounted for roughly 40% of total eBay revenue. At 26% revenue growth, it clearly places the division as the driver of growth within the company. The main Marketplaces division is only growing at 9%.Mobile, though, remains a small fraction of that revenue base. It expects roughly $10B in mobile volume in 2012 for each PayPal and Marketplaces. That makes the mobile payments part of PayPal less than 10% of the total volume.Stock ValuationThe eBay stock has seen considerable gains since the April article. As mentioned, the company now has a valuation of $64B. It trades at an expensive valuation to its growth rate even counting the fast growth of payments.Another concerning situation is that the free cash flow has weakened in the first half of 2012. In fact, the free cash flow basically peaked in Q4 2010, suggesting the underlying situation might not be as good as the revenue growth suggests.The forecasted free cash flow for 2012 is around $2.45B, making the stock valued at 26x those estimates.Sector DevelopmentsSquare is now handling $8B in payments a year, up from $4B back in April when we initially wrote about this sector. The company also announced raising $200M in a new round of funding. The deal reportedly values the company at $3.25B.With similar mobile payments processed, this values the PayPal mobile transactions at just over $3B or 5% of the company.This week, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) announced the launch of Groupon Payments. The company will offer a mobile card reader that uses an app on the iPhone or iPod to enter the space. It hopes to expand on the daily deals service already provided to retailers by offering the lowest cost for payment services.Groupon is offering three main rate structures:The potential of this offering actually makes Groupon the most interesting investment idea in the mobile payments space. At a market cap of only $3.5B, the stock is actually only slightly more expensive than the reported value of Square.ConclusionThe PayPal division of eBay remains an interesting growth story in both payments and especially the mobile payments arena. Unfortunately the potential value of the mobile transactions division is too small to invest in eBay for that reason.Groupon is too early on in the mobile payments development process to tell whether this concept will work. Not to mention, by providing the lowest fees will the service even be profitable. The company after all is known for offering deals and providing a ""Groupon"" to customers for credit card processing might not be the best way to make money.For now, the mobile payments sector promises a lot of growth, yet investors in general are left with nothing more than promises.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

I bought and profiled these shares back in early January when the stock was trading close to $30, mainly due to its fast growing PayPal franchise. EBAY is up more than 40% since then after a stellar earnings report. I am holding my shares as the company is hitting on all cylinders and rapidly evolving into a payment powerhouse. With mobile payments just starting coming into their own, I believe Paypal will soon be seen as a major competitor to the likes of Visa (V) and American Express (AXP) and it will remain a core part of my long term portfolio,"
807951,21798,2012-08-15T01:51:39-04:00,,"EBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) has grown to become a $56.7 billion market-cap provider of online commerce platforms. The company's online auctions, fixed price offerings, and PayPal payment system have become a popular way for individuals and businesses to perform online transactions.The company reported positive results for Q2 2012, with a revenue increase of 23% and an earnings per share increase of 16%. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.56 which exceeded estimates by 1.8%. This was the third quarter in a row that eBay exceeded its earnings estimates. This is also the third consecutive quarter where more than half of eBay's PayPal revenue came from outside the U.S. PayPal now accounts for over half of eBay's market-cap and is the company's primary driver of growth.Channel Advisor just reported that eBay's same store sales growth increased 28.2% for July. Strength was in the fixed-price category which increased 33.1% and eBay motors (parts & accessories) which increased 36%. This is another positive sign that the company is picking up momentum.The company is fairly valued with a forward PE ratio of 16.6, a PEG of 1.41, and a price to book ratio of 3. EBay has a high profit margin of 28.67% and an operating margin of 20.34%. For the past twelve months, the company has raked in $3.09 billion in operating cash flow and $1.06 billion in free cash flow.The balance sheet looks great as the company has about 2.8 times more total cash than total debt. It also has nearly twice the amount of current assets than current liabilities with a current ratio of 1.95.The company is expected to grow earnings annually at 13.25% for the next five years. This is sufficient to outpace the performance of the average S&P 500 company. This growth rate should allow the current stock price of $45 to increase to over $80 in five years.EBay has created a more convenient and positive experience with its mobile application. Users can access eBay from their smart phones/mobile devices for optimal convenience. The company added 600,000 new users in Q2. Although, the company doesn't know exactly how many users were added as a result of mobile, PayPal's CEO John Donahoe stated that there has been an accelerated growth rate of new users in the last nine months.The company has also been adding about 1 million new PayPal consumers per month for the past 3 years. This growth is 2 to 3 times faster than the e-commerce market. This is another example of how eBay is benefiting from a growth industry.Overall, eBay looks like a solid long-term investment. The company should continue to benefit from the growth of mobile and worldwide usage. An investment in eBay is an investment in the entrepreneurial dynamic of the new economy. Investors will reap the benefits of the transactions of millions of buyers and sellers throughout the world.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

As mentioned in the preview, we had a feeling this would be a great quarter for the company, and boy were we right. As of this writing the stock is up ~10% and flirting with new highs. In this blog post, we'll dissect the quarterly results focusing exclusively on the marketplace side of things (no payments or GSI, etc.) and highlight what we think are the most material datapoints for sellers.Second Quarter Results Tracker and HighlightsHere's a key metrics tracker that we've updated to show eBay's Q2 results vs. their own guidance and Wall St. expectations.(Click to enlarge)I think the highlight of the conference call was John Donahoe's statement:That's definitely true and exciting, but what's really impressive is that the marketplace is obviously a great deal larger now than what it was back in 2006, so they are accelerating a much larger 'mass'.Here are some other tidbits of interest to sellers:eBay BFF's MobilePerhaps most interesting was the continued bullishness on mobile across both eBay and Paypal:eBay's growth vs. e-commerceWe always like to compare eBay vs. e-commerce growth to see how the MP is doing against the baseline growth rate of the industry. In this chart we show that visually, and include some of these 'interior' data points that eBay is now sharing:You can see that eBay is essentially growing in-line with e-commerce in the U.S. What's more interesting and to my earlier point is that you have TRS and FP growing faster than e-commerce and gaining share vs. the other components (non-eTRS and auctions) - as that happens, the eBay growth rate should drift up toward those high teens and low twenties, something I don't think eBay is really putting into its guidance and that Wall St. is counting on happening.Category detailsOne of the most popular datapoints we publish is category detail. First, let's look at the categories by size:What really stands out to me from this data is that Home and Garden is now at a > $10b growth rate. I'll have to check the history of vehicles, but I'm definitely sure this is the first non-vehicle (and maybe the first category period) to get to this massive scale. H+G is interesting to me because it keeps on chugging without much focus from eBay.Here's a view of the categories by Q2 growth rate:I've color coded these into three buckets: Leaders, Neutral and Laggards.Leaders:Neutral:Laggards:What we're watching for in Q3One interesting thing to watch for in Q3 is the annualization of last year's price change where they included S+H in FVF. It's our analysis this added to some of the growth rates and if they hold pricing the same, it will be interesting to see if this causes any slowdowns or not. Those changes went live on July 6, 2011.Also, we'll be looking for any kind of read on the Holiday 2012 which hopefully will put a nice cherry on top of what is shaping up to be a great 'post turnaround' year for the eBay Marketplace.What did you think of the Q?

825781,34211,2012-08-24T02:12:34-04:00,,"Fourteen years ago, when a little-known company named eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) went public, few imagined just how much the world of retail was going to change. At the time, the notion of an ""online auction"" was unheard of. The company had a mere 30 employees at the time, but it has since exploded to become one of the most successful tech stocks around, completely changing the way people bought and sold items in the global marketplace. One of the most successful components for eBay has been its online payment system, PayPal. For many online merchants, PayPal is the weapon of choice. With the recent news that eBay has reached a deal with Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) to allow its PayPal services to be used in retail stores throughout the country, eBay may be set to change the game once again.With this recent news, eBay's reaches are no longer limited to the internet. The deal allows customers to pay with PayPal in any retail store nationwide that uses Discover, which amounts to over 7 million stores. PayPal currently has 50 million users, and that number will certainly grow on the heels of this latest news. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say this is going to be absolutely huge for eBay, and so far that looks like it's going to be the case. It just hit its 52-week high, and I see no reason to think it won't keep going up from here, especially as stores start implementing the new deal with PayPal. Analysts praised the deal as a move that keeps PayPal at the forefront of its field.""This initiative further distances PayPal's digital wallet ahead of other mobile payment platforms,"" R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said. ""PayPal continues to take measured and deliberate steps to extend its reach into the 'bricks and mortar' channel.""This move comes as no surprise, as eBay has recently been exploring ways to get into physical stores. The past year has seen eBay extend its PayPal services into many different retailers nationwide, including Home Depot. This new deal with Discover extends that number astronomically. Over the course of the next year, PayPal will begin issuing cards to its users that can be swiped at stores that accept Discover, using a PIN. Since Discover cards are not accepted in as many locations as Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) or MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), the move is also expected to be beneficial to Discover, as more stores will undoubtedly begin accepting Discover to meet customer demand of being able to pay with PayPal.Another factor to consider that makes this move even more important going forward is the evolution of smartphones being used for mobile purchasing. Digital payment systems are going to be paramount going forward, and eBay is a name people already know and trust. Other companies are looking to get into digital payment systems, but eBay has already been at it for a decade, so the evolving world of digital payments is far less foreign to them.Digital wallets are just in their infancy, and this deal with Discover is really the first major event that could really push things forward - and eBay could be set to reap huge rewards. In an interview with Bloomberg, PayPal Vice President of Retail Services Don Kingsborough touted the deal as great for both Discover and eBay.""This really makes real all the technology and things that people have been working on and the changes in consumer behavior,"" Kingsborough said. ""This is the first time that you make it real for the consumer and for the retailers.""Last quarter, eBay pulled in 40 percent of its revenue from PayPal, so it's clear PayPal is going to be an integral part of the eBay brand going forward. And though eBay is one of the kings of online shopping, the vast majority of people still do their shopping in physical retail stores. While more people will undoubtedly move to online shopping in the future, there will always be a desire for in-person shopping, as many people want to be able to see and feel the products they are buying. Thus, this move for eBay to extend its presence into these physical spaces is a brilliant one, and I would strongly recommend buying eBay immediately.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Revenue for the second quarter jumped 23% from the year-ago period, to $3.4 billion, roughly in line with expectations. Meanwhile, earnings per share increased 16% year over year to $0.56, a penny above the consensus estimate. The firm registers a 10 on the Valuentum Buying Index (the highest mark), and we think shares remain undervalued. eBay reiterated third-quarter guidance of $0.53-$0.55 and full-year earnings guidance of $2.30-$2.35 on revenue of $13.8-$14.1 billion.PayPal continues to be a key growth driver at the e-commerce giant. During the second quarter, the firm processed over $34 billion worth of transactions, an increase of 20% over the same period in 2011. Revenues for the segment grew 26% to $1.4 billion across over 113.2 million users (a 13% increase compared to a year ago). Payment processing margins increased 270 basis points over the same period last year to 66.3% on a take-rate of 3.94%. Mobile payment adoption and merchant acceptance continues to grow, and PayPal now has 16 committed national point-of-sale payment processing customers. Although PayPal still has a long way to go before matching Mastercard (NYSE:MA) or Visa (NYSE:V) in terms of payment processing volumes, we are confident PayPal will continue to grow thanks to secular tailwinds and market share gains.In addition to strong growth at PayPal, eBay itself experienced decent expansion in the second quarter. Gross merchandise volumes advanced 10%, to over $16 billion, driving revenue growth of 9%, to $1.8 billion. Though alternatives like craigslist.com and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) remain popular, eBay's integration with PayPal and extensive network make it an attractive e-commerce outlet. GSI, acquired by eBay in the second quarter of 2011, also continues to post strong results, adding $221 million in revenue. GSI, which provides the e-commerce infrastructure for firms, generated 21% same-store sales growth in the second quarter. We think GSI will eventually become an even more meaningful addition to the revenue mix.eBay remains a cash cow, generating $411 million in free cash flow in the second quarter, while increasing its cash and cash equivalents to $7.6 billion. Management also repurchased $355 million in stock and authorized $2 billion in additional stock buybacks. With an incredibly healthy balance sheet, an increasingly valuable asset in PayPal, and strong organic growth in its own marketplace, we think eBay is one of the best investment opportunities available right now.

Revenue increased 23% to $3.4 billion, compared to the same period of 2011. Non-GAAP earnings came in at $0.56 per diluted share, while eBay posted Q2 net income of $692 million - up from $283 million in Q2 2011. In terms of benchmarks, analysts had been expecting earnings of $0.55 per share on revenue of $3.36 billion.For reference, we can compare this to Q2 2011, when (excluding one-time items) eBay earned 48 cents per share with revenue posted at $2.76 billion - both of which were, at the time, above estimates. Now, as it was then, eBay continues to operate as one of the largest eCommerce companies in the world, so many look to the health of its principal businesses as an indicator of how eCommerce is faring overall. And although the economic pains over the last few years have wreaked havoc on traditional retailers and brick and mortars, it seems that eBay and online commerce seem to be more than weathering the storm.Analysts were also looking to PayPal, which had an extremely active first quarter (with numerous additions to its product set) and ended Q1 with 109.8 million active registered accounts for signs of growth. PayPal didn't disappoint, with registered users jumping to 113.2 million in Q2.The company has been moving to take its payment solution beyond the Web, bringing it to local merchants in brick-and-mortar stores and to mobile devices with its recently-launched Square competitor. PayPal's revenue increased 26% year, and the platform's net total payment volume grew 20% year over year to $34.5 billion. (This report follows, by the way, PayPal's acquisition of Card.io yesterday.)But the biggest contributor to the company's continued growth in the second quarter came from Marketplaces, which saw the strongest ""organic growth rate in gross merchandise volume, excluding vehicles, since 2006,"" eBay said in a statement. GMV grew at a 15 percent year-over-year basis (excluding the effects of foreign currency), while international GMV increased 15 percent to $16 billion. In all, Marketplaces revenue grew 9 percent year-over-year to $1.8 billion in the second quarter of 2012. Meanwhile, sold items increased 20 percent in the second quarter, a 2.5 percentage point acceleration, which the company said reflected ""a better customer experience and improved selection.""Also of note: eBay's suite of mobile apps surpassed 90 million downloads globally since it launched mobile in Q3 2008 - up from 78 million global downloads in Q1. As Donahoe mentioned, the company is now expecting both eBay and PayPal mobile to generate $10 billion in mobile transacted volume in 2012, which, for those keeping track at home, is more than double what it saw in 2011.The company's GSI business, which was acquired in the second quarter of 2011, saw $221 million in revenue for the quarter and generated $674 million in global eCommerce (GeC) merchandise sales, a slight drop from $237 million in revenue and $715 million in global sales in the first quarter. However, same store sales grew 21% year-over-year (compared to 26 percent year-over-year growth in Q1), which is an indication of strong eCommerce sales from the company's retail clients.As for looking forward, eBay is expecting more of the same, maintaining the guidance it set forth in April. The company forecasted net revenues in the range of $3.3 to $3.4 billion in the third quarter, with non-GAAP earnings per diluted share expected in the range of $0.53 to $0.55. In turn, it held firm on guidance for the year, expecting revenues in the range of $13.8 to $14.1 billion with GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.91 to $1.96 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be between $2.30 and $2.35 - exactly on par with guidance at the end of Q1.Remember, too, that eBay posted a solid first quarter, in which it was remarkably active, especially when it came to PayPal. The company put a good deal of resources into ramping up payment options for large and small merchants, debuting an in-store payments platform for large retailers; PayPal Here, a card swiper that attaches to a mobile phone for small businesses, with hints at a brand new PayPal wallet.And, of course, there were a number of leadership changes at the e-commerce company in Q1. After former president Scott Thompson departed for the CEO role at Yahoo, PayPal named David Marcus, the former CEO and founder of mobile payments startup Zong and PayPal Mobile VP, as President (PayPal acquired Zong last year for $240 million).X.commerce CTO Neal Sample also left eBay to join American Express, while PayPal product VP Sam Shrauger left for Yahoo and Alyssa Cutright took off for Square.Q2 earnings highlights below:View this document on ScribdOriginal post"

726701,21439,2012-07-17T13:56:56-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) will report their second-quarter results after the bell this  Wednesday, July 18th. In this article, we preview what we're looking for  from a seller's perspective regarding the report.Wenig pre-announces strong user growth and goal to double eBay GMV in three yearsOne interesting point this quarter: In his talk(s) at eBay On Location, eBay's new marketplace president, Devin Wenig, told attendees  that year-over-year active user growth was really accelerating and was in the  double digits (so 10%-plus). I don't think anyone on Wall Street picked up on  this and since it was said in Q2, could point to a stronger quarter than  many are forecasting. He also states it has an internal goal to  double in three years, which would be a 26% annual growth rate (with  compounding). That is essentially double what it is growing as of  Q1. We'll see if it shares that with Wall Street or if it was more of a  statement to get sellers jazzed up.Will eBay announce a new CBT solution?Finally, Wenig has been out talking publicly about a new  international program for sellers coming soon (Cross Border Trade, or CBT  in eBay-speak) -- perhaps that will be announced on the call.  The way  he describes it, the seller opts into the program and their items are now shown across all eBay international channels. Let's say a buyer in the U.K. purchases from a buyer in the U.S. -- eBay shows the U.K. buyer their fully loaded shipping costs including tarifs/customs. eBay sends a ship notification to the U.S. buyer to send to a U.S.-based reshipping facility. The reshipping facility receives the item and then ""reships"" it to its U.K. destination. eBay then updates the U.K. buyer on the status of the item as it works through the system.This type of service is provided by third parties such as FiftyOne  and Bongo today for non-eBay transactions and has some interesting  pros/cons to think through:Pros:Cons:UnknownsFinally, Wenig hasn't stated what the economic model will be.  If  eBay sees this as a profit center, it could be a new source of revenue  (pro for Wall Street).  Historically, eBay has used shipping as a revenue  driver vs. Amazon's approach of funding shipping, so it will be  interesting to see what it does here.  If it does see it as a profit  center, someone has to fund that and historically it is the eBay seller  that does, so that could be a negative and slow adoption of the seller  side of the equation (supply).For example, let's say you are shipping a pair of shoes to the U.K. and  the cost is $15.  If eBay marks that up 30%, or ~$5, then it either  has to get the seller to fund the $5 or the buyer.  International  buyers do tend to be OK with higher shipping because, in most cases, the  reason they are shopping outside of their borders is to get to some  unique selection, so they tend to be less value conscious. But there is a  limit and eBay has to realize they are competing with off-eBay  alternatives that aren't as expensive.eBay Q2 results trackerIn addition to the user growth and CBT solution, Wall Street is watching  for any macroeconomic headwinds. For example, the EU is still under  pressure and Comscore came out with e-commerce numbers in the U.S. this  week that were less than robust.Here is our key metrics tracker with eBay's guidance and Wall Street expectations:Disclosure: I am long AMZN and GOOG.

731121,24631,2012-07-19T00:26:39-04:00,,"eBay (EBAY) reported 2Q12 results yesterday after the close.Highlights:Both revenue and EPS came in better than expected and grew 23% y/y and 16% y/y respectively, as the company continues to deliver solid execution across its business segments.Payment revenue was $1.36 billion, +27% y/y on a FX-neutral basis, and TPV reached $34.5 billion, +23% FX-neutral basis, driven by continued expansion of PayPal, which added more than 1 million active accounts to 113 million over the quarter.PayPal's POS adoption was strong. As I mentioned in my earnings preview, 15 new retailers in addition to Home Depot (HD) have agreed to accept PayPal as a payment method and two of them, Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Jos.A.Bank, are already live. ANF introduced PayPal's POS in over 900 stores in just four weeks to get ready for back-to-school season and Jos.A.Bank expanded its pilot to a full national rollout in over 550 stores. In addition, Office Depot (ODP) implemented POS, PayPal Online, and PayPal Mobile. PayPal Here also generated strong interest after entering four markets, including a joint-venture with SoftBank in Japan, and recently introduced the app for both iPhone and Android.Market Places revenue reached $1.81 billion, +14% y/y on a FX-neutral basis and gross merchandise volume achieved the strongest growth since 2006. International non-vehicle GMV was especially strong, + 16% on FX-neutral basis, due to strong sales in UK, China, and Korea.Mobile continues to show robust growth. According to management, mobile volume is expected to double in 2012. eBay's mobile app has been downloaded 90 million times and is gaining momentum among both buyers and sellers. Sellers are listing 2 million items on mobile devices each week and 600K new customers made first purchase via mobile app during the quarter.Bottom line, this quarter was solid given the strong performance from both PayPal and Market Place. Management's $3.3-3.4 billion revenue and $0.53-0.55 EPS guidance are both shy of consensus $0.55 EPS on $3.41 billion in revenue given the macro headwind the company faces in all of its operating regions.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
716841,24631,2012-07-12T06:45:44-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) report Q2 earnings on July 18th.The Street expects:In Q1, eBay delivered a robust quarter that validates its strength in e-commerce. Revenue of $3.3 billion was an increase of 29% y/y. PayPal continues to gain momentum with revenue up 32% y/y due to increasing merchant and consumer adoption. Management guided $3.3 billion in revenue, plus 20% y/y, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.54.Heading into earnings, PayPal will continue to drive growth for eBay and building its mobile and point of sale (POS) platform is a top priority. According to management, PayPal expects to process $7 billion in mobile payments this year.In late May, eBay made two significant announcements as it makes a further push into offline payments and mobile. The first announcement was a partnership with VeriFone and Equinox, which are the #1 and #3 POS terminal providers. VeriFone operates in the electronic payment space and is used by 80% of the top 200 retailers. In addition, it has 5 out of 7 million terminals in the U.S. While these partnerships will not have immediate effect on PayPal, they nonetheless effectively legitimize PayPal's potential and pave the way for broad adoption by retailers.The second announcement indicated that PayPal's POS was gaining traction as 15 national retailers had agreed to accept PayPal as a payment method. The new retailers are: Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF), Advanced Auto Parts, Aeropostale (NYSE:ARO), American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO), Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS), Foot Locker (NYSE:FL), Guitar Center, Jamba Juice, JC Penney (JCP), Jos.A.Bank, Nine West, Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP), Rooms To Go, Tiger Direct and Toys ""R"" Us. The 15 retailers add additional 17K locations for PayPal's POS. Counting Home Depot's (NYSE:HD), PayPal has partnerships with a total of 16 retailers with over 19000 locations.Going forward, I expect further adoption by the retailers as PayPal's POS to deliver considerable payment flexibility to the consumers. I note that McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is currently testing the PayPal application in France and Australia. If McDonald's decides to adopt PayPal POS, eBay could double its POS locations with McDonald's' 26K branches.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The numbers are typically released at 4:15 p.m. ET and will be followed with a conference call at 5:00 p.m. eBay is expected to deliver solid results for the recent Q2 on strength in the PayPal and Marketplaces segments.Outliers and StrategyIn its previous earnings release, eBay gave the following guidance for Q2 2012:With Q2 2012 results potentially priced in, much of the focus will center on the outlook for Q3 2012.Any adjustments to the outlook for FY 2012 could also have consequences for eBay shares. Back in April, eBay said it expects net revenues in the range of $13.8 billion to $14.1 billion with non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.30-$2.35.eBay is seen posting non-GAAP EPS toward the high end of the guidance provided for Q2 2012, thanks to ongoing strength in the PayPal business and its expanding leadership position in global payments.Recent NewsTechnical ReviewSince touching a 52-week high of $43.94 on June 19, eBay shares have slipped more than 11%. Ahead of the earnings release, the shares tested and held support at $38 - a level going back to mid-March. That will be a key near-term support level in the event of a disappointing earnings release, with downside risk to the 200-day SMA near $35. However, if the recently positive sentiment from the sell-side proves positive, the shares could rebound toward resistance in the $41.00/$42.00 area. Note that the momentum oscillators (RSI and MACD) are also pointing toward an oversold scenario. Click to enlarge image.Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com.SummaryeBay shares are slipping ahead of its Q2 earnings release due to the weaker macroeconomic backdrop, currency headwinds, and potential taxes on online sales. However, the company is benefiting from improved trends in the payments division and the 11% pullback over the past month implies the shares may be pricing in the weakness in Marketplace and retail segments. Keep an eye on the outlook for the Q3 and balance of FY 2012, even though eBay tends to lean on the conservative side when it delivers its guidance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: By using this report, you acknowledge that  Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of  commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

714411,24432,2012-07-11T09:06:53-04:00,,"I have to admit that for the past few years, I wasn't wild about eBay (EBAY) as an investment idea. I thought that the online auction market had peaked - and that the aftermath of the financial crisis would put a crimp in the consumer's willingness to spend money overall.But year to date, eBay has been outperforming the overall stock market, so obviously I was wrong.As it turns out, eBay's 2002 acquisition of PayPal was one smart move. Why? Consumers may not be spending as much now as before the financial crisis, but when they do spend, PayPal has become one of the payment methods of choice.A chart from Statista shows that more and more of eBay's revenue can be attributed to payment revenues from PayPal. Of eBay's approximately $11.7 billion in revenues in 2011, PayPal was responsible for about 38% of that total.(Chart courtesy of Statista)Statista made some estimates based on these trends to show that by sometime in 2014 revenues from payments will exceed the revenues from eBay marketplace sales.(Chart courtesy of Statista)It seems to me that PayPal is giving more traditional payment processing services such as Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) some competition in the merchant services space. PayPal has become more and more of an acceptable payment alternative, especially when paying online.So when you review eBay's earnings report next week, pay attention to how much of the company's revenues come from payments and merchant services. That will provide some clues on the diversification of the revenue stream and perhaps what might be in store for Visa and MasterCard.No I'm not long eBay - and I did have a bad payment experience with PayPal about a decade ago - but that's ancient history now, so I'm certainly not going to let that stand in the that way of buying into eBay if it I see an attractive entry point.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
671981,30651,2012-06-20T10:13:46-04:00,,"People often compare eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to decide whether eBay is a good stock to buy. Some investors think it's a no-brainer to long eBay since its P/E ratio is only a fraction of Amazon's. They believe that in the long run, the market will correct itself by valuing the two e-commerce firms similarly. This way of thinking about relative value is dangerous for the following reasons.A sound relative value analysis must compare apples to apples. Only part of eBay's and Amazon's businesses are of the same nature: hosting buyers and sellers on the site and taking cut from final sales. On eBay.com, buyers and sellers trade in an auction or fixed-price fashion. eBay charges a listing fee and takes a cut from the final sales. eBay reports this part of the revenue under Marketplace segment. Marketplace only accounted for 57% of eBay's total revenue in 2011. On the contrary, the core business of Amazon is to directly sell media and other goods to customers on Amazon.com. In addition to that, it also hosts third-party sellers on the site and charges commission from sales. This is the only part of business that resembles eBay.com. Amazon does not report the third-party sales figures and commission revenues. Instead, it reported that third party sellers sold about 39% of total paid units in 2011. Assuming that third-party sales has the same average price per unit as Amazon's direct sales, I estimate that the third-party business is only about 40% of Amazon's business.Comment: data is aggregated from the revenue sheet posted on eBay's investor site.Therefore, roughly speaking, only 57% of eBay and about 40% of Amazon are comparable. This disproves the claim that eBay is in the same business as Amazon but it is valued differently by the market.Furthermore, Amazon's valuation is hyped. There are a lot of articles about why the lofty valuation of Amazon is unwarranted. This article by Robert Weistein is particularly insightful.Lastly, based on Morningstar's data, although Amazon has a price-to-earnings ratio more than ten times of eBay's and a price-to-cash-flow twice as much as eBay's, eBay has a higher price-to-sales ratio than Amazon. This does not mean anything except that one cannot draw an unambiguous conclusion from the juxtaposition of eBay's and Amazon's valuation multiples.Given the reasons noted above, I think it is best not to benchmark eBay against Amazon. Instead, one should really focus on the growth potentials each business segment of eBay has. My DCF model suggests that eBay is fairly valued. Currently trading at $43.30 a share, the stock does not offer much margin of safety.

The company reports earnings on July 18th.Given the company's track record of beating earnings estimates each quarter by a few pennies, we can assume that earnings estimates are sound indicators of the company's future results (plus a few pennies). Thus, buying a few shares at this price point, doesn't seem like a bad idea.Trading Covered CallsThe July 21st strike price of $41 presents an opportunity receive as much as a 55% annualized return from selling in-the-money covered calls. This is an excellent opportunity for a short-term gain and would be best utilized in a tax-free account, as part of a diversified strategy.In-The-Money CallsIn-the-money calls are call options with underlying strike prices below the current market price. The buyer of an in-the-money call is locking in their purchase price at that call strike price. If the market price of the stock drops below the strike price before expiration, the call will expire unexercised. Selling in-the-money covered calls is a great option when you don't think the stock price is going to rise, or fall precipitously, and you want to liquidate a position.Currently, the July 21, 2012 $41 strike price call options have a bid of $1.33. If you buy the stock at $41.20 and sell the $41.00 calls against those shares, then you could potentially lock in a theoretical selling price of $42.33 on shares that are currently trading at $41.20. If the price of the stock drops below $41, then you keep your shares and the call option premium of $1.33. The break-even price on the trade is $39.87. If the price of the stock stays above $41, then you lock in a 2.74% profit over about 18 days. This is the 55% annualized return, I wrote about above.Similarly, the August 18, 2012 $41 strike price has an even richer options premium of $1.96. Selling covered calls on your shares with this strike price could potentially bring you a 4.27% profit in a little more than a month and a half. Again, if shares trade below $41, you get to keep your shares and the options premium. Your break-even price on the trade is $39.24, about 4.76% below the current price.A Greater Short-term ProfitIf you are targeting a sales price of $43 for your eBay shares, consider the $43 strike price August 18, 2012 calls. Sell the $43 call for a bid price of $1.03. If shares trade below $43, you'll keep the $1.03 in call option premium, netting a 2.5% return on the money invested, over about 48 days. If shares trade over $43, you'll sell your shares and collect a 6.87% profit. The break-even price on the trade is $40.17.Covered calls are an excellent trading strategy whether you want to sell, or hold. They also give you a price point to exit your investment position.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Soon, viewers with PayPal accounts will be able to click on TV commercials and ads and buy advertised goods and services directly from their TV sets.Check out our complete analysis of eBayPayPal is already huge online and is seeing transaction volumes grow rapidly on mobile devices. Television could be the next big market it could tap into, and could drive significant transaction volumes, if it takes off.This is not PayPal's first attempt into T-commerce (e-commerce powered by TV). It had earlier launched an app which enabled tablet users to buy products shown in TV ads by entering their provider and channel details. However, this new workflow is much easier and could see greater adoption. TV ads are a huge market, and a majority of consumers still make purchase decisions based on advertisements they see on television, and so giving them a way to buy the advertised products effortlessly could be a huge opportunity.PayPal could generate a significant amount of revenue by charging a small cut on each transaction.PayPal accounts for nearly 30% of eBay's overall value.

In eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) case, we think the firm is significantly undervalued. We think the firm is worth $55 per share.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (please click here for a video on how to read our reports) which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. eBay posts a VBI score of 10 on our scale, reflecting our ""undervalued"" DCF assessment of the firm, its attractive relative valuation versus peers, and bullish technicals. We are huge fans of firms that register a 10 on our scale. eBay leads it peer group that includes Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), Liberty Interactive (LINTA) and Priceline.com (PCLN).Our Report on eBayIn the spirit of transparency, our report on eBay and hundreds of other companies can be found here. imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsBusiness QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. eBay's three-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 68.6%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.6%. As such,we assign the firm a ValueCreation rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid gray line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. eBay's free cash flow margin has averaged about 22.9% during the past three years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At eBay, cash flow from operations increased about 13% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 70% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that eBay's shares are worth between $41.00 - $69.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $55 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 22.4 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 20.6 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 14.7% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's three-year historical compound annual growth rate of 10.9%. Our model reflects a five-year projected average operating margin of 25.3%, which is above eBay's trailing thtee-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 5.6% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For eBay, we use a 10.6% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $55 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for eBay. We think the firm is attractive below $41 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $69 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate eBay's fair value at this point in time to be about $55 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of eBay's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $75 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $55 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
613101,21909,2012-05-23T16:26:59-04:00,,"I remember when eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) was founded back in 1995. It was a phenomenal success, creating thousands of new small businesses selling all manner of goods and services via auction and operating out of garages across America. The resulting revolution reinvented the mom-and-pop shop, granting small-time entrepreneurs access to a suite of sophisticated Internet tools to build a storefront on one of the busiest virtual streets in the world.But, as people's fascination with the auction process waned over time, the bloom fell from that electronic rose. eBay has had to evolve to be less dependent on small entrepreneurial auctions and friendlier towards larger mass-merchandising efforts at fixed prices.At the end of last year, eBay had more than 100 million active users around the world and the total value of the goods sold on its platform was over $60 billion (all figures in U.S. funds) or $2,100 every second. This global e-commerce platform has provided the company with steady cash flow since its founding and continues to do so today. But the real gem of the business and its main driver of future growth lies deeper within the company.PayPal, the company eBay acquired in the fall of 2002, enables online transactions through secure electronic payments, something few companies were supporting in the early days of e-commerce. eBay acquired the company because a large percentage of eBay's customers were using PayPal to complete their online transactions. It was a natural fit.PayPal has since grown to have over 106 million registered accounts worldwide and has developed into a virtual ""wallet in the sky"" that will be generating 50% of eBay's total revenue next year. It has enabled secure transactions for millions of online retailers and works with most of the major currencies and many of the minor ones around the world. But the real excitement for PayPal is just beginning. The world is rapidly adopting mobile transactions and payments via smart phones. PayPal, with its large user base on both the buy and sell side, is well-positioned to benefit from this rapidly growing trend.For example, PayPal is rolling out a program in 2,000 Home Depot (NYSE:HD) stores to allow shoppers to pay at the register using their PayPal account with just their mobile phone number. Within the next few years, a very significant number of transactions will be handled in just this way.But enabling transactions is only part of the story. eBay's massive consumer data base will help merchants better engage customers based on their established shopping habits. Merchants would be alerted when a customer is in their store, initiating a range of instant personalized marketing opportunities like money saving coupons and related incentives. This will also work online with targeted ads delivered to a customer's desktop and mobile devices.eBay's most recent quarter was very strong. Earnings per share reached $0.55 which was ahead of estimates and 18% more than last year. The e-retailing and auction business grew by 12% to $18 billion and fixed-price sales grew by 18%. PayPal had an excellent quarter with registered users growing by 12% and revenue growing by 32%. Moreover, 50% of the revenues from both businesses came from outside North American, so the company offers excellent geographic diversification. The stock did move up after the results came out but still looks cheap at 17.5 times anticipated earnings. That makes eBay a bargain compared to the prices being paid for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Visa (NYSE:V), Yahoo (YHOO), and others in the category.eBay has additional elements to its business that help strengthen its relationships with the retailers. GSI Commerce, acquired by the company in 2011, develops advanced technology and marketing solutions that enable retail participants large and small to improve the customer experience and reduce costs. The company also has a number of joint ventures and partnerships in China, Latin America, Japan, and Taiwan, to name a few. The company also owns StubHub, an online ticket business, and a piece of craigslist.org as well as Shopping.com.Of course, eBay won't be alone in pursuing mobile payment options. Visa (V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and other startups like Square are all working on platforms. But PayPal has a good head start and will be amongst those companies that dominate the rapidly growing trend in the post-cash and now post-credit world we are moving toward.The shares do not pay a dividend. Closing price on Friday was $38.36. Action now: Buy eBay with a target of $48.Disclosure: I am long EBAY."
511911,28581,2012-04-19T16:52:54-04:00,,"I am sure the owners of eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock are celebrating today (Wednesday). Revenues for the internet marketplace grew 29% to $3.3 billion. Earnings also grew on a non-GAAP basis 18% to $0.55. This beat expectations, and sent the stock up as much as 14% in response to the report. Many investors in eBay are now stuck wondering what they should do from here.In many ways the answer depends on why you decided to buy shares in the first place. It is like someone who is driving on the interstate trying to decide which exit to take. They have a couple of choices they could make. They could be spontaneous and get off at any random exit and see where it takes them (that wouldn't be very wise), or they could think back to why they got on the interstate in the first place. In the same way, investors need to have a clear mind and think back to what made them decide to pull the trigger and jump on ""interstate eBay"".If you got in because of a belief that this quarterly report was going to be strong, it is time to get off at this exit!Before the quarter's report, I was encouraging people to take a look at eBay's expectations and its earnings/revenue track record. I wrote that eBay was the best play going into this week's earnings. I saw a consistent growth over the last couple quarters in the revenue column as it made its way over the $3 billion revenue milestone, and felt that the consensus estimate of $0.52 was too low for this quarter. If you read that article and saw the same thing, then it is time to celebrate your 14% win and cash in that lottery ticket for the profits.Jim Cramer from MSNBC's Mad Money and thestreet.com has a rule: ""Never turn a trade into an investment."" In other words, if your plan was to use a specific catalyst that you felt would drive the price higher, once that catalyst passes then your reason for owning the stock has passed and it is time to sell.I feel that this is great advice, and I have a feeling that this gain is going to pull back soon. If you feel like eBay may be a long-term investment, my suggestion is to cash out now and do some research from the sidelines. From this position, you will be able to take your time without being emotionally invested in the stock. If you do some research and find that eBay and PayPal have some long-term prospects for growth, then you can begin to search for an entry point where the new catalyst is long-term growth instead of the short-term.If you got in because you felt that eBay and PayPal had solid potential for the future, then you should stay on for the ride.Jim Cramer also says, ""Never turn an investment into a trade."" In other words, if you bought for the long-term prospects of PayPal's growth, the strength of the auction site, growth of revenue, and the future of the physical POS systems, then the report of the quarter is actually a confirmation of your premise and your reason for holding the stock is still intact.As mentioned earlier, I believe the stock will have a minor pullback in the near future, so it might not be a bad idea to secure some of your gains and reinvest when the stock pulls back to a lower level. There is a lot of momentum pulling the stock up and once the dust settles, you should be able to increase your position at that point.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Let's take a look at the financial performance over the past five years:Revenue has grown substantially since 2007, increasing by over 50% in that time. Free cash flow has risen much more modestly.Owner EarningsOwner Earnings is a better measure for valuation purposes than free cash flow. Warren Buffett defines Owner Earnings as follows:I'll calculate Owner earnings by taking the Net Income and adding back various non-cash items, such as depreciation, and then subtracting the 5-year average Capital Expenditures. I'll also add interest payments adjusted for taxes since interest is tax deductible.Owner earnings smooth out capital expenditures and provide a clearer picture of the profitability of the company. Let's use the Owner Earnings figures to determine eBay's Cash Return on Invested Capital, or CROIC. This is the cash return generated by the company on invested capital, and is simply the Owner Earnings divided by the total invested capital. This is a better measure than ROIC because ROIC relies on earnings, which is a poor measure of profitability.eBay's CROIC has be decreasing over the past five years but is still a strong 10.77%. This is a testament to eBay's ability to consistently generate ample cash. Here is the most recent balance sheet:eBay has a strong balance sheet, with significantly more cash and investments than debt. On a per share basis eBay has $5.04 in net cash, representing about 12.3% of the total market capitalization.ValuationI use a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of a company. I will use a discount rate of both 12% and 15% and use these values to define a fair value range. I will assume that the owner earnings will grow by 9% next year, thereafter decaying over 20 years to a perpetual growth rate of 3%, as per the growth table below.For reference, the average analyst estimate for earnings growth over the next 5 years is 13.09%. Using the above parameters I arrive at a fair value range of $32.37 - $43.05.ConclusionCurrently trading at around $40 per share, eBay falls within my fair value range. With the total e-commerce market continuing to grow at a quick pace, and PayPal's push into in-store payments, eBay looks well positioned going into the future and currently offers a fair price for the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
549941,27011,2012-05-02T04:02:26-04:00,,"eBay, Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is widely known as a popular auction site for many types of goods, collectibles and even cars. However, the company also owns one of the world's most popular payment services, Paypal, Inc. That makes eBay a dominant player in both online auctions and online payments. eBay shares are in an uptrend and the stock has recently been making new 52-week highs. That trend is likely to continue in 2012. Here are 4 reasons why investors should consider eBay shares, (particularly on pullbacks) as the stock could continue making new 52-week highs through 2012:1. eBay has a very strong balance sheet with about $5.87 billion in cash and around $2 billion in debt. This will allow the company to pursue new opportunities and fund existing areas of growth such as the rapidly emerging ""mobile wallet"" market. More consumers are expected to use their mobile phones as wallets and make payments at stores. Paypal is well-positioned to capitalize on this in the future.2. eBay shares are very reasonably valued, especially when you compare it to other online giants like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). eBay sells for about 17 times earnings and Amazon.com sells for a mind-blowing figure of about 194 times earnings. Also, keep in mind that the profit margins in online retailing are very thin. Plus, some investors fear that Amazon.com will lose part of its edge if it is forced to charge sales taxes on more consumers in the future. eBay has a business that has solid profit margins and growth potential and yet it trades for a much more reasonable valuation.3. Paypal could be a potential spin-off candidate for eBay at some point in the future. While the auction business might not receive a rich valuation in terms of price to earnings multiple, Paypal could receive a very generous valuation based on current earnings and growth prospects for the mobile wallet and online payments. An initial public offering of Paypal would probably be very well-received by the markets and it could unlock additional value for shareholders.4. eBay recently reported strong earnings that beat expectations. Revenues surged 29% to $3.28 billion, from just $2.55 billion last year. This resulted in earnings per share of 55 cents, which compares favorably with just 47 cents per share last year. Strong earnings growth can often lead to multiple expansion with the price to earnings ratio, and this could help take the stock higher.

621661,21820,2012-05-29T02:58:47-04:00,,"On Thursday, Paypal announced two new deals that should keep the eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) subsidiary ahead of the game in mobile payments. The ever increasing number of companies in the mobile payments field makes both announcements a big deal for shareholders of eBay's stock. Paypal continues to drive the company forward as its auction business takes the backseat.The first deal announced by Paypal was a partnership with VeriFone (NYSE:PAY). VeriFone will help bring Paypal to over a million new checkout lanes. VeriFone is already used by 80% of the biggest 200 retailers in the United States. The deal gives customers more control over payment options in the checkout lane. Customers can directly log in to their Paypal account to pay for items or use a Paypal card to purchase the same items. VeriFone remains a leader in the mPOS (mobile point of sale) technology market.VeriFone entered into a similar deal with Google Wallet last year. The new deal with Paypal competes directly with the payment service launched by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Back in April, VeriFone announced they had installed or updated 40,000 POS systems to accept the payment service by Google. Now customers will have another option when paying at stores that have VeriFone terminals. Paypal's biggest rival in the mobile payments game may be rising private company Square.Square was founded by Jack Dorsey, who also founded Twitter. The company is raising money and could be valued at $4 billion in its next funding round, according to All Things Digital. The company processes $4 billion in annual transactions. Each transaction nets Square a processing fee. Square is pretty open about their fees with swipes getting the company 2.75% of the transactions, and keyed in debit transactions earn the company a $0.15 fee plus 3.5% of the sale.The second deal that Paypal announced was a huge expansion into fifteen retail stores. The fifteen stores will all allow customers to use Paypal to pay for goods and services at checkout. The new stores added are:Several of the retailers will roll out programs within the next couple of weeks. Paypal remains on track to be in twenty retailers by the end of 2012. The fifteen retailers add to Paypal's recent signing with Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Back in February, all 2,000 plus Home Depot stores started allowing customers to use their Paypal account to pay for purchases at the home improvement warehouse.A recent article by All Things Digital asked, ""Is Google or Paypal Leading the Charge in Mobile Payments?"" In the article, it lists Google Wallet being available at 140,000 locations, represented by 25 retailers. The article estimates that with its new deal Paypal will be available in 16,000 locations through 16 retailers. Google recently acquired TxVia to further its presence in the mobile payments field.Paypal went public in 2001 at a valuation close to $800 million. The year before Paypal went public, they had $103.7 million in revenue. eBay did not wait long to snatch up the mobile payment leader by buying out the company in 2002. Paypal entered the mobile race in 2006 as one of the first entrants in the now vast field. Paypal had $118 billion in total payments throughout 2011. This year, the company is forecasting $7 billion in mobile payments alone.The mobile payments field is heating up and will see lots of acquisition activity over the next couple of years. One of the key battling points amongst competitors is processing fees. Processing fees are the amount charged by the payment company.Key features from each company are also ways of attracting new customers to using each mobile payment process. Square has an application that makes a mobile phone act as a cash register. Rival Intuit's (NASDAQ:INTU) Go Payment offers use of the company's Quickbooks software, perhaps luring small business owners. Paypal has the largest customer base of the mobile payment companies.eBay shares are closing in on a fifty two week high. Shares were trading for $40.35 at the time of writing. The shares have traded as high as $41.96 in the last fifty two weeks. This was the highest share price for eBay shares since the beginning of 2006.Analysts (Yahoo Finance) predict eBay to earn $0.55 in the current June quarter. For fiscal 2012, analysts are predicting $2.36 in earnings per share. The following year, analysts see the company earning $2.73 per share.eBay has beat or matched earnings estimates each of the last four quarters. The company reports second quarter earnings on July 18th. Look for revised earnings estimates from the company as the Paypal brand will contribute even more to the earnings. eBay's auction and fixed price format sales beginning to increase. Paypal is the gem in eBay's portfolio and will continue to make shares of the company a good long term bet.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The company's first-quarter earnings are as follows:(Ebay's Quarterly Report)These earnings show healthy growth and this is met with the stock closing at a four-year high. The story behind this growth in earnings along with its stock price performance is due to the company growing its marketplace business along with its ability to scale its PayPal business into brick and mortar retail outlets. EBAY has strong financials and is fairly price - leaving the company with plenty of room to grow both in earnings and in stock price over the coming quarters and years.Expansion of Marketplace and PayPal:EBAY's ability to expand its PayPal business represents an incredible opportunity for PayPal to become a staple payment method for consumers on an everyday basis. The company reported:What is of particular note is Home Depot's (NYSE:HD) adoption of this payment method. If more brick and mortar companies, like HD, adopt the service, this could open the floodgates for EBAY growth in this market segment. It is clear that EBAY has not capitalized fully in this segment and if the company is able to play its cards correctly, this business could double in size. Bloomberg reports that ""PayPal continues to be a star,"" Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York, said in an interview. ""The traction in the marketplace has been slow and steady."" Steady results within the company's marketplace along with PayPal's potential make EBAY a company that is poised for continued growth into the coming year.Financials/Valuation:(Nasdaq)(Yahoo! Finance)Conclusion: EBAY's first quarter 2012 results point to its strategic plan to expand its MarketPlace and PayPal businesses are taking hold and this is the beginning of what could be an incredible time for PayPal.

At a price of $41.31, shares of EBAY haven't been this high since February 2006.So with the stock already up 15%, should you 'Buy it Now' or keep it on your watch list? The table below shows the 24 days since it came public in 1998 that EBAY rose more than 15% in a single day. For each day we calculated the stock's average and median returns over the next week and month. As shown, the average returns over the next week and month are both convincingly positive. However, when we look at median returns, shares of EBAY have actually seen a decline (-0.15%) over the next week and a much more modest gain (relative to the average) of 3.58% over the next month. Furthermore, over the next week and month, shares of EBAY have seen positive returns just half of the time.

Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.55, beating analyst consensus who expected the company to report earnings of $0.52. Revenues increased 29% to $3.28 billion exceeding Wall Street's consensus of $3.15 billion.eBay has expanded its PayPal services at many brick and mortar retailers including Home Depot. Revenues at PayPal increased 32% to $1.31 billion as the number of active accounts increased 12% to 109.8 million. Total payment volume increased 24% to $34 billion.Revenues at the marketplace division increased 11% to $1.73 billion as gross merchandise volume on eBay rose 12% to $16 billion. 78 million people have downloaded the eBay app, and the company expects to have $8 billion in mobile transaction for the entire year of 2012.""""We believe that innovation in retail today is technology driven, and consumers are embracing smarter, easier, better ways to shop,"" according to CEO Donahoe.OutlookFor the second quarter of 2012 the company expects adjusted earnings per share of $0.53-$0.55 on revenues between $3.25-$3.35 billion. For the entire year of 2012 eBay expects net revenues between $13.8 and $14.1 billion, with diluted earnings per share coming in at $1.91-$1.96ValuationeBay ended the first quarter with $5.8 billion in cash and equivalents. The company operates with roughly $2.1 billion in short and long term debt for a net cash position of roughly $3.7 billion. Factoring in a 7% increase in after hours trading, the market values the operating assets of the company around $46 billion. This values the company at 3.9 times annual revenues and merely 14 times 2011's earnings which were boosted by one time items.eBay trades at a significant revenue premium compared to internet competitor Amazon (AMZN) which trades at 1.8 times annual revenues. Margins of Amazon are however much lower and the company trades well over 100 times annual earnings. The premium revenue multiple is largely the result of the premium PayPal business of eBay which grows quickly, has higher margins and requires little capital to operate.Investment ThesisShares in eBay have seen a strong recovery from lows of $12 in the beginning of 2009 to current levels approaching $40 per share in after hours trading. This is still 30% below the all time high set in 2004 when shares peaked around $58 per share.In hindsight the $1.5 billion acquisition of PayPal a decade ago has been a stellar deal. eBay's growth is driven by the PayPal unit as revenue growth in the traditional market place is slowing down. At this pace the company is no longer simply providing complementary services (being able to pay your purchases on eBay with PayPal) but it is actually gradually transforming into a global online payment company which is focused on consumers and small businesses.Valued around 18-19 times expected 2012's earnings, shares trade at a fair valuation.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The Payments segment and mobile platforms were the high points in the quarter.The company reported gross revenue of $3.38 billion, up 14.0% sequentially and better than the Consensus expectation of $3.32 billion, aided by holiday-driven demand. Over 86% of eBay's total revenue was transactions-based, while the remaining 14% came from marketing services.The pro forma gross margin was 70.0%, up 31 bps sequentially and down 221 bps year over year. The sequential increase was due to higher volumes as well as lower transaction expenses and a lower transaction loss rate.First Quarter GuidanceeBay expects revenue of $3.05-3.15 billion (down 8.3% sequentially and up 21.8% year over year), GAAP EPS of 37 cents to 38 cents and non-GAAP EPS of 50 cents to 51 cents. For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 43 cents.For 2012, management expects revenue of $13.7-$14.0 billion, GAAP EPS of $1.76 to $1.81 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.30. For fiscal 2012, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.97.Agreement of AnalystsOut of the 15 analysts providing estimates for the first quarter, none revised the estimate in the last 30 days. Over the same period, only 1 analyst made an upward revision for fiscal 2012.The majority of analysts expect a strong first quarter with earnings per share coming ahead of the Zacks Consensus at 52 cents and the company's guidance range of 50-51 cents. They see continued traction in eBay's Marketplace business and continued online and offline share gains in the PayPal segment.The analysts believe that the extra shopping day in February and mix-shift to fixed price should help overall growth in the quarter. They believe that PayPal is expanding its market opportunity by aggressively enabling mobile payments and launching its Point-of-Sale (POS) offering. The analysts expect margins to continue to expand and are waiting for management comments on the progress/roll-out of point-of-sale business.However, a handful of analysts remain concerned about the relative weakness in merchant Services total payment value growth due to the continued negative impact of foreign currency and lack of recovery in the rate of cross border commerce in eBay's market. They believe that FX headwinds this quarter could again impact eBay's cross-border trade, which accounts for approximately 20% of total gross merchandise volume.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsIn the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained intact for the first quarter, but increased a penny to $1.97 cents for fiscal 2012.Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate fell 2 cents each for the first quarter as well as fiscal 2012. Therefore, negative sentiments appear to have outweighed the positive post fourth-quarter earnings.RecommendationWe expect eBay to report another good quarter with a potential upside from payments and remain impressed by its business strategy and execution.We believe eBay's PayPal is well positioned for sustained growth and the marketplaces business is also showing signs of improvement. On the PayPal side, the recent launch of PayPal Here and the upcoming introduction of the new wallet are quite encouraging. Additionally, PayPal had announced its initial POS test with Home Depot in the fourth quarter. This would considerably increase PayPal's addressable market going forward.PayPal has also reinforced its mobile payments segment through the PayPal Mobile Express Checkout system and the Zong acquisition, which are expected to boost mobile payment volumes.However, we are concerned about increasing competition from major online retailers, such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), as well as many other smaller players. Additionally, Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been eyeing the online retail space, threatening eBay's dominance.While eBay's payments business shows great promise, here too competition may be expected to pick up as banks and other companies announce their own payment systems and Google's digital wallet gathers steam.Currently, eBay has a Zacks #2 Rank, implying a short-term Buy recommendation."
504511,24706,2012-04-17T15:45:16-04:00,,"By Brendan GilmartinOvervieweBay (EBAY) is scheduled to report 1Q 2012 earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, April 18. The numbers are typically released at 4:15 p.m. EST and will be followed with a conference call at 5:00 p.m. eBay is expected to deliver solid results for the recent 1Q on strength in the PayPal and Marketplaces segments, while the 2Q outlook is fairly uncertain.Outliers And StrategyIn its previous earnings release, eBay gave the following guidance for 1Q 2012:With 1Q 2012 results potentially priced in, much of the focus will center on the outlook for 2Q 2012.Any adjustments to the outlook for FY2012 could also have consequences for eBay shares. Back in January, eBay said it expects net revenues in the range of $13.7 billion to $14.0 billion with non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.25 - $2.30.eBay is seen topping its previously announced guidance for 1Q 2012 thanks to ongoing strength in the PayPal business and its expanding leadership position in global payments. The Marketplaces business is also poised to deliver solid 1Q performance.Recent NewsTechnical RevieweBay shares are up more than 17% YTD and recently touched a 52-week high of $38.18, implying that solid results for the recently concluded 1Q 2012 period may be priced in at these levels. If the company can deliver on expectations to top the 1Q2012 consensus and slightly increase its outlook for 2Q (estimates call for eBay to report in-line guidance), the shares could re-test the recent highs near $38. Conversely, the support is at the 50-daySMA near $35.85, with downside risk to $35.00, followed by $33.25. (Chart Courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryeBay shares posted solid gains over the course of the 1Q 2012 period amid evidence of improvement at the Marketplaces segment (eBay.com and other e-commerce sites) and the continued leadership of PayPal in both online and mobile payments. The Street Estimates for NON-GAAP EPS of $0.52 on revenue of $3.15 billion are at or above the high end of the outlook the company provided back in January. Should eBay therefore fail to meet these lofty expectations, the shares are vulnerable to several points of downside risk. Investors will also focus on the outlook. The guidance for 2Q 2012 is widely expected to bracket consensus estimates. Should earnings and guidance surprise to the upside, eBay is well-supported above the 50-Day SMA and could make another run back toward the recent 52-week high of $38.18.Disclaimer: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis and or data in this report.

Both revenue and net income expanded at a nice double-digit pace, as PayPal continues to drive strong performance. In after-hours trading, the shares are up 6% (to over $38 per share) on the report. We are strongly considering adding to our existing position in the portfolio of our newsletter, as we think the shares are conservatively worth $46 each (with upside to the high $50s based on the upper end of our fair value range).(Equity Research Report on eBay)In the first quarter, the global commerce platform and payments leader's revenue advanced an impressive 29% from the same period a year ago. Net income on a non-GAAP basis came in at $725 million, or $0.55 per share, a nice showing (consensus was at $0.52 per share). As our followers know, we believe eBay is essentially trading on the value of its PayPal assets alone, and such performance by the division during the period further reinforces this view. PayPal ended the quarter with 109.8 million active registered users (a 12% increase), while its revenue jumped 32% on a year-over-year basis. PayPal's net total payment volume grew 24% to $34 billion. In addition to continued web traction, we're expecting solid adoption of PayPal's mobile and point-of-sale initiatives. Specifically, the firm expects to process $7 billion in mobile payment volume during 2012 and has just started its endeavor to expand to offline merchants, with Home Depot (HD) launching PayPal payments in all of its 2,000 U.S. stores.Though we like eBay based on its PayPal business, the company's Marketplace business is not performing poorly at all. In the quarter, gross merchandise volume, excluding vehicles, jumped 12% on a year-over-year basis, to over $16 billion. We credit such strength to the firm's ongoing improvement in making the site easier and faster to use for consumers. Further, the company's recently-acquired GSI business generated $715 million in sales during the period, with same-store-sales up 26%.Looking ahead, on a full year 2012 basis, eBay expects revenues to be as high as $14.1 billion (consensus was at $13.85 billion) and non-GAAP earnings per share to come in at $2.35 per share at the upper end of the range (consensus was at $2.30 per share). We think the range will be exceeded on both the top and bottom line for 2012.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: EBAY is included in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter."

496391,22762,2012-04-13T11:54:52-04:00,,"Last year, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) acquired Magento, developer of an open-source e-commerce platform  for around $180 million. Magento became part of X.commerce, a combined  open platform business from eBay and PayPal. A year after the  acquisition was announced, Magento co-founder and CTO Yoav Kutner has  left eBay. While fellow Magento co-founder Roy Rubin sent Kutner off  with a warm farewell, Kutner doesn’t have such nice things to say about eBay and X.commerce, according to this post on Quora.In response to the question of why he left eBay, Kutner responded (Kutner confirmed to us that he posted this response): I  will answer and give much more information over the next few weeks as  to the reasons I had to leave Magento. As for now I can say that (very)  short term I would not be worried about the ‘open’ part of Magento, but  as I have learned eBay and the folks at X.commerce don’t really  understand the meaning of open and have a hard time explaining and  defining it to them selves and to others. As such, long term, it would  be very interesting to see if Magento will continue to stay open in the  manor the people behind Magento and I meant it to be.The Magento e-commerce platform,  basically enables merchants and brands to have control over the look,  content, SEO, digital marketing and functionality of their online  storefronts. Originally, Magento was a product developed and marketed by  Varien, a decade-old e-commerce software and consultancy company. When eBay invested  in the e-commerce platform in March 2010 was Magento effectively  incorporated as a stand-alone venture. As we reported last year, there  was some discontent from Magento employees around stock and equity.Last Fall, eBay debuted X.commerce,  which featured a “fabric” that stitched the eBay, PayPal, GSI Commerce  and Magento platforms together with other partners to create new  experiences for retailers and their customers. At the time, eBay had  more than 200,000 developers building off the two platforms, plus the  450,000 Magento developers that were added via the acquisition.Magento also launched an app store for its extensions. Developers  could create applications on top of Magento, and retailers could use  this functionality in their online storefronts via the app store.We spoke to Kutner on the phone, and he reiterated that eBay is  struggling with what open source means. “They are not an open source  company, so defining this has been a bit of a struggle.” And while he  doesn’t think eBay would discontinue Magento as an open source platform,  he says eBay still has not figured out the “fabric” component of  X.commerce, over a year after the acquisitionAs for why he left, Kutner says the execs that coordinated the deal  at eBay and PayPal were no longer with the company, and the vision of  why to buy Magento and what to do with it was lost when they left. “I’m  hopeful they will figure it out,” he added.eBay released this statement when we inquired about Kutner’s views: X.commerce  & Magento are fundamentally believers in open source and an open  ecosystem, including our Magento Community and Enterprise editions.  Beyond our ongoing efforts, we are committed to releasing a major  upgrade in Magento 2 in late 2012/early 2013. Additionally, our  X.commerce Fabric is generally available and is also released in an open  format. “Open” for X.commerce means that source code is available to  anyone to modify and customize in their environment. “Open” can also  mean that beyond being able to take a copy, developers in the ecosystem  can modify the primary source code and help accelerate the overall  progress of Magento.While it’s important to remember that this is just one perspective,  Kutner’s account doesn’t paint a rosy picture for the state of Magento  in eBay’s family or for X.commerce. Last week, it was revealed that  X.commerce CTO Neal Sample was leaving eBay to join American Express. PayPal also recently lost product VP Sam Shrauger as well as Alyssa Cutright (who joined Square)."
516281,21439,2012-04-22T07:05:35-04:00,,"On April 18 , 2012, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) released their Q1 2012 results.The results were very impressive - all three business units (PayPal, GSI and eBay Marketplace) outperformed Wall Street's expectations and eBay's guidance given earlier in the year.  Since we're focused on the marketplace part of the business we'll cover that in detail.  Also, there's a ton of excitement about PayPal in stores which is great, but I think it overshadows some of the great things going on in the marketplace side of the business which is more impactful short-term to retailers of all sizes.This quarter there were some really interesting new data-points and hints about the future that haven't been covered by Wall St. or the mainstream press  that I think many sellers will find interesting, so we'll focus on those.  Also, as you read on you will find that we believe they foreshadow a great 2012 for eBay (and eBay sellers).eBay vs. Wall St.First, to put the quarter in context from a  Wall St. perspective, this table shows some of the key metrics, eBay's guidance, Wall Street's expectations and how the company performed against those two expectations: (click to enlarge)As you can tell, for all of the marketplace metrics we watch, eBay exceeded expectations. Not only did they exceed expectations, but I'd say they pretty much blew them away!So, congratulations to both our friends at eBay on a huge quarter and also all of the sellers that participated - it looks like we're teeing up for a strong 2012 for eBay.Regular readers will note that we've been reporting a substantial uptick in y/y growth for eBay in our regular Same Store Sales (SSS) data.  You can read the March data here.  It's good to see that the upward momentum is not just isolated to our customers, but starting to work its way throughout the marketplace.eBay Marketplace metrics of interestIn the table above, I wanted to call out a couple of the metrics and add some others that were mentioned on the conference call that I thought were very interesting:What's interesting is that the ares eBay is focusing on are growing very nicely.  We'll spend a fair amount of time in this post digging into the implications of that.What is Active Buyer Growth?Before we dig into what some of the growth rates mean, I did get a bunch of questions off a comment that JD made.  The comment was:The 'he' in that sentence is Devin Wesig, eBay's marketplace president.  Some people assumed that JD misspoke and meant the 7% active user growth.  but what I think he was talking about (speculating since there wasn't any color) is what I would call GMV/buyer y/y growth.  Some companies call the GMV/buyer GMB (Gross merchandise per buyer) - I usually avoid that because it sounds so close to GMV you spend 80% of your time clarifying (Did you mean B or V? Bravo or Victor?).Anyway, what I think JD was saying is that buyers are buying more on eBay at a y/y improvement of 10%. It's great they are measuring this and to put it in perspective Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is growing the same metric at about 30-40% y/y with programs like Prime, so there is a ton of room to run here.eBay vs. e-commerce growth ratesNow, here's a chart we usually have that shows eBay's growth rate vs. e-commerce.eBay is the blue line and e-commerce is the red line.  When you look at that, you may say: ""Ok, great, eBay is growing 13% and beat Wall Street's weak 9% prediction, but they are still 5% slower than e-commerce - so what's the big deal!?""  If you said that, you'd absolutely be right, but what's interesting and I think a bit exciting for one of the first times in a while, is that pieces of eBay are:You can see this on the chart with:As someone that is intimately involved in a business that deals with this type of portfolio of businesses growing at different rates, I think it's important to really dig into what this means going forward.  Before we do that though, we always get positive comments about our detailed category analysis on the Q. So let's tackle that first.Detailed eBay Marketplace Category dataFirst, I always get some negative comments on this data speculating that we are making this data up.  Let me be clear - eBay releases this data with their Quarterly data and Wall St. doesn't cover it for whatever reason.  It does come 100% from eBay and is part of their quarterly metrics package available at investor.ebay.com - this is not ChannelAdvisor data, but it is our analysis of eBay's non-GAAP metrics data released by the company.That being said, here is the eBay category results for the first quarter, sorted by fastest growing category to lowest.On the call, eBay talked a lot about Tickets, CSA (fashion) and P+A which certainly are great categories.  But what I think is interesting is that eBay never highlights the Home and Garden category and that puppy is off to the races with a 22% growth rate.  But wait, it gets better...In this chart, we sort the categories by size-> So when you put this chart together with the growth rate you see that not only is H+G the fastest growing category (22%), but it's the largest category!  In fact, if you round up just $6m, this category has hit a $10b annual run rate - a first for any eBay category.That's pretty amazing.  To put it into perspective, according to Internet Retailer:eBay's H+G business at $10b is bigger than Sears+JCP+QVC+HD+Lowes and that leaves a solid ~$2b on top of those!What does this mean for the rest of 2012 for eBay? It's all in the mix!One thing that I haven't seen the analysts on Wall St. think about is a mix analysis and what that means going forward.  For example, when eBay tells us data points such as Fixed Price is 64% and growing at 18%, you can start to make some pretty good forecasts based on the different components of the business and their various growth rates.  For example, here's a simple model that takes the 18% FP growth rate and the 3% auction growth rate from Q1 and projects them forward into Q2-4:As you can see the overall GMV growth rate accelerates over time because the way the math works.  If FP is growing at 18% and Auctions at 3%, then not only does FP have to increase as a percent of mix (goes to 67% in Q4 in this model), but as that slower growing piece gets smaller, the overall growth rate picks up pretty dramatically.This model holds those rate steady.  Actually the fixed-price rate has been ticking up a couple of points a Q.  If we take a more aggressive approach and grow FP 20%/22%/24%, then you can really see how the overall (in green) growth rate accelerates:Another interesting datapoint JD revealed was that in Q1 2012, 50% of the GMV was from TRS and it is growing at 22%.  Here's a mix model that works backwards to last year and then projects that growth rate forward:Here you can see that if we hold the TRS growth rate steady, it will result in 53% of TRS by Q4.  Also, we can infer that non-TRS only grew at 3%.The above model holds the 22% steady and since we have only the one datapoint, it's hard to know what to project there, but given our SSS data which we believe is best represented by this mix model (TRS sellers tend to be FP as well and larger in scale which more closely matches the ChannelAdvisor customer set).   So if we take what we know there and give the growth rates a bit of a nudge as  we have seen:So you can see both from the FP and the TRS models, that even if eBay doesn't change the growth rates, the simple math will result in great growth overall.  However, if they can get the growth rates of FP/TRS to continue to grow, you could see the entire marketplace north of 15-17% by the end of the year.Is Cassini close to being released?Background: We first covered eBay's top secret search project, Cassini, here.As you can tell, this Q was a treasure trove of new information and another tidbit that is near and dear to our hearts was leaked by JD in these two snippets (note if you want to read the entire transcript - which I highly recommend - you can find it at SeekingAlpha here.)Reading the tea leaves, these new innovations must be close to coming out for JD to be starting to create buzz on them, so we're on the edge of our seats to see what eBay has in store here.  If eBay can really nail the cart and checkout experience while significantly improving the search experience, you can imagine the growth rates on TRS/FP could move up faster than we've modeled.Up next...Amazon!Now that we have had eBay surprise to the upside, all eyes will be on Amazon when they report on April 26th.Disclosure: I am long Amazon and Google. eBay is an investor where I am CEO."
503551,21445,2012-04-17T12:06:17-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is expected to report Q1 earnings after the market close on Wednesday, April 18 with a conference call scheduled for 5:00 pm ET. Analysts are looking for EPS of 52c on revenue of $3.15B. The consensus range is 50c-56c for EPS, and $3.1B-$3.24B for revenue, according to First Call. After reporting better-than-expected EPS and revenue in Q4, the company gave a Q1 forecast of 50c-51c in EPS and $3.05B-$3.15B in revenue. It also expects FY12 EPS $2.25-$2.30 and FY12 revenue $13.7B-$14B. In the Q4 conference call, the company said its EPS will grow slower in Q1 than in FY12 overall, but it has ""increased confidence"" in its FY12 outlook. The company expects mobile payment volume to increase markedly over the next year and it sees its PayPal mobile volume to reach $7B. The company is looking to expand its in-store payment presence as Home Depot (NYSE:HD) brought PayPal to nearly 2,000 stores in the U.S. Internationally, the company sees a strong investment in India and continues to work on a partnership with the Russian Post. It also remains cautiously optimistic that it will become the first foreign operator with a license to process electronic payments in China. Over the last quarter, Credit Suisse and Citigroup downgraded eBay to Neutral, and Raymond James downgraded the company to Outperform, citing valuation. Deutsche Bank also said its core business growth was slowing despite its strong results."

I note that over 50,000 merchants have signed up during the first week.Digital WalletPayPal will roll out its new digital wallet platform next month. The new platform allows users to:In my view, digital wallet is more convenient and secure than traditional wallet in that money is stored in the cloud and can be accessed via multiple devices. The platform will likely result in incremental revenue growth in the foreseeable future as consumers begins to appreciate its benefits and convenience.Bill-Me-LatereBay acquired BML in 2008 and the unit will likely play an increasing role since it will fund much of the receivable balance from the digital wallet.

481271,25036,2012-04-05T13:24:30-04:00,,"In four previous articles, posted on January 17, 2012, January 26, 2012, February 23, 2012 and on March 16, 2012, a bull-put spread has been considered for eBay (EBAY). The position has been rolled several times, as the majority of the potential profit was realized, and each new position increased the potential return. As of the most recent roll, the position has a 33.7% potential return.For the most recent position, the management point was set at $36 which was breached yesterday, so the position should be managed.The reason for eBay's 2.5% drop yesterday appear to be the result of Google's (GOOG) purchase of payment processing technology company TxVia and in sympathy to the drop in the overall market. Apparently Google thinks the acquisition of TxVia will help its Google Wallet initiative.Regardless of Google's new acquisition, eBay has a nice position in the payment processing space via PayPal. However, eBay's next earnings call is coming up on April, 18, 2012, so it's typically not a good idea to hold a bullish spread for a company with an upcoming earnings release, especially if the company's stock price has been ballistic as eBay's stock has been of late (at least until the last few days) as shown below:The most recent spread as outlined in the March 16, 2012 article consisting of a 2012 Apr 32/34 put spread can be exited for a net debit of $0.29 using midpoint pricing based upon PowerOptions tools as shown below:(Click to enlarge)Over the course of managing the position a cumulative net credit has been received of $0.64 ($0.19+$0.19+$0.13+$0.13), so as long as we exit for a net debit of less than $0.64 we have made a profit (not including brokerage fees/commissions). Exiting for a net debit of $0.29 leaves $0.35 of net credit or a return of about 19%.After eBay's earnings call on April, 18, 2012, consideration for another spread position will be considered for the eBay.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
488071,25062,2012-04-10T08:46:53-04:00,,"In the minds of many investors, PayPal is the most important component of eBay's (EBAY) valuation. Consider this from January earnings:PayPal is a popular way for people and businesses to pay each other online, and it benefits from first-mover status. But competition is heating up. Just recently, Google (GOOG) acquired TxVia, which has a significant back-end network that the search giant can leverage. There is also Amazon (AMZN), which has earned payer trust via its shopping websites. There's Facebook (FB), which has started to threaten Google in driving some channels of web traffic and is an early popularizer of token currencies. And there's the next generation, like Square, which has A-list economist Larry Summers on its board.In this scramble for dominance in payments, there is no particular winner as of yet. While a couple percentage points of a transaction would be small in most realities, two percent is a more than substantial prize across the scale of the Internet and the Internet's mobilization.For customers, it makes little difference who processes a payment, so long as it is done reliably and easily. Thus, differentiation and branding are key for these competitors.Paypal President Marcus says,He's talking about beauty as a design issue, but the aesthetics of morality could soon prove a more pressing concern for PayPal.George Zimmerman is the criminal justice student and neighborhood watch enthusiast who shot and killed a teenager in Florida. There has been an outpouring of anger which has forced him into hiding as he awaits possible charges. Now, he's raising money via a website using PayPal.This puts eBay/PayPal in a PR dilemma. Should it allow Zimmerman's payments?PayPal froze WikiLeaks donations, citing ""illegal activity"". So there is some precedent for criminally controversial donation drives being shut down. On the other hand, WikiLeaks ""espionage"" was an ongoing activity, whereas the Zimmerman killing is a past event. Plus technically, Zimmerman is innocent until proven guilty.Still my first instinct tells me PayPal will invalidate the fundraiser. Because, although some would be mad at PayPal for not taking the opposite stand, people would be especially mad at PayPal for staying involved.However, it is necessary for PayPal to draw a line of neutrality somewhere. Zimmerman is not the first ""defendant"" to collect support from the general public via PayPal. So it appears this issue may be framed on the one hand as a matter of principle (neutrality) and the other hand a simple question of decency.Either way, there are strong feelings on both sides of this case, and PayPal is unfortunately going to make at least one side unhappy. Without PayPal, eBay is just another MySpace or Yahoo (YHOO). This dilemma could snowball very easily and is therefore a potentially bearish catalyst for Ebay.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
466821,22762,2012-03-29T16:34:53-04:00,,"By Leena RaoeBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) CEO John Donahoe announced this morning that David Marcus, the former CEO and founder of mobile payments startup Zong and PayPal Mobile VP, will be taking over as PayPal’s president. As you may know, former president Scott Thompson departed PayPal in January to be Yahoo’s CEO. Marcus joined PayPal last year when the payments giant acquired Zong for $240 million. Marcus stepping into the top spot at PayPal is not particularly surprising considering his extensive experience in the mobile and payments world, but it’s interesting that eBay chose a Silicon Valley startup entrepreneur (as opposed to an exec with large company experience) to lead its crown jewel.We had a chance to chat with both Donahoe and Marcus about the next era of PayPal under Marcus’ leadership. Donahoe explains to us “David is the right guy for the right time at PayPal. PayPal is on the cusp of an enormous opportunity and David is a product visionary,” he says. “He knows how to create beautiful product experiences, and can match that with PayPal’s scale.”Marcus is best described as a serial entrepreneur. He started his first company, GTN telecom, in 1996 in Geneva, Switzerland, which was acquired by World Access in 2000. That same year, he founded Echovox, a mobile media monetization company that helps large media companies connect with their mobile audiences. Zong, which was spun out of Echovox, offered a mobile payments platform that let you pay for items online via direct billing to your mobile phone. When PayPal acquired Zong last year, Marcus became VP of mobile for the eBay-owned company.While at PayPal for the past seven months, Marcus spearheaded the creation, design and launch of PayPal Here, a Square-like mobile payments hardware and software platform for small businesses. He’s also worked on PayPal’s new Wallet product, set to debut later this year. And PayPal has also been hard at work on an in-store payments technology for big box retailers, which has been adopted nationally by Home Depot.“David is going to focus on how to weave the consumer experience into these technologies,” Donahoe adds.In his new role, Marcus says he will continue to use his past as an entrepreneur and product exec to bring a valuable consumer experience to PayPal’s mobile and web products. ”We are going to spend time and focus on the product and consumer experience,”Marcus tells us. “We need to produce an amazing user experience for consumers in payments.”Part of this will be focusing on innovating in mobile and adding new products to the lineup, he says. Last year, the company processed $4 billion in mobile payments transactions and expects $7 billion in mobile payment volume in 2012. He’s also betting on the soon to be launched digital wallet, which he explains will be able to add all forms of payments and stored value to a cloud-based wallet.“I believe in one thing with payments—shopping is fun, payments are not,” he says. “We need to continue to innovate in mobile and web payments online and offline and remove friction wherever we can.”Challenges are still aplenty for PayPal. Square, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and many well-funded startups like Jumio are vying for pieces of the payments pie both in terms of mobile and the web. But Marcus’s experience as a nimble entrepreneur is going to help the company continue to move fast, he says. He points to the fact this trend is already happening at PayPal with PayPal Here, which was built in 7 months. “The entrepreneurial spirit is strong at PayPal and the organization is nimble despite what people think.”Besides working on product innovation around the consumer experience, Marcus is also making design a major focus. “Design is very important for everything going forward at PayPal and we are making sure to hire fantastic designers,” he says. “Beauty needs to be everywhere, even in a payments product.”It’s worth noting that some were not impressed with PayPal Here’s design (a triangle dongle), while others seem to embrace the hardware’s aesthetic.For PayPal Here specifically, the company is hard at work on expanding the mobile payments service for small businesses internationally. Marcus added that the merchant response to the launch of the product has been “tremendous.” And in its first day of availability, PayPal was seeing 1,000 new registrants per hour for the new service.For PayPal, Marcus could be a breath of fresh ‘entrepreneurial’ air. Matrix Partners’ Dana Stalder, who was the former CTO of PayPal and was on Zong’s board of directors says that the appointment of Marcus is a sign that the company is looking to innovate in the next frontier of payments. “David is cut from the entrepreneurs’ cloth; he’s an incredible product person, has a deep passion for customer experience, and is not afraid of rolling up his sleeves,” Stalder says.In the end, it’s clear that PayPal’s success in mobile payments and the digital wallet will come down to execution, customer experience, design and scale. Clearly, Marcus has his work cut out for him but considering his success as an entrepreneur so far, he may just be the man for the job.Original post"
492011,24114,2012-04-11T14:25:56-04:00,,"by Larry GellarA new report suggests that eBay (EBAY) could be a hot stock to buy right now. ChannelAdvisor tracks revenue for companies that have used the service for a year or longer, and eBay's revenue statistic is up 22.4% year over year for the month of March. That's up from the 19.7% increase experienced in February, and fixed price sales were up 30.2% in March as well. The only negative part of ChannelAdvisor's report was the 20.7% decrease in auctions that eBay experienced, but this doesn't surprise me at all. Users are becoming increasingly frustrated with the uncertainty of bidding on items, but I believe that eBay has a number of other businesses that are strong enough to keep this stock moving higher.Before we take a look at eBay's individual parts, let's compare it to its fiercest competitors. At a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.76, eBay is cheaper than other stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Yahoo (YHOO). Those companies have price-to-earnings ratios of 140.07, 21.20, and 18.50, respectively. eBay also has reasonably strong price/earnings-to-growth and price-to-sales ratios -- 1.20 and 3.93, respectively. As for margins, eBay's gross margin (70.30%) beats out Amazon's (22.44%), Google's (65.21%) and Yahoo's (69.85%). eBay's gross margin of 20.37% is pretty good as well. Overall, I'm satisfied with eBay's statistics.Raymond James recently released a research note on eBay, and I think investors would certainly be well-served to take a look at what the bank had to say. Raymond James lowered its rating from Strong Buy to Outperform, which is about where I would rank my enthusiasm. Based on comments from Raymond James, it appears the rating change was due to a new realization that PayPal's mobile revenue could take more time to develop than previously thought. Regardless, PayPal Here figures to be a lucrative enterprise, and Home Depot (HD) is one major retailer that's jumping on board. Additionally, the promotion of David Marcus to president is another positive piece of news for PayPal after the unit's previous president was hired as the new chief executive at Yahoo.In fact, David Marcus appears to be the perfect candidate to take the lead on PayPal. Marcus sold his business, Zong, to eBay for $240 million, and the business was a crucial launching point for PayPal's current direction as a mobile payments processor. (Zong was a way for customers to attach their payments to their carrier bill, and PayPal still uses much of that startup's technology). Marcus joined eBay as vice president of mobile after selling his business, and I believe this makes him a top-notch candidate for PayPal overall. Clearly, PayPal's future growth will be largely in the mobile industry, and this is where a creative mind like Marcus' should help enormously.Outside of the topics discussed in the Raymond James report, PayPal is also embarking on some exciting initiatives to streamline its business. The company just launched its PayPal Payments service, which will replace many of the smaller divisions that had some reference to the word ""website"" in its name. Here's how Peter Karpas, vice president of customer engagement for North America, explained the change: ""We've talked about the blurring of online, offline and mobile, but we've talked about that in the large enterprise context. Now, we're extending that to heart of the company which is small business."" This move should make it easier for businesses to work with PayPal, and PayPal is also offering a new ""Advanced"" option for its payments. Specifically, this should help businesses that want services of a level between the current Standard and Pro options.Besides PayPal, eBay's other businesses also appear to be in pretty good shape. In fact, eBay Motors is one part of eBay that could see a special boost due to the tax season. According to a survey from Harris Interactive, many consumers are planning to use this year's tax return to purchase a vehicle or least some vehicle parts. eBay Motors has experienced increased search activity, and it certainly make senses that this trend would continue. With that in mind, I expect eBay Motors to play an important role in what should be a strong quarter for eBay, especially because of increased activity on eBay's mobile applications.Another aspect of the eBay story that deserves attention is the company's strategy for India. eBay is projecting that the country's online shopping market will double in 2012, and the company hopes to take advantage of this by finding ways to get customers to purchase higher-margin items. As eBay knows too well, Indian consumers have historically purchased items with lower profit margins such as electronics and books. eBay would prefer that consumers buy items like shoes and clothes, although the Indian market is also characterized by other trends that eBay needs to overcome. The PaisaPay system is one payment method being offered to induce customers to make their purchases online, and Alibaba.com is a fierce competitor in the market for business-to-business exports. I expect eBay to make headway on these challenges, which in turn should cause the stock price to appreciate.As always, I recommend investors check out a company's statement of cash flows, and eBay is no different. Although the company experienced a net outflow of cash of $886.31 million in 2011, much of that can be attributed to aggressive acquisitions and stock repurchases. As the economic recovery slowly but surely continues, this is a strategy I like, and investors should jump on board while the stock is still below $40. eBay's traditional Marketplace business is still holding steady, and PayPal could see significant growth due to the revolution in mobile payments. Additionally, I expect the promotion of David Marcus to be a significant tailwind going forward.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

We think the best opportunities arise from a complete understanding of all investing disciplines in order to identify the most attractive stocks at any given time. We therefore analyze each stock across a wide spectrum of philosophies, from deep value through momentum investing.This involves performing significant valuation analysis, both on a DCF and relative value basis, as well as a assessing the firm's fundamentals (cash flow, risk, etc.), technicals and momentum indicators. The best stocks, we believe, will be attractive from a number of investment perspectives -- from value through momentum (hence our name, Valuentum). On the other hand, the worst stocks will be shunned by most investment disciplines and display expensive valuations and poor technicals and momentum indicators.As part of our process, we employ a discounted cash-flow model to arrive at a fair value estimate for every company within our equity coverage universe. In eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) case case, we think the shares look undervalued at today's prices. Our fair value estimate for eBAY is $46 per share, nearly 25% higher than where it is currently trading. In the spirit of transparency, we make available our fully-populated DCF valuation models to all of our financial advisor and institutional customers here.Valuation SummaryWe assume annual average top-line growth will average in the mid-teens over the next five years. We also assume that eBay will grow earnings at a solid double-digit pace during our discrete five-year horizon.

447201,24714,2012-03-20T19:02:44-04:00,,"In online auctions, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has a stranglehold on the market. The company has managed to stay ahead of its competitors. When it comes to buying online, eBay and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are the two big brand names that come to mind. Over the past few years, eBay shares have been performing at around par with the Nasdaq. In this article, I explain why eBay is currently undervalued.eBay is currently expected to grow earnings by 12.8 percent in 2012 and 13.1 percent in 2013. From a P/E valuation standpoint, I believe that eBay's stock should trade at around $42, which is over 11 percent higher than its price of $37.79 at the close of trading on March 20th. But eBay is an attractive buy for much more than its earnings potential. eBay's brand and business model give the company a lot of upside potential. This can be seen when comparing it to Amazon. eBay makes the majority of its revenue from consumer-to-consumer online auctions, but is trying to break into online retailing. Amazon makes the majority of its revenue from online retailing, but is making a strong effort to promote consumer-to-consumer business. In theory, eBay's and Amazon's will eventually move closer to each other, and both companies try to grow more in the world of e-commerce. Looking at their valuations, Amazon is almost unanimously expected to grow faster than eBay as the stock trades at over 135 times earnings, while eBay's P/E ratio hovers around the market average. I believe that Amazon will grow faster than eBay over the next few years because of its expansion into the tech world with the Kindle, but eBay's attempts to grow should beat expectations and boost stock price in the near future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The service has no monthly account or set-up fees. The encrypted thumb-sized card reader includes a free application and is currently supported by iPhone with Android forthcoming. There's a lot of positioning going on in the mobile payment arena, and it looks like eBay is in pretty good shape which puts the company in the bullish category.EBay's stock price has been on the upswing as shown below:The latest 2012 April 28/30 bull-put credit spread for eBay does not have much time value left, so management of the position will be considered.The 2012 April 28/30 bull-put credit spread can be closed for a net debit of $0.03 using midpoint pricing representing about 1.5% of time value remaining. There's still 36 days left until April options expiration, so it should be possible to find another April position for rolling to.A number of potential positions are available for rolling to and we select to roll to the 2012 April 32/34 bull-put credit spread with details shown below:(Click to enlarge)The 2012 April 32/34 bull-put credit spread selected for rolling to has a net credit of $0.16 using midpoint pricing, so taking into account the $0.03 net debit for exiting the current position, the roll may be executed for $0.13 which represents an incremental potential return of about 6.2%.

The price of eBay's stock has continued to increase and the most recent 2012 March 27/29 bull-put spread position has very little potential return left, so management of the position will be considered.There's been some recent banter about PayPal's (an eBay company) mobile payment options being insecure.

Regardless of this exchange, eBay's stock price has continued to climb, as shown below:eBay's stock price is in the neighborhood of its previous four resistance points, so diligent treading at this point is important, as the stock could suddenly drop, as exhibited previously.The prospects for eBay continue to appear bullish, so a new bullish position will be considered. First consideration is given to rolling the position to the same month of expiration as the current position, March. However, no suitable positions were found for March expiration, so April expiration is considered with the position selected for the roll being the 2012 April 28/30 bull-put spread, as shown below:To exit the current position will require a net debit of about $0.01 and a net credit of $0.14 may be received for the new position, so the total net credit for the roll is $0.13 ($0.14-$0.01), so we're picking up about 6.5% of potential return.

468971,24276,2012-03-30T14:25:36-04:00,,"Scott Thompson, who had been head of eBay's PayPal unit, was thought good enough to get the top job at Yahoo. But eBay (EBAY) management dissed his reign this week by saying his replacement, David Marcus, will bring ""startup energy"" back to the unit.(For more on the news, check out TechCrunch's story elsewhere on Seeking Alpha.)Marcus' energy comes from Zong, a mobile payments startup Marcus sold to eBay less than a year ago for $240 million. Zong started with virtual goods, but quickly expanded into real-world purchases.Marcus is a serial entrepreneur, having founded GTN Telecom and Echovox before Zong, which moved him to Silicon Valley in 2008. (He also co-founded TwitterFone.) Thompson is betting that Marcus' experience and contacts within the mobile industry - he's a regular on the mobile technology speech circuit - will make eBay the big winner in mobile payments.At eBay, Marcus has already produced PayPal Here, a competitor to Square that will let merchants take credit and debt card transactions from a mobile phone.This is the ""sweet spot"" in the payment business, an area every processor, bank and merchant wants to succeed in. It's going to be a game for big players, over time, so does a startup guy make sense as eBay's chief negotiator?Considering how slowly the rest of the industry has responded to mobile, signs actually point to yes.The next question is what might this do for the stock of eBay, which at about $37/share is still well short of its late-2004 high of $56.65. The eBay auction service was one of the great stories of the dot-com era, and the 2002 acquisition of PayPal for $1.5 billion fueled the stock through the dot-bust.But things haven't gone the way they were supposed to. The company got Frank McCourt lucky in finding a way out of Skype, the voice over Internet Protocol (OTC:VOIP) it bought for $2.6 billion in 2005 and managed to get out of successfully only after selling most of it to outside investors.The consensus is that eBay's managers are not the sharpest knives in the Internet drawer. But the business is now at a nearly $12 billion annual run rate, and last year brought $3.2 billion down to net income. (By way of comparison, Google (GOOG) last year brought $9.7 billion out of $37.9 billion in revenue down to that bottom line.) Yet eBay sells at a PE of 15 right now, against 22 for Google. The reason for that is on the top-line, where eBay has grown just 30% since 2008 while Google has nearly doubled revenues.Payments have the potential to give eBay the top-line growth it needs, and if Marcus can manage it he'll be in line to challenge John Donahoe for the CEO job. (Donahoe was the company's fair-haired boy, credited with growing eBay Marketplaces, when he took over from Meg Whitman in 2008.)Donahoe knows what is at stake, calling payments ""a winner take all business"" before plucking Marcus out of relative obscurity this week.""Who had $20 on Marcus? Anyone?"" asked Zack Whittaker of ZDNet when the appointment was announced. Obviously, Donahoe has bet a lot more.How much would you put on him?Disclosure: I am long GOOG."

411681,25274,2012-03-05T12:25:28-05:00,,"Over the past few years there has been an increase in the popularity of online shopping. While the majority of businesses that compete in this space are brick and mortar businesses with an online store, there are still a few companies that compete as ""online only"" retailers. Two of those companies are eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Though they operate with slightly different business models and have a range of competitors outside their core e-retailing space, they do still compete in the same core industry - online retail. Amazon operates primarily as an online reseller, but also competes in other spaces as it produces and markets its own brand of tablet (Kindle), and offers its own proprietary web services. eBay on the other hand operates primarily as an online marketplace which allows consumers to buy and sell their own products via auction format, and offers its own payment system (PayPal), which can be used with numerous retailers online. Though the companies themselves have very similar operations, their stocks trade very differently. To better evaluate the attractiveness of both companies I will use a series of profitability and valuation techniques.ProfitabilityWhen examining the two companies on profitability using three popular profitability ratios (Gross profit Margin, Operating Profit Margin, and Net Profit Margin) it's clear to see that eBay is the more profitable company. Since eBay just provides the marketplace and not the actual product, it has no product costs. Its only costs of revenue are the ones associated with providing the online market place and payment system to consumers. Whereas Amazon, as a reseller, has those same costs in addition to the cost of products it is purchasing and then reselling. Although eBay had a Net Profit Margin of 27%, it was mostly aided by a gain on the sale of Skype to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). If we back out the $1.4 million gain from the sale, eBay then would have a Net Profit Margin of 18%, much lower than their current 27% but higher than Amazon's 1.3%.ValuationeBay shares also trade at a much cheaper valuation than Amazon shares. eBay trades at $36.25 or 20.55 times current earnings, which is in line with the rest of the online names. Amazon trades at $179.30, or an outrageous 130 times earnings, which is a high valuation even for a technology based growth company. Factoring in the future growth of both companies we can evaluate each stock's PEG ratio, a measure of a company's price-to-earnings ratio in relation to its future earnings growth. The PEG ratio for eBay is just 1.56- a moderately low valuation, while the PEG ratio for Amazon is an overvalued 4.85. This just confirms how attractive eBay's price level is in comparison with that of rival Amazon. Both Amazon's P/E and PEG ratio act as support that the stock's current price of $179.30 is overvalued. eBay offers a much safer investment, as the operations are much more efficient than Amazon's and the stock trades at a much lower earnings multiple as well.Although eBay is trading more attractively than Amazon in relation to its underlying earnings, the results are mixed when comparing the company's price to other underlying measures. For instance eBay has a price-to-book value ratio of 2.60, which is far lower than Amazon's price-to-book value ratio of 10.5. However when comparing the share price to underlying sales, we actually see that Amazon has a much lower valuation than eBay. Amazon shares are only trading at 1.7 times revenue, while eBay trades at 4 times revenue. This is not surprising as Amazon has been growing its revenue roughly 40% each year- Amazon's problem is not in its sales numbers but   profits. One final valuation metric is the Enterprise Value to EBITDA valuation technique. This valuation tool takes the enterprise value of a company, which is essentially an expanded market capitalization value, and divides it by the company's EBITDA. In this case, eBay has a much lower valuation based on its EV to EBITDA valuation - 18 times as opposed to 90 times for Amazon shares.SummaryAmazon has been growing revenue at a rapid pace of late, and has been investing in the infrastructure needed to support growth. This is evidenced by the 83% increase in the net amount of property, plant and equipment on Amazon's Balance Sheet from 2010 to 2011. This also undoubtedly contributed to Amazon's increased expenses in 2011. However these costs will need to create much more efficient operations in the future for me to be a buyer of Amazon. I feel the shares are still far too overvalued at this price range, and even if the company can lower expenses I don't feel it will have enough of an impact on the share valuation to make me view it as a fair or even cheap valuation. eBay on the other hand also has attractive growth options, most notably in the payments sector as PayPal looks to move into mobile and even physical payment formats. However shares of eBay trade at a much more attractive valuation - 20 times current earnings and 18 times next year's earnings. While they both operate in similar sectors, the fact that eBay never holds inventory and operates solely in an online space, gives it a great advantage over Amazon. eBay benefits from very low costs of revenue and also from its Payments segment where PayPal continues to expand into new markets and formats. For this reason I would favor eBay shares over those of Amazon in the online retailing space.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
351601,22936,2012-02-08T16:15:33-05:00,,"One of the most iconic names of the Internet era is eBay (EBAY). Some overall statistics about the stock include:These are very solid overall fundamental numbers, but before considering an investment in eBay it is important to remember that eBay now has two main businesses:These business do interact and provide some synergy, but they are also very different. One is basically retail oriented, and the other a financial services business. They have different business drivers, metrics and competitors.From an investment perspective, having two businesses under one roof can both be good and bad. This provides diversification, which means less risk to an investor. It also tends to provide a floor under the price of a stock. Conversely, having two businesses makes it hard for the stock to move up quickly based on any one big driver. This struggle between the good and bad of having two businesses under one roof can be seen in the performance of the stock over the past year. The stock has oscillated in the range of $27 and $35. There does not appear to be an obvious short term catalyst to drive the stock out of this range.If an investor believes the stock will stay in that range, one suggested way to profit is to sell a strangle. That would involve selling an out of the money put and selling an out of the money call to generate a credit and then hoping for the stock to stay within that trading range. For example, as of the time I'm writing this article, the stock was trading at $32.80 and the April $28 -$35 strangle was selling for a little over $1. A few scenarios and their probabilities are shown below:In summary, eBay is a unique company with two diverse businesses. That potentially makes it both a less risky investment, but may also limit its upside. If an investor feels their is no catalyst to drive this stock out of its trading range the option trade above might be worth considering.Disclosure: I am short EBAY.Additional disclosure: This posting is for informational, educational and entertainment purposes only and should not be considered investment advice."

As the position has realized the majority of its potential profit, further management of the position will be examined.Prior to presenting information related to managing the position, information related to eBay's most recent Q4 2011 conference call is presented.The company is positioning itself to be an effective partner to retailers of all sizes. Both PayPal and eBay have over 100 million active accounts and active users. PayPal is increasingly becoming a global business with more than half of PayPal's revenues generated outside of the U.S. PayPal's mobile payments hit $4 billion, which is five times the amount from the previous year. The company is planning to extend PayPal to point-of-sale retail locations. A limited in-store test is in process with Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and the company plans on extending the pilot to 51 Home Depot stores primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area.eBay increased its marketing efforts in Q4 and is pleased with the performance of its Buy It New and Buy it Now marketing campaign. The company launched X.commerce in Q4 enabling developers to create products and connect with merchants without requiring the eBay platform. eBay's recent acquisition, GSI, had a great holiday season, driving strong growth for its clients.eBay appears to be performing very well, and opportunities for eBay's PayPal are looking very attractive. With this in mind, the price of eBay's stock has increased since the bullish spread was considered in the previous article, as shown below:The initial position had a potential return of 10.5%, of which the majority has been realized, as the current position has about 1% of potential return remaining. At this juncture, the position should either be exited for a profit or rolled for more potential profit. Since eBay is performing well and it's earnings report is in the hind mirror, rolling the position to another bullish spread with increased potential return will be analyzed.Using PowerOptions tools, a new position for rolling was found for March with a potential return of 11.7%. The specific position to roll to is the 2012 March 27/29 put spread with a midpoint net credit of $0.21. The net debit for closing the 2012 February 25/27 is $0.02 using midpoint pricing. The net credit for rolling the position is $0.19 ($0.21-$0.02). The initial position also had a potential net credit of $0.19, so the total net credit for after rolling the position will be the net debit for closing subtracted from the initial net credit added to the net credit for entering the new position or $0.19-$-0.02+$0.21 or $0.38. The new aggregate potential return is 21% and is calculated as $0.38*100%/(2-$0.19). A profit/loss graph for one contract of the new position, including the net credit from the previous position, is shown below:The new position will initially be 9.2% out-of-the-money and should probably be exited or rolled if the price of eBay's stock drops to $30.50 or below.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

We are maintaining our above-market fair value estimate of the online auction and payment processor (our full report can be found here).eBay's revenue for its fourth quarter jumped 35% from the same period a year ago. The firm's PayPal business continued to perform well, ending the quarter with 106.3 million active registered accounts (up 13% from the same period a year ago). Revenue from PayPal jumped an impressive 28% thanks to continued merchant and consumer adoption and increased penetration on eBay. PayPal's net total payment volume grew 24%, and the firm noted that its international markets exceeded revenue from the US for the first time, reflecting its global footprint. Its Marketplaces business also performed well, with revenue jumping 16% from the same period last year. Gross merchandising volume, excluding vehicles, improved 10% with sold items increasing 11% globally.The global e-commerce giant reported non-GAAP net income of $0.60 per share, a 15% increase, thanks to the strong top-line expansion noted above and improved productivity, offset in part by a modestly higher tax rate. Profitability was also solid, though its non-GAAP operating margin fell slightly due to the impact of acquisitions and business mix. However, all three business segment margins (Marketplaces, Payments, and GSI) advanced on a sequential basis from the third quarter. Overall, we were pleased with the bottom-line performance.Looking ahead, eBay expects net revenues for the first quarter of 2012 in the range of $3.05 - $3.15 billion with non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.50-$0.51, the latter slightly below street consensus. The company expects net revenues for the full year 2012 to jump to $13.7 - $14 billion (18% - 20% growth) with non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.25 - $3 (11% - 13% growth), ranges we think are achievable. Though the strong US dollar will negatively impact the firm's top and bottom line growth by approximately 3 percentage points, the company expects strong operating earnings growth of about 15% for the year on the heels of improving segment margins at PayPal and GSI.Our 16-page Report on eBay.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
450521,26031,2012-03-22T06:56:33-04:00,,"As most of you have heard, PayPal [owned by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)] will be launching a new service (and dongle) to compete directly with Square in the offline payment space, and believes it can swallow some of Square's market share. While I understand that a $1 billion valuation for Square may have seemed a bit much for PayPal execs to swallow, I believe such an acquisition would have been highly beneficial, and would ultimately have been cheaper than competing directly.Acquired in 2002 for $1.5 billion, PayPal has had an immensely successful run, and is one of eBay's most profitable units. The company has recently released its vision for the future, to provide customers with ""Integrated in-store, online and mobile shopping solutions that create a fully optimized end-to-end shopping experience"", and intends to do so by competing in the offline payment space as well by taking on companies such as Square, which has to date processed over $4 billion worth of goods. PayPal has good reason to believe that it will succeed. With incredible brand recognition, over 106 million active accounts (13% increase year over year), excellent relationships with millions of merchants spread across various geographies, a wide suite of product capabilities, and an excellent risk management and claims system, PayPal believes it can leverage its current strengths and dominate the offline payment space as well. Compared with Square, PayPal is a behemoth. Backed by eBay's strong analytics team, and with total payment volume of $33.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011 and mobile payment volume of over $4.0 billion last year (a 500% increase from 2010), PayPal enjoys a significantly lower cost of capital than does Square. To top it all off, PayPal has announced that it will be charging five basis points less than Square's transaction fee of 2.75%, and is signaling that it intends to be aggressive about competing in the space.However, Square is no small player, and unless merchants are willing to switch to PayPal immediately (something I would love to see a study on), it will continue to enjoy a dominant position in the market. Square is also willing to compete aggressively, and hired Alyssa Cutright, who until recently served as Vice President of Products for North America at PayPal. PayPal is not the first to compete with Square. Launched by accounting software firm Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in May 2009 and currently about half the size of Square, GoPayment is a software service that comes with a free card reading device, and has been steadily increasing market share. Other companies, such as Eventbrite, have also announced that they will be launching a service that would compete with Square in certain markets.While we can expect fierce competition in this space in the future, I believe Square at a $1 billion valuation has never been cheaper. I am confident that PayPal will be successful in the offline payment space as well. However, I also believe that Square will be able to compete successfully with PayPal in the markets in which it is currently dominant. PayPal's move will undoubtedly make it difficult for Square to be a serious player in markets in which PayPal has a dominant online platform presence, but this should not have such a pronounced effect on Square's position in the U.S. market, and will not completely lock them out of foreign markets either. Assuming you accept this premise, Square will continue to grow in certain markets, and will continue to be a competitor of PayPal (assuming PayPal is successful in their endeavors as well). Given this scenario, it may very well have been cheaper to acquire Square, its market share, and its know-how at $1 billion, than to bear the costs of competing with it. Acquiring Square would allow PayPal to keep the 5 basis point fee reduction, which will prove to be significant over time, save on sales and marketing expenses associated with fierce competition (assuming PayPal is serious about dominating this space), and leverage Square's momentum of success across world markets.Just as Square seems to have underestimated PayPal's willingness to compete in the offline payment space, I believe PayPal has underestimated Square's ability to remain competitive despite more aggressive competition. If Square continues to grow as it has (I expect we will see at least some slowing in growth), PayPal may end up acquiring it down the road at a higher valuation, or worse, Square could be acquired by an even larger player in the financial world, resulting in an even worse position for PayPal. PayPal will surely be successful, but I believe it could have done even better had it acquired Square.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

320518,22762,2012-01-19T06:18:12-05:00,,"By Leena RaoPayPal recently revealed that it was testing an in-store payments technology both via mobile and point of sale systems on a ‘friends and family’ basis at Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Initially, the pilot was only for 5 stores. Wednesday, on eBay’s earnings call eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) President and CEO (and interim PayPal president) John Donahoe revealed that PayPal will be extending the pilot to 51 Home Depot stores in the San Francisco Bay Area.Basically, via the pilot customers (for now, this only applies to PayPal employees) are able to pay for items via their PayPal account at Home Depot’s point of sale systems. They can either use a pin code via their mobile phone or a specialized PayPal credit card that can be swiped, the payment amount will be deducted from their PayPal account.The bigger vision of brick and mortar partnerships are set to include location-based offers, making payments accessible from any device and offering more payments flexibility to customers after they’ve checked out. Users will also have the ability to access realtime store inventory, receive in-store offers, and real-time location-based advertising from stores. PayPal will also help retailers use location and transaction data to improve the experience for consumers.As PayPal’s Anuj Nayar told us recently, the Home Depot test program was individually established between PayPal and the big-box retailer, but in the future, PayPal is partnering with point-of-sale software companies to help expand the in-store program to other brick and mortar retailers.The assumption is that the results of the smaller test at Home Depot, which only launched a few weeks ago, must have been positive, so Home Depot is expanding the pilot program. We’re told that PayPal will be partnering with at least 20 other known top-tier retailers for the in-store payments test, which will be unveiled later this year.When asked about the impact of PayPal point of sale integrations will have this year, Donahoe says the last year was about the planning process, this year will be getting the in-store integrations rolled out and next year will be about sale. “The goal is to get a product that will be expanded to every vertical around the world so we can build a business around the point of sale product.”Donahoe said he tried actually the in-store integration this morning at a Home Depot in San Jose (he says he left his wallet and mobile phone in the car), and just was able to enter his mobile number and pin and was able to pay. The receipt was emailed to him.Original post"
320578,21439,2012-01-19T10:03:01-05:00,,"Last evening, January 18, 2012, eBay released their Q4 2011 results.Here is how eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) did across the metrics we follow in the World of eBay Marketplaces:While we don't cover it, PayPal continues to do very well and the GSI  unit over-performed as well.   And with the eBay  Marketplace, everything about the Q was very solid and ahead of  expectations, with the exception of GMV growth in the US (in-line at 10%  and below e-commerce's 15%) and Intl (below expectations at 9%).  I'm  sure these results will continue the drum beat of people suggesting the  company should split eBay marketplaces and Paypal.A deep-dive on eBay marketplace growthOne interesting part of the Q that sellers are already picking up on  is this: ""If GMV grew at 10% how did revenue grow at 16%?""  The answer  is that eBay's effective 'take rate' (the % of revenue they make on GMV)  went up pretty strongly for the Q - coming in at 7.9% (marketplaces)  and 3.71% (paypal) for a total take rate of 11.61%.  There are a couple  of factors that drive this:That explains the disconnect between revenue and GMV, now let's look at why GMV came in at/below expectations for the Q.Whenever we look at GMV growth we find it helpful to look at the  category data.  Here's the eBay category data for Q4 - sorted by y/y  category growth and color-coded - green grew faster than e-comm, yellow  grew around e-comm and red was below 10%.When you think of the eBay marketplace as a portfolio of categories  (which it is and is increasingly becoming more siloed), you get  a  better feel for where eBay is making inroads and where they are losing  share in e-commerce. As you can see there are only two categories that  grew faster than e-commerce (BI/H+G) and 9 categories were moderate and  ten categories that lagged.Vehicles have been problematic for years so no surprise there, but  some of the categories point to erosion from competition (most likely  Amazon you would have to assume) such as BMV and Video Games.  It's also  interesting that CE and Musical Instruments had a tough Q.Jewelry and Coins had been on a huge spike, presumably due to the  melt-value price of gold and other precious metals, but growth from that  trend seems to have either annualized or decreased.It will be interesting to see if eBay's increased verticalization  strategy on CE will help turn around the category and if they can get  CSA to grow faster than 11% with the concerted effort on eBay Fashion in  2012.Finally, we've mentioned that our SSS for auto-parts is north of 50%.   Our customers tend to all have adopted eBay's fitment feature in that  category which is probably a core driver of the super-sized results for  that set of ChannelAdvisor customers.Why was eBay's GMV growth so far off the ChannelAdvisor data?In Q4, our customers at ChannelAdvisor as reported in our SSS data  had a great Q on eBay - growing ~18% for the Q and hitting a record ~22%  in December.  We've covered this in the past, but I thought it was  important and timely to cover why there is a pretty big 8% gap (10% vs.  18%):Other interesting datapointsCombing through the news release, conference call and analyst reports, here are a couple of other interesting tidbits:Up next...AmazonAll in all, this was a great Q for eBay and they are already focused  on turning around some of the categories with lagging growth.  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn't report until January 31st, so stay tuned for coverage of their  results on sister-site, AmazonStrategies.   We have been holding a ton of interesting posts and topics such as  (PayPal POS vs. Gwallet from NRF, details on eBay's new search engine,  Cassini, and an update on Groupon Goods), stay tuned.What did you think about eBay's Q?

360031,24866,2012-02-12T07:35:16-05:00,,"Despite disappointing fourth quarter results for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), analysts are still bullish on the stock. However, based on my analysis of the fundamentals, multiples, and my DCF model, I find that the firm will be easily outperformed by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Despite the seductive growth story, Amazon's multiples conjure up images of stock charts from the dot-com era. This firm is simply not worth the risk.Amazon trades at a respective 135x and 68.8x past and forward earnings, while its competitor eBay trades at 13.5x and 12.6x past and forward earnings. This is a significant premium that requires dramatic earnings growth to justify. With earnings expected to decline 4.4% in 2012 as the economy subsequently picks up, I believe investors might exit for firms with stronger free cash flow yields.At the fourth quarter earnings call, Amazon's management addressed a poor close to the year:On the plus side, the firm is becoming the brick-and-mortar retailer's worst enemy, with its price checking app and general undercutting of the competition. With 164M active users, the firm still has plenty of room to penetrate and the Kindle Fire has expectations for double-digit top-line momentum. However, fourth quarter results were not only below expectations but also weak on first quarter guidance. Margins are likely to remain constrained in the near-term with greater investments. I expect that a recovery will also reduce the appeal of Amazon's low cost appeal by increasing demand for higher-end retail.Consensus estimates for Amazon's EPS forecast that it will grow by 4.4% to $1.31 in 2012 and then grow by 105.3% and 86.6% in the following two years. With the firm trading at triple-digit levels, I will leave the reader to make an attempt to extrapolate a justifiable intrinsic value from these (uncertain) projections.In my view, eBay will similarly face substitute competition from higher-end retail. However, the firm's multiples are reasonable and the earnings streams offer much greater certainty. PayPal has 106M active users and represented nearly two-fifths of eBay's business in 2011. One-fourth of online retail transactions are processed via PayPal, while the segment still has plenty of room for penetration. The GSI acquisition further extends the company's e-commerce base into a greater amount of retailers.Consensus estimates for eBay's EPS forecast that it will grow by 12.8% to $2.29 in 2012 and then by 15.8% and 14.3% in the following two years. Modeling a CAGR of 14.3% for EPS over the next three years and then discounting backwards by a WACC of 9% yields a fair value figure of $38.36, implying 15.3% upside.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
320249,21445,2012-01-18T10:10:07-05:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is expected to report Q4 earnings after the market close on Wednesday, January 18 with a conference call scheduled for 5:00 pm ET. Analysts are looking for EPS of 57c on revenue of $3.32B. The consensus range is 54c-59c for EPS, and $3.22B-$3.44B for revenue, according to First Call. In October, eBay guided Q4 EPS 55c-58c on revenue $3.2B-$3.35B. The company also forecast FY11 EPS $1.98-$2.01 vs. consensus $2.00 on revenue $11.5B-$11.6B vs. consensus $11.59B. eBay CEO John Donahoe forecast that the company would reach $8B in mobile gross merchandise volume and that PayPal will reach $7B in transactions this year, reported TechCrunch, citing the executive's address at the Consumer Electronics Show. Earlier this month, Yahoo (YHOO) named PayPal President Scott Thompson as its new CEO, and CEO John Donahoe was named as interim PayPal President. Collins Stewart views eBay's loss of Scott Thompson to Yahoo! as an incremental negative for eBay as the loss could slow down PayPal's growth rate in 2012. However, Collins believes eBay's business continues to be strong. Argus expects PayPal's growth over the next few years to be more based on execution than strategy. The firm expects eBay's margins to increase this year. eBay is worth $40B and if the company were to separate PayPal, its online payments unit, that would boost the combined value of the entities by as much as 30%, according to data compiled by Huntington Asset Advisors and Bloomberg. Bernstein expects eBay will report stronger than expected results, benefiting from growth in PayPal and changes in its Marketplaces business. Deutsche Bank believes that while eBay's Q4 results are likely to be in-line to slightly better than consensus estimates, underlying weakness will be seen at the company in 2012 as the U.S. dollar strengthens and comps get tougher."
320084,25338,2012-01-17T16:02:53-05:00,,"Let's get something out of the way. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is winning the online commerce battle. Even though eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is mostly an online auctions website and Amazon is an online superstore, Amazon is winning in both sales of new items and used items by an insurmountable margin. eBay's main service will never match Amazon's. It's too late, and people feel much more comfortable and safer buying and selling on Amazon than on eBay. So eBay's growth will most likely not be stellar in the next couple of years, at least not compared to Amazon's. But eBay, as a company, has something else up its sleeve, and that's Paypal. Just look at the recent revenue growth.We are currently experiencing a huge, multiyear boom in online commerce. Look at any major seller of anything, and that company probably has an e-commerce website. In such an environment, it is important for businesses that customers feel comfortable making these purchases on their websites. In comes Paypal --- there is something slightly unsettling with giving out your credit card details online. Sure, when it's on the online Apple Store or on Amazon, everyone feels safe, but when you're buying from a smaller, less-known website, the fear of fraud and theft is always there. With Paypal, there are a few big advantages that make buying things online more comfortable:So Paypal is set to, and already has been capitalising from growing online sales. As more and more malware and theft is targeted at online sales from industry growth, security will become more and more of a concern, and people will be happy to use a service like Paypal. Another big advantage of the service is for small businesses: it is much easier and much cheaper for them to set up online payment facilities for their customers through Paypal than through enabling credit card payments.All the things above have already been happening for a while, but here's where is gets interesting. Paypal has another big catalyst: the upcoming rise of NFC (Near Field Communication) payments (see this article). This long-term development will be key for eBay and Paypal. From what I've see so far, replacing credit and debit cards with electronic versions on phones makes a lot of people uncomfortable, as they are scared that hackers and thieves could get their information from their phones. This fear sounds familiar doesn't it?Once again, as with online payments, in comes Paypal. I think that Paypal's real potential comes as a mobile payments service for physical stores that works in the same way as the online service does. This would be extremely useful and successful, especially for smaller stores and businesses, just like it is useful for smaller websites online. Corner stores and stands could have Paypal set up --- instead of using dollar bills and coins for small purchases, you would swipe your smartphone and pay through Paypal. No one would have the worry of getting their credit card information stolen, as all payments and all of the information stored on their smartphones will simply be Paypal. I don't think that people will fully give up physical payment cards and switch to paying with their phones anytime soon, but with this kind of a service, a lot of people would make at least a partial transition much faster. Think about all of the potential:One of my favourites:We are at a time in which things are changing rapidly in the virtual world, and eBay needs to make large investments to be significant in future business. I think that it should put a lot of focus on its Paypal platform, as it has the potential to become the Paypal of NFC payments, just as it is the Paypal of online payments. I hope that eBay follows this path, as in my opinion it will be the ""critical point"" for the company and its subsidiary.Would you feel more comfortable with NFC payments if they were made through Paypal?Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The numbers are typically released at 4:15 p.m. EST, and will be followed with a conference call at 5:00 p.m.Outliers & StrategyRecent NewsTechnical RevieweBay shares recently hit a two-month high near $32, an area of resistance going back to August, 2010. This will be a key level to watch headed into the 4Q 2011 earnings release. Beyond that level, there is room to run toward the October high near $34, followed by the 52-week high of $35.35. Should earnings disappoint, look for initial support near $30.50 - a crossover of the 20-Day SMA & 50-Day SMA, with further downside rise to $29.50, followed by $28. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com.)SummaryeBay shares have recovered from the slide earlier this month, stemming from the departure that Scott Thompson as president of PayPal to accept the position of CEO of Yahoo. While the PayPal division is one of eBay's key growth drivers, the Street is less concerned about the change, given the deep management team established on the PayPal side of the business. eBay is also seen benefiting from strength in mobile and its online marketplace, where it has invested heavily to facilitate quick purchases at fixed prices.With that being said, eBay is in good shape to overcome the conservative outlook for the Q4 2011 period it offered back in October. Therefore, much of the focus will center on the outlook for Q1 2012, given that the results from the current period are now largely priced in, while many of the company's new initiatives should take shape headed into 2012.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

318700,24491,2012-01-10T17:39:45-05:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) case, we think the firm is undervalued. Our fair value estimate is $46 per share, and we view the company as a core holding in our Best Ideas Newsletter.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for more information on our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. eBay scores a 6 on our scale (reflecting its undervaluation, but bearish technicals).Our Report on eBay ( images)Investment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightseBay earns a ValueCreation rating of excellent, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. We expect the firm's return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) to expand to 150% from 116% during the next two years.eBay 's valuation is compelling at this time. The firm is trading at a nice discount to our estimate of its fair value, even after considering an appropriate margin of safety. The firm's forward earnings multiple and PEG ratio also look attractive versus peers.eBay has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 24.1% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 0.6 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 10.5%.The firm's shares have underperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter. Although eBay's valuation appears attractive, the company is currently exhibiting characteristics of a potential value trap, and we'd still be cautious at these levels. There may be a better entry point yet.The firm is nearing resistance levels based on its 10-week moving average. We'd pay close attention to see if it bulls back or breaks through resistance for an indication of its future price trend.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. eBay 's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 106.5%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 11.5%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation rating of excellent. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. eBay's free cash flow margin has averaged about 25.3% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively strong. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow, which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. (For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit valuentum.com.) At eBay, cash flow from operations decreased about 5% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 28% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that eBay 's shares are worth between $35.00 - $58.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's medium ValueRisk rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $46 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 33.9 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 20 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 16.9% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 6.1%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 26%, which is above eBay's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 6% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For eBay, we use a 11.5% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $46 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for eBay. We think the firm is attractive below $35 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $58 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate eBay's fair value at this point in time to be about $46 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of eBay's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $64 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $46 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. eBay is a constituent in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter."

In Q3, SSS was 16.7%.Click to enlarge:In addition, Comscore indicated that sales from e-commerce in the U.S. increased 15% y/y in the month of November, in which Black Friday and Cyber Monday saw online sales surge 26% y/y and 22% y/y, respectively. This was driven by free shipping which accounted for 66% of all online transactions.Continued Ramp Up In Mobile e-CommerceInvestors can also expect to see continued strong growth in the mobile e-commerce. As of last quarter, Mobile GMV is on track to approach $5 billion (+100% y/y) in 2011, accounting for approximately 7% of total GMV. PayPal mobile is on track to surpass $3.5 billion in 2011 (+400% y/y), accounting for 3% of TPV. According to PayPal, global mobile payment volume jumped 500% y/y during Cyber Monday and Black Friday. Based on these data points, I expect another strong quarter for mobile e-commerce.PayPal’s Point of Sale (POS) StrategyIn Q3, management made a comment on PayPal’s Point of Sale strategy that allows shoppers to use PayPal at major retailers. Recently, PayPal partnered with Home Depot (NYSE:HD) to launch its POS service in five Home Depot stores. I see this move as a positive due to PayPal’s security feature, convenience and large user base. It is unlikely that PayPal’s POS will have meaningful impact on revenue for this quarter, but it will likely take market share away from other payment services such as MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) if the service ramps up by the end of the year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Investors will be looking to see a number north of $0.57 per share, based on the earnings estimates. Analyst estimates range between $0.48 and $1.44 per share.The current trailing twelve months P/E ratio is 18.9. The forward P/E ratio is 15.82. eBay recently tested the 200-day moving average, but has since broke down below again. All the moving averages are simply trending sideways, providing almost no trend direction guidance. eBay better not disappoint in this environment with the current PE, or it may get ugly.With the current type of breakdown failure of the 200MA test, I would be looking to buy portfolio insurance with options before the release if I owned shares. This can be done with selling calls against the shares you have and/or buying puts.Investors have been rewarded with an increase of year-over-year revenue. Revenue reported was $9.16 billion for 2010 vs. $8.73 billion for 2009. The bottom line has falling earnings year-over-year of $1.80 billion for 2010 vs. $2.39 billion for 2009.The company's earnings before interest and taxes are rising, with an EBIT year-over-year of $2.05 billion for 2010 vs. $1.46 billion for 2009.Here is a look at the fiscal year revenue:Gross reported revenue compared to the mean estimate (rounded):M = millions, B = billionsDifferences are rounded.Some onetime items are often excluded in reported EPS.Reported earnings per share compared to the mean estimate.

There's no standing still.The hiring of Paypal CTO Scott Thompson as Yahoo (YHOO) CEO indicates that eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) drift may be terminal.Both shares fell in value after the announcement, but Yahoo's fall was easier to understand. After all, most holders were looking for a take-out, not a new charge in the market. It was eBay's 5% loss that caused heads to scratch, but they shouldn't be.Paypal has become eBay's key profit driver. The success of start-ups like Square has made payments an important area of innovation, but here is eBay's chief payments guy jumping onto a sinking ship. Why?The only explanation that makes sense is that Thompson wanted a new challenge. Fine, but Paypal is facing a host of new challenges. Not only are the big payment companies like Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) looking at new currency solutions, not only are payment industry veterans like VeriFone investing in the space , but so are Internet companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Paypal's position is under serious threat, and here's the CTO looking for new challenges... t Yahoo?The move overshadows eBay's own CES announcements, which seems like small beer, a focus on specialty consumer electronics retailers and their need for a better online presence. Yawn.In theory this could be a good hire for Yahoo. Alibaba, of which Yahoo still owns 40%, is the biggest site for sellers on the Internet, representing the China market, while Yahoo's reach includes most of the world's buyers, in theory. What is needed to link the two is a common currency, a payment method, and that's what Thompson is all about.If he can make something work between Asian sellers and American buyers, Yahoo might become special again.  This may be the rare case where you sell the rumor and buy the news.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
312184,25075,2011-12-06T15:35:23-05:00,,"eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY) manages eBay, an online auction and shopping website. EBAY was founded in 1995 and now has a presence in 40 countries. Over the years it has expanded to include standard shopping, barcode shopping (Half.com), online classified advertisements (Kijiji or eBay Classifieds), online event ticket trading (StubHub), online apartment listing (Rent.com), online shopping comparison (Shopping.com) online money transfers (PayPal), local sales (Milo.com) and fashion sales (Brands4Friends). EBAY has 17,700 employees and is based in San Jose California. The company generates revenue through various fees including a fee to list an item and another fee once the item is sold. PayPal also charges fees to the seller for payment processing services.EBAY is cashing in on the growth in e-commerce and will continue to do so for years to come. E-commerce has grown massively, particularly over the last 10 years, and it is expected to continue to grow at a decent rate for many years to come. This massive growth in the e-commerce marketplace is being fought over between EBAY, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Yahoo (YHOO).As a technology company EBAY needs to keep evolving in order to keep up with ever changing trends and demands. EBAY, through its numerous acquisitions (both large and small) gains revenue through a variety of sources which the company categorizes under 2 business segments – Marketplaces and Payments. Importantly, the company is a good generator of cash – over the last 10 years the company has reported net earnings of over $10B, and achieved Free Cash Flow of over $14B. This cash allows the company to acquire smaller companies that have perhaps come up with a new solution that will complement EBAY’s existing operations – it helps allow EBAY to keep up with the competition.Consumers are shopping more and more on mobile devices, and EBAY has positioned itself well to capitalize on that growing market. By the end of 2010, EBAY mobile apps had been downloaded more than 30 million times, in eight languages, across 190 countries. In 2010 mobile payment volume was 5 times that of 2009. More than 2.5 million people have downloaded PayPal’s mobile apps.PayPal’s earnings have been a bit erratic over recent years probably due to acquisitions being bought (increasing revenue), and other acquisitions being sold (decreasing revenue). The sale of skype benefited eBay through a big wad of cash on the balance sheet, but the sale also reduced revenue.Quality RatingThe glaringly obvious issue with eBay’s Quality Rating is its poor Normalized Return on Equity. A company with a poor Return on Equity is not one that is particularly profitable with the use of Shareholders Equity. EBAY’s reported Shareholders Equity is around $16, and it also reports goodwill of $8B. It may need to write down some of its goodwill over the coming years. Its poor NROE has serious implications on the calculation of Intrinsic Value:Intrinsic ValueIf an investors’ Required Return for the stock is higher than its Return on Equity, such as the case here (EBAY’s Forecast Average Normalized Return on Equity is 12.6%, rounded up in the Intrinsic Value display), then the Intrinsic Value of the company is less than its book value. The easiest way to explain this is for you to consider a business that is available for you to buy for $1M in cash, and it makes $100K per year (10% return on your equity), but you want to receive a 12% return on your $1M. In this case you wouldn’t pay the $1M because the $100k per year does not meet your required return of investing in the business. This is obviously a simplified example, but important none-the-less.EBAY has been popular with market participants because it is one of the leaders in e-commerce, an industry in the spotlight and one likely to continue to grow. The performance of eBay has not matched the expectations of the market. If eBay can achieve higher rates of Return on Equity in coming years its Intrinsic Value will appreciate considerably.Regulatory UncertaintyA lot has been written recently regarding the likely introduction of an online sales tax bill which will bring online retailers in line with traditional retailers.The rules as they currently stand are: For the majority of states, if an individual or entity sell goods via the internet and ship them to the consumer in the same state, then they will need to collect sales tax from the buyer, and in turn pay that tax to the state. This applies when the seller has a physical presence in the state. The reason that the rule typically only applies when the seller has a physical presence in the state is that for a small online retailer, collecting sales tax from all buyers, then distributing the correct amount to each of the 50 states would be a nightmare.Already around 5 states have introduced requirements that out of state retailers collect sales tax and pay those states the amount collected, but this practice is messy and is not commonly adhered to.The new legislation in the US Senate proposes that internet retailers collect sales tax on all purchases from all states, regardless of whether or not they have a physical presence in the state. The bill proposes to simplify and streamline the process and give more authority to the states in enforcing the payment of sales taxes from online sellers. The states would need to adopt the standardized administrative procedures laid out at Federal level. Each state would have the option of joining the new system or keeping things the way they are.If passed, the new bill will create more paperwork for eBay sellers (although the intent of the bill is to make it simple – there will certainly be some headaches for smaller online retailers, at least initially), as well as making purchases more expensive (due to the additional tax) and hence slightly less attractive to the consumer.Under the current proposal, sellers with less than $500k in sales per year would be exempt, but there aren’t many businesses that have less than $500k in sales. At a 10% net margin, $500k in sales provides net income of only $50k. It would only be Moms and Dads selling their used goods on eBay who won’t be affected by the bill.Amazon is all for the bill – they know that they offer the best prices with or without sales tax added on. Amazon knows that the sales tax bill would be applied also to all of its competitors – such as retailers on eBay. The bill would make Amazon’s competitive position stronger, and every small online retailer slightly weaker.Both eBay and PayPal collect fees based on a percentage of the total purchase price, so with the additional price caused by a sales tax, their fees and margins would actually increase.The new legislation would have implications to eBay, as a lot of its retailers would be affected. The competitiveness of online retailers as a whole would not be expected to change dramatically though – due to other cost advantages, online retailers would still provide better prices than traditional retailers. And though the increase in prices due to the tax will bring online prices closer to that of physical retailers, the convenience of buying online is not diminished. Currently consumers enjoy the convenience of buying online paying prices at a large discount to physical retailers, and if the bill is passed consumers will still enjoy the convenience of buying online but will be paying prices at a smaller discount to physical retailers.ConclusionBased on the premise that as time goes by more and more people will shop online, EBAY will be expected to continue to grow their business. But investors keen on EBAY will be looking for 2 things before they consider a purchase – 1) the company increases its profitability as measured by Return on Equity, and 2) a decent Margin of Safety emerges through either a decrease in the share-price, or an increase in the Intrinsic Value of the business (which will come about if point 1 comes to fruition).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
310484,24802,2011-11-28T09:01:21-05:00,,"Every day, we hear stories about how crucial Black Friday, and indeed the entire holiday shopping season, is for traditional retailers. We also hear about how this will all be a barometer on the US economy. While many retailers will succeed, and many will fail, there is one that will rise above them all.eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is the ubiquitous consumer auction site, and it is one of the few survivors of the dot com bubble. Founded in 1995, eBay has revolutionized commerce, and it has delivered huge profits for investors. Since the IPO, shares of eBay have soared by over 1,400%, trouncing the S&P 500's (NYSEARCA:SPY) 10.9% gain.(Click charts to expand)We think the shares have much farther to rise, for eBay is riding a number of secular trends to the benefit of its customers and shareholders. As a pioneer in e-commerce, eBay wins no matter what happens to overall retail sales. E-commerce is growing, and even if overall retail sales were to decline, eBay would still benefit from the shift to internet sales. It is at this point that readers may begin to wonder why we are recommending shares of eBay, and not Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), given that Amazon has become the ""Walmart of the Internet."" We have profiled Amazon before, and although we are still bullish on the stock, there are a number of factors that make the stock unappealing in the short term. Specifically, Amazon's razor-thin margins, and its nosebleed valuation. While we are confident in its long-term prospects, in this market environment, a cheaper, more stable company like eBay is preferable.Black Friday has been an enormous success for eBay, across all of its channels. Global mobile payment volume processed through PayPal this Thanksgiving rose 511% over last year. Let us repeat that. 511%. That is a huge increase, and bodes well for eBay's prospects this quarter. Despite its name, the eBay auction website itself contributes less and less of eBay's overall profit. Below we breakdown eBay's profitability by division.From this breakdown, it is clear that PayPal is driving growth at eBay. Registered users reached 103 million in the last quarter, a 14% rise over last year. PayPal revenue set records each quarter, driven by continued merchant and consumer adoption, and soon PayPal will eclipse the core Marketplace division as the company's main business. But while we are most excited about PayPal, it would be wise to check on the state of the overall company, since we are not investing in PayPal, but rather eBay as a whole.eBay's last quarter was a strong one, and the company was bullish on its prospects. eBay posted EPS of 37 cents a share on record revenue of $2.96 billion. Growth was solid across all business segments. PayPal transaction volume grew 31% to 29.3 billion, and gross merchandising volume, a key gauge at the Marketplace division, grew 16% over last year to $14.7 billion. CEO John Donahoe noted that, ""Mobile commerce continues to accelerate as consumers change the way they shop and pay. We expect eBay mobile commerce to generate almost $5 billion in merchandise volume this year and PayPal mobile to exceed $3.5 billion in payment volume. Mobile is one way online and offline shopping are blending into a single commerce environment. We are focused on enabling commerce, helping consumers shop anytime, anywhere, and being the commerce partner of choice for retailers of all sizes."" eBay is winning share across industries, and the results are showing. Growth was strong across all geographic regions, including Europe. International gross merchandise volume rose 18% to $9.1 billion as a result of strong sales in Europe, Korea, and currency changes. Although the operating margin did decline to 18.1% from 21.8% last year, this was due to a number of acquisitions and investments and is not due to underlying business fundamentals.On the conference call, not a single analyst asked about Europe or the overall ""state of the consumer."" This is bullish, because the Street sees that success at eBay is not dependent on the health of the overall economy. Frankly, it does not matter what happens to overall retail sales. All that matters is that a larger percentage of those sales happen online, either through eBay's Marketplace division or the PayPal system. On the call, management was questioned repeatedly on growth, and CEO Donahoe was confident about the future. Specifically, he stated that:While eBay may not be Amazon.com, the leader in e-commerce, it does not have to be. eBay is a different type of company meant for a different type of investor. Amazon operates on the razor's edge, and while this has worked in the past, there is no guarantee that this will continue to work. This holiday season will be yet another record for e-commerce. Despite this, Amazon has said it could very well lose money in what will be a record quarter for internet sales. eBay on the other hand, will most likely post record profits and revenue. Amazon trades at a P/E of more than 96, while eBay trades at a P/E of less than 21. Furthermore, the company's balance sheets could not be more different. Amazon.com leverages its balance sheet fully, investing every penny it can in the business. eBay, on the other hand, is far more careful, investing with precision and conservatism. And the results show. eBay has a net $4.5 billion in cash, which works out to $3.50 per share. eBay is committed to not only growing its cash, but also buying back stock and making smart, strategic acquisitions, such as Hunch and GSI Commerce.eBay is poised for continued success, regardless of the economy. Investors should take advantage of the current turmoil engulfing the markets to add to or initiate a position in eBay. And analysts agree. Argus & Credit Suisse sees the stock at $40, S&P sees it at $37. The Reuters average price target stands at $38.52, representing upside of over 36% from current levels. eBay is changing the world of online and offline commerce, connecting shoppers and merchants in new and innovative ways. And investors can connect to profits by investing in eBay.Disclosure: I am long EBAY, We are long Amazon via the PowerShares NASDAQ Internet Portfolio, an ETF that tracks a basket of internet stocks trading on the NASDAQ.

300752,20485,2011-10-20T06:02:55-04:00,,"Shares of eBay (EBAY) fell roughly 5% after hours Wednesday, following the company’s third quarter results. eBay’s earnings per share were in line with the analysts’ consensus forecast. However, just meeting expectations is not good enough for a company that has a consistent record of beating the Street. Yahoo Finance indicates eBay exceeded expectations for at least the last four consecutive quarters heading into Q3. Furthermore, the company’s guidance for the coming quarter and the full year were not impressive when compared with the consensus of analysts’ views for the shares. Thus, eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) joins Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), IBM (NYSE: IBM), VMware (NYSE: VMW) and Cree (Nasdaq: CREE) in resetting investor expectations and equity valuations.eBay beat the Street on the top line, making $2.97 billion against expectations for $2.91 billion, based on Factset data. eBay reported a 32% increase in revenue against the prior year quarter, attributing its growth to each of its business segments. However, investments made to assimilate acquisitions and market the brand, and some difficulty with the learning curve on mobile business led it to only earn the $0.48 per share (on a non-GAAP basis) that analysts were looking for. According to Yahoo Finance, over the last four quarters, eBay beat estimates by between 2% and 11%. Thus, expectations for the same were likely built into the company’s valuation, and so were squeezed out of it on Wednesday evening. However, by 8:00 PM ET, and after the conference call concluded, the stock had mitigated its decline to minus 4%.The company’s Payments business generated a 32% net revenue increase, to $1.107 billion. Within Payments, its merchant services business grew sharply in Q3, with net total payment volume rising 36%. eBay’s signature Marketplaces operations generated a 17% net revenue rise, to $1.653 billion. Within this segment, its international gross merchandise volume exceeded the rate of growth in domestic volume, growing 18% to $9.078 billion. The company’s GSI business, the operations just acquired in Q2, generated $203 million in net revenue.A key problem with the quarter, as far as investors indicated Wednesday evening, was the contraction of the operating margin. Also, it looks as though the margin will hold stubbornly higher than the comparable period through Q4 as well. eBay’s net operating margin was squeezed to 25.3% on a non-GAAP basis in Q3, from 28.7% last year. Executives on the call attributed the contraction to acquisitions, including of GSI, and to business mix. Increasing business via mobile phones played at a higher cost than was expected to be the case. As the company moves up the learning curve, according to executives on the conference call, things should improve. The effective tax rate was also unfavorable against the prior year comparison, but the company’s executives focused their discussion on costs, and assurances of expected improvement over coming quarters. eBay also experienced a higher effective tax rate and completed its share repurchase program in the quarter.When it came to guidance, eBay raised its outlook, but it seems not enough to satisfy investors. The company guided for a Q4 revenue range of between $3.2 billion and $3.35 billion, but the average of the two points was a bit short of the analysts’ consensus, which according to Yahoo Finance, sits at $3.3 billion. Also, the company’s fourth quarter EPS forecast for between $0.55 to $0.58 matches poorly against the consensus estimate for $0.58. eBay’s full year 2011 revenue forecast for between $11.5 billion and $11.6 billion sits well against the analysts’ consensus estimate for $11.51 billion. However, the company’s EPS forecast range of between $1.98 and $2.01, which is a penny higher than previously forecast, only encompasses the analysts’ consensus view for $2.00. Again, investors were likely looking for more.Given eBay’s risk tied to the euro and its questionable forecast for an okay holiday season, which is certainly at risk, there appears to be good enough reason to temper short-term enthusiasm for the shares. However, eBay’s Paypal expansion to point of sale, with a beta test at play with one major retailer this Q4, could set this company’s growth into a higher gear in the next few years. According to Yahoo Finance, the company’s P/E/G ratio sits at 1.4, with growth forecast at 12.1% over the next five years. Thus, it seems to me that its trading range should not vary much, with downside cushioned by its potential for greater long-term growth and its upside burdened by current issues. Therefore, while I’m cautious over the short-term, based on cost pressures, macroeconomic risks, and what I see as deteriorating broader market sentiment, I would put eBay in a category of names to look up again on weakness based on its opportunity in the emerging blockbuster point of sale business. Therefore, a hold rating would be in order for this stock today for most investors, and depending on your patience and investment style, I would label it a short-term avoid (weak sell) and long-term accumulate (weak buy).

The company has enjoyed a very positive trend in earnings per share over the past year and has posted better than expected results. Ken Griffin significantly increased his position in EBAY during the second quarter. John Griffin, Steven Cohen, and Eric Mindich also all had over $100 million invested in the stock. We are going to take a closer look at eBay and its comparables, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Yahoo (YHOO) to determine which stocks promise higher returns for investors.The company reported revenue of $3.0 billion for the third quarter of 2011. Income was up 14% in the same time period. EPS was $0.37, up 12% year-over-year. EBay is expected to earn $1.69 in 2011 and $2.02 in 2012. The stock recently traded at $32.29. Its current PE ratio is 23.56.ValuationEBay’s earnings are expected to grow by 11.43% over the next five years. This implies that its PE ratio using its 2014 earnings is around 12.87. Amazon’s expected growth rate is 25.16% and its corresponding PE ratio is 48.56. Google is expected to grow at 19.29% and its PE ratio using its 2014 earnings is around 10.80. Yahoo is expected to grow by 14.76% over the next 5 years and its PE ratio using its 2014 earnings is around 14.31. Amazon’s stock price soared 50% during the past six months. That’s the reason the stock is trading at a significant premium. EBAY looks undervalued compared with Amazon and Yahoo. Google is also trading at a discount compared with the comparable companies.VolatilityVolatility is generally used as a measure of risk. EBay’s beta is 1.58, Amazon’s beta is 0.85, Google’s beta is 0.86 and Yahoo’s beta is 0.80. Amazon, Google and Yahoo are at the same volatility level, while eBay looks riskier than these three stocks.Hedge Fund OwnershipStocks that are favored by hedge funds tend to outperform the market by a few percentage points on the average. Google was the most popular stock among hedge funds at the end of second quarter. It was held by 83 hedge funds (nearly 30% of the funds we track). Yahoo was the second popular stock. 52 hedge funds were bullish about it. EBAY and Amazon were also quite popular: 47 and 51 hedge fund managers were bullish about them respectively. Bill Miller and John Griffin both were bullish about eBay and Amazon.Insider PurchasesStocks purchased by insiders tend to outperform the market on the average. Yahoo has the biggest number of insider purchases. It was purchased by two insiders during the past six months. EBay was also purchased by one insider. The insider paid $29.56 and purchased 3380 shares. The stock gained more than 5% since then. Other stocks do not have insider purchases during the same period.Overall our analysis points out that eBay is slightly undervalued compared with the other stocks in the group. However, it is apparently more risky than its comparables. On the other hand, Google is also trading below its true value and it is less volatile. In addition, more hedge funds are bullish about GOOG, indicating some form of perceived value in the stock. Therefore, we choose Google over eBay among this group. But considering the fact that Google is not as good a comparable to eBay as Amazon and that eBay’s overall performance is better than Amazon, we still like eBay and encourage investors to do an in-depth analysis of the stock for their portfolios.

Also, a lot of people are worried about the PayPal growth rate which  was it's lowest ever (around 32%).The Q+A session is always the most interesting and here's a couple of nuggets from that.eBay not going to compete with FBAAn analysts, Matt@Wells Fargo, asked (paraphrasing here) ....what about the test on fulfillment...-I suspect he was asking about this fulfillment  program that was announced in June to help Chinese sellers with CBT  into the US. Swan and JD didn't seem to know what he was talking about  and Swan answered about GSI and then JD added this interesting tidbit:Which should put to bed all the rumors that they acquired GSI for the fulfillment capabilities to compete with FBA.Large Merchant ProgramInterestingly they really played down the large merchant program and  highlighted the Coach Factory Outlet deal which was really a coupon and  not a true large merchant deal.They did discuss the eBay Factory Outlet which was good to hear.Category DetailsOne of the more popular features we publish is the detailed category  information which you can see in this chart (click to enlarge).As you can see the Coin category continues to do very well due to the  demand for Gold and other precious metals.  I haven't seen any press on  this, but eBay has even opened a bullion center to make it easier to  buy gold which you can checkout here: http://goldandsilver.ebay.com/gold  (Hey if you put your life savings into this, you get a free coin - eTRS!).Sometimes when eBay publishes results, everyone on Wall St. gets  excited and upgrades the stock, etc. (bullish), other times they are  very upset with the results and turn Bearish.    This time there was an  interesting mix of opinions and I wanted to share some highlights that  are applicable to sellers.  Only time will tell which camp is right.The Bear caseJeetil Patel @ Deutsche Bank has some interesting observations that add up to a bearish view on eBay's Q4 and 2012 prospects:The Bull scenarioShawn Milne at Janney had one of the most glowing bull cases on the Q, highlighting these points:Disclosure : I am long Amazon and Google.  eBay is a strategic investor in ChannelAdvisor where I am CEO."
300689,22762,2011-10-19T17:04:34-04:00,,"By Leena RaoeBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported third quarter earnings today, which were in-line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the third quarter increased 32% to $3 billion, compared to the same period of 2010. This was actually a record quarter for revenue, says the company. Net income on a GAAP basis was $490.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income came in at $628.2 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, up 18% from 2010. Analysts expected $0.48 cents per share, and revenue was expected to hit $2.9 billion.The company’s PayPal business continued to help buoy the company’s earnings. PayPal ended the quarter with 103 million active registered accounts, a 14% increase year over year. PayPal revenue increased 32% year over year driven primarily by increased penetration on eBay as well as continued merchant and consumer adoption. PayPal’s net total payment volume grew 31% to $29.3 billion in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the same period of last year. PayPal had its first billion dollar quarter last quarter but exceeded this, bringing in $1.1 billion in revenue, which is up over 30% from 2010. And PayPal expects to generate more than $3.5 billion in mobile TPV in 2011, up from $750 million in 2010.The company’s Marketplaces business also grew, bringing in $1.7 billion in revenue, which is up 17% from the previous year. Gross merchandise volume (GMV) excluding vehicles increased by 16% year over year to $14.7 billion. U.S. GMV excluding vehicles increased 14% year over year, and international GMV excluding vehicles increased 18% year over year to $9.1 billion, reflecting solid growth in Europe, continued improved performance in Korea, as well as a positive impact from foreign exchange. eBay expects to generate almost $5 billion in mobile GMV in 2011, more than double mobile GMV in 2010.The company’s GSI Commerce business, which was acquired earlier this year, contributed $202.6 million in revenue for the third quarter. GSI generated $608 million in global ecommerce (GeC) merchandise sales during the quarter.The year-over-year increase in third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was driven primarily by strong top-line growth, says eBay, and partially offset by continued investment in strategic initiatives and the impact of acquisitions.Bay Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe, said in a statement, “Our company reported another strong quarter, with eBay, PayPal and GSI each performing well ... mobile commerce continues to accelerate as consumers change the way they shop and pay. We expect eBay mobile commerce to generate almost $5 billion in merchandise volume this year and PayPal mobile to exceed $3.5 billion in payment volume. Mobile is one way online and offline shopping are blending into a single commerce environment. We are focused on enabling commerce, helping consumers shop anytime, anywhere and being the commerce partner of choice for retailers of all sizes.”In the fourth quarter, eBay expects revenues in the range of $3.2 to $3.35 billion million with GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.47–$1.53 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.55–$0.58. GAAP earnings per diluted share will include the gain from eBay’s sale of its remaining equity interest in Skype. For the full year, eBay expects revenue in the range of $11.5 to $11.6 billion with GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.42–$2.48 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.98–$2.01.The company has had a pretty significant few weeks. Last week eBay debuted its brand new developer business, X.commerce, which stitched together technologies from eBay, PayPal, Magento and GSI. The company also teamed up with Facebook to integrate the social network’s Open Graph into the Magento and GSI global commerce platforms. PayPal also revealed PayPal Access, a payments identity technology that would allow you to carry your payments identity to various retailers on the web.Facebook Platform Marketing Chief Katie Burke Mitic just joined eBay’s board. PayPal is also expected to debut a new payments platform for merchants as well as in-store integrations.Original post"
300744,24491,2011-10-19T23:43:52-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported strong third-quarter results Wednesday that showed particular strength in Paypal, its global payments business. The firm remains one of our best ideas, and we are maintaining our $47 fair value estimate (the stock is trading just over $30 per share). Our full report supporting our fair value estimate can be found here.The global ecommerce and online payments leader saw revenue increase an impressive 32% from the prior-year period, while non-GAAP net income jumped 18% and non-GAAP diluted earnings-per-share advanced to $0.48 (up 20%), meeting expectations. The revenue growth number was its best performance since 2006!Paypal was particularly strong during the period, revealing a 14% increase in active registered accounts — Paypal’s net total payment volume was up over 30% in the quarter. The firm also noted that total mobile payment volume will surpass $3.5 billion in 2011, almost a five-fold increase over the previous year. The firm’s marketplace business also performed quite well during the third quarter, with gross merchandise volume (GMV), excluding vehicles, increasing 16% from the same period a year ago. Interestingly, the firm noted strength in GMV in Europe, as well as mobile GMV, which eBay thinks will hit over $5 billion this year (twice the levels of 2010). We think eBay is steadily improving its position in marketplace against Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)—encouraging sales of new items in a fixed price format--something that continues to be overlooked by the Street.The firm’s guidance was strong as well, though it did disappoint some. The global ecommerce giant expects fourth-quarter revenue to hit $3.35 billion and non-GAAP earnings-per-share to be $0.58 on the high end of the range, coming in about in line with our expectations. We think the major concerns with eBay rest in shaking off its perception as an “online flea market,” potential weakness in the fast-approaching holiday season, and integration risk with respect to recent acquisitions (Milo, Magento, and GSI Commerce).All things considered, we think eBay’s quarter reaffirms our thesis that the firm is far from a dot-com bust. We’d be looking to add to our position in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter on any meaningful pullback.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

That's a pretty consistent record and its expected to keep on increasing in the future. Although the stock has been down recently, it's only 6.29% off its one year high and is up 28.86% for the past 12 months. In this weekly price graph provided by Barchart, there was a lot of volatility over the last 2-1/4 years but the trend has been upward:The basics: eBay Inc.provides online marketplaces for the sale of goods and services, as well as other online commerce, platforms, and online payment solutions to individuals and businesses in the United States and internationally. The company's Marketplaces segment provides the infrastructure to enable online commerce on a range of platforms, including the eBay.com platform, and its localized platforms. Its online platforms also consist of StubHub, a secondary tickets marketplace; Shopping.com, an online shopping comparison website; Rent.com, an apartment listing service platform; and Half.com, a fixed price media marketplace. This segment also operates classifieds websites, such as Den Bla Avis, BilBasen, Gumtree, Kijiji, LoQUo, Marktplaats.nl, and mobile.de, as well as eBay Classifieds, including eBay Anuncios, eBay Kleinanzeigen, and eBay Annunci. In addition, its eBay.com platform provides services comprising feedback forums, safeharbor programs, verified rights owner programs, customer support, pre-trade and post-trade tools and services, powerseller programs, eBay top-rated seller programs, top buyer programs, coupons and buyer rewards, and eBay buyer protection services.

People are using eBay to buy both new and used products on the Internet at both fixed and auction prices. I think these services plus a method to pay and collect through secure and trusted methods are a business model that should continue to do well.

I'm not an expert on Y!, but  it appears that 30-40% of Yahoo! is locked up in Alibaba (OTC:ALBIY) stock (and they  own 40% of Alibaba) and Alibaba has some kind of a right of first  refusal that would allow them to block a deal they don't like.  Also,  Jack Ma, the crazy smart, sly like a fox CEO of Alibaba recently was  reported as saying: If this happened, I firmly believe this could be eBay's worst  nightmare coming soon and I haven't seen anyone in the press or Wall St.  thinking this through, so wanted to share some thoughts on this topic  and get feedback. One of the benefits of being in the biz for 10yrs+  now is I was first hand at a lot of these happenings.Ni Hao, Alibaba - a quick primer on China's e-commerce giantHeadquartered in China (Hangzhou to be specific), Alibaba has rapidly  built a massive e-commerce company with many subsidiaries.  Here are  the very brief highlights: (here is more info)eBay and Alibaba - a long history of butt-kickin' (and it wasn't Alibaba's)At the height of the Meg Whitman regime's hubris, Meg decided that  eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) was going to conquer China. They acquired a local auction company  and proclaimed victory.  AFTER eBay was dominant, Ma started Taobao and  essentially kicked eBay out of the region with the exception of some CBT  today in 3-4 years.During the battle, some of the best Meg and Ma quotes surfaced as the  two duked it out toe to toe.  Here are my personal favorites that  really illustrate the Meg regime and the cleverness of Ma:If you want a detailed exceptional read of how this played out,  Stanford has a great business case study with all the gory details here.  Here's my quick summary of the battle and how eBay lost.So we had a lot of activity in '02-05 and it's been relatively quiet  lately as the companies stayed in their relative geographies.  Now with  Yahoo! in play and Alibaba as a likely buyer/player, we could be looking  at another intense period of competition.The Aligator is coming to the Ocean - why should eBay be worried?They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Here's what happened to eBay when Taobao turned the model upside down in China:So in three years you saw that the battle was over and then by four  years it was totally done.Based on what we've seen historically, here is the foundation for the 'nightmare scenario':Now you have a proven marketplace as a platform, but to bring it to life you need supply and demand.SupplyDemandThis isn't a stretch or unproven strategy, it's the exact same playbook they used in China and that also worked in Japan for Softbank.But eBay is really PayPal so who cares?Most folks on Wall St. view eBay really as Paypal plus a marketplace  and there's a lot of analysis that demonstrates that eBay doesn't get  much credit for the marketplace if you do a sum of the parts.  What's  really interesting about Alibaba+Yahoo getting in the game though is you  have the first competitive threat to not only the eBay marketplace, but  to Paypal.  Alipay is multi-lingual, multi-currency and even has some features  that Paypal doesn't offer.  It could also be leveraged to help US brands  sell more into China which Paypal is effectively locked out of as their  CBT flows out of China.What should eBay do?Well, as you can see, I think eBay has a strong vested interest in keeping Yahoo out of Alibaba's hands.  So you  could see:If eBay isn't able to block the merger, they should batten down the hatches and prepare for some choppy seas.What do you think?Readers, what do you think? Should eBay be concerned or am I making a  mountain out of a mole hill? Should they make a run at Y!? Sellers -  would you sell on Taobao US? One thing is for certain - the Chinese  proverb - 'May you live in interesting times' is definitely in play!Disclosure: I am long Google and Amazon. eBay is an investor in ChannelAdvisor where I am CEO."

The only way to grow earnings year after year without corresponding revenue growth is to cut expenses. You can only do that for so long. At some point, there isn’t any fat left to cut and you are cutting into bone. Investors want and need to see top and bottom line growth which is why high flyers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Priceline (PCLN), and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) have done so well. Unfortunately, a lot of the good news is reflected in these stocks.One that has been overlooked is eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) (Click here for my eBay recommendation on Fox Business News). This is a $41 billion company that is likely to grow its top and bottom line at over 16% and can still be purchased for less than its growth rate at 14x next year’s earnings. Numbers like this get me excited, however, when you peel back the onion, the story gets sexier. eBay’s PayPal system has been a home run and its mobile division is growing at 25-30%.  Online vs. OfflineIncreasingly, it is all about offline. Merrill Lynch analyst Justin Post, in a recent note, pointed out that PayPal will offer multiple payment options at retail for its 100 million active accounts. He also points out there are four ways to use PayPal’s offline mobile payment system.There is no question that we are in the early innings and PayPal is growing fast enough to become eBay’s largest business by 2014. That is saying something because eBay is likely to do well north of $13 billion in revenue next year. Clearly, there will be a lot of competition in the e-commerce payment space, but we strongly believe PayPal, with its strong fraud protection features, will be an industry leader.Currently, the biggest bull on the street is Wedbush’s Gil Luria. In his recent upgrade note he placed a $48 target on eBay a year from now. He points out that eBay currently trades with a PEG ratio of 0.8 and that as PayPal becomes an ever bigger part of its revenue, investors will start to afford a higher multiple, more in line with other growth stocks like Visa (V), Mastercard and Amazon.I think the AMZN multiple is a stretch, but multiple expansion is right on target for eBay and could easily support a PEG ratio north of 1. eBay is worth at least 40, and with any stabilization in our economy, we could get a 50% return at 48.Disclosure: I am long EBAY and expect to add to the position."
299809,24866,2011-10-16T05:11:52-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), the iconic provider of merchant services, currently has a consensus ""buy"" rating on Wall Street due to strong growth opportunities and stable flagship operations. I tend to agree with this rating - the stock is trading below its intrinsic value even despite a high valuation of 25.5x and 14.5x past and forward earnings, respectively, and no dividend yield. This is so because while the market recognizes the value in PayPal, it has yet to fully appreciate the emerging offline capabilities of the segment.With 8M people currently using PayPal Mobile and more firms accepting the payment option, eBay is well positioned to compete against credit, debit, and prepaid providers. A long-term growth in eCommerce will drive Marketplace sales and result in increased recognition of this innovative payment option. Mobile GMV is on track to double next year to $4B in FY11 and there are more than 800K listings per week. PayPal has already proven resilient to a depressed economy, as it continues to grow by 25% to 30% annually.Management has also done an incredible job with strategy, highlighting its vision and shifting to lower cost alternatives. According to the CEO:The point is that the company is transitioning to higher-margin offline mediums, but, at the same time, strengthening current ones. While a new search system in 2012 will improve customer satisfaction in Marketplaces, the recent acquisition of Zong will provide a vehicle to grow PayPal. Zong's synergistic value for eBay has yet to be fully factored into the stock valuation in the extent that it has direct carrier billing relationships with 250+ global mobile network providers - a considerable foothold that can be leveraged to grow a payment option. PizzaExpress, for example, now accepts PayPal Mobile in its chain of restaurants - my expectation is that many more will follow suit, making the business the largest revenue provider of eBay by around 2014.PayPal has also achieved a record $1B+ worth of sales in 2Q and now is actively used by more than 100M individuals and 9M merchants globally. The mobile option, specifically, is used by 8M individuals. The low current market penetration makes the next week an ideal entry point for investors looking to maximize returns from this opportunity - more on this below.During the second quarter, revenue also exceeded management's top-end guidance as it grew by 25%. With a strong eCommerce market and higher demand for lower cost goods due to macro stagnation, sales will continue to rise in Marketplace. At the same time, as the company moves to lower cost alternatives offline, I model gross margins expanding by around 110 basis points to 74.1% in 2012. Growth in Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) will further increase the demand for eBay's virtual payment option.As the company is due to report third quarter earnings on Wednesday, investors should be particularly concerned about how PayPal has performed. The market will be highly sensitive to this growing business and should it fail to meet expectations, even slightly, I anticipate the stock taking a bit of a hit. Many developments are underway with PayPal and thus analyst expectations should be taken with much reservation.For this reason, if you are not currently long EBAY, I recommend holding out until the market gets a greater sense of PayPal's growth rate. My expectations for Q311 are that Marketplace y-o-y revenue will rise by around 15.1% and Payments by 27.9%, Both are expected to benefit more from marketing serves than transactions in terms of growth. My anticipation is that Payments' number of active registerd accounts will grow by roughly 15.4%.Overall, consensus estimates for EPS are that it will grow by 15.6% to $2 and then by 16.5% and 15.5% in the following two years. My expectations for revenue growth are 27.8% in 2011 and then 18.6% in 2011. In conclusion, I find that a stable flagship business coupled with strong opportunities will make eBay a long-term winner in its market.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
300355,20568,2011-10-18T15:37:45-04:00,,"eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is scheduled to announce its third quarter fiscal 2011 results on October 19, 2011, and we notice no movement in analyst estimates.Second Quarter OvervieweBay’s second quarter 2011 earnings per share (EPS) of 46 cents (excluding one-time items and including stock-based compensation) were level with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company reported gross revenue of $2.76 billion, up 8.4% sequentially and better than the Consensus expectation of $2.61 billion. Over 85% of eBay’s total revenue was transactions-based, while the remaining 15% came from marketing services.The pro forma gross margin was 72.4%, up 73 bps sequentially and down 25 bps year over year. While high volumes were a positive in the quarter, the increasing number of active users adversely affected the year-over-year comparison.Management GuidanceFor the third quarter, management expects revenue of $2.85–$2.95 billion (up 3–7% sequentially and 27–31% year over year), GAAP EPS of 37–38 cents and non GAAP EPS of 46–47 cents.For 2011, management expects revenue of $11.3–$11.6 billion ($10.6–$10.9 billion previously), GAAP EPS of $2.41–$2.44 ($1.53 to $1.58 previously) and non GAAP EPS of $1.97–$2.00 ($1.93 to $1.97 previously).Agreement of AnalystsOut of the 14 analysts providing estimates for the third quarter, none revised the estimate in the last 30 days. For fiscal 2011, 2 analysts made upward revisions, while one analyst made a downward revision in the last 30 days.The analysts expect a decent third quarter with revenue and earnings per share slightly above the guidance range. They see continued traction in eBay’s Marketplace business and continued online and offline share gains in the PayPal segment. With the acquisition of Zong, the analysts believe that PayPal can hugely attract online transactions such as streaming movies and newspaper subscriptions, thereby increasing digital revenue.The analysts contend that eBay has significant foreign exchange exposure, and almost 54% of its third quarter revenue will be derived from international markets. Based on average foreign currency exchange rates during 3Q11, they expect currency movements to have a positive impact on eBay’s total revenue.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsIn the past ninety days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter dropped a penny to 40 cents.  For 2011, the Zacks Consensus Estimate increased 2 cents to $1.70 in the last 90 days.RecommendationWe expect eBay to report another good quarter but remain cautiously optimistic on the fourth quarter. While the risk of a recession in Europe and a worldwide economic slowdown may eventually restrict consumer spending, current trends indicate solid holiday demand.We believe eBay’s PayPal is well positioned for sustained growth. During the quarter, PayPal has reinforced its mobile payments segment with strategic acquisitions such as Zong. Because of PayPal’s mixed funding sources between bank transfers, debit cards and credit cards, it can offer cheaper payment transactions than credit cards. We believe this competitive advantage should drive penetration across the Internet and emerging mobile landscape.Additionally, we remain encouraged by the company’s increasing focus on technology and a forward-thinking approach to e-commerce services. The company is aiming to be a one-stop shop for commerce products and services for consumers, merchants and developers with its X.commerce platform. We believe that eBay’s services will eventually drive more activity on the core Marketplace.However, we are concerned about increasing competition from major online retailers, such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), as well as many other smaller players. Additionally, Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been eyeing the online retail space, threatening eBay’s dominance. Google Wallet has the potential to become a predominant choice for users’ mobile payments given the relationship it has already forged with credit card giants such as Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) and other banks.Currently, eBay has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold recommendation.Disclosure: No positions"

297666,24491,2011-10-05T06:43:45-04:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) case, we think the firm is worth just under $50 per share, more than 50% higher than it is currently trading. Our full reports on eBay and hundreds of other companies are available on our website.We think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.  If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. We think our methodology and broad coverage universe is largely responsible for the meaningful outperformance of the portfolio in our Best Ideas Newsletter.  Our Report on eBay  Click to enlarge images    Investment Considerations  For every company in our coverage universe, we rate them on 13 unique measures. To get started, we show eBay's below:    Investment Highlights  eBay earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. We expect the firm's return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) to expand to 154.5% from 116% during the next two years. eBay 's valuation is compelling at this time. The firm is trading at a nice discount to our estimate of its fair value, even after considering an appropriate margin of safety. The firm's forward earnings multiple and PEG ratio also look attractive versus peers. eBay has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 25.7% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 0.6 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 10.5%. The company's stock price has outperformed the benchmark during the last quarter, and its valuation still looks interesting at these levels. Investors could be accumulating shares, as the stock continues to trade at bargain-basement levels. The firm's technicals look very attractive. If current prices hold, the firm's moving averages could create a golden cross, a very bullish technical pattern. Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC), with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. eBay 's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 106.5%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 11.5%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. 
Cash Flow Analysis

Valuation Analysis
Our discounted cash flow model indicates that eBay 's shares are worth between $35.00 - $59.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $47 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 34.6 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 20.3 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 15.7% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 6.1%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 26.9%, which is above eBay 's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, our valuation model assumes free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 5.9% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For eBay, our model uses a 11.5% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows. Click to enlarge

Margin of Safety Analysis
Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $47 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock.
In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for eBay . We think the firm is attractive below $35 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $59 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion. 
Future Path of Fair Value
We estimate eBay's fair value at this point in time to be about $47 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of eBay's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence.
This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $66 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $47 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.

292181,24389,2011-09-07T13:22:31-04:00,,"eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), founded in 1995, is the world’s leading provider of shopping and payments on the web. San Jose, California-based company connects a diverse community of individual buyers and sellers as well as small businesses around the world. The company has 2 segments: Payments segment (PayPal) and Marketplaces segment (eBay). Today, the company has more than 94 million active users worldwide.As of Sep 6, eBay stock was trading at $29 with a 52-week range of $23.38 – $35.35. It has a market cap of $36.7 billion. Trailing twelve month P/E ratio is 22.2, and forward P/E ratio is 12.3. P/B, P/S, and P/CF ratios stand at 2.3, 3.7, and 12.2, respectively. The 3-year annualized revenue and EPS growth stand at 6.1% and 75.9%, respectively. Operating margin is 21.5%, and net profit margin is 17.4%. The company has a low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.1. eBay does not have a dividend policy yet.eBay has a 4-star rating from Morningstar. While its trailing P/E ratio is 22.2, it has a 5-year average P/E ratio of 43. Out of 31 analysts covering the company, 13 have buy, 3 have outperform, 14 have hold, and one has sell ratings. Wall Street has diverse opinions on eBay’s future. The bottom line is -2.5% growth, whereas the top-line growth estimate is 24% for the next year. Average five-year annualized growth forecast estimate is 12%.What is the fair value of eBay given the forecast estimates? In this article, the 26th in the series, I will show a step-by-step calculation of eBay’s fair value using discounted earnings plus equity model.Discounted Earnings Plus Equity ModelThis model is primarily used for estimating the returns from long-term projects. It is also frequently used to price fair-valued IPOs. The methodology is based on discounting the present value of the future earnings to the current period:V = E0 + E1 /(1+r) + E2 /(1+r)2 + E3/(1+r)3 + E4/(1+r)4 + E5/(1+r)5 + Disposal ValueV = E0 + E0 (1+g)/(1+r) + E0(1+g)2/(1+r)2 + … + E0(1+g)5/(1+r)5 + E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5]The earnings after the last period act as a perpetuity that creates regular earnings:Disposal Value = D = E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5] = E5 / rWhile this formula might look scary for many of us, it easily calculates the fair value of a stock. All we need is the current-period earnings, earnings growth estimate, and the discount rate. To be as objective as possible, I use Morningstar data for my estimates. You can set these parameters as you wish, according to your own diligence.eBay’s Valuation Historically, the average return of the DJI has been around 11% (including dividends). Therefore, I will use 11% as my discount rate.Since we are in the middle of the year, it will be more feasible to take the average of ttm EPS of $1.32 along with the mean estimate of $2.32 for the next year.E0 = EPS = ($1.32 + $2.32) / 2 = $1.82Wall Street holds diversified opinions on eBay’s future. While analysts tend to impose subjective opinions on their estimates, the average analyst estimate is a good starting point. Average five-year growth forecast is 12%. Book value per share is $12.58.The rest is as follows:I decided to add the book value per share so that we can distinguish between a low-debt and debt-loaded company. The lower boundary does not include the book value. According to my 5 year discounted-earnings-plus-book-value model, the fair-value range for eBay is between $28.47 and $41.05 per share.As of Sep 6, eBay was trading at a price of $29. I like eBay as a company. Its websites allows me to get products easily, quickly and safely. I still see a great growth potential, as well. The market more-or-less priced this potential. The current price of $29 reaches the lower boundary of my fair-value range. The stock has 41.56% upside potential to reach the upper boundary of its fair-value range.O – Metrix ConfirmationIf the math above looks too complicated for you, try estimating the fair value using the O-Metrix as such:O-Metrix = [(Dividend Yield + Growth Estimate) / (P/E Ratio)] * 5The back-testing of this valuation technique on 40 large-caps shows that O-Metrix works very well over the long-term, such as five years. I am also continuously checking on specific sectors, and the formula works very well so far.What is the O-Metrix Score?O-Metrix = [(12 + 0) / (17.25] * 5 = 3.48Depending on the benchmark chosen, the market has an O-Metrix score range between 4 and 5. eBay's O-Metrix score of 3.48 is below the fair-value range. Back-testing of this ranking system shows that companies with higher-than-average O-Metrix scores beat the market with lower volatility. At a price of $29, the company is trading within the D-Grade, below-average-return zone.  (Click to enlarge)SummaryeBay’s stock has always been priced at a premium due to its high growth potential. The average P/E ratio in the last 5 years was 43. As of September 6, the stock is trading with a relatively lower P/E ratio of 22.2, and a forward P/E ratio of 12.3. In the last 5 years annualized EPS growth was 11.81%. With an ever increasing demand for online shopping, I expect the growth to keep its pace.As of Sep 6, eBay was trading at $29, at the lower boundary of my fair-value range of $28.47 and $41.05. The stock has low total debt/equity ratio of 0.1, but it has a high Beta of 1.55. The stock has 41.56% upside potential based on 12% EPS growth estimate. Analysts are pretty bullish on the stock. The mean intermediate target price estimate is $38.71, implying significant upside potential. Nevertheless, I would wait until earnings confirm the high growth expectations.You can download FED+ Fair Value Estimator, here.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
282153,21439,2011-07-27T09:32:23-04:00,,"This is part one of a two part series covering eBay's Q2 results which  were released last week Wednesday (July 20th, 2011).  Every quarter we  provide a highlights of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) results from a seller's  perspective.  eBay revealed quite a bit of information so I split this  report into two segments:eBay's Q2 HighlightseBay announced a strong Q2.  Before digging into some of the  specifics, here are some highlights that I picked out that are of most  interest to sellers:eBay vs. E-commerceWhen Donahoe took over eBay, he set a multi-year strategy to turn  around the marketplaces business and a big milestone in that strategy  was to get the business to grow at least as fast as e-commerce.  As you  can see from this graph, eBay has hit that goal with their Q2 results!  Note that ComScore hasn't released their Q2 e-commerce number and that's  usually what people measure until the US DOC comes out with theirs much  later.  Even if e-commerce grew 14% (as reported by Mastercard's early  data), then eBay was still there.  eBay  management attributed the growth to price changes (which we are now  annualizing) and all the other changes such as duplicate listing policy,  free shipping, eTRs, etc.Domestic vs. InternationalThis next chart shows three segments: eBay US, eBay Intl and total  eBay y/y growth.  You can see that since Q410, eBay international GMV  growth has been struggling while US has been on a nice rebound.  eBay  doesn't split up different regions, but they have mentioned challenges  with their Korean unit/gmarket in the past that I suspect continue to  give them international headwinds.  At ChannelAdvisor we're seeing  strong growth in Europe/UK and also in Australia that is more in line  with the US growth.   A deep dive into categoriesOne of the most popular parts of our quarterly updates is the  category data.  This quarter we're expanding it to give even more  detail.First, here's a look at eBay's Q2 2011 Category performance organized from largest category to smallest in absolute GMV.As you can see eBay has 5 > $1B/Q categories and 20 > $1B  annualized GMV categories which is an impressive portfolio and a lot of  opportunity for retailers.This next table organizes the categories by y/y growth rate and bucket-izes them into three buckets:Sellers can use this data to benchmark their y/y performance vs. the  overall category and also  use the data as a way to identify new rapidly  growing categories they may want to explore to diversify their  offerings (gold coins anyone!?)  The category tables above show the Q2 2011 snapshot of a category.   We've had several requests from customers to show more category trend  data, so we are introducing two new eBay category charts that show  eBay's largest and smaller categories over the period of 5 quarters to  see the trends.Here's the chart for Home and GArden, Parts and Accessories, CSA, Computers, Sports and Business/Industrial: Here you can really see Home and Garden's clear acceleration path  with GMV in Q2 already accelerating past the seasonally robust Q4.  Also  notice the performance of the P+A line where you can really see the  acceleration since the parts finder was broadly adopted in Q310.   Finally, note that CSA is still below Q4 levels.To keep the chart clean, I put the other categories on this chart:    In this chart you can really see CE fall off post Q4 and none of these  smaller categories is really showing crazy signs of growth over time  like you see with H+G, P+A.The bear case - increased sales and marketingReading through the stock analyst reports, a couple of analysts  (Jeetil@DB and Herman@SIG) noted an increase in eBay's Sales and  Marketing expense that I thought was interesting and warranted a look  at.  This chart shows eBay's GMV growth (blue line) charted against the  sales and marketing growth (red line).You can see above that eBay is investing a ton in sales and  marketing, but not generating an equal amount of growth in GMV.  The  last two blue datapoints are estimates, so we'll have to see how those  come in. This next chart shows the same data but as a % of transaction  revenue: You can see from this chart that eBay has essentially doubled sales  and marketing as a % of transaction revenues from Q2 10 to Q2 11 (again  the last two data points are estimates, not actuals).  This is  interesting because I haven't seen a dramatic increase in eBay search  spend or online ads, so I'm not really sure where the incremental spend  is going.  I believe the seller eTRS discounts are contra-revenue so it  wouldn't be there...In any case, tare two conclusions you can make from this data:I'd be interested to hear your thoughts and if you are seeing any benefit/signs of increased marketing spend.That's it for Part IUp next - Details on eBay's big Holiday 2011 plans that may surprise  you (they did me!)  In post II, we'll detail some of the other non-Q2  news that came out of the Q2 news.Disclosure: I am long Amazon and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). eBay is an investor in ChannelAdvisor where I am CEO."

Analysts are looking for EPS of 46c on revenue of $2.61B. The consensus range is 45c-47c for EPS, and $2.55B-$2.65B for revenue, according to First Call. In April, eBay forecast Q2 EPS 45c-46c on revenue of $2.55B-$2.65B, and FY11 EPS $1.93-$1.97 vs. consensus $1.96 on revenue of $10.6B-$10.9B vs. consensus $10.87B. During the quarter, the company's PayPal unit acquired Fig Card and eBay hired ex-Yahoo (YHOO) executive Don Bradford to head its social e-commerce initiatives. eBay also acquired Zong for $240M in cash. Also during the quarter, eBay completed its acquisition of GSI Commerce and its PayPal unit said it will terminate its year-old cooperation with Ali Express.

280248,23479,2011-07-19T14:46:17-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is expected to announce its Q2 2011 earnings results on 20th July 2011. For this quarter, we would keep a close eye on growth in the company’s payment transaction business i.e. PayPal, which has shown robust growth both in average deal sizes as well as increased adoption of PayPal as the preferred mode of online payment. eBay competes with other e-commerce sites like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Overstock (NASDAQ:OSTK).Our price estimate for eBay stock, at $32.75 is in line with the current market price.Mobile Payments to Drive Future GrowthTotal value of mobile payments is expected to reach about $670 billion by 2015 from $240 billion by 2011, [1] driven by increasing needs for financial access especially in emerging markets. eBay’s recent acquisition of mobile-payment start-up Zong emphasizes the same trend. [2] Given that PayPal significantly grew in Total Payments Volume (TPV) by about 28% in Q1 2011 over last year, we expect increased acquisition activity to drive the number of PayPal accounts upwards for Q2 2011.(Chart created by using Trefis' app)Larger Merchants Should Combat Competition but Reduce Take RateIn its Q1 2011 earnings release, eBay indicated lower take rates (average % commission made by PayPal on each transaction) on its payment transactions primarily driven by a shift to larger merchants. eBay’s recent acquisition of GSI Commerce points to the same trend in future. [3]GSI Commerce is an e-commerce company and has long-term relationships with brands and retailers such as Toys “R” Us. Consistent with our earlier note on the potential effect of eBay’s acquisition of GSI Commerce, we expect merchandise listings to increase in future given the increasing mix of merchants of all sizes on the site.

Every quarter we  provide a highlights of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) results from a seller's  perspective.  eBay revealed quite a bit of information so I split this  report into two segments:There were two revelations in eBay's Q2 results that were very interesting that I wanted to cover.Paypal goes Brick-and-mortarWhile the purview of this blog is really eBay and not PayPal, I'm  fascinated by the payment wars we see unraveling between Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) and PayPal. We covered Google Wallet's launch by ex-PayPal'er Stephanie  Tilenius here if you want to catch up on where things stand.On the Q2 conference call, Donahoe announced that PayPal is  officially going 'off-line' and will be available in a point of sale  test by the End of Year 2011 with a 'Major Retailer and then rolled out  to 20 retailers by the end of 2012.  In comments/Q+A he added:And took a pretty firm jab at Google Wallet with this one:Finally, there's a lot of speculation that Apple will enter the  payments war by including a NFC chip on the rumored Fall iPhone 5.   Donahoe pre-empted that and said that a retailer told him that NFC  stands for ""Not for Commerce."" OUCH!The interesting angle of this war is going to be which position has  the most leverage. Do the platform providers have the most leverage  because they control the phone?  Does eBay have more leverage because of  the large user base and merchant relationships?One of GSI/eBay's largest customers Toys-R-Us is squarely in the  GWallet camp so it will be interesting to see who the mystery large  retailer is.Of course the holy grail is Wal-mart which does take Paypal.  You  have to believe that Walmart is being courted by Google and Apple hard  as well.This Ain't your Momma's eBay!  Perhaps, most interestingly, eBay's CEO, John Donahoe took the covers  off of eBay's plans for an aggressive holiday push in 2011.  Stating:I have to admit that I was pretty excited to see eBay finally get  back to getting the word out. The Q2 results show that they've  definitely made improvements in areas of trust and usability.  In fact, I  think the last major ad campaign was in 2009 when they had comedians do the 'Come to think of it......eBay' (which made it seem like eBay is an afterthought, but I digress).SCREEEEEECCCHHHHHH....Really?!So there I was after the call thinking of some of the things that  eBay could highlight - hard to find items, great selection, 100% buyer  guarantees, top rated sellers.... Then I saw an article from the WSJ/AllthingsD that provided more details:Whoa.  I think what they are saying here is the whole theme for this  massive ad campaign is going to be: ""It's not your mother's eBay  anymore.""The first thing I did was Google that phrase because it was oddly  familiar and low and behold it was actually first coined (queue the  ironic music!) by Stephanie Tilenius at our 2008 catalyst event!Regardless of pedigree, I'm trying hard to be up-beat about the ad  campaign, but I honestly can't see how eBay's going to make this work.   Taken at face value, you are basically saying that Moms aren't hip and  now eBay is hip because your Mom won't shop there any more?!  I've  shopped at eBay for 10yrs and I'm not a mom - what's that mean about me?   Actually, my mom has never shopped at eBay, so what's that mean?   What's this mean for Mother's Day?!I was shocked that I haven't heard more seller concern about this -  maybe I'm the only one that doesn't get it?!  let me know your thoughts  in comments - or your Mom's - I actually am very pro-moms and hope they  continue to shop on eBay....Seriously though, it's going to be interesting to see if eBay can  pull this off - I guess it would have to be very tongue in cheek and  craftily done to avoid a Groupon-scale disaster.  The good news I guess is that JD promises it won't be the new tagline.Stay tuned...eBay's ad agency always loves NFL games and late-night TV, so keep an  eye out for any maternally disparaging ads or Mother Funny and let us  know when you've seen your first one.

278589,22762,2011-07-08T12:31:36-04:00,,"eBay has acquired mobile payments company Zong for $240 million in cash. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2011.Zong has been one of the pioneers in the mobile payments space,  adding a compelling new way for consumers to pay for items online.  Simply put, it lets you pay for things, particularly virtual goods  online, via direct billing to your mobile phone. Consumers simply enter  their mobile phone numbers in the payments process.When a user wants to purchase an item, he can enters his cell phone  number on a site, the site sends a text message to the phone, the user  confirms the transaction with a short reply, and all the charges show up  on his phone bill. Zong powers this entire transaction. The company has  partnered with over 250 carriers worldwide to offer the technology to  mobile phone users.eBay says that Zong will add ""complementary technology and talent"" to  its PayPal division, giving consumers more ways to pay for virtual  goods and products online. Scott Thompson, president of PayPal, said  this in a release: “Commerce is changing. With mobile phones, we walk  around with a mall in our pockets. PayPal helps to make money work  better for customers in this new commerce reality – no matter how they  want to pay or what device they’re using…We believe that Zong will  strengthen this value by helping us reach the more than 4 billion people  who have mobile phones, giving them more choice and security when they  pay.”Zong, which was founded in 2008 by entrepreneur David Marcus, has raised a total of $27.5 million in funding. Matrix Partners’ Dana Stalder, who was the former CTO of PayPal, is on Zong’s board of directors.Stalder tells us that he’s spent a lot of time looking at financial  services technology, and Zong was one of his first investments in the  venture world. “It was clear to me at the time that we had space to  build something big here,” he explains. In the digital goods category,  carrier billed payments account for 50 percent of payment volume. It’s a  frictionless payments mechanism, he says, and this makes it ideal for  digital goods. For digital good providers, carrier billing provides the  highest conversions and Zong helps PayPal shore up this category.Last year, Zong was spun off from its European parent, Echovox, and Marcus  moved to the U.S. to run the fast growing company, which landed a  pretty big deal last year with Facebook to become a an early mobile  payment provider for Facebook Credits. Other partners include IMVU,  Sulake (makers of Habbo Hotel), Big Fish Games, Sony (NYSE:SNE) Online  Entertainment, Zynga, Playdom [owned by Disney (NYSE:DIS)], and Bigpoint. The  company also launched Zong+,  an extension of the mobile payment startup which lets users bill  microtransactions to credit, debit and prepaid cards (instead of their  phones).Marcus wrote in a post on the company’s site: I  am so excited by the unique combination of PayPal’s 8 million  merchants, brand power, risk management expertise, and financial  stability, with Zong’s Carrier DNA, its largest direct carrier payments  network, product innovation, and best-in-class carrier billing  technology. This industry first is going to allow us to scale what we’ve  built over the course of the past 3 years (and then some) in a massive  way!Zong faces competition from Boku, which was also rumored to be the target of an acquisition as well.eBay and PayPal have been on a bit of an acquisition spree,  so it’s not surprising that the e-commerce giant made another big buy.  PayPal is facing competition from fast growing startups like Square and  even Google, and the payments company needs to add compelling  technologies to help draw merchants, consumers and local businesses. As  we’ve seen in the past few months, PayPal acquired local payments and advertising company Where, and shelled out cash for mobile payments company Fig Card as well.Zong provides a seamless payments product that could help improve  conversions for online merchants and digital goods (PayPal processed  $3.4 billion in transactions for digital goods in 2010), and in the end,  frictionless online payments is PayPal’s bread and butter. In fact, PayPal just upped estimates  of the amount of mobile payments transactions using the technology this  year; doubling the estimate to $3 billion in mobile total payments  volume in 2011.PayPal’s CFO Patrick Dupuis tells us the acquisition is an expansion  of vision fo enabling commerce anytime anywhere, adding another payments  source for PayPal’s 9 million merchants. Marcus tells us that PayPal’s  ability to scale and accelerate with Zong’s built made it an appealing  new home.Another draw for PayPal — Zong has pretty massive international reach,  offering mobile payments in in 21 languages and 45 countries. The  service’s technology is especially appealing in countries where mobile  phone usage is high (as opposed to internet connectivity). Zong should  also help PayPal expand its footprint in developing countries.In terms of integration, PayPal and Zong arent’s saying much as to  how Zong will be branded in the future. Marcus says he will be staying  on at PayPal.Unsurprisingly, Dupuis says that Marcus and his team will have a  critical role in PayPal’s future transformation in the payments  business. Stalder echoes this sentiment, explaining that PayPal, with  Zong in hand, is in a better position to create the digital wallet of  the future."
276474,22762,2011-06-24T05:28:40-04:00,,"By Leena RaoPayPal is upping its estimates of the amount of mobile payments transactions using the technology this year; doubling the estimate to $3 billion in mobile total payments volume (TPV) in 2011.PayPal says that the rate at which people are using the payments technology to buy items via their mobile phones is growing rapidly and this is actually the third time the company has had to update its numbers. At years end in 2010, PayPal predicted $1.5 billion in mobile payments and in February, the company revised this to $2 billion.Last year, mobile payments were up 300 percent from the previous year, so PayPal could exceed the growth rate from 2010.PayPal is also seeing up to $10 million in mobile TPV a day, which is up from $6 million PayPal reported in March. The company currently has eight million customers who are regularly making purchases on their mobile phones, up from a previously reported six million users.Of course, PayPal is probably feeling heat from the competition. Notably, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) just unveiled its mobile payments system, Google Wallet. Square has been growing rapidly, and is tackling local, an area where PayPal has not had much success in. Who knows, Facebook may even throw its hat in the ring.But the fact remains that PayPal’s payments business is still widespread and growing. The mobile payments race will certainly be entertaining.Original post"
280151,24318,2011-07-19T09:49:37-04:00,,"Ebay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) recent acquisition of Zong has us finally interested in the name again. Ebay stock has been doing well this year but let’s be clear it hasn’t been the talk of the town in Silicon Valley for quite some time. Zong may be one of the firm’s most recent high profile acquisitions in 2011 but it’s actually the seventh this year! Other acquisition names have included GSI Commerce, Magento and Where. Now the flurry of acquisitions according to the firm has to do with “buying businesses and technology that can help it work with more merchants as commerce moves increasingly online.” So here comes the controversy “is Ebay on the offense or the defense” in relation to this transition in commerce. While Ebays’ recent string of acquisitions are interesting to say the least and have some offensive characteristics, we think that this recent activity comes from defensive origins but we’ll let you decide. Who or What is Zong?Zong is a name only a mother could love.  In the simplest context, Zong lets shoppers pay through their mobile phone account. When checking out online, a customer can now complete a transaction by entering his or her number. It's a Pretty novel idea given how it’s even more convenient and simple to pay for something online. The recent acquisition has allowed EBay to attain access to roughly 3.2 billion mobile users through relationships with more than 250 wireless carriers operating in 45 countries. In our opinion, those are huge numbers. At a minimum, EBay has acquired a firm with plenty of traction and potential but what needs to be seen now is how it contributes to the top and bottom line.What does this really do for Ebay? Zong should help the PayPal unit drive much deeper and faster into mobile commerce to see what the real potential is. Is this the next frontier in commerce, you ask? The potential is definitely there but the answer lies with the consumer. It really depends on whether consumers feel it’s even more convenient, trustworthy, and efficient than the current options available. With 100 million users of PayPal now able to pay and fund their account through their phone, EBay will get a definitive answer one way or another. At face value, this acquisition should be very accretive right off the bat for the firm and is definitely its newest X-Factor.Bull Camp:For Ebay bulls, Zong couldn’t have come at a better time. It just adds momentum and hype for the firm. With the firm’s stock already performing well, this could easily be the next catalyst the firm needs to break into highs for the year. As well, proponents of the stock are quick to point out that PayPal will effectively be able to dominate two of the five payment options available for online checkouts. When the CEO of Ebay was questioned about whether this acquisition was defensive or offensive in nature, his response was ""I think it's the other guys who are trying to compete with us."" Well that let’s you know where the CEO stands on the subject.Bears Camp:In some ways it tough to say Ebay isn’t playing some type of defense as it tries to take an offensive acquisition approach. Bearish investors probably have a hard time believing that any move in 2011 has been offensive given the fact that in May 2011 alone Sprint (NYSE:S), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) all started offering a mobile phone payment option. Yikes! Talk about competition cropping up this goes without saying. Given this reality its tough to downplay the bears point.To some degree we think even bulls can understand where the bears are coming. Still, PayPal CFO, Patrick Dupuis, denied that the acquisition of Zong had anything to do with recent increase in competition. Really? Nothing at all you say? It may be a great acquisition but to make such a strong statement sounds a little foolish. We hope they’re watching what their competition is up to one way or another because saying or implying that they're ""oblivious"" doesn't score them any brownie points with investors.Call to Action:Ebay looks pretty hot. With cash on hand and an X-Factor like Zong we think the firm has potential to go higher. The competitive landscape looks tough at first glance but we think a lot of new players are just dipping their toe to see if it’s easy money to be made or not. We question the commitment of some new players in the space. For investors looking to access the mobile commerce movement, this is the name to be in. If we had to take a definitive side on the debate, we would be bulls and say they firm is a BUY given that it seems the firm is regaining substantial steam. Ultimately though this is the decision of the investor and the only real question to ask is whether you fall into the bull or bear camp.Disclosure: I am long C."

270011,22762,2011-05-15T13:48:03-04:00,,"By Leena RaoIt’s no secret that eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has been heavily investing in a local commerce strategy. The central core of this is trying to capitalize on the $917 million online-to-offline buying market, which Forrester estimates will eventually reach $1.3 trillion and account for nearly 50% of total retail sales by 2013. Virtually every acquisition in the past year (besides the company’s $2.4 billion purchase of GSI Commerce) has been of a company that is dabbling in local payments or linking to merchants (Milo, RedLaser, Where, FigCard). If you look closely, a clear strategy is emerging that positions eBay at the center of mobile shopping, local commerce, and payments (through PayPal). Let’s connect the dots.Online-To-Offline and Comparison ShoppingeBay’s first foray into the local commerce arena was though the acquisition of barcode scanning mobile app RedLaser last June. RedLaser’s barcode scanning technology allows users to comparison shop on the go. Anyone can scan a barcode on an item at a store and then automatically access any eBay listings of the product on the marketplace. Sellers can also use the scanning technology to scan an item and list the product in very little time. RedLaser’s technology was quickly integrated into eBay’s dedicated iPhone and Android apps.The company then bought Milo for $75 million, which aggregates and lists real-time in-store product inventory for over 50,000 stores across the country; featuring over 3 million products from Target (NYSE:TGT), Macy’s (NYSE:M), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Crate & Barrel and more.Most recently eBay integrated Milo into a few of its core products, including RedLaser. So with a single scan of a product in a store, users can see which nearby retailers have a product in store, and at what price. eBay also integrated Milo’s results into its own marketplace, allowing users to include local shopping tab in search results to check a product’s local, or in-store, availability directly from the eBay search results page.But surfacing local product results and integrating barcode scanning only scratches the surface of local and mobile commerce and its potential. There’s no doubt that eBay is reaping the benefits of mobile commerce (the company expects to do $4 billion in mobile gross merchandise volume in 2011).Local PaymentsAnd eBay realizes that in order to really capitalize on local and mobile in the ecommerce experience, the company also has to be a part of the point of sale for local merchants. And eBay has a player in this race—payments giant PayPal. PayPal has been making its own small forays into local commerce and late last year launched a new version of its popular iPhone app that allows users to find businesses near their immediate location that accept PayPal as a form of payment. The feature rolled out in San Francisco initially, but we haven’t heard much about the initiative since last November.Why? Well, scaling this feature broadly to other cities is a challenge for even a large company like PayPal. Not only do they have to find the local businesses, but PayPal has to teach them how to use their mobile apps as a payment mechanism. Wouldn’t it be much easier to acquire a company that could help PayPal and eBay do this?Enter Where, a geo-location service and mobile advertising company that already has millions of active users across many mobile platforms. The apps show local listings for restaurants, bars, merchants, and events, and also suggests places and deals for you based on your location and past behavior. Where also offers a location-based ad network, which allows advertisers to show their mobile ads only to people near their store, or perhaps near a competitor’s store (after the user opts in to see these types of ads). Currently, more than 120,000 retailers, brands and small merchants use Where’s network daily to reach new audiences and deliver real-time foot traffic to their doorstep.eBay of course acquired Where a few weeks ago, and housed the company within PayPal. Not only does this give PayPal much more of a reach with its payments service, but it gives eBay a platform to to enter into the the local deals market. As Where’s CEO Walt Doyle told us after the acquisition, “eBay is about connecting buyers and sellers and Where is about connecting people with places.” Ebay can now tap into connecting consumers with local businesses and can be a part of the transaction with PayPal.PayPal also just bought mobile payments startup FigCard,  a Boston-based startup that allows merchants to accept mobile payments in stores by using a simple USB device that plugs into the cash register or point-of-sale terminal. All the consumer needs is the Fig app on his or her smart phone. The connection with PayPal is that when consumers setup their payment information, they could add PayPal as a payments option and pay for goods via their mobile phone.Eliminating the need for an actual wallet has always been a goal for PayPal, and if the company can scale FigCard’s technology (perhaps to many of those merchants using Where?); PayPal could have a stake in the mobile wallet race.The ‘Pivot’In the past year, it’s fair to say that eBay and PayPal have spent over $200 million on the acquisitions I mentioned above. That’s a fair chunk of change even for a company that is making billions each year.There’s no doubt that eBay is invested heavily in this strategy and believes that the future of the company is based on both online to offline purchases, local and mobile commerce. eBay VP of engineering Dane Glasgow recently told us that one of the challenges for eBay in this strategy is being on the pulse of technology, which is constantly evolving.But as retail evolves, eBay is shifting its business as well, and it will undoubtedly be interesting to see if the company can connect the dots with all these acquisitions and technologies to create a powerhouse in mobile and local commerce. The challenge is that some of these initiatives aren’t really that complimentary to eBay’s core marketplace and auction business.While eBay won’t be quitting the auction business anytimesoon, the marketplace business itself isn’t growing as fast as PayPal. PayPal now represents 39 percent of eBay’s total revenue, and nearly made $1 billion in revenue for the company in the first quarter of 2011, up 23 percent from the same quarter in the previous year. Marketplaces brought in $1.5 billion, up 12 percent from the same quarter in 2010.Pivot is a word that tends to be over-used in the tech world, but in eBay’s case that is exactly what we are witnessing—a major pivot in the company’s business model to local commerce. It’s certainly not easy for any company to “pivot,” especially one as massive as eBay. If it manages to pull this off so late in the game, it could herald a whole new era of growth for the company.As Glasgow tells us, “it’s a new retail environment, where the convergence of online and offline are coming to life through mobile and local experiences.” Can eBay position itself fast enough to flourish in that environment?Original post"
273038,23479,2011-06-02T12:25:05-04:00,,"As car and truck purchases over the original eBay mobile apps increased to 2,000 cars and 90,000 parts per week in Q1 2011, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) decided to launch a dedicated eBay motors app to target this burgeoning market. [1] We believe that the high value of autos and auto-parts along with healthy expected growth in U.S. auto market will help the eBay motors app to grow sales further. This momentum could provide significant upside to eBay's stock price. eBay competes with other e-commerce sites like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Overstock (NASDAQ:OSTK), and Blue Nile (NASDAQ:NILE)eBay Marketplaces constitutes around 45% of our $32.74 price estimate for eBay's stock. Our number currently implies a premium to market price.Auto Purchase Via Mobile Device is a Growing TrendThe trend of purchasing autos and auto-parts through mobile devices is on a steep upward slope. eBay reported that globally, in Q1 2011, total vehicle sales transacted via mobile devices increased 160% year-on-year and total number of parts and accessories sold increased nearly 250% year-on-year. In Q1 2011 users purchased 2,000 cars and 90,000 parts and accessories per week via the original eBay mobile app. During the same period, the value of the 5 most expensive vehicles sold over smartphone ranged from $152,000 to $369,000. The increased value of autos and auto-parts will increase the average selling price of merchandise on eBay, which was about $65 in 2010.(Chart created by using Trefis' app)Solid Growth in U.S. Vehicle SalesThe U.S. auto industry has recovered from the downturn in 2008 and 2009. U.S. vehicle sales totaled about 12 million in 2010, up 11% from 2009. [2] In Q1 2011, U.S. vehicle sales increased by around 20% year-on-year. [3] Growing industry demand should support an increased number of listings of autos and auto-parts on eBay.(Chart created by using Trefis' app)Improved Customer ExperienceThe new eBay motors app should ease the process of searching for auto parts and be a significant upgrade to the customer experience. Customers will be able to scan a car's vehicle identification number and easily search parts and accessories that fit these cars. This will not only help the adoption of this app but also drive improvement in the listings-to-sales conversion rate on eBay.(Chart created by using Trefis' app)Potential 17% Upside to Our Stock Price EstimateIn the scenario where average selling price of merchandise increases by 4% ever year, number of listings on eBay grows by 8% every year and listings-to-sales conversion rate improves by 3% in 2011 and by 0.5% thereafter, implied stock value of eBay would be about $38.40. This implies more than 17% upside to eBay's stock value from our base case $32.74 price estimate.You can drag the trend lines in the modifiable charts above to see the impact of these trends on eBay's stock value.Notes:Disclosure: No position"
276848,22762,2011-06-27T16:35:10-04:00,,"By Leena RaoPayPal has hit 100 million active users. The company confirmed the milestone today. Last week, the company announced that it was upping estimates of the amount of mobile payments transactions using the technology this year; doubling the estimate to $3 billion in mobile total payments volume (TPV) in 2011.At the end of last year, PayPal, which is owned by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), had around 94.4 million active users, and has been adding approximately one million active accounts per month. It’s unclear, however, what PayPal considers as an ‘active user.’PayPal now represents 39 percent of eBay’s total revenue, and nearly made $1 billion in revenue for the company in the first quarter of 2011, up 23 percent from the same quarter in the previous yearIn terms of mobile, PayPal is also seeing up to $10 million in mobile TPV a day, which is up from $6 million PayPal reported in March. The company currently has eight million customers who are regularly making purchases on their mobile phones, up from a previously reported six million users.2011 should continue to be a big year for PayPal, as it becomes a central part of eBay’s local commerce strategy. And PayPal now faces competition from Google’s mobile payments system, Google Wallet, Square  and maybe even Facebook.Original post"
266238,21439,2011-04-28T12:19:02-04:00,,"Today, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) announced their Q1 2011 results.  The  results were pretty much in-line with what Wall St. was looking for, but  as usual had some interesting aspects of the results from a seller's  perspective.  The highlight was that US GMV shot up to 10% y/y growth,  which is very interesting and something we'll dig into.In this post we'll first take a quick run through the PayPal and  Mobile highlights and then spend the bulk of the time on the core  marketplace business.  We'll conclude with some other observations and a  view of the growth rates of e-commerce, eBay and Amazon.Mobile and PaypalHere are a couple of highlights relevant to sellers on the Mobile and Paypal topics:MarketplacesOverall eBay revenue was up 16% (14% organic), with marketplaces  coming in at 11%.  Within marketplaces the GMV growth rates were:When looking at the US, eBay's GMV growth rate came pretty much  in-line with e-commerce for the first time in years which was one of  Donahoe's goals when he took over the business.You can see them closing the gap in this graph:  The  US 10% number was definitely an acceleration and great to see.  eBay  attributed the growth to increased ASPs due to some search cleanup of  low-ASP items.  They also (couldn't tell if they were joking or  serious?) mentioned gold bars and ipad2s were big growers. This is an  important number and we'll dig into it in the category data.A couple of interior numbers behind GMV were lower than usual which supports the 'move to high ASP' theory:If your GMV grows 10% and sold items grow at 6.5%, then you have to  make up that other 4% in an ASP increase.  ASP increases on eBay don't  mean that people are paying more for the same item, but are more mix  related - e.g. if you sell more B+I items ($1k ASP) vs. cell phone  accessories ($5 ASP), your overall ASP will move north.Another way to slice eBay is to look at the different formats:Finally one of the most interesting sets of data I dig into each Q is  the category details.  I like to look at the data first by overall size  (large to small) and then by y/y growth rates.  Note that these are  global numbers.  At our recent Catalyst event, many attendees gave me  feedback that they appreciate us spending time on category analysis as  they can't find it anywhere else, so I'm going to dive into this deeper  than in past quarterly summary blog posts with the hopes it gives you  more insights into what's going on.eBay categories by size  eBay categories by growth rate  eBay category analysisIf you take eBay's overall growth rate of 10%, you can put categories  into a bucket above that line (fast growers or leaders) and below  (laggards)Some of these warrant some deeper look as they tell the story behind what's going on inside eBay's portfolio of businesses:This chart shows how BI has really been accelerating in the last 6  months.  I'll try and dig into this a little more when time allows, if  anyone has any thoughts, would love to hear them in comments.   Comparing growth rates - e-commerce, eBay and AmazonWhen compared to expectations and historical growth rates and even  e-commerce growth rates, this was definitely a great quarter for eBay -  they closed the gap on growth with e-commerce which is great to see.However, the e-commerce elephant in the room is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and their Q1 (details at  sister site Amazon Strategies) had 38% growth overall with EGM globally  (where the bulk of the Amazon/eBay category and marketplace overlap  exists) significantly higher than that.This chart shows the relative domestic growth rates and illustrates  that eBay needs to continue to close the gap, not only with e-commerce  growth, but Amazon to avoid losing significant share over the  longer-term.ConclusionTo be 100% clear - we continue to recommend to sellers/retailers that  they leverage both eBay and Amazon. Even though it's growing much  slower, globally, eBay is 5-6X the size of Amazon's marketplace and  represents a growth opportunity a) if you are not selling there as you  are missing a big chunk of e-commerce and b) most of our customers  on-eBay are outpacing eBay's macro growth rates by taking internal  share.  eBay has 19 categories with > $1b annual sales - every  retailer needs to have eBay as part of their mix.That being said, we feel it's important to understand the underlying  trends of all of these businesses, be they positive or negative because  it makes us smarter online retailers and helps us achieve those higher  growth rates.As always, I'm interested in hearing what everyone else thinks about eBay's Q in comments.Disclosure: I am long Amazon and Google. eBay is an investor in ChannelAdvisor where I am CEO."

264493,22762,2011-04-20T13:11:44-04:00,,"By Leena RaoeBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has acquired location-based media company Where.com, the ecommerce giant tells us. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed and the acquisition is expected to close during the second quarter of 2011.Where, which has raised nearly $20 million in funding, builds location-based mobile apps across every major mobile device platform—including Android, iPhone, and Blackberry—and boasts about 4 million active users a month. The apps show local listings for restaurants, bars, merchants, and events, and also suggests places and deals for you based on your location and past behavior. Last year, Where acquired daily deals site Local Ginger, which is now WhereBuys. Where also offers a location-based ad network, which allow advertisers to show their mobile ads only to people near their store, or perhaps near a competitor’s store (after the user opts in to see these types of ads). Currently, more than 120,000 retailers, brands and small merchants use Where’s network daily to reach new audiences and deliver real-time foot traffic to their doorstep.The company will report to the PayPal business unit. PayPal spokesperson Anuj Nayar tells us that the reasoning behind acquiring Where focused on the Boston-based company’s talent, IP and technology. “Ebay and PayPal are both investing in multi-channel commerce and the online to offline experience,” he explains, “this acquisition represents that.”Where will continue to operate independently but eBay and PayPal are both looking for ways to sync the technologies. PayPal will be integrated into Where’s mobile app as a payments mechanism for its local deals, says Nayar.It’s not a surprising buy for eBay considering its massive push into local commerce and online to offline shopping. The company bought Milo and quickly added its local product results to its mobile apps and search. And eBay bought barcode scanning app RedLaser to add the ability to scan products at a store via its mobile apps and look up results on eBay properties.What’s interesting about the deal with Where is that the company reports into PayPal, which signifies the payments unit’s push into local and location-based payments as well. Where was also granted an important patent late last year relating to geofencing,  which covers 31 claims ranging from sending an alert to offering a coupon when somebody crosses a geofence with a mobile device. Where had a number of ways it was planning to incorporate geofencing, but it’s interesting to see eBay and PayPal invest so heavily in a location-based service.Clearly, eBay is moving into the direction of serving geo-targeted ads and offers. With Paypal, they will have the ability to close the loop and purchase items as well. Theoretically, eBay can now track mobile ads from impressions to purchase. That’s pretty powerful considering the massive market size of both mobile advertising and mobile e-commerce.Original post"
252550,22521,2011-02-13T11:57:37-05:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) hosted an Analyst Day (seen here) last week to present an update on progress and provide new, aggressive, financial targets, almost two years after it presented goals to analysts at the 2009 analyst day. The tone of the meeting was upbeat and the shares increased over 7% during the presentation on promises to stabilize the ailing marketplace business and robust financial forecasts for the PayPal unit. In fact, eBay expects 20% growth for PayPal and high single to low double digit growth rates for the marketplace segment.The financial targets provided for 2013 at Analyst Day:PayPal continues to be the key focus of management's attention and the unit continues to work driven by the merchant services business. The unit has proven to be the best acquisition eBay has made and it gets us thinking that management should rename the company eBay PayPal. PayPal has done an effective job at leveraging its more than nine-million merchants and over 90 million active accounts, which are expected to grow to 130 million by 2013, increasing its penetration on eBay, adding merchants, integrating Bill Me Later, and expanding internationally, while warding off competitive threats, to-date.Despite widely-speculated competitive threats from upcoming payment systems from Facebook as well as from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and a regulatory overhang, management believes that PayPal's revenues could double by 2013. That growth will be powered by international growth, increasing eBay penetration to 75% from 69% today; new initiatives with credit growing revenues in the 40% range; and merchant coverage market share increasing to upwards of 24% from 18% today.For the struggling Merchant-Services segment, which has undergone a bevy of changes over the past few years in a futile attempt to reinvigorate growth, management believes it can stabilize the auction business and grow fixed price and classifieds. On the core eBay platform, management expects to increase GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) to $75B from $60B today, driven by fixed price listings growth in the double digits, and stabilizing the auction business. Revenues from Marketplace are expected to grow at a high single digit CAGR (compound annual growth rate) through 2013, with help from the classifieds business, which is expected to grow in the mid-teens. Despite this aggressive growth, management expects margins to remain flat at the midpoint of 38% to 42%, from 40% today, due to increased marketing spend to support this growth.From a valuation perspective, shares should trade to the downside. Using the 10%-14% non-GAAP EPS CAGR provided by the company as the multiple range to use to value the business, we arrive at a share price of $22 to $30 (Editor: shares closed Friday at $34.51). This is based on the 2012 consensus pro-forma EPS estimate of $2.15, implying a 13% to 38% downside from current share prices. We believe that the shares should trade at a price-to-earnings-growth (PEG) of 1.0x due to the challenging marketplace business, which continues to underperform overall ecommerce, and faces steep competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). As an example, ChannelAdvisor's January same-store sales figures for January showed growth of 85% for Amazon versus 6% from eBay.The strength at PayPal is encouraging, but the Marketplace business continues to account for a majority of the profits of the company, and will continue to do so in 2013, per our estimates. As such, we cannot justify multiple-to-growth scenarios that are above the current growth forecast by the company. A sum-of-the-parts valuation could argue for a share price roughly near the current price depending on how aggressive we want to get with our PayPal multiple. However, despite PayPal being a great growth business, we are loath to buy the shares solely for PayPal. With all that said, we applaud management for pursuing a strategy that at the minimum has halted the slide in the company's structurally challenged core business. Give some credit where credit is due.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
265463,21445,2011-04-26T10:54:37-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is expected to report Q1 earnings after the market close on Wednesday, April 27 with a conference call scheduled for 5 pm ET. Analysts are looking for EPS of 46c on revenue of $2.48B. The consensus range is 44c-49c for EPS, and $2.44B-$2.52B for revenue, according to First Call. In January, eBay guided Q1 EPS 44c-46c on revenue $2.4B-$2.5B . For FY11 EPS it sees $1.90-$1.95 vs. consensus $1.94, on revenue $10.3B-$10.6B vs. consensus $10.48B. In February, eBay guided FY13 revenue $13B-$15B compared to $9.2B in FY10, and compound annual EPS growth 10%-14%. The company said it expects the growth in the three-year period to be driven by continued strong global momentum at PayPal, sustainable growth at eBay, and a doubling of mobile gross merchandise volume to $4B in FY11. During the quarter, eBay announced the acquisition of GSI Commerce (GSIC) for $29.25 per share in cash, or about $2.4. eBay said it expects that the acquisition will be immaterial to 2011 non-GAAP EPS guidance. Additionally, eBay acquired WHERE, a company that helps mobile phone users get information on local businesses. As for quarterly results, Caris views eBay's changes to Marketplace as an incremental positive as the change may help eBay increase GMV per listing and realize better effective take rate. ThinkEquity believes eBay will report higher than expected Q1 EPS. Analysts and investors will listen for comments on growth at PayPal and Marketplace, as well as an update on the use of eBay.com and PayPal on mobile devices."
252535,20468,2011-02-13T10:01:41-05:00,,"For a company with more $2.3 billion in annual earnings and $9.1 billion in revenue, it has been shockingly fashionable to write off eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). The common refrain: eBay is losing marketplace share. It’s so Web 1.0. And eBay can’t hang with Amazon.However, eBay has quietly been turning around a few analysts on Wall Street and its powwow Wednesday won a few over. Simply put, eBay has some heady goals between now and 2013. Here’s the bottom line outlook:How will eBay get to that revenue goal? PayPal will carry the company.But eBay CEO John Donahoe’s vision goes beyond riding PayPal’s coattails. In a chat with analysts, Donahoe said eBay can be a bridge between offline and online commerce. He wants to ditch the “e” in e-commerce. The argument in a nutshell looks like this:Mobile apps are bringing coupons, checkout, payments and price comparisons to brick and mortar retailers. EBay has some early leadership in mobile apps and has bought companies like Milo, an early shopping tool, and Brands4Friends, a German social shopping site.eBay’s mobile apps are backed by PayPal.The company aims to sit in the middle of the transaction and shopping experience as it connects buyers, sellers and developers.If that plan works out, eBay’s addressable market balloons.The big question here is whether folks will buy eBay’s master plan. Barclays analyst Douglas Anmuth writes:Others aren’t so sure. The skeptics note that eBay’s marketplace business is likely to continue to lose share. In other words, eBay hasn’t quite turned the corner. Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster writes:Ultimately shoppers will decide eBay’s fate, but Donahoe was convincing in putting a new spin on the auction leader.Original post"
248751,23142,2011-01-26T12:31:51-05:00,,"Early in my career I studied the investment philosophy of the most successful and admired investors like John Templeton and Peter Lynch. Both men had great long-term track records in portfolio management. John Templeton’s concept of buying common stocks at the “point of maximum pessimism” usually marks the only time you can buy a superior publicly traded business at a deeply discounted price. From Peter Lynch we got the common sense idea of observing what is going on around us to look for ideas. I’m fond of taking pictures of the lines at Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) or noticing three days before Christmas that Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) had sold out of Gucci “Guilty."" Owning a company that meets our proprietary eight criteria and holding it for many years was also an idea Peter Lynch popularized. Doing so requires something about the company which stops it from gaining maniacal popularity, one of our sell criteria. We’d like to explain how Ebay (NASDAQ:EBAY) fits Peter Lynch’s two ideas.Internet commerce is in its early years, but any alert business person can see that there is mass adoption of PayPal. They currently have a 15% market share of internet transactions. Last year, our marketing director, Cole, commented that American Airlines (NASDAQ:AMR) has the fact that they accept PayPal on the back of their boarding pass. I used my I-phone Starbucks app yesterday to pay for my iced tea and many folks refill their Starbucks card with PayPal. The growth in PayPal probably keeps the top executives of Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) awake at night. Numerous other parts of Ebay’s stable of companies are seeing very fast growth and could be observed by Mr. Lynch.To understand why Ebay won’t get a maniacal stock price, you have to understand its original business. Ebay Marketplace is the New York Stock Exchange of pre-owned goods. It also is a home for numerous “power sellers” of new and refurbished goods. It is a retailing entity which pays no rent and carries zero inventories. It is like the NYSE in that they really don’t care what the hot selling item is, as long as someone has a hot selling item on their system. This business produces massive free cash flow, but is a niche business and is probably not in a position to dominate Internet retail sales growth and market share, in our opinion.Ebay reported earnings on January 20, 2011, and pleasantly surprised the Wall Street analyst community. However, numerous analysts and news reports framed the earnings release in a very negative light even though operating earnings grew 24%. They say that since Internet retail sales grew by 12% in 2010’s fourth quarter, Ebay is somewhat of a failure by only growing gross merchandise value (GMV) by 6%. I don’t remember folks criticizing Berkshire Hathaway for the slow growth in its insurance businesses, which provided Warren Buffett the float to invest in other businesses and stocks like Coca Cola (NYSE:KO), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Burlington Northern (BNI) and Gillette.One of the stocks that Peter Lynch invested in to build his successful track record at the Fidelity Magellan Fund was Phillip Morris (NYSE:PM). It was the largest tobacco company in the U.S. and was using its massive free cash flow to become a major player in the food business in the 1980s and early 1990s. No matter how well the earnings, cash flow and dividends grew, the stock never got an inflated price-to-earnings ratio (PE). Philip Morris was being sued by the families of smokers. Who wants to own shares in a company which is getting sued constantly? It stayed reasonable for decades and made its common stock owners wealthy in the process. From 1972 to 2001 it produced a 17.8% average annual gain for its common stock holders who stayed for the entire 30-year stretch.Ebay has about $5 per share in cash and is expected to have operating earnings of $1.90-1.95 this year. When you back the cash out of today’s price of around $30 per share, you get $25 per share. This means that a company (PayPal), which is growing at 20% per year in sales and could be one of the most exciting businesses in the world is hiding inside a company with a 13 PE multiple.

We saw some UK SSS slowdown in March, but nothing alarming.   Large  brands continue to be attracted to eBay.  However, not all successful.

The growth is a reflection of eBay’s concerted efforts to integrate   PayPal into its “Marketplaces” segment and forge strategic relationships   with a diversified group of leading online commerce portals like Blue   Nile. We anticipate that PayPal will continue to see double digit  growth in the number of accounts on its platform.(Chart created by using Trefis' app)In line with its customer account growth, PayPal is witnessing  corresponding growth in its total payment volumes (TPV). eBay actually  contributes a hefty proportion of PayPal’s TPV (40% as of 2009), and  this is likely to increase as eBay further integrates PayPal into its  adjacent marketplace platforms like Shopping.com and Rent.com.

The biggest datapoint we  follow is GMV growth.  As reported earlier,  we saw eBay Same Store Sales at 3.8%. While we use SSS for customer  benchmarking, it's not a great proxy for what a marketplace like eBay  did 'all in' - they could have had a ton of new sellers in the year not  covered in SSS or a ton of seller defections.  Our all-in eBay number is  a good bit larger than that reflecting a lot of larger brands coming  onto the site and we know a lot of smaller sellers are leaving.To put it in context, Wall St is looking at US GMV growth of around  2% and non-domestic around 10% - anything above those will be viewed  very positively.In addition to GMV growth, we also track:Mobile UpdateeBay already stated that 2010 saw ~$2b in mobile GMV.  With the  RedLaser and Milo acquisitions and PayPal efforts it will be interesting  to see what's going on here and if they remain bullish on the sector.PayPal items of interestWe always keep an eye on the Paypal growth rates both on and off eBay  as well as TPV trends.  Also there's a lot of talk about Near Field  Payments coming to Android and iPhone that could be an opportunity and  threat to Paypal. Finally, there's some Durbin banking legislation that I'm hearing a  lot about that could reduce PayPal's ACH costs and be a positive to the  bottom line. It will be interesting to learn more about that.2011 GuidanceQ4 has been in our rear-view windows for a while now, it will be  probably most important to see eBay's posture for the PayPal and  Marketplace businesses heading into 2011.Stay tuned, later tonight we'll pull out all of these highlights and anything else of interest after we listen to the call.Disclosure: I am long Amazon and Google. eBay is an investor in ChannelAdvisor where I am CEO."

In the U.S., the top five categories ranked by the number of items sold through eBay’s mobile apps for the year were: clothing shoes & accessories; cell phones & PDAs; collectibles; jewelry & watches; and toys & hobbies.In terms of gadgets, the consumer electronics category saw its peak in mobile sales after the release of the iPad and iPhone 4.

A buyer does not have to reenter shipping, billing, or payment information for a PayPal payment, expediting the checkout process. All they need to do is enter their PayPal account login. It’s similar in theory to Amazon’s one click ordering option. And PayPal recently incorporated this for mobile payments as well. Today, PayPal is releasing an Ipsos Public Affairs reports that shows that incorporating the seamless payment offering has helped online merchants increase sales.According to the report, eight in ten (83 percent) of PayPal merchants surveyed say Sales have increased since offering Express Checkout. Among online merchants who are able to track their revenue, sales have increased an average of 18 percent since adding the Express Checkout service. Eight in ten (84 percent) of those who noticed an increase in sales say it happened within the first 3 months after offering PayPal. Others say it took four to six months (8 percent) or longer (8 percent) before they noticed an increase in sales.Since offering PayPal, merchants claim that 22 percent of their total revenue comes from PayPal’s Express Checkout. And 25 percent of revenue coming from new customers is channeled through PayPal’s Express Checkout.It’s important to note that this report is anecdotal and is by no means indicative of the sentiments and sales of all online merchants. But it does highlight an important trend: a seamless payments experience, whether it be online or via a mobile device, is a contributing factor to an increase in sales. PayPal has been working to offer additional seamless payment options, including a Digital Goods product. PayPal isn’t the only company to start making transactions easier for consumers and merchants. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) launched its own Google Checkout-powered digital goods payment option recently. And we know NFC technologies on mobile phones are picking up steam.Original post"

We estimate that eBay Marketplaces accounts for almost half of eBay’s  stock value while PayPal contributes about 20%.We currently have a Trefis price estimate of $31.33 for eBay’s stock, about 2% above the current market price of $30.60.Higher PayPal TPV on Ebay Marketplaces and Third Party PlatformsPayPal increased its Total Payment Volume (TPV) from eBay’s marketplaces from $24 billion in 2006 to around $31 billion in 2009. [1]  We expect the TPV from eBay marketplaces will rise as eBay continues to  integrate PayPal into its adjacent  marketplaces platforms like  Shopping.com and Rent.com.PayPal’s TPV penetration of third party merchants is also increasing  steadily.

239523,22762,2010-12-01T12:16:04-05:00,,"By Leena Rao There’s no question that mobile sales are rapidly growing from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), who saw sales in the U.S. from its suite of mobile apps nearly double on Black Friday. Today, eBay is releasing its Cyber Monday data, reporting that mobile sales for the Monday after Thanksgiving were up 146 percent. In conjunction with the announcement eBay is also releasing a new infographic application that provides a visualization of mobile shopping trends from Nov. 22 to Nov. 29 within the top 20 eBay product categories across the United States, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia (the application isn’t live yet).eBay also reported that consumer adoption of its mobile suite of apps increased more than threefold based on items purchased during the week of Thanksgiving and “Cyber Monday” compared to the same period in 2009. Consumers shopped on eBay’s mobile apps primarily for cars & trucks and clothing & accessories during the period.Mobile data also shows that, unsurprisingly, the iPhone was the leading mobile device on eBay this year, in terms of sales, with two-thirds of its mobile revenue from the holiday week coming from iPhone users. The other third was comprised of Android, BlackBerry and mobile web users combined, as well as Windows Phone 7 users. eBay’s primary iPhone app is by far its most popular mobile offering and has seen over 13 million downloads.In the U.S., cars & trucks topped the list of products purchased by mobile phones, and cell phone & PDA accessories and women’s clothing led in terms of total number of transactions. During November 22 through November 29, the most money was spent using mobile phones in California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Pennsylvania. California was the most active state in both sales volume and number of transactions.In terms of international mobile trends for the period, cars and trucks led in mobile sales in all of eBay’s top markets except for France. French mobile shoppers focused their purchasing mostly on clothing & accessories and toys. The U.K. was by far the strongest in purchases of cars & trucks, which made up 20 percent of mobile sales, while Germany was the only country in which the consumer electronics category appeared in the top five.The mobile commerce visualization is actually pretty cool. The application features a playable heat map of sales by geography over the period, and allows you to compare sales by category and location, and will show you what’s hot in terms of products by location and date. eBay actually launched a similar application last year for web sales.Another compelling data point: according to an eBay survey, over half the people who shop regularly on their phones are comfortable spending over $100 on a purchase, with 14 percent willing to spend over a thousand dollars (eBay notes that earlier this year an eBay shopper purchased a Mercedes-Benz for $240,000 using their mobile phone). On the average, mobile shoppers spend over $100 per month.It looks like the holiday season is treating eBay well this year. eBay has already adjusted its previous forecasts of a total of $1.5 billion in mobile sales for 2010, to report that consumers will spend over $1.5 billion in mobile sales. Of course Black Friday and Cyber Monday tend to be the peak days for holiday shopping, but it should be interesting to see if the company can generate the same sort of growth in sales over the next month.Original post"
243680,22675,2010-12-27T09:41:33-05:00,,"With the holidays around the corner, we decided to do a mini series about a few of the tech stocks that we follow all year long. We are the first ones to judge and criticize how these companies are run but as they say, it’s always much easier to criticize then actually run a company. So we decided to go ahead and write a series about what we would do with these companies.Since the arrival of John Donahoe, I think eBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) general direction has been much better than in past years. One of the key challenges for eBay is that it aims to be at the center of e-commerce but it’s not quite clear where that center is. The sales are booming but it is also changing very fast. A few years ago, auctions were the driving way to buy goods online but that evolved towards listings. Through Ebay and investments in Kijjiji and Craigslist, Ebay has generally been well positioned for all of these trends. It is now working very hard to be well positioned in the booming mobile segment.The one thing that has impressed me most about John Donahoe, however, is that Paypal seems to finally be getting the attention that it deserves inside eBay. You might say he has no choice to do so after its continued growth. In fact, I’ve been very public about the fact that I’ve been valuing eBay as a bank rather than as the ecommerce company that it once was exclusively.Be at center of online transactions for both e-commerce and services alike through innovative and customer friendly services.B2B: Business to Business is a growing part of what is happening on the internet and it’s fair to say that it will be a big part of the future. eBay needs to take a central role in those transactions and one great way to do that would be buying Alibaba from Yahoo (YHOO). Alibaba is a leading B2B player and is quickly expanding beyond its Chinese origins.Craigslist: eBay is part owner and in my opinion it’s time to complete the acquisition. Craigslist has proved it was a player for the long term and eBay’s power could certainly help it keep that place. For profitability purposes, I would slowly start integrating more “premium listings”. Like Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) adwords, however, these listings would be clicks-based and only appear when they prove relevant to users.Coupons: Internet e-commerce used to be mainly done through auctions and then moved to classified websites such as Craigslist. That is now moving to a new center as coupon websites such as Groupon are gaining a lot of traction and websites. eBay needs to get involved here as quickly as possible. It would be a good fit to buy Groupon although the leading coupon player is quickly becoming a very expensive buy. Otherwise, smaller players like Coupons.com might still be possible to get. eBay must act quickly before it gets too light.Change its mentality: eBay, Craigslist, Stubhub, etc. These are all niche players that answer to a specific consumer need. I think it’s important for Ebay to be more proactive in these markets. For example, when coupons started being a trend over a year ago, eBay should have acted then. It would have been much cheaper one year ago to make a major acquisition or start a product of its own. But as eBay takes time to answer, it becomes much more expensive to get into the game.Develop a ticketmaster alternative: Ticketmaster (TKTM) is a dominant player in the ticket industry and has been charging very high fees because of its dominance. Recently, it has even started competing with eBay in the resell of tickets. I think Ebay is one of the companies that could develop a solid Ticketmaster competition. It is about creating a robust, flexible and innovative solution that helps merchants maximize their revenues while diminishing the fees to event holders. Because of the low competition, the margins available right now are very high.Use Paypal as a hub to offer expanded loans, credit cards: Paypal has made it easy for consumers to exchange money between their Paypal account and their eBay account. It could slowly start offering more financial products to these users starting with credit.Diminish fees charges to Paypal users: Being profitable is important but remaining the leading player for e-commerce transactions is even more so and one of the only complaints about Paypal are the high fees. I think that Paypal should aim to slowly diminish these fees in order to make it much more difficult for competitors to enter the market. Instead, focus on offering expanded services to make up and even increase revenues per user.Disclosure: Long eBay"

Mobile shopping is expected to be huge this year and tt should be interesting to see if eBay and PayPal can sustain the mobile sales today on Cyber Monday and throughout the holiday season.Of course for total retail sales, eBay lost out to Amazon, Walmart and Target who all took the top spors for online retail sales for Black Friday.Original post"

And as more consumers look to their mobile phones as a way to search and shop for products, eBay is gaining more traffic to its apps. eBay’s primary iPhone app has seen over 13 million downloads, and its suite of apps have been downloaded 30 million times.It’s good news for eBay that sales have continued to increase from Cyber Monday and Black Friday, which tend to be peak days for many retailers. The e-commerce giant adjusted its forecasts for the year following the Thanksgiving holiday, stating that it will see over $1.5 billion in mobile sales through its marketplace.Original post"
233614,22762,2010-10-31T10:14:16-04:00,,"By Leena RaoIn conjunction with the company’s developer conference, PayPal announced a slew of news and product releases this week, including a new micropayments product and an apps platform for businesses. But tucked away in a release was another piece of news from PayPal that could be huge. PayPal just released a new version of its popular iPhone app that allows users to find businesses near their immediate location that accept PayPal as a form of payment. Launching in San Francisco initially, the feature encourages merchants to attract nearby customers to their stores by posting deals and promotions to the app as an incentive for customers to visit their businesses.Customers can search by category and location, and find and select stores, services, or special offers. Users can pick up the goods or services in person, but pay the merchant using their PayPal app. Users can also use tags from Bling Nation, a startup that has partnered with PayPal to use the startup’s mobile payment chips to deduct funds from a PayPal account.One of the big selling points around using PayPal for merchants is the ability to offer deals as an incentive to drive buyers to a store or restaurant. Whether it be Groupon-like daily deals or just ordinary coupons, there’s no doubt that deals do help drive online to offline sales.PayPal President Scott Thompson tells TechCrunch (see video below) that eventually this local feature will have “ubiquity,” meaning you’ll be able to access these merchant listings and pay with PayPal wherever you are in the world. Local is one of the key parts of PayPal’s future strategy, says Thompson. He’s confident that has the world becomes more connected, eventually all local merchants will accept PayPal as a payments option for in-store purchases.For PayPal, local payments certainly makes sense. Online to offline sales is a big part of local commerce, and if PayPal can become a payments mechanism in the local market, it could be pay off in revenue for the company.One competitor worth noting in the local payments space is Google Checkout. While Google Checkout doesn’t have as extensive of a reach as PayPal, Google Checkout has an ace in the hole when it comes to Google Places. Google Places allows local businesses to claim and edit a page, post realtime updates (eg, “happy hour tonight”), post reviews, create a custom QR code, and even offer coupons. And Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) indexes and highlights these pages in search results, most recently launching a more integrated placement of Places page within Google search.Google could easily turn on a transaction (such as a daily deal) for these merchants, and use Google Checkout as the payments mechanism. The same experience could extend to mobile phones.The advantage Google has over PayPal is that with Places, these relationships with local merchants are already built into the search giants business. At last count a few months ago, Google had Places pages in place for over 4 million businesses but I’m sure this number is higher. PayPal on the other hand will have to forge new relationships with all these local businesses to get them on board with their payments platform. Not only do they have to find the businesses, but PayPal has to teach them how to use their mobile apps as a payment mechanism. Scaling PayPal’s local feature will be a huge endeavor for the company, which is why PayPal is testing the feature out in a limited market in the San Francisco.This why it makes sense for PayPal to form partnerships on its local endeavor. Google is an unlikely partner considering that the company already has its own payments platform. Facebook Places could be a potential partner (PayPal is already a micropayments partner for the social network’s virtual currency platform Credits). Facebook is rumored to be turning on a deals feature for Places and PayPal could be a way to process these payments. And Groupon is rumored to be brokering a payments deal with PayPal as well.So while Google Checkout still doesn’t have the sort of users numbers that PayPal does in the payments area, Google has much more in the war chest in terms of local. With local up for grabs, the battle between the two payments platform just got a whole lot more interesting."

The average Trefis member forecast predicts listings ahead of our base case corresponding with a 10% increase in the price estimate as outlined below. We currently have a Trefis price estimate of around $31 for eBay’s stock, about 5% above the current market price of around $30.More Online Buyers and SellerseBay Marketplaces’ core proposition is to bring buyers and sellers together  for a low intermediation fee. eBay does this by providing great selection and value for buyers while offering sellers access to a large audience with cost  effective marketing. As a result, nearly 40% of the 2.9 billion listings on eBay’s Marketplaces platform in 2009 converted into actual sales.[2]With traditional retailers like the U.K.’s Saville Row, Jigsaw and Ed Hardy starting to sell more merchandise on eBay, we see this trend towards e-commerce benefiting eBay markedly. The growing number of Internet users globally, which is expected to touch 2 billion by end of 2010, will also encourage sellers to have more sales listings on e-commerce sites like eBay.[3] According to a recent report by ComScore, U.S. retail e-commerce spending reached $32.1 billion in Q3 of 2010, up 9% versus a year ago.[4] This indicates that consumer spending has started to pick up again – a good sign for eBay.Rising Online Retail PenetrationOnline retail penetration still has tremendous scope for growth. As of 2009, online penetration of electronics and general merchandise in the US was around 10% versus 5.7% internationally.[5] The number of active users on the eBay site has increased from 48 million in 2004 to over 90 million in 2009.[6] In addition, the number of listings per active user has gone up in response to eBay’s efforts to simplify the fee structure.As consumers spend more online, we expect merchandise listings to increase.  See how our estimates compare to the average member forecast below.The average of Trefis member forecasts for number of merchandise listings on eBay indicate an increase from 3.5 billion in 2010 to 5.4 billion by 2016, compared to the baseline Trefis estimate of an increase from 3.1 billion in 2010 to 4.5 billion by the end of the Trefis forecast period.

The company was founded in 1995 and is based in San Jose, California.eBay has beat EPS estimates for the past 5 years. Could eBay keep the streak going as it releases its third quarter numbers?Earnings: eBay earned $432 million ( $.33 per share) in the third quarter. This is an increase from last year’s $350 million ($.27 per share) in the third quarter. Excluding one time items, eBay earned $.40 per share.Revenue: Increased 1% to $2.25 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of about $2.18 billion. eBay’s online payment unit, PayPal and Bill Me Later, reported a 22% increase in revenue from the year-ago period. Online payment unit revenue totaled $838 million for the third quarter. Marketplace revenue also rose to $1.41 billion (3% increase).Actual versus Wall Street Expectations: Excluding one time items, eBay beat analysts estimates of .37 per share by 3 cents. The company also raised its full year guidance to $1.67-$1.70 per share, compared to earlier estimates of $1.60-$1.65 per share.Notable Stats: At the end of the third quarter, PayPal had 90 million active accounts. A million new accounts were added each month of the third quarter. This helped eBay’s total online payment volume jump 26%. The Street seemed to enjoy the earnings release as shares rose over 7% in after-hours trading.Did You Hear That? President and CEO John Donahoe had the following to say, “We delivered strong third quarter results, with great performance at PayPal and stable results at eBay. PayPal gained share globally and eBay continued to improve key metrics. Our company is strong and we are managing our global portfolio to balance strengths, challenges and opportunities, invest in growth and deliver consistent performance.”Commentary:  Investors should consider eBay as a company that can perform well in a strong and weak economy. eBay allows consumers to save money on an endless supply of items. Futhermore, eBay also provides consumers a way to pay for online purchases through PayPal.Disclosure: No position."
232197,23479,2010-10-26T12:52:16-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) management has indicated that the eBay Bucks rewards program introduced in August 2010 is gaining traction and enabling higher consumer spending on eBay.eBay Bucks is a rewards program for shopping on eBay.  Shoppers earn 2% of the purchase value of qualified items and are issued an eBay Bucks certificate at the end of each quarter which can be redeemed within the next 30 days.  For example, spending $2,500  per quarter on eBay would earn you $50 in eBay Bucks which can be used on future purchases.eBay Bucks can stimulate more purchases on eBay which can lead to an increase in the company’s listings-to-sales conversion rate.  eBay’s program may also siphon off purchases from competing platforms like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Overstock (NASDAQ:OSTK).Listing-to-sales conversion rate decliningListings-to-sales conversion rate represents the percentage of items for sale listed on eBay that are actually sold. We estimate that the conversion rate has declined slowly from 42% in 2006 to 39% in 2009. We believe that this ratio declined in the past due to the recessionary environment forcing customers to cut down on spending. With improving macro conditions, we expect this ratio to stabilize at around 39% in the future.Can eBay Bucks program boost sales on its website?According to eBay management, over three million shoppers have enrolled in the eBay Bucks program and spent five times more than those not enrolled. If eBay continues to come up with such innovative programs, this conversion rate could actually increase in the future.  There could be an upside of more than 10% to the $31 Trefis price estimate for eBay’s stock if eBay’s conversion rate were to increase to 50% (half of all listed items sold) by the end of the Trefis forecast period.Disclosure: No positions"
232192,23479,2010-10-26T07:52:16-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) indicated in its recent earnings that a number of brands and retailers are starting to open outlet shops on eBay (stores.ebay.com).  A growing presence of traditional retailers on eBay can help increase the number of merchandise listings on the site, which in turn can attract more buyers to eBay’s platform.  This is a good move for eBay which faces competition from online retailer Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and its network of third-party sellers.Retailers opening up outlet shops on eBayeBay’s Marketplaces business constitutes around half of the $31 Trefis price estimate for eBay’s stock. According to eBay management, many major retailers such as U.K.’s Saville Row, Jigsaw and Ed Hardy have opened up outlets on eBay.Outlets on eBay can help retailers reach new customers as well as sell excess inventory quickly, reducing costs associated with accumulating inventory.  For shoppers, eBay outlet stores can provide convenience as well as potential discounts on brand name retail items.  We believe that trends such as these will help eBay increase the number of merchandise listings on its site from around 2.9 billion in 2009 to around 4.5 billion by the end of Trefis forecast period.By modifying the forecast above, you can see how there could be an upside of more than 10% to the $31 Trefis price estimate for eBay’s stock if the number of merchandise listings doubles to reach 5.8 billion by 2016, instead of 4.5 billion that we forecast.Disclosure: No positions"

231430,20568,2010-10-21T13:40:10-04:00,,"eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported third  quarter earnings that beat the Zacks Consensus by 5 cents or 16.1%. This  was much better than the average positive surprise of 7.26% reported in  the four preceding quarters. As a result, shares jumped 7.13% in  after-hours trading.A few analysts have been raising estimates over the past few days, as  it became apparent that the negative foreign exchange impact would not  be as severe as initially expected. Business metrics continue to improve  overall, with weakening gross margins the only downside in the quarter.RevenueGross revenue of $2.25 billion was up 1.5% sequentially and 0.5% year  over year, beating the Zacks Consensus by 3.0% and exceeding the high  end of management guidance. The company is accounting for its stake in  Skype under the equity method, so reported revenue does not include any  contribution from Skype.Around 88% of total revenue was transactions-based, while the  remaining 12% came from marketing services. Both transactions-based  revenue (up 0.5% sequentially) and marketing services revenue (up 1.5%  sequentially) contributed to the revenue upside versus guidance. They  were also up 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively from a year ago.Revenue by SegmentThe company reports revenue under the Marketplaces and Payments  segments. The Marketplaces segment essentially refers to revenue earned  from the sale of goods available on eBay properties. The Payments  segment refers to revenues generated through Paypal. Consequently, both  segments derive revenue from transactions, as well as marketing  services.Marketplaces revenue increased 0.9% sequentially and 3.4% from  the year-ago quarter. The sequential revenue increase was the net  impact of a 0.3% increase in transaction revenue and a 4.6% increase in  marketing services revenue. The year-over-year increase was due to a  3.0% increase in transaction revenue and a 5.9% increase in marketing  services revenue.Vehicles volume declined 1% sequentially and 10% from the year-ago  quarter. Vehicle volumes have witnessed year-over-year declines in each  of the last 5 quarters. Active users increased to the highest level in 6  quarters. Marketplaces generated 63% of total revenue.Payments revenue increased 2.6% sequentially and 21.8% from  the year-ago quarter. Revenue from transactions was up 3.5% sequentially  and 22.9% year over year, with the revenue generated per transaction  declining both sequentially and from a year ago. However, revenue per  user increased both sequentially and year over year, indicating that  users are making smaller transactions, but coming back for more.Additionally, the number of users continued to increase from both  previous and year-ago periods. Although the cost per transaction  increased slightly, management was able to contain the transaction loss  rate. Revenue from marketing services was down 12.9% sequentially, but  up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Payments segment generated 37% of  total revenue.Revenue by GeographyAround 47% of total revenue was generated in the U.S., representing a  sequential increase of 2.5% and a year-over-year increase of 4.4%. The  balance came from international markets, which was flattish sequentially  (up 0.7%) and down 2.7% year over year.Management stated that sales into Europe which is a net importer from  both the U.S. and Asia were stronger than expected. What was more  heartening, the important markets of U.K. and Germany remained strong.  Although China and Hong Kong remain the fastest growing regions, sales  growth was tempered by currency in the last quarter.MarginsThe pro forma gross margin for the quarter was 71.5%, down 114 bps  sequentially and 30 bps year over year. Flattish volumes in both  segments combined with an increasing number of active users and  increasing cost per transaction processed negatively impacted the gross  margin in the last quarter.Marketplaces margins are generally much higher than Payments margins.  However, 60% of transactions in the last quarter were under the fixed  price format, exposing the company to the severe price competition in  the online retail market.Operating expenses of $1.07 billion were higher than the previous  quarter’s $1.06 billion. The operating margin was 24.0%, declining 102  bps sequentially and 30 bps from the year-ago quarter. All expenses were  flattish sequentially as a percentage of sales, so the decline in the  operating margin was primarily on account of the weaker gross margin.Excluding the impact of restructuring charges and the amortization of  intangible assets on a tax adjusted basis, the pro forma net income was  $470.6 million or 20.9% net income margin, compared to $458.8 million  or 20.7% in the previous quarter and $428.6 million or 19.2% in the  year-ago quarter.Including the special items, the GAAP net income was $431.9 million  ($0.33 per share) compared to $412.2 million ($0.31 per share) in the  June 2010 quarter and $349.7 million ($0.27 per share) in the September  quarter of last year.Balance SheetThe company has a solid balance sheet, with cash and short term  investments of $5.36 billion, up $465 million in the last quarter. eBay  generated $747 million in cash from operations and spent $167 million on  capex, netting a free cash flow of $580 million (up $61 million during  the quarter).OutlookManagement expects fourth quarter 2010 revenue of $2.39-2.49 billion  (up 8.5% sequentially and 2.9% year over year), GAAP EPS of 37 to 40  cents and non GAAP EPS of 45 to 48 cents.For the full year, management expects revenue of $9.05-9.15 billion  (raising previous guidance by $200 million), GAAP EPS of $1.30 to $1.33  (up from $1.23 to $1.28) and non GAAP EPS of $1.67 to $1.70 (up from  $1.60 to $1.65).ConclusioneBay reported another good quarter and the negative currency impact  was much less than cautioned by management, causing them to raise  full-year guidance after lowering it in July. The fixed price format,  while impacting margins negatively, is making the company more  competitive and management’s focus on technological improvements will  further improve customer satisfaction.Shares have responded positively to the news and we believe there  could be further upside, if eBay performs strongly versus peers in the  seasonally stronger fourth quarter. We therefore have a Zacks #2 Rank on  eBay shares, meaning that we recommend investors to accumulate shares  at this point.We believe eBay will continue to see higher volumes, the impact of  which will be partially offset by higher costs, weaker pricing and  shrinking margins.Our longer term rating on eBay shares stays Neutral.Disclosure: None"
231241,23404,2010-10-21T03:31:46-04:00,,"The bidding for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) shares has heated up since my June article ""eBay: Buyout or Breakup?""  and my purchase at $19.85 a share that same month.  Since then, the  company has added over $10 billion to its market value (or about 40%).   Based on price alone, the investment case is far less clear today.  There is plenty of good news in the the third quarter earnings report.   Earnings beat expectations.  PayPal accounts and float increased  significantly.  Free cash flow clocked in at $580 million for the  quarter.  There were no stupid acquisitions.  Guidance was raised.   Things that make investors giddy.  The after-hours action in eBay shares  proves it.  Did I mention that eBay generates tons of cash?  The company generated just over $2.3 billion in free cash flow in 2008  and a nearly identical amount in 2009.  This year's total will almost  certainly be in the ballpark, not much higher and perhaps a bit lower  (thanks to some working capital changes).  You can practically set your  watch using their cash flow statement.  In the first 9 months of 2010,  total free cash flow sums to $1.4 billion.  Not surprisingly, eBay is  flush with cash (over $6 billion at quarter end) and zero debt.  In addition to a beautiful balance sheet and copious amounts of cash  flow, eBay continues to own a a stake in Skype.  Why?  Who knows.   Apparently it's worth billions to someone.  I just wish eBay would take  that someone up on the offer.  Dear eBay, please SELL Skype once and for  all.  If there was ever a ""non-core"" asset, this is it.  In any case, at the current price, Mr. Market is putting a $36 billion  market value on eBay (assuming overnight gains hold).  $10 billion ago  eBay was clearly undervalued.  Today, it seems to have entered fair  value territory.  For all the talk of growth, the cash generating  fundamentals of eBay are little changed.  I'm not complaining.  And to  be fair, when a company generates this much cash, it's difficult to move  the needle.  PayPal's growth is impressive, but it is still a relatively small  business within eBay.  While most investors point to a lack of growth in  the Marketplace business, this is the division generating most of  eBay's free cash flow. And growth in PayPal hasn't translated into huge  free cash flow gains.  Mostly it has offset pressures elsewhere.  None of this is particularly worrisome given the absolute level of cash  that eBay generates.  And a free cash flow multiple of 12 to 14 times is  not exactly a ridiculously optimistic valuation.  Nonetheless, there  are reasons for concern.  Shareholders should take note of the increase in shares outstanding  since 2008.  If not for a $300 million repurchase in the most recent  quarter, the share base would have risen again.  Even with the share  repurchase, diluted shares outstanding barely fell.  This creeping  dilution (and the addiction to options that cause it) is not  insignificant and means that the fcf multiples above are overstated.  Below $20 a share, it was a risk worth taking because the valuation was compelling.  But now?  The media seems quite thrilled with the eBay's announcement that it  plans to repurchase $2 billion worth of its own shares.  But as I've  said many times before, not all share buybacks are created equal.  Some  merely attempt to mask the effects of options and other dilutive  actions, while others actually amount to a return of cash to  shareholders.  When companies buy back billions in shares and the actual  number of shares outstanding doesn't change, then shareholders are not  better off.  Management is simply putting an explicit cost on the  implicit cost of dilution.  The dilution that would have happened without the repurchase.  But it is a distinction without a difference.   Shareholders are poorer either way.  Should eBay shareholders get excited about the company's recently  announced repurchase program?  Here's the full quote from the Q3 press  release:Did  you catch that?  I guess we're left to wonder how long that $2 billion  will ""protect"" us.  The company is practically bragging about having cut  a hole in our pocket.  Guess who's holding the bucket?  All those  option holders.Newsflash: this isn't a buyback to be proud of OR to cheer about.  Going twice...In addition to this, I am mystified by the decision of eBay's management  to issuance of ""up to $1.5 billion"" of debt.  With $6 billion in net  cash?  They say the funding would “enhance the company’s flexibility to  invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions.”Oh no, here it comes!Now I know most of eBay’s excess cash is overseas (thanks to huge  international sales), but borrowing money (even at these rates) seems  like a perfect waste of time.  Perhaps the finance department is so  bored with collecting and counting all the aforementioned cash that  they've decided to borrow some money just to make life interesting.Let's all hope they don't start throwing money at acquisitions in the  pursuit of growth.  Acquisitions?  Really?  Given your track record?   Are you trying to kill the golden goose again?  We've seen that movie  before.  Wasn't it called ""Pie in the Sky(pe)""?  Stop it.eBay also needs to cool it with the options.  They aren't a sexy startup  that burns cash and is run out of a garage.  They can/should use actual  cash instead of options instead of the sleight of hand that they are  hoping nobody sees.  Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!They also need to accept that they are a maturing business with enviable  cash generating properties.  Excess cash should be paid out via  dividends and real, honest-to-goodness stock repurchases.Until there's some evidence of this, I'll be reducing my eBay holding.   I'm bringing the gavel down after 5 months and 40 percent.  SOLD to that  eBay man behind the curtain... I can seeeeee you!  Disclosure:  Long eBay"

The company’s non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $530.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, representing a 14% increase excluding Skype, compared to the same period of 2009.According to the release, PayPal delivered strong third quarter performance seeing a growth in revenue, total payment volume and active registered accounts.

231851,23970,2010-10-24T07:46:23-04:00,,"What does eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) do?Founded in 1995, the company began connecting buyers and sellers through eBay.com – an online marketplace using an auction-pricing format. Since then, the firm has expanded into different pricing formats (fixed pricing), different brands (Half.com, StubHub) and different products (PayPal, classifieds, display ads), guided by the framework of helping buyers and sellers connect. The firm is organized into two segments.Why did we purchase the stock?We purchased eBay Inc in July 2010 at an average cost of approximately $20 per share. We like eBay’s strong presence in both the on-line payment network sector through its PayPal division and the e-commerce market via eBay.com.The company generates strong returns on capital (over 15%) and high levels of free cash flow (FCF/share has averaged over $1.50/year from 2007-2009). Based on our valuation estimates, we believe that we initially purchased eBay at a price that primarily reflects the value of eBay’ s e-commerce division and the company’ s cash position only, giving little value to PayPal.More specifically, the e-commerce division generates 80% of the firm’ s profits, or $1.20 in FCF/share. Assigning a conservative 10x multiple to this FCF, and adding $5/share in cash currently on the balance sheet, we get a value of $17/share, assigning no value to PayPal. We believe PayPal is worth significantly more than the $3 implicit value, given its growth potential, and the comparatively valuations for Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA).What are the opportunities for eBay?The biggest growth opportunities are within the PayPal business as it continues to expand with global e-Commerce ($430bn global industry), while potentially capturing off-internet transactions via mobile phone applications and a low cost position.Even though PayPal might ultimately address only a portion of these large market opportunities, it has the potential to take market share from the global payment card industry ($5.5T industry), the paper check industry ($40T industry in the U.S.), consumer cash expenditures ($3T in the U.S.), the global remittance industry ($300bn), and the person-to-person payment industry ($1.1T in U.S.) PayPal’ s revenue has grown at a 32% CAGR over the past 5 years.What are the main risks to eBay’ s businesses?Management execution is important in maintaining PayPal’ s innovation and in continuing to improve eBay.com’s competitive position versus other e-commerce sites. The largest risk for eBay.com is niche retail websites that can better serve and target specific groups of customers.Regarding risks for PayPal, there is some uncertainty regarding PayPal’ s ability to penetrate off-internet commerce. Not only will retailers need to be willing to accept PayPal payments via the mobile phone at the store, but PayPal will also be competing against the credit card networks that are also making investments in mobile payments. Nevertheless, we believe that the low price we paid for the stock reflected most of our concerns and potential risks.How much is eBay worth?We believe eBay is worth $28-30/sh under our “ normalized” scenario, which assumes long-term revenue and profit growth rates in the mid-single digits.This projection is probably conservative given eBay’s historical growth rates and growth prospects.

The maximum proposed offering amount is listed as $100 million, but that is just a placeholder amount.According to the filing, Skype’s revenues for the first six months of 2010 were $406 million, with a net income of only $13 million. But a big portion of that was from interest income. That is only a 3 percent net margin, and this isn’t exactly a new business. Its income from operations was only $1.4 million for the six months. However, its gross margins are 51 percent, and have been expanding steadily as the company benefits from the scale of is operations and is able to negotiate lower telephone termination fees around the world.On the IPO road show, Skype will no doubt point to its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before income taxes and depreciation) numbers, which conveniently strip out things like goodwill, stock-based compensation and litigation expenses. Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2010 was $115.7 million, up 54 percent from a year ago. The company currently has $85 million in cash. These numbers reflect pro forma adjustments to Skype’s historical financial statements. (Click on the financial results table below to enlarge):One interesting tidbit from the filing is that Skype had to pay $344 million to settle with the Skype founders for the Joltid peer-to-peer technology that at one point threatened to hold up the spin-off of Skype from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).The filing also reveals that Skype “users made 95 billion minutes of voice and video calls” during the first half of 2010, with a full 40 percent of those minutes being video. Skype users also sent 84 million SMS text messages through Skype during the period.As of June 30, Skype was averaging 124 million users a month, with only 8.1 million of those paying users (out of a total of 560 million registered users). Those users, however, pay an average of $96 a year. Skype’s strategy is to keep growing its overall number of users and convert more of them to paying customers.Getting more people to buy Skype-Out minutes will obviously not be sufficient. Skype also plans on adding advertising revenues and enterprise products (37 percent of users surveyed say they use Skype for business purposes). According to the filing, part of Skype’s strategy will be to:The company is based in Luxemborg and is offering American depository shares. A new holding company will be created following the offering which will combine the ownership from public investors, private investors such as Silver Lake Partners and Andreessen Horowitz, and employees.

When a stock is selling for 6x fcf, is it really priced for  growth?  Or death?  And I thought risk was a function of price.  Lower in  price = less risk? I must be wrong.  Fearful investors continue to stand in line to lend Uncle Sam money.   3.5% over 10 years?  Sure, sign me up.  After all, there's no risk  here.  How could there be?  These people have very simple operating  rules.Call me  crazy, but I prefer the private sector.  Under-leveraged and profitable  aren't adjectives that are typically ascribed to governments these  days, Greek or otherwise.  Yet Mr. Market continues to offer up such  companies every day at reasonable prices.So despite (or because of) the continuing drop in equity prices, I  skipped the Treasury line again today.  My stock du jour is: eBay  (NASDAQ:EBAY).  It's not a new idea, just a new price, having bought eBay at  $12 (Jan 2009) and having sold at $24.50 (October 2009).At $19.85, I decided to start buying again.  The current market value of  $26 billion seems reasonable for a company with $5 billion in excess  cash, no debt, a 30% stake in Skype, and ample free cash flow (of $400  to $500 million per quarter).  Analysts are generally negative about the  Marketplace (auction/retail) business and positive about PayPal (online  payments) business.  The growth in PayPal's float (translation: other  people's money that eBay holds, but doesn't pay for) to $2.3 billion is  impressive.  Nontheless, the Marketplace businesses generate piles of  cash.  And as an exchange, eBay isn't stuck holding a lot of inventory.   Those 20+% net margins are nice too.Either way, investors don't have to be unduly excited about either to  see upside from current levels.  There's even some  talk of eBay becoming a buyout target.  Given the numbers above,  the speculation is understandable from a financial standpoint, but not  from a practical one.At the current price, eBay is hardly a small company.  The number of  potential buyers who could afford eBay (in its entirety) is quite  small.  Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT)?  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)?  Both companies are big enough  to buy eBay, but they'd each end up with something they don't want.Let's face it, eBay is an odd conglomeration of assets, most of which  are worth more as part of another whole.The Marketplace division may interest Wal-Mart, if it wants to bulk up  its online business.  Amazon might want it to bootstrap into its current  valuation and provide an opportunity for cost cutting. PayPal would  most likely attract a financial buyer.  I'm thinking of American Express  (NYSE:AXP), which recently made an online  payment acquisition or even JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).  The Skype stake  also has a separate set up for prospective buyers.  The consortium that  recently bought the other 70% seems logical, but a host of telecom firms  could also be interested.The proceeds of these sales plus the huge net cash position at eBay  would treat shareholders to a hefty payday. But don't hold your breath.   I'm not expecting eBay to announce a liquidation of the company...  ever.  But this would be the best option for investors.As a standalone company or as a liquidation play, eBay deserves  consideration.  But if you're buying it in hopes of a buyout, don't  bother.

215878,21435,2010-07-22T12:48:27-04:00,,"There are few stocks that are as polarizing as is eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY); message boards and forums are choked full of vitriol aimed at the online bazaar of things both old and new. When I first wrote about their stock in June of 2008, I was taken aback by the negative response and it seemed to outpace any other stock I had written on by a wide margin. It made me wonder if there is something fatally flawed about the company, or otherwise there could be an unloved stock that presents investors an opportunity. In the interest of disclosure, I am nothing more than a casual user of their sites and services and have no extreme affinity or hatred for the company (no position in the stock either). With that said, I hope to provide an analysis of eBay’s stock and the underlying fundamentals and not a commentary on their business.EBay reported its second quarter results yesterday where they saw EPS of $.40 and revenue of $2.2 billion. As far as expectations the results were a mixed bag, as consensus estimates called for $.38 in profit per share on $2.2 billion in sales. As you can see, their performance was strong on the top-line matching expectations and profits advanced 26% which was slightly better than expected. The biggest highlight for the quarter was gains in its Paypal online payment processing platform, whose revenue jumped 22% to $817 million and payment volume spiked 28% to $21.4 billion. Paypal is clearly a driver of growth for eBay and one of the most attractive pieces of the company as it grows into a larger percentage of revenue. Already counting for a little more than a third of sales, CEO John Donahoe believes Paypal will exceed their marketplace segment in short order.Paypal’s exciting growth aside, the marketplace is still eBay’s bread and butter, and revenue growth of 11% to $1.4 billion is certainly not too shabby. The online auctioneer and marketplace claims 91.8 million active users on their platform as of the end of the quarter, up from 88.4 million a year ago. Donahoe alluded to the ongoing facelift for their marketplace that thus far has failed to live up to their hopes. They plan to continue to fine tune the site for the next 6 to 18 months. Surprisingly strong was the growth seen in Europe, particularly in the U.K., and the United States market was actually slower than expected. Furthermore, management said they expect to be negatively impacted by the strengthening dollar in the rest of the year, as foreign sales will likely translate into fewer dollars. The stronger dollar accounted for the modest guidance for the rest of the year: 2010 revenue of $8.8 billion to $8.9 billion and EPS of $1.60 to $1.65.The results were good, but we have to admit they are compared to a pretty weak quarter a year ago. Furthermore, Wall Street analysts had been lowering estimates in anticipation of the impact of foreign exchange. Even still the stock is trading about 5.5% higher in morning trading on heavy volume, and we think that is appropriate. At Ockham, we have our most bullish Greatly Undervalued stance on eBay stock. For one thing, it is trading well below its historically normal valuation multiples. For example, over the past ten years (recent years weighed more heavily) we have established a price-to-cash earnings range of 32.8x to 60.1x, but at percent the stock trades at a multiple of under 14x expected 2010 cash earnings per share. Likewise, some might view a price-to-sales per share multiple of 3.2x as excessive, but historically speaking the market has been willing to pay between 5.7x and 11.1x.Now, to be clear, we understand that eBay is on a slower growth trajectory than they had been when they were valued at the huge multiples of 60x times cash earnings and 11x times sales. Simply put, eBay will never again get back to that level. Furthermore, the Paypal division that has the most exciting growth is a lower margin business than their marketplace revenue; slumping margins is another thing investors won’t pay a premium for. However, we think it is worth considering that excluding this recession, the last time eBay traded for this price level was more than seven years ago. At that time, revenue and cash earnings were both one-quarter what it is today. We do think that eBay’s stock has continued growth potential through both of its main business segments and particularly in online payment processing which added a million new users a month in the last quarter. For a company with zero debt and nearly $4 per share in cash on hand, eBay has clearly fallen out of favor with the market but they aren’t going anywhere.Original post"
201150,23479,2010-04-27T16:30:45-04:00,,"eBay  (NASDAQ:EBAY) has made concerted efforts lately to improve its  customer service with respect to sellers and buyers on its platform.  We  believe reduced take rates, innovative mobile apps for devices like the  iPhone and iPad, and the launch of a new fashion platform will benefit  eBay by encouraging sellers to list more merchandise on its platform.Merchandise Listings on eBay  Expected to IncreaseWe estimate that eBay Marketplaces constitutes around 50% of the $40  Trefis price estimate for eBay’s stock, making it the most  significant business segment for eBay.  We estimate that the number  of Merchandise Listings on eBay will continue to increase from 2.9  billion in 2009 to 4.5 billion by the end of the Trefis forecast period.However, there could be an upside of 10% to the $40  Trefis price estimate for eBay’s stock if the number of merchandise  listings were to increase at a faster rate and reach 5.5 billion by the  end of the Trefis forecast period.Below we highlight three initiatives that eBay has taken that we  believe will lead to more merchandise being listed on eBay marketplaces. 1.  Reduced Take Rates Will Motivate Sellers to List More eBay’s  transaction take rate represents the average commission, as a  percentage of the merchandise sale price, that eBay earns on every item  sold.  eBay has reduced its take rate over the last few years in order  to drive volumes and sales.  We believe that the take rate will continue  to decline from 7.8% in 2009 to 6.8% by the end of Trefis forecast  period. This will help encourage more seller listings.2.  Mobile Apps for iPhone and iPad Will Increase Seller  Reach eBay’s main shopping app for mobile phones has been downloaded more  than 8.5 million times and eBay expects to generate $1.5 billion in  Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) from mobile apps in 2010.  In comparison,  we expect total eBay GMV (including mobile) to reach $63 billion in  2010.Mobile apps will allow sellers to reach a wider audience of buyers,  and importantly, reach them when they are considering a purchase at a  store.  With mobile apps, shoppers can more conveniently search eBay  from their mobile phones to compare prices on eBay to merchandise they  are considering in store.Having access to a shopper that has high intent to purchase is  extremely important for sellers and we believe that mobile apps help to  improve seller access to such buyers.3.  Launch of Fashion Vault Will Increase Apparel ListingseBay has recently launched a new category for apparel called the  Fashion Vault. It has negotiated with top brands, retailers and  designers to list their items on eBay at a discount to the retail price.   eBay expects to generate more than $5 billion in GMV from clothing,  shoes and accessories in 2010.10% Upside to eBay’s Stock from Better Customer Focused  EffortsAlthough we forecast that the Number of Merchandise Listings on the eBay  platform will increase to around 4.5 billion, there could be an upside  of $4 (10%) to the $40  Trefis price estimate for eBay’s stock if it were to increase to  5.5 billion by the end of Trefis forecast period if eBay’s seller  initiatives were to attract more sellers to its platform.You can modify our forecast for the Number of Merchandise Listings on  eBay above  to see how eBay’s stock will be impacted if those rates were to increase at a  faster rate than what we forecast.For additional analysis and forecasts, here is our  complete model for eBay’s stock.Disclosure: No positions"
228648,23690,2010-10-06T05:08:10-04:00,,"The preliminary prospectus still has quite a few blanks in it, but after a basic review Skype looks like a company that might be better off acquired than public.  Based on our valuation work the market clearing price should be around $4.8B.The Wrapper: Skype is the leading Internet-based communication company with 560 million registered users completing about 200 billion minutes of calls annually.  Skype has over 8 million paying customers with an ARPU of about $100.  For 2010, we expect the company to report close to $900M in revenue with operating margins near 20%.Recipe History: Skype was started back in 2003 and baffled many at the beginning – “Why on earth would anyone want to use their PC to make a phone call?”  Even after Skype caught on the questions continued – “How are these guys going to make any money if the calls are free?”   Years later these answers are clear but still developing.  Skype makes most of their money today on calls to non-Skype phones.  They charge a few cents per minute versus the tens of cents or even dollars that phone companies charge for the same call.  New features like video calls and desktop sharing are broadening the appeal of the service and the way people use it.  Additional features will roll out soon, like click-to-call, which will be integrated with services like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Search, Maps, and Facebook.Yummy Ingredients:Sour Tastes:Valuation:  The company has not filed a price range or many of the details we need to compute a per-share Intrinsic Valuation.  We can, however, estimate that the IV is likely to be about $4.8B.  Once the final prospectus is filed we can update our valuation analysis and include per-share IV estimates.Candy Verdict:  Skype is a leading player in an important area of the Internet and cloud computing.  As such, we expect most investors will want to own it as long as the price doesn’t get too high.  Skype is operating in a space that is of great interest to most of the major players and it’s been suggested that the company may be acquired before the IPO.  Even if they do become a public company they will remain tempting.Beyond simple continued execution, we expect the spread of Internet-enabled TV and video-capable communication devices to open up important new markets for Skype.   The success of the management team will hinge on how well they take advantage of these.In summation, Skype is a deal we expect most to want to own, which suggests it’s going to do well at almost any price.  Once we see the filing range and how pricing goes we’ll have a clearer idea on what to do with the shares post-IPO.[Disclosures: None]"

215308,22406,2010-07-20T06:57:35-04:00,,"Previewing eBay’s Q2 EarningsYes, it is that time again. First, let's take a look at how I did with my Q1 forecast versus actual results.Payments (PayPal)Last quarter I had said that PayPal revenue should come in at 819 MM, the actual number that came in was 809 MM.  Not bad at all.   This quarter, I am estimating more subdued growth at 2% in revenue increases from Q1, and 23% growth year over year. This is slightly below historical growth rates. This puts revenue for PayPal to come in around 825 MM.  PayPal is continuing to expand market share here in the US as well as Europe and Asia.  I believe PayPal’s emphasis on mobile payments and aggressively targeting Asia (such as the deal with Alibaba) is the right direction for PayPal to follow.A press release yesterday created some hubbub about some patents that Paypal has apparently infringed.  After taking an initial look, I’m convinced it’smeritless.  There is a good article here that goes into the details.eBay should take it seriously, but it looks like the accusations stand on shaky ground.   MarketPlaces (eBay)Since eBay’s change their fee structure, the site has experienced explosive growth in listings.  The sell through rate has fallen from the mid 35% to low 30%, while this at first may seem troubling; this makes sense with the increased listings.  The biggest wild card here is if the counter cyclical nature of MarketPlaces in recessions continues to have a positive effect on eBay.  MarketPlaces is still the weakest and most critical area for eBay.  Last quarter I estimated revenue at 1.38 billion for MarketPlaces.  I hit the bull’s-eye here – eBay reported 1.38 billion last quarter.  I’m taking a cautious stance and forecasting revenue to come in at 1.39 billion, this is a growth rate of 1% quarter over quarter and 11% year over year.Communications (Skype)I’ve said for a while now that Skype was a hidden gem, and a much maligned entity.  As mobile computing continues to take off, Skype is turning out to be a great investment.  True, completely tangential to Payments and eBay, however - it cannot be denied it remains a high growing, profitable, and ubiquitous solution for VOIP.  With apps on the Iphone and Android – Skype’s position continues to look very promising.  Last quarter, I had estimated a pro-rated revenue value.  I didn’t realize that eBay was no longer reporting Skype’s revenue and bottom line contribution – so I won’t revisit this segment since we won’t have a reportable benchmark.Currency FluctuationsI must acknowledge that I made an error last quarter in respect to the Euro With half of eBay’s revenues coming from international markets; currency rates have a huge impact on revenue. I had reported that eBay would benefit from the stronger dollar, when in reality of course – it is quite the opposite.  I had factored this to improve the bottom line by 1% last quarter, when I should have subtracted 1%.  The dollar gained continued to gain strength in the second quarter of this year versus the euro – around 10 percent. I would estimate this should negatively impact eBay’s earnings around 1.5 percent due to currency exchange rates.***eBay had given 2.150 to 2.2 billion in revenue guidance from the last earnings (Q1) report. I forecast that total eBay revenue will come in at 2.181 billion with eps of 0.28 cents (GAAP) and .38 cents (non-GAAP).  With the unforeseen debt crisis that unfolded in Europe this quarter, their bottom line has a good possibility of coming in slightly below analyst estimates, it might be rough day for eBay.Disclosure: Author is long EBAY"

You may want to review our same-store-sale data for Q1 here.GMV  - the pulse of the marketplace.eBay provides a myriad  of data points for the marketplace business, but we always counsel folks  to look at the primary datapoint - GMV (Gross Merchandise Value).  Registered users, items sold, segment revenue, etc.  Those are all  useful secondary metrics, but they don't shine as much light on the  business as GMV does.For the earnings call, eBay provided this  handy chart with the GMV metrics: (click to enlarge)  eBay's  overall GMV was $15.4b for the Q, but to get a true apples to apples  for GMV, you have to pull out three pieces:The following numbers are all ex-autos, ex-gmarket and ex-FX.

In the key eBay International markets,  eBay is a year into the same fee changes they are rolled out in the US  on 3/31/10.  If those changes are already 'tapped out', that could  indicate problems for the domestic side in the near future.  The  International deceleration caused the overall number to come in flat  Q/Q.But what about Amazon and e-commerce?Taken  in a vacuum, eBay's results are decent.  But their stated goal is to  grow with e-commerce.  . Comscore came out with data this week that  indicates they saw March come in (ex travel) at 19% y/y and they pegged  Q1 at 11% y/y.  So at 8% overall, eBay lags that growth rate by 3% and  the comscore data is US, so the comp is 6% vs. 11% - or a 5% delta. So  eBay isn't out of the woods yet and needs to continue to work on growth  strategies.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announces Thursday and we'll have coverage on Amazon Strategies - our SSS  data indicates there is no slow down there and we suspect sales will be  up > 30% again for Q1.Disclosure  - I am long Google and Amazon. eBay is an investor in  ChannelAdvisor."

Well, let’s take a look at where we’ve been, where we’re at, and hopefully where I think we’ll be by Wednesday.First, let me give you a chart with quarterly revenue since eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) went public.It displays revenue by quarter. It also has quarter over quarter growth (QoQ) and year over year growth (YoY).Payment RevenuePayPal booked 795 MM in revenue in Q4 2009. With activity and listings increasing - and I don’t mind going out on a limb here - I am forecasting a 3% revenue increase from Q4. This is in line with historical growth rates. I expect revenue for PayPal to come in around 819 MM.MarketPlacesWith added auctions, stable sell through rates and increasing consumer confidence, eBay’s MarketPlace business seems to have found its footing. It is this segment that is the biggest (and most difficult) to forecast. eBay has essentially assumed a retrench to below Q3 revenue. Based on what I’ve seen from auction listing rates and sell through rates (see the chart below), I think we’re in for another strong quarter that will exceed eBay’s estimates. Strong listings combined should counteract reduced take rates. I believe eBay will exceed its own published forecast . I’m estimating revenue at 1.38 billion for MarketPlaces.eBay’s Sell Thru has been roughly in the high 30 percent range in Q4, 2009. This trend continues with a slight dip in March 2010. CommunicationsSkype contributed 138 million in Q1 2009; if current trajectories have held, it should have contributed gross of around 185 million this quarter. However, eBay now only owns roughly 1/3, so keep that in mind with their revenue release a net revenue contribution of 61 million would be about in-line. Currency FluctuationsWith half of eBay’s revenues coming from international markets, currency rates have a huge impact on revenue. The dollar gained some strength in the first quarter of this year versus the euro – around 6 percent.  I would give eBay’s earnings a boost of around one percent due to currency exchange rates.***eBay has given 2.1 to 2.2 billion in revenue guidance from the last earnings (Q4) report. I forecast that total eBay revenue will come in at 2.3 billion with eps of 0.33 cents (GAAP) and .43 cents (non-GAAP).Disclosure: Author holds a long position in EBAY"
201030,22884,2010-04-27T09:01:08-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported 1Q10 financial results last week (results can be found on eBay's site here; conference call transcript can be found on Seeking Alpha here) and plenty of press articles covered the results. We're not going to recount figures in this post as we have limited time, but we wanted to go on record now that -- in our view -- the company's current and future earnings power remain impressive.As a result, we expect shares to track moderately growing earnings higher over time. Also, at 15x forward earnings (7% earnings yield), we see some room for further multiple expansion that should juice share performance as earnings increase for this E-commerce stalwart. Shares are currently trading at 13x consensus 2011E earnings.Briefly on what happened last week (old news by now): eBay reported an inline 1Q10 and guided slightly lower than Wall Street expectations for 2Q10 while maintaining full-year guidance. Foreign currency movements and higher U.S. taxes (because the company is performing better stateside) are the primary culprits for the lower near-term guidance. In a market that favors momentum and ""beat and raise quarters"" (see our Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) post last Thursday), traders were quick to dump shares of eBay and at least one brokerage house (Deutsche Bank) took a ""victory lap"" for its pre-existing ""sell"" rating while another downgraded the stock to sell from hold.An article published by BusinessWeek/Bloomberg lauded the DB sell call and highlighted that not only had the analyst had the sell call in place since October 2007, but a short-term trading call was made the very the morning of eBay's reporting date.Wow, congratulations on the 50/50 gamble that eBay would guide lower that afternoon -- while having a specific edge or insight into a quarter is preferable, we submit that actually ""gaming"" results/guidance within a few pennies for such a large company with many moving pieces is extremely difficult and a dangerous game. We know from experience. Fortunately, it worked out this time for DB. However, what about the up-move from $10 to the mid-$20s over the past year (contrary to the longstanding sell call)?The shorts can enjoy a brief victory lap, yet we think the celebration will be just that: only a respite. Why? PayPal is a rapidly growing category killer in online payments and the Marketplaces segment -- no matter how you look at it -- is a high margin, high ROIC cash cow, growth or no-growth (although it is growing and we expect more growth from the core e-commerce site as well as Shopping.com, StubHub, classifieds, and advertising). Excess cash will continue to accumulate on the balance sheet, enabling additional growth through reinvestment/acquisitions and returns to shareholders through share repurchases (and perhaps a dividend someday).We think investors/traders who are negative on eBay are missing the forest for the trees -- a sell rating seems completely oblivious to the company's formidable competitive advantages detailed in our eBay post last August. It's a tremendous franchise that we're happy to own at current levels.Disclosure: Author holds a long position in EBAY"

Also, I can definitely see the 'sum of the parts' argument working to unlock shareholder value, so we'll have to keep an eye on this.Also, remember in my Paypal post, there were some interesting 'inside baseball' nuances that point to an eBay/Paypal drift doing on.eBay Bucks - a new chapterWe're getting a lot of questions from sellers who have heard about a new twist to the eBay bucks loyalty program.  Historically the program offered X% back on all eBay purchases to a beta set of buyers where X typically is 2%.Here is a copy of what was sent to eBay Bucks buyers yesterday: (click to expand)   As you can see, for select merchants, eBay is now offering deeper cash back (6-10%).  Overall, it's good to see this system get with the times and offer more material discounts. We'll be monitoring to see what kind of impact it has for this first wave of participating sellers.   I'm still not a fan of the weird 'burn up and burn down' aspect of eBay bucks - no other program really works this way and as a consumer, I think it seriously complicates and reduces the value of the program. So a good move forward for eBay Bucks, but it's still not where it needs to be in my opinion.The common question we are getting from sellers now is - 'How do I participate in this program?!"" and 'who pays?""

Yes, you can find designer goods on the auction site, but the validity of these goods has been tarnished slightly by reports and subsequent lawsuits of fake designer items being sold on the site. But the e-commerce giant is hoping to change this. eBay recently launched FashionVault, a site that sells designer clothes and includes Gilt Groupe-like flash sales on designer items. And today, the company is launching eBay Fashion , a “new enhanced shopping destination for clothing, shoes and accessories on the world’s largest online marketplace.” It’s sort of like a one-stop-shop for all things fashion on eBay.The site promises more advanced and customized features to surface and showcases the new, vintage, branded and designer merchandise included on the 19 million average daily listings on eBay. New features include enhanced browsing capabilities, with a dedicated “Fashion Tab” in the top navigation on the eBay homepage. Users are given the choice to shop by boutique, brand, category, similar items and trends.Other new functionality includes a “More Like This” feature that will surface other apparel and accessories items that are similar in color, shape, pattern and more; and tailored boutiques for categories like Women’s Clothing, Men’s Clothing, Women’s Shoes, Men’s Shoes and Handbags. eBay is also soliciting tips and advice from fashion insiders and stylists that will curate shopping lists and looks from the Marketplace.It seems that this new fashion-focused site is more than just a push towards getting fashionistas to visit eBay. eBay recently sectioned off its classified site to this could be representative of a strategy towards fencing off their marketplace sections to create niche retail and content portals.Original post"

188645,20413,2010-02-16T00:22:07-05:00,,"First, let me get the disclosures and disclaimers out of the way. I own shares in the following stock. It is a 'screaming buy' for me. I am not recommending it as an investment for you as most of you who are aware of from previous articles, I never make any recommendations; however, occasionally I strongly suggest that you take a closer look a certain stocks. For example, back on March 8, 2007, when I wrote the article ‘Why Amazon.com Stock could be Up Substantially by Year End’. The article listed twelve reasons why Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) looked extremely favorable. The stock closed at 38.10 that day, started shooting up in April and never looked back, now trading around 120 per share. So what is the stock I am writing about? It is eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), which closed at 21.77 on Friday. This is the company that owns PayPal, the online payment services company. Remember several years ago when eBay took a lot of grief for buying PayPal? Now look at it; it is driving the company. PayPal's total payment volume, also known as TPV, jumped above $20 billion for the latest reported quarter. PayPal operates in 190 markets around the world, with over 80 million active accounts, supporting 24 different currencies. The Merchant Services division of PayPal grew by an incredible 50% for the fourth quarter. So what is Merchant Services? This is essentially the checkout process that you see when you purchase something online, whether you are buying from a small, medium, or even large companies such as Wal Mart (NYSE:WMT), 1-800-Flowers (NASDAQ:FLWS), and Blue Nile (NASDAQ:NILE). Usually you see a choice of VISA (NYSE:V) or MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and often in addition, Discover (NYSE:DFS) and American Express (NYSE:AXP). A major bank or other financial institution would normally process this whole checkout procedure. But PayPal is moving in on this business in a big way. With PayPal handling it, consumers can still use a credit card to check out through PayPal even if they don't have or don't want to use a PayPal account. Smaller merchants are realizing that they have been paying a lot in monthly fees to some merchant service company in addition to being subject to a minimum monthly dollar amount in transactions. Whereas with a basic PayPal plan, no monthly fees and minimums. So for the Merchant Services business of PayPal, the company's total payment volume grew at a rate of ten times the market growth rate for ecommerce in general, with the international services growing at 80% over last year, boosting non-US volume to 40% of PayPal's total TPV. The international business is significant, with the cross border trade amounting to about one quarter of all of PayPal's total payment volume. Oh yes, I think the company also has some kind of an online auction business. But seriously, the eBay marketplace portion of the business is holding its own. Revenues for the eBay Marketplace increased by 15% for the latest quarter, with sold items growing by 11% worldwide over last year. Gross marketplace volume grew by almost 50% over last year in the Asia Pacific region. And in Europe, the number of live listings has practically doubled. Same store sales growth for the fourth quarter for top-rated sellers grew by over 10% in the United States, 25% in Germany, and 35% in the UK. There is even an eBay app for the iPhone, which has been downloaded practically 7 million times, which has generated more than $600 million in GMV during 2009, a 200% increase over the prior year. I look at the eBay marketplace business a practically a utility. People will always have stuff they want to sell, and people will always be looking for stuff to buy. Whether we are in a recession or a booming economy, the eBay transactions will always continue. As for eBay's other businesses, it has completed the sale of its 70% interest in Skype for about $1.9 billion. StubHub had a 54% fourth quarter increase in ticket sales over the same quarter last year. The classifieds business increased by 20% for the year. Revenue for Shopping.com, Rent.com and other businesses was up 7% for the latest quarter. As for the company in general, revenues grew by 16% to $24 billion for the latest quarter, with non-GAAP earnings per share increasing by 9%. The company generated almost $600 million in free cash flow. And most important of all, the company is debt free. (I just love debt free companies.) The company has $5.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and non-equity investments, amounting to about $4 in cash per share. The line of credit is paid off. Did I mention that the company has no debt?  The company reported financials on January 20. If the stock market and the economy had been stronger at the time, I think eBay would have performed better over the last few weeks. So if you are looking for a company to do your homework on, take a very close look at eBay. Disclosure: Author owns AMZN and EBAY."

Ecommerce giant eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has been reaching big milestones with its mobile apps, and apparently PayPal, its electronic payments subsidiary, is striking a chord with mobile users around the globe as well.
The company, which boasts more than 81 million active accounts in 190 markets and 24 currencies around the world, says its new iPhone app (iTunes link) has been downloaded an impressive one million times in less than three weeks since its debut.
With the new PayPal Mobile iPhone app, users can split restaurant checks, collect money for events, set reminders for recurring payments, donate to their favorite causes and manage their PayPal accounts.
Thanks to an integration with Bump Technologies, users can exchange information and quickly close PayPal transactions simply by ‘bumping’ (tapping) their smartphones together.
PayPal Mobile supports fifteen languages and also features a global currency calculator. It has been in the App Store, free of charge, since mid-2008.
The company also boasts applications for Android and Blackberry devices, but to date hasn’t released download numbers for those platforms.

184498,22762,2010-01-26T12:01:55-05:00,,"By Robin WauterseBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) Tuesday morning announced that it will introduce free auction listings and reduced listing fees for fixed-priced items in the U.S., starting March 30.The e-commerce giant says the ’success-based’ pricing is similar to changes implemented by eBay in Europe, changes that have self-reportedly driven strong growth for sellers in markets such as the U.K. and Germany.Beginning March 30, eBay will offer two pricing packages in the United States:“eBay Everyday” ratesAuction-style listings with a start price of 99 cents or less will be free (with no insertion fees for up to 100 listings per month).When an item sells, the seller will pay a flat final value fee of 9 percent of the sale price – and never more than $50. If an item doesn’t sell, the seller pays nothing. eBay says these listings are typically are the ideal format for people who sell on the site occasionally.“eBay Stores” subscription ratesFor large volume sellers, eBay is to introduce insertion fees as low as 3 cents per listing for 30 days—a 90 percent reduction over current rates according to the company.Subscription rates offer various pricing options, depending on the size of a seller’s business. With the new pricing, a seller with 250 listings per month would save $80 or $960 a year in insertion fees, eBay says. With these changes, eBay’s current store inventory format will be discontinued and will no longer have separate search functionality from core fixed-price listings. With the new eBay Stores rate package, all fixed priced inventory on eBay will have exposure through eBay’s main search functionality.Sellers who want to determine which pricing option will work best for their listings when the changes take place in March can use eBay’s Fee Illustrator:Along with the pricing changes, eBay announced that, effective today, it is expanding to all buyers its eBay Buyer Protection, which the company has been piloting over the past year. The program was first introduced in October 2009 and helps buyers identify sellers who consistently provide great service (as rated by other buyers).Through the program, buyers will have access to customer support specialists seven days a week, as well as a money-back offer for most purchases should a problem arise and the seller is unable to resolve the issue. eBay Buyer Protection covers items paid with PayPal or any other approved payment method.Original post"
183696,22406,2010-01-21T14:38:32-05:00,,"Wow, it seems just like yesterday that I finished writing my analysis for eBay’s Q3 earnings. For Q4, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) drops a blockbuster quarter with the stock up 8 % today. Let’s dig deeper and see if we can find out what’s going on here.Turning the TitaniceBay is not shy of controversy. From upsetting long time sellers, to having to delist inappropriate auctions, eBay seems to stir up the bee’s nest like no other dot com. A couple years ago, Meg Whitman, the long time CEO, handed the wheel to John Donahoe who was inheriting a rapidly slowing auction business. The new CEO quickly went to work implementing radical changes to the marketplace, and angering sellers along the way. eBay had finally matured and Donahoe solidified the inevitable, turning eBay from a community-based startup to full fledged public corporate American company (that ultimately answers to shareholders.) The timing couldn’t have been worse, the radical changes occurred simultaneously with what seemed to be crumbling of the American financial system. The changes were further exasperated by the false assertion that eBay just bought the dead dog Skype.It wasn’t until the second quarter of 2009 that eBay’s numbers started seeing the fruits of  Donahoe's strategy. Q2 2009 was the first quarter with growth in almost a year seemed to initially validate Donahoe changes. The third quarter further solidified that John Donahoe’s makeover strategy was working. And with today’s quarterly earnings announcement, I think there should no longer be any doubt that there was a method to King Donahoe’s madness.One more step toward that cashless societyIf you don’t know that eBay has repositioned PayPal as its new flagship business unit, you do now. I’ve even joked that eBay might as well change their stock ticker to PYPL. PayPal’s growth and profits have continued to skyrocket. Amid what analysts considered would be a modest retail season, PayPal accelerated growth and further gained market share (when was the last time you used “Google Payments”?). An amazing 28% year over year growth and a very robust 34%  growth in Total Payment Volume (TPV).Bill Me Later’s also ended the year with 320 million accounts (almost 50% over last year) PayPal Revenue (Click to enlarge)  PayPal is without a doubt the main driver of growth for eBay and will continue to be so. As a standalone business, PayPal has tremendous potential, and many investors simply do not realize that the realignment of eBay has already occured with PayPal truly being the 'mother company.' Core MarketplacesNow we come to the crux of eBay’s drama – the Mainstay site. Is John Donahoe plan working? Well what does this chart tell you?Marketplace Revenue  Marketplaces generated $1.463 billion in revenue for the quarter. Most importantly, this is the first sign of growth in a year. If that’s not a turnaround, what is? eBay has finally stopped the contraction and squeezed out growth 3 quarters in a row now. In these challenging times, eBay may have revealed its counter cyclical resilience. As more and more people are stretched financially, they are turning to the secondary market to purchase discounted items and sell unneeded items.So Long, Farewell SkypeThe ink is dry now and eBay is $1.9 Billion richer. (eBay now has a $5.2 billion war chest and minimal debt) More importantly, it was able to take the unwarranted bad press of their backs. Meg and eBay gave their best efforts to integrate Skype to eBay, but it became obvious that Skype was just too tangential to eBay. I plead to any rational mind however, that while yes, eBay did make a mistake in buying Skype – it was not a fatal one, not even a flesh wound. Today’s results have illustrated once again why somebody would buy Skype from eBay. While only releasing partial numbers, Skype shows that it continues to grow, be profitable, and most important continue to add to eBay’s bottom line with their retained 1/3 stake. What lies ahead?eBay always gives conservative forecasts, and this quarter is the first time I’ve seen a somewhat “bold” forecast. Last quarter they said 4th quarter would basically be flat. (Talk about under promising and over delivering.) eBay expects 2010 to deliver $1.63 to $1.68 a share, with revenue coming in between $8.8 billion and $9.1 billion. This is higher then what analysts were expecting of  $1.60 a share on revenue of $9 billion.It seems Donahoe may know something we don’t as the formerly cautious CEO seems to feel that tailwinds may finally be blowing.Disclosure: Author holds a long position in EBAY."

Below we drill into the key growth, profitability and valuation metrics below and access the attractiveness of the company. Top Line Growth eBay’s revenue growth rates have declined as the company continues to scale. You would expect this given the law of large numbers. Revenue growth turned negative in Q408 but have since rebounded.  PayPal / International Growth PayPal and international expansion are the keys that will continue to drive top line growth and profits for the company. You can see eBay’s strong penetration rates in the chart below with particular strength internationally.  eBay announced it will increase PayPal’s work force in Asia by 100% to 2,000 this year. They signed a deal with China UnionPay that will open up the Chinese market for the company. UnionPay (CUP) card members will be able to use PayPal to shop online, representing a new opportunity for international retailers to sell to a large base of Chinese customers who, combined, hold 2.1 billion CUP cards. Scott Thomson, president of PayPal, said:  Given the penetration trends above, this is worth taking note of and suggests good times may be ahead for eBay’s PayPal. The international opportunity for eBay is expected to be $460 to $480 billion by 2011 with eBay capturing less than 6% of the market.Merchant ServicesThe company also added over 100 merchants via merchant services in 2009 including Kmart, Sears (SHLD), Foot Locker (NYSE:FL), FAO Schwarz and Disney (NYSE:DIS).Free Cash FloweBay’s free cash flow continues to improve to nearly $600M in Q409.ValuationeBay has traditionally traded at higher multiples on revenues and earnings.

However, shares were up 8.1% after hours, as the company recorded a $1.1 profit per share on the sale of Skype.  Revenue  Gross revenue of $2.37 billion was up 5.9% sequentially and 16.5% year over year. Around 88% of total revenue was transactions-based, while the remaining 12% came from marketing services. Both existing segments contributed to the revenue increase in the last quarter.  Revenue by Segment  Marketplaces revenue increased 7.2% sequentially and 15.4% compared to the year-ago quarter. The sequential revenue increase was driven by a 5.9% increase in transaction revenue and a 14.2% increase in marketing services revenue. The year-over-year increase was due to a 16.6% increase in transaction value and a 10% increase in marketing services. Vehicles volume continued to decline both sequentially and year over year. The segment generated 62% of total revenue.  Payments revenue increased 15.6% sequentially and 27.7% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue from transactions was up 16.6% sequentially and 25.3% year over year, as both the number of active users and the number of transactions increased. Although the revenue generated per transaction declined, this was partially offset by the lower cost per transaction and lower transaction loss rate. Marketing services revenue was flat sequentially (down 0.8%), but up a whopping 104.2% from the year-ago quarter. The segment generated 34% of total revenue.  Communications revenue was down 39.5% sequentially and 22.9% from the year-ago quarter. Both comparisons were impacted by the sale of the unit (Skype) in November 2009. Transactions represented 92% of communications revenue, while marketing services accounted for the rest.  Revenue by Geography  Around 44% of total revenue was generated in the U.S., representing a sequential increase of 2.9% and year-over-year increase of 10.8%. The balance came from international markets, increasing 8.4% sequentially and 21.3% year over year. An increasing percentage of revenue from both Marketplaces and Payments segments is coming from international markets.  Margins  The pro forma gross margin for the quarter was 72.9%, up 113 bps from the previous quarter’s 71.7%, mainly due to a more favorable mix.  Marketplaces and Payments segments have been seeing shrinking gross margins over the past few quarters. Payments margins have seen the biggest declines, as revenue per transaction has been declining at a much faster rate than costs per transaction. Marketplaces margins have been impacted by the severe price competition in the online retail market, although margins are much higher than the Payments segment.  Operating expenses of $921.2 million were higher than the previous quarter’s $887.5 million. The operating margin was 34.0%, up 194 bps from the 32.1% recorded in the previous quarter. The increase was mainly attributable to the lower COGS (as a percentage of sales), helped by slightly lower product development and general & administrative expenses, partially offset by slightly higher sales & marketing expenses (as a percentage of sales).  Excluding the impact of restructuring charges, stock compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, provision for transaction and loan losses, the Joltid legal settlement charges, the gain on sale of Skype and the associated tax impact, the pro forma net income was $452.5 million or 19.1% net income margin, compared to $568.5 million or 25.4% in the previous quarter and $624.6 million or 30.7% in the year-ago quarter. Including special items, the GAAP EPS was $1.02 compared to $0.27 in the September 2009 quarter and $0.38 in the December quarter of last year.  Balance Sheet  The company has a solid balance sheet, with cash and short term investments of $4.94 billion, up $1.8 billion in the last quarter. The company generated $770.6 million in cash from operations and spent $172.9 million on capex, netting a free cash flow of $597.7 million. The company received $1.78 billion in cash for Skype, which was responsible for the increase in the cash balance.  Guidance  Management expects first quarter 2010 revenue of $2.1-2.2 billion, GAAP EPS of $0.29-0.31 and non GAAP EPS of $0.39-$0.41. The non GAAP EPS excludes intangibles amortization charges of $65-75 million, stock based compensation related charges of $$90-110 million and restructuring charges of $20-25 million.  For the full year, management expects revenue of $8.8-9.1 billion, GAAP EPS of $1.29-$1.34 and non GAAP EPS of $1.63-$1.68. The non GAAP EPS excludes intangibles amortization charges of $230-245 million, stock-based compensation related charges of $$410-440 million and restructuring charges of $20-25 million."

They partnered with Microsoft to offer up to 30% off on Bing (Live back then) cashback.  On top of that eBay flooded the marketplace with a ton of coupons (10% off $100, free ship, etc.)2009 - Back to TV (Come to think of it....)This year Bing bumped up from 8 to 10% cash back for CyberMonday which may seem decent, but compared to last year is paltry.  Last year, eBay was one of the only merchants in Bing Cashback, this year the program is very robust with hundreds of merchants and many of them offering 15% or more, so eBay actually feels under funded in that environment.  eBay doesn't seem to be running any major coupons that I've seen either.However, while eBay has pulled back from cashback and coupons, they are running TV spots and interactive media like nobody's business.One idea of why they would change strategies is maybe they evaluated the Q408 strategy and found it to be more cannibalistic (giving discounts to folks already going to buy on eBay) vs. incremental (new buyers).eBay is a no-show for CyberMonday :(I did a comprehensive survey this morning (CyberMonday morning) and pretty much every online retailer ran some great CyberMonday promos: Walmart.com (NYSE:WMT), Amazon,com (NASDAQ:AMZN), target.com (NYSE:TGT), toysrus.com, buy.com  - you name it, they were running strong CyberMonday promotions, highlighting great gifts, etc. Here's what eBay was running this morning: (click to enlarge)  You can look at this page with a microscope and you won't find the words Cyber or Monday and certainly not CyberMonday anywhere.  eBay is really missing the boat IMO by not joining with the rest of the online retail world and doing something special on this day.ConclusionWe're watching the data closely from BF and CM to see what early holiday shopping trends we are seeing - eBay Strategies readers, what are you seeing?

176957,21439,2009-12-07T15:42:37-05:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported last week that eBay.com saw 1m transactions on Black Friday and 1.4m transactions on Cyber Monday.  I've had a lot of people ask what that means and didn't have time until this weekend to really think about it.  It's always a good exercise and mentally stimulating to have a little fun with eBay math so I 'put a proverbial pin in it' and worked on it this weekend.The questions generally ranged from - Why is eBay saying it this way?  What is the GMV?  This number sounds good, but is it?  Is a million a lot?Some correspondents (usually skeptical sellers), believe that eBay is being 'cute' by reporting vague numbers that can be changed as they are not concrete.  For example, even the word transactions is somewhat ""squishy"" - is that an actual paid for item? What if someone buys 2 items, is that one transaction or two? Heck in the world of compsci, a search is effectively a transaction.This post assumes that what eBay is talking about when they say transactions are actual paid-for items, one per customer (pretty typical on eBay given there's no 'cart' system).Missing data points / assumptions made in this post.To answer the questions the 1m and 1.4m transaction/day datapoints raise we have to do some calculations to determine how this relates to the daily rate of transactions and what-not.  Unfortunately there are several datapoints that eBay doesn't provide regularly needed to compare these numbers to those that eBay does provide, but we can make some educated guesses at these.First, eBay doesn't tell us the number of transactions the site processes in total. However we can calculate that from GMV if we know the average selling price (ASP) per transaction because (transactions * ASP = GMV).For this article, I assume that eBay's ASP is $45.  This is what the ChannelAdvisor data shows (ex-vehicles) and I have read other reports that end up right in this range.Second, eBay doesn't report the split of GMV (or transactions) across geographies. They do however report the split of revenues and I believe that to be a safe proxy. eBay's revenues are 45% us-based and 55% non-domestic.  We'll go with that split in this article. With those 'plugs' in place, let's see what this data means.How many transactions does eBay process on a given day?Before we measure the scale of the 1/1.4m numbers, we have to understand the normal transaction volume on eBay to establish a baseline.  Unfortunately as best I can tell, eBay does not release transaction data, but they do release GMV data and other elements we can use to back into daily transactions.If you go to Q3, you find that eBay's global GMV was $12.2b for the Q (ex-autos).So using that we end up with $12.2b / 90 days = $135m in GMV/day. If we divide $135m by $45 ASP we get 3m transactions on any given day on eBay globally.All of eBay's PR around Cyber Monday and Black Friday has indicated 'ebay.com' which means US, but they didn't mention if autos are included or not.  All of my math thus far has excluded autos.  Honestly at the transaction level, eBay doesn't sell enough cars (in the thousands) to move the needle on these, but I wanted to point that out for clarity as it could cause the numbers to be slightly apples and oranges.If we then use the 45% split applied to the 3m transactions/day globally , then we arrive at 1.355m transactions/day on average on eBay US in Q3.The results are... disappointing?If that math is correct, Black Friday's 1m transactions were actually 25% below average and Cyber Monday was a paltry 3% above average.  Of course our assumptions could be off here, but they'd have to be off pretty significantly to change these results.  Also they are based off of real-world datapoints so they are far from guesses.The biggest variable out there is eBay's definition of transaction.  They did base these neat heat map things on this data and I looked at that and best I can tell a transaction is a single sold item.One last area if discrepancy I can think of is UnPaid Items (UPIs).  UPIs are unique to eBay and the scourge of sellers.  Essentially a buyer can start a transaction on eBay and not pay very easily.  I believe that eBay counts UPIs in GMV (GMV is not complete/paid transactions) and maybe they don't include those in transactions.  The average UPI rate runs in the 10% range (but swings wildly as high as 30% for some) for our customers, so it could be that transactions exclude UPIs and GMV includes UPIs which would cause my numbers to be off by about 10%.  In other words  the 1.35m transactions based off GMV are actually 1.2m 'paid-for' transactions. eBay and the Holiday sales period.If we assume the data is right and eBay didn't have a special Black Friday or Cyber Monday, then is that cause for alarm?  Actually, I don't think so.  I've already mentioned some of the headwinds eBay faces due to the change in the Bing cashback strategy.  Also, for the years I've followed eBay they always are more back-end loaded vs. other online retailers during the holiday period.  My educated guess is that eBay becomes the go-to marketplace when inventories for various items online/offline sell out.  Usually eBay's sales peak around mid December where-as last year, the peak for online retailers ex-eBay was around Cyber Monday.  So eBay has plenty of running room over the next two weeks to completely crush that 1.4m transaction mark.  I'd fully expect them to have a day that was near double that before the end of the year.What do you think?eBay strategies readers - do you think eBay was being clever with this metric to make it seem significant when it wasn't or do you think my calculations are off?  Sound off in comments.  I'll update this post if I learn anything new on the topic or if eBay clarifies their definition of a transaction.Disclosure - I am long Google and Amazon.  eBay is an investor in ChannelAdvisor where I am CEO."

William is the Lead Portfolio Manager on SCM's large cap portfolios as well as the firm's proprietary mutual fund.We asked William to share his single highest conviction position and provide his investment thesis.• • •What is your highest conviction stock position in your fund - long or short?eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is our top stock pick and the number one position in the Smead Value Fund (SMVLX).First, eBay is a sum of the parts story. They own PayPal, Bill Me Later, StubHub, 28% of Craigslist, 30% of Skype, 5 of the 6 largest online classified advertising firms in the world, the greatest online auction business in the world and sit on 5-plus billion dollars in cash with no debt. If all these businesses trade on a stand-alone basis, the stock could be 50% greater than the current price. Here's my breakdown:Marketplace: At a 18 P/E =  $22.48 (Includes StubHub, 28% of Craigslist, 5 of the 6 largest online classified businesses)PayPal: At a 30 P/E =         $ 9.60 (includes Bill Me Later)Skype and Cash:     $ 4.48Total:                          $36.56How would you describe eBay's competitive environment? How is it  positioned vis a vis its competitors? eBay is a growth story. As the years go by and my children become middle-aged, buying and selling online will be as normal as drinking water out of the tap. Imagine all the transactions PayPal will take a small piece of and think about the earnings leverage and free cash flow. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) started a payment system a few years back and has all the resources you’d want, yet it has not made a dent in PayPal’s moat. PayPal recently opened its platform up to developers and the future business opportunities for eBay are boundless.If Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) recent success were the benchmark for all retailers and online businesses, everyone would look terrible in comparison. We believe that eBay is becoming a massive toll bridge in online classified advertising and online payments. They aren’t the merchandiser that Amazon is, but we didn’t use AMZN’s 60 P/E in our analysis either. The economy caused a severe consumer contraction and compared to most retailers, eBay held up great.Can you talk about valuation and how it compares to the competitors?eBay is a worldwide brand and a business with no inventory, and most investors don’t yet recognize the premium which should be placed on its P/E multiple. For comparison, Amazon is a great company and could generate $1.2 billion of cash flow in 2009. Amazon has a market cap of around $60 billion. eBay has a market cap of around $30 billion, yet should generate over $2.1 billion in cash flow this year. Why is eBay trading at less than 15 times earnings net of cash while Amazon trades for 56 times earnings net of cash?What is the current sentiment on the stock? How does your view differ from the consensus?Consensus is that the marketplace business is generally in decline, but we don’t agree. The last two quarters have seen significant improvement in listing conversion and gross margin volume. This can be tied to free shipping, progress on search, progress on selection, progress with top-rated sellers, safety improvements and other changes. The Marketplace business does pump out over a billion dollars of cash flow currently.What catalysts do you see that could move the stock?We prefer to be buy and hold investors and always assume that time is our catalyst. If you are going to own a stock for three to five years, it really doesn’t make much difference which part of the first three years produce the mark up in the price of the shares.For other investors, it will probably be earnings surprises which will drive the stock or it might be the sale of various parts of the company over the years as in the case of Skype. We love to invest in powerful brands, and eBay owns a bunch of them. Short of nuclear proliferation or a worldwide flu pandemic, we see a very bright future for eBay.What could go wrong with this stock pick? Three events could ruin our thesis on eBay:1.     A viable rival to PayPal2.     An economic depression3.     A buyout by Amazon (like AOL buying Time Warner (NYSE:TWX)). We would make a huge short-term gain and get cut off of the long-term growth.Disclosure: long EBAY"

You can follow the official eBay Announcement board here for details.  At the time of writing, it looks like we're going on a 6hr+ outage here.The problems manifest themselves in zero search results like you see here.  It's interesting that eBay chooses this behavior instead of a page saying the site is down. You'll notice that the sponsored listings and other advertisements are all doing just fine. This is a bad buyer experience IMO because it makes it seem like eBay has zero (ipods, xbox, etc.)There was a similar, but shorter outage last in in October.  There are four general buckets of problems that will impact a search engine like this:Judging by the hint given in the AB post - ""errors in our  backend systems"", I'm going to go with the 'existing system bug' theory, but it's all speculation at this point until we learn more.One thing is clear, this doesn't give anyone in the eBay ecosystem confidence that the site will be up and robust for the critical next 30 day prime time holiday selling period.Impact on sellersSellers are asking us if there will be some form of compensation from eBay.  I believe eBay has to declare it an outage first and then they automatically extend listings 24 hours as compensation.  You could theoretically argue that this isn't an outage as the front end of the site is up.  That's an empty argument as it's like saying your car is starts fine even though it has four flat tires.The 'extend listings 24hrs' thing is a kick back to the auction orientation of the site and doesn't really apply to today's fixed price world where a days worth of sales have been effectively lost and extending listings won't bring 'em back.Speaking of SPOFs, we've been guiding sellers that putting all of your eggs in one basket isn't prudent.

The company also retained an approximately 30 percent equity investment in Skype.The company also purchased senior debt securities with a face value of $50 million as part of a Skype debt financing.The news of the completion of the sale of the successful Internet communication company comes two weeks after Skype founders Niklas Zennström and Janus Friis announced that they had reached a settlement with eBay in return for a 14% stake and board seats, clearing the way for the deal to close after some very public legal quarrels.As you may remember, Andreessen Horowitz partner Marc Andreessen swiftly deemed Skype one of the most important companies on the Internet after the settlement was reached and announced (and made quite a strong case for it).TechCrunch was first to report the imminent sale of Skype to the investor group back in August 2009 and shortly after confirmed that the deal would value the company at $2.75 billion.

The money was in escrow and was going to close” even if the lawsuits weren’t settled. The transaction is on track to close later this quarter. The other investors are Silver Lake Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Index Ventures and Mike Volpi are out of the deal. Josh Silverman will continue to be CEO.Andreessen is glad that the lawsuits are settled and that the “Joltid IP is now owned by Skype,” but was prepared to litigate if it didn’t work out. He explains: “This was a completely known situation going into it. It was one of the reasons the deal was available, because of the situation. We assumed it would be a good idea to bring the founders on board and resolve all the issues, we are very pro-founder. There was some drama along the way, but we came out with everybody in the same boat rowing in the same direction.”In addition to legal avenues, Skype also had the option to try to switch to a different technology, such as SIP-based Internet telephony. “Had this not happened,” says Andreessen, “there were various technological paths that could have been followed. Now that it is settled, it is not necessary to make any changes. The technology is scaling very well.”Skype is on a $740 million revenue run-rate and boasts 521 million users worldwide. “Skype is gigantic and yet still a relatively small percentage of international call volume,” notes Andreesen. “This is, and ought to be, one of the most important companies on the Internet.Now that the deal drama is over, we’ll get to find out.Original post"

And there’s a good reason for eBay to bolster its mobile offering: the company says its mobile GMV (value of goods sold) via its iPhone app and mobile website (m.ebay.com) is on track to top half a billion dollars by the end of this year.Impressive number, and that’s not the end of the story. eBay also shared that its mobile GMV is growing at a double-digit rate month-over-month, and that approximately half of its 750,000 unique mobile users per month are situated outside the United States. Another interesting tidbit: eBay says 1 item is purchased every 2 seconds through its mobile offering.Earlier this year, eBay CEO John Donahoe told a conference audience that the value of goods sold through the eBay iPhone app alone would exceed $400 million, and that an upgraded version of the app was imminent. That updated app should now be available, and it gained a little brother, too.Version 1.5 of the eBay iPhone application (iTunes link), which the company says has been downloaded 5 million times to date, should now be live on the App Store – in 8 languages and in 77 countries. It boasts a streamlined interface that lets buyers and sellers manage their eBay activity and accounts directly from their iPhone devices, Daily Deal access, social media and e-mail sharing options (new), ‘Buy It Now’ capabilities, push notification alerts (also new) and a more powerful integration with PayPal.The e-commerce giant is also debuting a new app, called Deals (iTunes link – US store only), that basically gives iPhone and iPod Touch users a way to access the seemingly never-ending stream of bargains among hundreds of millions eBay listings. The app has built-in integration with social networks like Facebook and Twitter, making it easier for buyers to share their shopping activity with other and even build consensus around deals with their friends. Nice touch: you can shake your device to refresh the deals on display.eBay has released the new app just in time for its ‘12 Days Of Deals’ program, that will commence this Friday, November 27.Anyone still believe e-commerce via mobile isn’t worth the effort?Original post"

Seller reaction was negative with an occasional positive of 'at least they are doing something this year' as you can see in the comments of that post.Tuesday, eBay has a microsite up here, that shows off all of the new holiday ad campaigns.  Here's the blurb used to introduce the campaign:They are split into categories: TV, Web Videos, Print, Rich Media banners and Other banners. Let's briefly tour each.TalentThere are three, well four, folks in the ads that are all up and coming comedians from Comedy Central.Here's a funny sketch from the Michaels that will prime you for the eBay ads:TVThere are three TV ad 'flavors':Personally, I'd have to rate Michaels/Camera #1, Kevin/TV #2 and then they fall off from there.  What do you think?Web VideosThe web videos feature the same three folks (Kevin, Jim and the Michaels):PrintThere are seven different print ads - each featuring a product picture with a tag line in the bottom left with the 'come to think of it' tag at the end.  For example, Jeans says ""New designer jeans for fifty percent off still make your butt look completely amazing."" Other products are purse, cookware, tv, mp3 player, drill and crib.  The most snarky is the crib: ""Your baby won't know it's last year's model.  Babies don't know anything.""Rich Media banners and other banners (online)The three rich media banners are pretty clever- this fashion one features a walking model and you can see pop outs of all the clothes she is wearing and then find that stuff on eBay. The other two are cookware (Mark Sullivan is chef) and  mp3 player plays a Sydney Wayser song on a nondescript mp3 player.The other banner ads are categorical and target: apparel, cameras, gifts, golf and cutlery with some clever little animations - for example you cut a tomato and pear with the virtual knife.ConclusionAfter seeing the complete campaign, the whole thing is growing on me.  I'm still not a fan of the 'come to think of it' tag-line, but I do like that they are showing a very wide range of things here from new to used to refurb and golf, cutlery, apparel, etc.  The comedians for the TV commercials were a nice touch and add some personality to things which should help get attention.  The ads started running on 11/3 so we'll report in if we see any bump in traffic or transactions from the campaign.

Skype founders Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis also got a 14% slice of the company, after settling litigation between their latest project, Joltid Ltd., and Skype that alleged patent violations (The Deal Pipeline subscribers can read more about the settlement here). EBay said it got about $1.9 billion in cash and a $125 million note. As Skype president Josh Silverman said in a brief blog post, ""Say hello to the future."" There's no doubt that the company will be better off independent than it was within eBay, which acquired Skype for $2.6 billion in 2005 and never figured out how to make the deal work. With the Joltid settlement, Skype has control over the intellectual property necessary to keep its peer-to-peer technology working.

That’s a stunning 40 million new registered users in the past three months. Revenues grew 29 percent to $185 million. Free Skype-to-Skype minutes grew 74 percent to 27.7 billion minutes, whereas SkypeOut minutes (which is what members pay for) grew 44 percent to 3.1 billion minutes.All of those SkypeOut calls translated to a healthy $185 million in revenues, up 29 percent from a year ago. If it keeps up at this pace, it should easily be able to exceed its $1 billion annual revenue goal by 2011.Skype was one of the few bright spots in eBay’s earnings, along with Paypal, which brought in $688 million in revenues (up 15 percent). eBay’s bread-and-butter marketplaces business was down 1 percent to $1.365 billion.eBay Q309EarningsSlides FINAL Original post"

168463,22762,2009-10-23T05:38:31-04:00,,"By Leena RaoWednesday, eBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) third-quarter results were bitter sweet, with profits declining 29 percent from the same quarter last year. But year-over-year revenue increased for the first time in the past year, thanks in part of strong results posted by PayPal (and Skype). The payments processor saw its revenue rise to $668.1 million, up 15 percent compared to last year, and the number of active registered accounts grew by nearly 20 percent in the quarter to 78 million.What is notable is that the number of online merchants using PayPal separately from eBay continues to rise, with the external use now at 56% of total volume, up from 51% last year. And the company has stated that 44 of the top 100 U.S. retailers offer PayPal as a payment option.Added to the mix of PayPal’s steady success is the company’s strategy of opening up its platform to developers to fuel even more viral growth outside of eBay’s own platform. PayPal recently announced its Adaptive Payments API, which gives developers full and open access to PayPal’s payment processing features, allowing them a lot more freedom in building applications which incorporate PayPal, which includes the ability to accept and distribute payments.Paypal’s Adaptive Payments has built-in micropayments support, and also offers “Chained Payments,” which lets developers create applications that enable a sender to send a single payment to a primary receiver who may keep part of the payment and pay other, secondary receivers with the remainder of the funds. For example, an application might be an online travel agency that handles bookings for airfare, hotel reservations, and car rentals. The sender sees only the travel site as the primary receiver. But that site could allocate the payment for its commission and the actual cost of services provided by other merchants. PayPal would deduct the money from the sender’s account and deposit it in both the primary travel site’s account and the secondary receivers’ accounts. It sounds complicated but in execution it’s much simpler and fairly innovative.Adaptive Payments will also offer “Parallel Payments,” which would let a sender send a single payment to multiple receivers. An example of this type of application might be a shopping cart that lets a buyer pay for items from several merchants with one payment. The shopping cart would allocate the payment to the merchants who actually provided the items. PayPal would then deduct money from the sender’s account and deposits it in the receivers’ accounts. FundRazr, Lottay, TwitPay and Payvment, which helps set up e-commerce retail stores on Facebook, are both using this API to power their applications.And PayPal’s APIs aren’t just getting attention from startups; some of the biggest players in technology are investing resources in the API. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) cloud computing platform Azure are utilizing Adaptive Payments to let developers who are building applications using PayPal seamless integrate their applications with Azure’s platform. Microsoft is working with PayPal to help developers easily embed billing and payment functionality into applications built off Azure and will offer interoperability between Azure and Adaptive Payments.At the Web 2.0 summit Wednesday, PayPal president Scott Thompson, said that the company is working with consumer tech companies, mobile device manufacturers, and software companies to incorporate the new APIs in applications. Thompson also emphasized that PayPal has international ambitions, with hopes that the API will be used across the world in various currencies (currently PayPal transactions can be conducted in 19 currencies). The ambition, which is articulated well in this futuristic video, is for consumers to be able to make a payment from any device, whether that be a TV, mobile device, or computer (it’s sort of similar to Microsoft chief software architect Ray Ozzie’s three screens strategy). Thompson added that a dozens of additional APIs will be released in the coming year, creating an unprecedented open platform for online payments development.So where does PayPal’s primary competitor Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), fit into the mix? Amazon’s fledgling Flexible Payments API is similar in theory to PayPal’s Adaptive Payments API and offers some of the same functionality. But PayPal’s platform is being marketed very aggressively to both developers and the greater tech community, with the company even throwing a conference around the public release of the API. PayPal appears to be evangelizing its API everywhere, publicly campaigning that the payments platform will change how consumers will pay in the future.There’s been some rumors about eBay possibly spinning off PayPal, thanks to PayPal’s continued strength in the marketplace. Donahoe “regularly asks himself whether eBay is hampering PayPal’s development,” Bloomberg reports, via the NY Post. “When I feel the business will be better off separately, we’ll do what we did with Skype,” he said.Original post"

165607,21376,2009-10-08T16:50:54-04:00,,"Don’t be fooled. Even though there hasn’t been any news on the various lawsuits around Skype’s intellectual property ownership, that doesn’t mean things aren’t happening behind the scenes.Negotiations continue, say multiple sources, between eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), the new proposed Skype owner group, and the original founders Janus Friis and Niklas Zennstrom, via their company Joltd, in what is turning into a very high stakes and very emotional game of poker.Joltid first sued eBay/Skype in July 2009, claiming breach of a license agreement that granted Skype the use of key technology.Multiple sources have confirmed to us that settlement negotiations were underway with Joltid to give the company a percentage of Skype to drop the litigation. Joltid was to receive “between 5% and 15% of Skype” to settle.But the announcement of an agreement to sell most of Skype to a new investor group scuttled the settlement, say our sources, because of the massive debt that the company would be burdened with following the closing. Part of the purchase price for Skype is lender financed, and the debt would be on Skype’s books.The breakdown in negotiations led to the second Joltid lawsuit. Our sources say that a settlement should be possible, but that emotions are keeping the parties apart. “We’re talking about some very rich, very emotionally immature people here. On both sides of the table. It’s not about money, it’s about saving face.”  The fact that so much of the conflict is playing out in the press is evidence of this as well.There’s another odd issue here as well. In the first lawsuit, Joltid claimed that Skype misused Joltid source code: “In particular, Joltid has alleged that Skype should not possess, use or modify certain software source code and that, by doing so, and by disclosing such code in certain U.S. patent cases pursuant to orders from U.S. courts, Skype has breached the license agreement.”But the second lawsuit by Joltid claims that Skype never had the source code to begin with. The lawsuit’s goal is to prevent them from getting it. From the lawsuit: “An executable-only object code form of the GI Software was licensed by Joltid to Skype, a well-known Internet-based company that provides users throughout the world with free or low-cost telephone services over the Internet. Skype did not obtain a license to the GI Software source code, however, and the license it did obtain was terminated based on Skype’s breaches of the license agreement.”Our sources say that Skype does indeed have the GI software source code, although it isn’t clear if they have a right to it or not. The key issue seems to be that they modified that software and disclosed it to third parties.Skype has long been attempting to rewrite their P2P engine so that they wouldn’t have to rely on that Joltid code, we’ve heard from former employees, but they’ve been unsuccessful to date. Skype can move away from P2P to a purely SIP based infrastructure, but bandwidth costs would skyrocket. Skype is supposedly 7% of all international long distance minutes today, mostly from Skype to Skype calls that use the P2P backend. Paying bandwidth charges on those calls isn’t attractive, and Skype appears to be unable to develop a P2P based SIP infrastructure that performs well.Game theory suggests that the multiple parties would work the situation out. Shutting down Skype just doesn’t make sense. But as we said, emotions are running hot right now, and now no one seems to want to back down.The buyers group has certain protections from the litigation in their purchase agreement. Specifically, they don’t have to close the deal if there are injunctions around the lawsuit (meaning Joltid wins). And if the transaction closes, eBay is on the hook for 50% of any damages.The likely outcome of all of this remains the same – Joltid will get a stake of some size in Skype. But given the players involved, anything could still happen.Original post"

Non-GAAP earnings were $501.5 million, or 38 cents a share, a penny better than Wall Street estimates.

Operating margin fell to 19.8 percent in the quarter, down from 24.7 percent a year ago. The margin decline was largely attributed to eBay’s Bill Me Later unit and a weaker U.S. dollar. Bill Me Later had a net charge-off rate of 11.5 percent as bankruptcy and credit write-offs increased.  The outlook was roughly on par with estimates. For the fourth quarter, eBay projected earnings of 28 cents a share to 30 cents a share. On a non-GAAP basis eBay projected earnings of 38 cents a share to 40 cents a share.

One thing of value that I have discovered is analyzing sentiment moves in a stock ahead of the company’s earnings release.  In the case of eBay, I will use the piqqem sentiment index for eBay to see how sentiment has changed in the last quarter, for the months within that quarter, and from the end of the reporting quarter through today.I’m looking for moves or changes that may foreshadow the earning release. (piqqem leverages the ‘wisdom of crowds’ by allowing its users to vote on the price direction of a stock and then applies its own propriety factors to calculate sentiment for a security. In their model, 0 is the lowest and 4 is the highest sentiment).  Source: PiqqemThe above chart shows eBay’s sentiment decreasing by 5% from the beginning of the quarter to today. The chart also shows that sentiment increased by 4% from the end of Q3 thru today. This last indicator has historically been the most accurate indicator regarding an earnings surprise, both upside and downside. On the Piqqem scale, eBay’s sentiment rating of 2.53 indicates moderate quality and this is considered a hold.  Only eBay knows their actual results, but their current sentiment points to eBay delivering earnings in a narrow range around $.37/share on Wednesday.Disclosure: No Positions"

The federal appeals court affirmed without comment the dismissal of claims brought by Peer Communications, a subsidiary of Acacia Research Corporation, reports Law360.Acacia Research’s subisidiaries are in the business (PDF) of acquiring, developing, licensing and enforcing patents, according to its website.One of those subsidiaries, Peer Communications, filed the patent case in August 2006 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The court ruled in favor of Skype and eBay swiftly, but the case then went on to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which has now affirmed the lower court’s decision.The two patents are somewhat related, to be fair. They deal with “a uniform user interface for network access that can enable a network agent to access multiple discrete network services,” according to court filing documents. The technology contributes to a system that allows groups of loosely interconnected agents to communicate contemporaneously without intermediaries such as a servers and to exchange data. A quick Web search reveals that the actual patent holder is most likely Miami-based Sociocybernetics, which has held such a patent in the U.S. since November 2005.It’s a small victory for Skype/eBay, who is neck deep in far more serious litigation than this patent case.

165402,21435,2009-10-07T18:44:31-04:00,,"Bloomberg.com on Wednesday highlighted the turnaround in sales for Ebay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) online marketplace in its Chart of the Day.The firm that pioneered the online auction process has reported sales declines for fixed-price items for at least twelve consecutive months dating back to July 2008 (the first month it was tracked by ChannelAdvisor), but retailers selling their goods on EBay have seen sales tick up in the past two months. While this study is not comprehensive of all merchants on Ebay, it is representative of an important step in the progression of EBay from an auction house to a a site that sells fixed-price items as well.Consensus analysts’ estimates are calling for overall revenue growth from EBay of less than 1% in the third quarter. The rise of fixed-price items is an encouraging trend as EBay’s auction business has started to drift away to lower cost competitors. Whether this strategy will in fact be a winner for EBay is too early to tell, but analysts are becoming more bullish on the stock. According to Yahoo Finance, upgrades outnumber downgrades 6 to 0 in the last six months, and earnings estimates for this year and the next are both trending higher.At Ockham, we continue to believe that EBay is Greatly Undervalued at the current price level. EBAY has been beaten down by the market, as there have been legitimate questions about the business model, but the company is starting to show that it is diversifying its business away from an auctioneer to a complete e-commerce powerhouse.For some time now, EBay has seemed sort of adrift at sea. They undoubtedly have productive assets in the online marketplace and Paypal payment processing, as well as high-potential assets like Skype.

164192,20362,2009-10-01T03:39:11-04:00,,"I've recently criticized  Yahoo!'s (YHOO) Carol Bartz and  Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) Mark Hurd for excessive pay and perks, given their companies' performances.  My focus on Silicon Valley gluttony would be incomplete without discussing the perks at eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).After founding eBay in September 1995 and overseeing all aspects of the business for the first three years, Pierre Omidyar decided he had a tiger by the tail and needed some professional management. He hired Meg Whitman, a Harvard MBA with stints at Bain, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS), FTD, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Stride Rite, as CEO in March 1998. The company went public six months later and has been a runaway success.eBay is an incredible entrepreneurial story. Omidyar and his first employee, Jeff Skoll, deserve countless wealth for creating a multibillion dollar company from nothing. Along the way, Skoll -- who no longer holds any eBay stock -- cashed out equity worth $5.3 billion. Omidyar, still chairman, has cashed out about $3.5 billion to date, but his remaining equity stake is worth another $3.8 billion at current market prices. He now lives in Hawaii and is a philanthropist. And with as much wealth as they've created for themselves, Omidyar and Skoll have created more for others and should be celebrated for this success.Whitman, who stepped down as CEO last year and now has ambitions to become governor in California in 2010, had a net positive record overseeing eBay. She rode a rocket ship of growth -- getting through the early days of frequent Web site crashes -- and ultimately got it to be a $60 billion company in late 2004; it's about half that valuation today.Yet Whitman's final years at eBay leave her open to criticism. She promoted a drunken-sailor approach to acquisitions, always overpaying and making little effort to stitch them together. A culmination was the $4.1 billion purchase of Skype in 2005 (including all payouts), in which she took an auction and e-commerce site into the phone business.Potentially more damaging in the long-run for eBay than overpaying was that Whitman didn't get the intellectual property associated with Skype. This has allowed Skype's founders to now come back and sue eBay for trying to unload the property recently at a valuation of $2.75 billion.Although Whitman hasn't done as well as Omidyar and Skoll, she's been well-compensated for her time as CEO. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Whitman was paid $47 million in total compensation between 1998 and 2008. Additionally, she sold eBay stock during that time worth about $732 million. She still owns stock in the company as of the end of last year worth another $500 million at today's valuation, as well as additional stock options that will have renewed value if eBay's stock gets above $31.I believe Whitman deserves every nickel of compensation and stock sale proceeds she got between her joining the company in 1998 and Jan. 1, 2005. Since then, however, eBay has been in a tailspin with the stock down 59% vs. a Nasdaq decline of 3% over the same period. eBay's new CEO John Donahoe was hand-picked by Whitman because he used to work with her at Bain. He has spent the first two years on the job trying to give the company some sense of focus and direction, which it lacked under his predecessor.Something happened in Whitman's last four years on the job in which her pay became dramatically disconnected with eBay's stock price and her perks started to go through the roof.Based on my review of the company's SEC proxy filings, it appears that there were two big clues for investors that suggested, between 2005 and 2008, Whitman's interest had drifted away from increasing the stock price of eBay to increasing her cash compensation and perks. Had anyone seen these clues -- and, interestingly, perhaps Skoll did as he liquidated his entire eBay stake in 2006 -- they might have pulled the ripcord on owning the stock in 2006 or 2007 when it was trading at $35, before the bottom fell out in the stock and it hit its nadir below $10 this past March.The first big clue that Whitman's eye was no longer on the ball as CEO had to do with her total annual compensation spiking in the last two full years of her tenure, even as eBay's stock price continued to decline. Peaking at $58 at the start of 2005, eBay's stock price dropped 43% over the next three years. Over that same period, Whitman's total annual compensation almost quintupled to $13.9 million from $2.9 million.One of the interesting coincidences, and perhaps not a coincidence at all, about the above figure is that Whitman's annual compensation is remarkably modest from 1998 through 2002. Over that time period, she averaged total annual pay of $412,000. During that time, there were three members of eBay's compensation committee: Philippe Bourguignon, ex-CEO of EuroDisney; Bob Kagle, general partner of Benchmark Capital and early eBay investor; and Howard Schultz, the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) founder who also is a venture partner in Maveron, an early eBay backer.At the end of 2002, Schultz left eBay's board and compensation committee. He was replaced by Tom Tierney. Tierney was formerly the CEO of Bain Consulting and, indirectly, Whitman's old boss. Tierney would pass any stock exchange definition of an ""independent"" director. But for those of us who live in the real world, it is obvious that Whitman had a new friend in the small group deciding how she would be paid.It should come as no surprise then that this committee immediately started loosening the purse strings, and for the years 2003 to 2007, just before she resigned, Whitman's total annual compensation averaged $7.6 million.The second big clue that Whitman was no longer as focused on eBay's fortunes in her final four years as CEO was the amount of time she spent flying around the world on personal business in eBay's corporate jet, which was paid for by eBay shareholders.As the chart below illustrates, eBay's compensation committee (again perhaps indirectly linked to Tierney's arrival) went from a practice of not granting Whitman any personal air travel on the corporate jet paid by the shareholders to almost $1 million a year in her final two full years on the job.That $1 million includes tax gross-ups, meaning shareholders also paid Whitman's taxes on the benefit she received of making all those flights instead of the billionaire paying her taxes herself. These two years of lavish perks coincided with a time when eBay's stock dropped 22%, even though Nasdaq was up 17% in the same period. I took HP's Hurd to task last week for spending almost $150,000 last year on personal air travel in HP's jet and charging it to his shareholders.  So, I'm just flabbergasted seeing that Whitman spent more than $1 million on personal air travel in 2006. How do you do that? And how does Whitman and eBay's compensation committee justify trying to brazenly sneak that large expense report past shareholders, especially when the stock is tanking during the ginned-up, credit-fueled boom of 2006?I don't follow California politics -- although I'm a fervent supporter of free market capitalism as advocated by Milton Friedman -- but I find it highly ironic and disingenuous of Whitman to portray herself now as a populist based on her time at eBay. According to a glowing Fortune profile of her political ambitions last March, the only ""dirt"" her critics have been able to dig up on her is that she voted in only half the elections for which she was eligible in the last decade. She explained it this way: ""I was head down, building eBay, with two teenage sons and a neurosurgeon husband, and traveling half the time.""She was certainly traveling half the time -- for personal vacation jaunts, all paid by eBay shareholders.In the last two years, perhaps self-conscious at just how embarrassing these numbers were, eBay decided to break up the personal air travel perks into two categories: purely personal travel and travel to outside board meetings. Whitman was on the boards of Procter & Gamble and DreamWorks Animation (NASDAQ:DWA) in the last two years of her tenure. So some of her million-dollar expense went to shuttling her to L.A. and Cincinnati several times a year for these meetings.I can understand why eBay burnished Whitman's personal network to serve on those boards and rub shoulders with Steven Spielberg and other luminaries, but how did serving on those boards help eBay shareholders? They say that while Rome burned, Nero fiddled. At eBay in 2006, while the stock dropped and the Skype merger was a mess, Whitman flew to Hawaii and other locales on a private jet paid for from the shareholders' bank account.So, a question to the eBay compensation committee: Who do you think you are? With the exception of HP, no other tech company foists off this extravagant perk on its shareholders. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) don't do it. Even Yahoo! -- the king of excessive compensation -- doesn't do this. What makes eBay so special?Most troubling about this ""CEO entitlement mentality"" that Whitman adopted in her final years on the job is that she's passed the habit on to her successor. Donahoe racked up almost $280,000 worth of personal aircraft expenses in his first nine months on the job in 2008. I can't wait to see what he can do this year with a full 12 months.I doubt he's ever had to answer to why he's indulging himself in this ridiculous expense. If asked, I suspect he'd look blankly ahead and say something like, ""Well, Meg said it was OK.""It's time for eBay to grow up and stamp out these excesses. Just because you've always done something dumb doesn't mean you should keep doing it. Make your well-compensated execs pay their own way on personal trips using the corporate jet, and start linking pay for performance. Donahoe made $13.1 million last year for his nine months as CEO, while eBay's stock dropped 55%, far wider than Nasdaq's 30% loss in that same period.eBay's board, particularly its compensation committee, needs to turn the page on the Meg Whitman era and get its executives focused on the tough task at hand in turning around the company instead of worrying about their next tee time.Disclosure: At the time of publication, Jackson had no positions in the stocks mentioned.This article was originally published in TheStreet.com"
162321,21439,2009-09-20T14:19:24-04:00,,A retailer we work with for Comparison Shopping Engines (CSE) recently emailed as they were really confused about a promotion they were sent by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) pictured here:
162077,20568,2009-09-17T15:54:48-04:00,,"Skype founders Janus Friis and Niklas Zennstrom recently filed a lawsuit against eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), claiming that there had been a breach in agreement by which it licensed key communication technology enabling phone calls over the Internet. Joltid Ltd., a firm owned by the co-founders, estimates that damages could amount to as much as $75 million per day.This is not the first time that Skype has filed complaints. In the U.K., lawsuits over global index software have been continuing for some time. Joltid stated that the technology licensing agreement had been terminated as Skype had obtained unauthorized copies of the source code and sold modified versions to third parties. However, Skype stated that the allegations were without merit.After buying Skype back in 2005, eBay made a subsequent payment of $530 million to its technology founders. It also wrote off $1.4 billion in 2007, as the initial purchase price was too high.The sale of the 65% stake in Skype to private equity firm Silver Lake would be a positive for eBay, as it would bring home some immediate cash, aid focus on its core business and also leave open a healthy stream of cash flows for the future.The sale would also be a positive for Skype, allowing it to focus on the development of the core technology. Moreover, Silver Lake owns telecom equipment company Avaya, so there could be some synergistic bundling of offerings.Skype has developed mobile applications for Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iphones and Research In Motion’s (RIMM) Blackberry handsets. The company also agreed to embed its services on some Nokia (NOK - Snapshot Report) handset models. These areas could also be further developed.eBay said that the sale was on track to be completed in the fourth quarter. However, there could be a hitch in the contract as the buyers would have to agree to the terms of settlement with Joltid. Moreover, any new technology that could have a negative impact on Skype’s business could also put an end to it."

Let’s get that out of the way.Kazaa was a disruptive and destructive force in music that took the baton from Napster after the RIAA killed the popular file sharing software.   But Kazaa’s fate was no different than Napster’s.Skype, on the other hand, was not only disruptive but also wildly profitable.  The duo cashed out admirably in a sale to eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).  It turned out, of course, that eBay bought everything but the underlying technology.Joost was a disaster from Day 1, and as one of our distribution partners, that was clear from Day 1.  We tried to tell them all of the things they were doing wrong, to no avail.Regardless, even if every other project they touch fails, they have made their mark - and earned their fortunes - with the sale of Skype.  However, I wonder if this has made them lose their senses.In fact, I think that it’s a good thing that they seem to have begun to focus on investments through their Atomico Investments, because I think they are damaging their own reputation as entrepreneurs and businessmen with the way they have handled everything since the sale of Skype.For one, selling eBay the company without the technology is just bad form, even if the clueless Meg Whitman didn’t see a problem with this.  I understand Friis and Zennstrom planned to use the underlying Joltid peer-to-peer Global Index technology for subsequent projects, including Joost, but it is simply bad form.  What they should have done is worthy of a separate article.However, the fact that they are now suing former Joost CEO and Chairman Mike Volpi is also bad form, because I don’t think that they will be able to recruit as many would-be CEOs in the future.  By the looks of it, if what they allege is true, Mr. Volpi has also acted questionably, but at some point, you cut your losses and walk away.As an entrepreneur, I inquired about Atomico way back in the day (full disclaimer: Atomico since invested in DECA, another content producer, though it isn't really competitive with WatchMojo.com), but seeing how they have gone about this eBay/Volpi mess… you have to ask yourself, if you are an entrepreneur, does this saga make you more or less interested in partnering with them?The answer to that question should trouble current investors.Further reading on this saga:From GigaOm:PaidContent:and Tech Crunch re: the technical aspect of why Skype could never open up to developers:This is getting ridiculous.  Is there anyone in this saga that doesn’t stink, basically?"
164993,21382,2009-10-06T04:59:20-04:00,,"Over the past few months, Skype has been testing click-to-call ads on the Web, partnering with local-business directories who pay for the calls. Tuesday, Skype is set to announce the official roll-out of its click-to-call advertising service with European Directories, one of the largest local business directory services in Europe.Part of Skype’s latest version for Windows (Skype 4.1) comes with a browser plug-in that lights up phone numbers on Web pages. Users can click on the numbers to automatically launch a Skype call, but they pay for the SkypeOut minutes. Skype is taking the same functionality and making those calls free to consumers by partnering with directory listing services who pay for them instead.Initially, European Directories will pass along the calls for no additional charge to its business customers. Eventually, it hopes to demonstrate the value of the calls and charge for them on a click-per-call basis. As I explained back in April:And that is exactly what it has done. Free calls, paid for by partners, are highlighted in blue when encountered on a Webpage, while regular SkypeOut calls are highlighted in gray.Turning phone numbers found on the Web into ads could help Skype open up a significant new line of revenue. But already Skype is playing catch-up against younger rivals. Yext, one of this year’s TechCrunch50 crop which just raised $25 million in new funding, has been turning online directory listings into click-to-call leads for years.Now, Yext is moving beyond simple click-to-call ads to pay-per-action ads based on what people actually say in the call and monitored by sophisticated speech-to-text software. Skype has “no plans to do anything based on what someone is saying on the call,” says Don Albert, Skype’s Vice President of Advertising. And it might not have to. If it can get just a small portion of its 480 million users worldwide to start clicking on those free calls, its advertising business will do just fine.Of course, that is assuming it settles those pesky lawsuits with the Skype founders about its continued access to the basic technology that Skype runs on.Original post"
164139,23228,2009-09-30T15:17:46-04:00,,"By Richard ReadSomebody smarter than us once said, ""Better to have tried and lost than to have never tried at all"". (Or something to that effect.) That ""oh well, we gave it a shot"" sentiment seems to sum up General Motors' attitude toward its relationship with eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), which comes to an amicable end today.As you might recall, Bob Lutz first announced plans to sell GM vehicles through eBay the very day that General Motors emerged from bankruptcy. Subsequently, eBay learned of the arrangement, and the two set off to sell vehicles through GM's subdomain on eBay.com. The plan was for potential car buyers to peruse new GM vehicles and make bids, after which they'd be put in touch with their local dealership. In other words, eBay motors was used as GM's second showroom -- virtual bait to lure buyers onto very real lots. As with other eBay auctions, each car on the site had a ""Buy Now"" option, but car sales being what they are, buyers have tended to prefer face-to-face wheeling and dealing.The program was slated to end on September 30, and apparently, it's sticking to that schedule. According to the Associated Press, the GM subdomain of eBay received 1.5 million visits over the course of the program's run, which generated about 15,000 leads for GM dealers. Neither General Motors nor eBay would comment on how many of those leads turn into sales, but when we last checked on the program at the beginning of September, that figure was closer to 4,000.It's safe to assume that if the program had proven successful, both GM and eBay would be anxious to keep it around. However, even though the program's sales might not have been stellar, GM has learned some things from the alliance. Said General Motors spokesman John McDonald, ""We're taking what we learned from eBay and applying it to our digital and social marketing media marketing strategies.... From our view, it was a success.""Some may see that as the case of ""yeah, we meant to do that"", but the fact of the matter is, the program did earn General Motors some nice publicity, and it likely didn't cost either GM or eBay too much cash. At the very least, we can say the company tried something new -- which is more than we could often say about the old GM."
161375,21376,2009-09-14T10:24:17-04:00,,"I’ve had a couple of conversations with Skype exec Jonathan Christensen over the last few days to get a better understanding of just what directions the company plans to go with regard to third party developers. The recent announcement of the closing of the Skype Extras program seems to suggest Skype is heading exactly in the wrong direction.As an aside, one of those conversations was extraordinary from a technical perspective. Jonathan called me via Skype, which forwarded via Skype Out to my mobile phone when I didn’t pick up. Since Google now controls my mobile number, it rang my cell and my home Vonage line per my rules. I picked up the Vonage line and I had a crystal clear connection with no lag.Christensen says that the Extras announcement is not about Skype backing away from a robust developer platform. Rather, he says, Skype is focusing on a next generation platform that will hopefully address the deficiencies of the old program and open many more opportunities for developers to build on Skype services.Vague? Somewhat. But it’s a heck of a lot more information than we’ve ever gotten out of Skype before.Eventually, we suspect, Skype will release a SDK that allows developers to integrate deep into Skype and make calls over the Skype service without opening the Skype client. In other words, people may start to think of Skype (voice, video, chat) as a service rather than a client that must be installed and used to communicate. Today’s tools, which include a public API and the now defunct Extras program, require developers to open the Skype client to make a call.In the future we’ll see other third party desktop applications be able to make Skype calls directly, and possibly share in the growing Skype-out per minute charges that make up the bulk of Skype revenues. And sometime after that, we will see web applications leveraging Skype as a service, too.A couple of things have to happen first, though. There are two reasons Skype has to run on a client today. The first is audio/video encoding at the client level that ensure high quality calls with low latency and minimal configuration. There’s a reason calls on Skype tend to sound good. The second is the p2p architecture of Skype, which also affects latency and cost.It’s relatively straightforward for Skype to allow third parties to build both functions into their apps via a SDK, which is why we’ll see desktop applications integrate Skype as a service first.But the real win is when you can initiate Skype voice and video calls via web applications. It’s not clear that we’re anywhere near that being possible with today’s browsers, say experts we’ve spoken with. There will likely always need to be some desktop software to assist with at least audio/video encoding. But it’s possible this could be done via browser plugins, or even in Flash.Anyway, we’re looking a ways into the future with all of this. But one thing seems clear – Skype, which is happily soon to be under new management, will someday open its doors widely to developers.Original post"
160195,20991,2009-09-06T08:53:45-04:00,,"Joe Nocera this week looks at eBay’s sale of Skype, and wonders who would pay $2 billion for a company with a massive lawsuit hanging over its head. With apologies for quoting at some length, here’s the nub of Nocera’s thesis:The problem I have here is with the “hmmm”s and the “less seemly”. Nocera is clearly of the opinion that if Skype’s buyers have a tacit agreement to settle with JoltID, that would be pretty scandalous. But why?From the point of view of eBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) shareholders, the existence of any such agreement would clearly be a good thing: they managed to sell Skype for $2 billion as a result. More generally, it’s clearly Pareto-optimal that Skype and JoltID are on good, non-litigious terms with each other. And it’s obvious that they were never going to be on such terms so long as eBay owned Skype. If Adam Smith’s invisible hand were doing its job, then, eBay would sell Skype to someone who had much friendlier relations with JoltID. What’s unseemly about that?"
161238,21376,2009-09-13T03:54:47-04:00,,"Skype is terminating its Extras developer program, they announced earlier Friday, because “not enough people were using [the tools] to justify” it. No new projects will be certified, and existing ones will expire over time. This is exactly the wrong thing for Skype to be doing.Om Malik goes on a justifiable rant, arguing that Skype doesn’t understand developers, never understood developers, and shouldn’t be trusted by developers. For the record, I agree. Skype has not been much of a team player when it comes to community over the years.And they’re right, the Extras program was a dud. But only because developers didn’t have any real ability to do deep integrations. For all the pomp, third party developers have never been able to do much more than skim the surface of Skype functionality. No wonder the program never took off.What developers need to really integrate with Skype is the ability to treat the call function as a service, and build it directly into other applications. Today, almost without exception, to make a Skype call requires the Skype client to be opened.Skype has made a very few exceptions to this rule. iSkoot for example, runs the heavy part of Skype on a server so that mobile users could get the functionality on their devices. But these were one-off deals, not via an API or developer program.What developers need is the ability to build the core Skype functionality directly into applications. Like Outlook. Or Facebook. And give those developers a revenue share from paid Skype-out calls, supposedly Skype’s biggest and fast growing revenue source.It’s not clear Skype is going to go in that direction, although the new buyers have said quietly that they’re going to look hard at skype-as-a-service. and some Skype employees I’ve spoken with have said much the same – at some point, expect developers to be able to do deep integrations with the Skype service, not just launch the Skype client.We’re all waiting for that day. And when it comes Skype will win, too. Skype-out calls will absolutely skyrocket, and the revenue will pour in. But for now, Skype, you’re going in the wrong direction. Instead of killing your limited APIs and tools, you should be expanding them dramatically.Original post"
159929,22829,2009-09-04T02:59:59-04:00,,"by Brenon Daly  Just a month after we  speculated on an unconventional home for Skype Technologies, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) found a rather unconventional home of its own for its VoIP subsidiary. Rather than go to Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which is what we suggested as an (admittedly) far-flung idea, Skype has landed in a portfolio of a consortium led by tech buyout shop Silver Lake. Terms call for the group (Silver Lake, along with venture firms Index Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, plus the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board) to hand over $2bn for two-thirds of Skype. EBay, which acquired Skype four years ago, will own the remaining one-third stake.In most markets, a multibillion-dollar carve-out of a noncore asset led by a private equity (PE) firm would hardly be called ‘unconventional.’ (In fact, one could argue that type of transaction is precisely what PE firms should be doing.) But today’s market – even with the recovery that we’ve had – is hardly a healthy one. The equity markets have rallied, but investors – including the big investment groups that back the PE firms – are still skittish. Add to that, debt is still tough to come by. Those are the main reasons why buyout shops have been largely sitting on their hands recently, making a $2bn deal by a PE consortium a relatively unusual event.Consider this fact: the Skype carve-out is the largest tech PE deal since May 2008. In fact, it accounts for almost half of all tech spending by buyout shops in 2009. So far this year, we’ve tallied 50 transactions that have an aggregate announced deal value of just $4.6bn. That’s one-third the amount during the same period last year ($13.1bn), and a mere fraction of the total the buyout barons spent during the same period in the boom year of 2007 ($101bn)."

Among them: GM had begun partnership with eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), which would offer customers the opportunity to bid on and purchase vehicles through the popular auction website. That intrigued many buyers and many in the industry -- the only problem being that eBay said the arrangement wasn't a done deal.By August 11, however, the two companies had dotted Is, crossed Ts, and put up 16,000 GM vehicles for sale on eBay -- of which roughly 50 sold. We're not sure how things have gone since then, but Automotive News took the liberty of perusing 3,000 GM listings on eBay, all of which had an end-date of September 1, and none had been sold.Still, General Motors insists that the pilot program has been successful and has generated increased awareness of GM products. And that's likely true. (Based on our own meanderings through eBay Motors, we're guessing that the program's major shortcoming might be that the subdomain -- GM.eBay.com -- is slightly hard to find.) The company has said that roughly 4,000 eBay shoppers ""entered into negotiations -- either online, over the phone or in person -- to buy a vehicle."" There's no word on how many of those negotiations resulted in sales.GM's vice president of U.S. sales, Mark LaNeve, says that ""The numbers on eBay itself aren't significant, but we didn't think it would be."" Unfortunately, that's the classic ""Yeah, we meant to do that"" explanation for poor performance that never convinces anyone. However, General Motors has opted to extend the program from its original end date of September 8 to September 30 -- so perhaps the company has reason to believe that its partnership with eBay could bear fruit in the future."
157318,20568,2009-08-20T11:55:27-04:00,,"eBay Inc. (EBAY - Analyst Report) recently revised its incentive scale in an attempt to pacify ruffled sellers who are facing shrinking profit margins. The company also expects the new policies to encourage the best sellers to stick with eBay.The company now promises a 20% discount to top-rated sellers on its Direct Seller Ratings (DSR) system. The rating system outlines four criteria based on which the vendor and the buying experience are evaluated by the buyer.We believe the incentive revision will have limited impact on eBay’s performance. Management’s main problem seems to be the rating system itself. There is also a serious lack of communication between the company and its seller partners that could build a wall between buyers and sellers, rather than a bridge.The fact that most sellers are unaware of any written policies that govern them is another major stumbling block. The rating system does not even consider all buyer feedback to be of equal value.Another serious allegation against eBay is management’s habit of taking seemingly arbitrary decisions. For example, many vendor accounts have been suspended for no specified reason, thus increasing discontent.Management also announced a reduction in payment options, specifying that sellers should not accept payment through checks and money orders. While this could increase the use of paypal, it shuts out buyers who do not want to go through the rigors of acquiring a paypal account.We think management faces a number of issues. The first and most important is the perception of buyers and sellers regarding the company. eBay started out in 1995 as an auction house helping small sellers get the best price for their product. The customer base developed likewise, on the belief that products could be obtained at eBay for a reasonable price.These dynamics have gradually changed with other classes of buyers visiting its website and the company adding larger suppliers and more popular brands. It is a pity that some continue to perceive it as “cheap”.Management needs to get its act together if it wants to avoid alienating both buyers and sellers. In our opinion, marketing, supplier relationships, technology and website management are areas in need of particular attention.Product definition is another important area, which the rating system does not clarify. While a good definition would attract the correct class of buyers, the failure to provide one would exacerbate buyer dissatisfaction. For a company that is supposed to bring buyers and sellers together, eBay certainly has a lot of work to do."

Typically, eBay Motors, which lures 12 million car shoppers a month, deals with used autos.According to an eBay statement (Techmeme), the eBay-GM effort launches Tuesday. In a nutshell, eBay will serve as a point guard to move GM inventory—specifically Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Pontiac autos–from Aug. 11 through Sept. 8. The pilot only applies to California for now.If successful, you could project more eBay experiments like this. Why? Dealer networks for the likes of GM and Chrysler are a mess. They’re being pared down dramatically. It’s unclear whether Americans really want to buy a car from a government-owned entity—it gives me pause. And consumers are buying Fords, Toyotas, Hyundais and Hondas in the Cash for Clunkers program. Simply put, GM has too much inventory and needs eBay to cull your best offer and sell these cars.Can eBay make things more efficient for GM? We’ll see. Online haggling for cars isn’t a new model—companies like Autobytel have been doing it for years. But eBay’s foray into new cars may be a nice way to boost revenue and make the process more efficient. Even if eBay manages to pare GM’s inventory a bit it’ll be a success.In many respects, the eBay-GM move sounds like a nice spin on a inventory liquidation effort. If this inventory was going to move it would have already. However, eBay can at least help find the clearing price."
153113,23309,2009-08-02T06:27:48-04:00,,"Why are there firms?  A more flexible way to manage transactions would be through a system of specific contracts detailing what each individual should produce, to whom it should be delivered and what he should be paid.  It would also be more efficient:  a traditional firm makes some group of individuals the owners and a separate group of individuals the workers.  The firm is saddled with the problem of motivating workers when the profits from their efforts go to the owners.The problem of course is that most of these contracts would be far too complicated to spell out and enforce.  And without an airtight contract, disputes occur.  Because disputes are inefficient, the disputants almost always find some settlement which supplants the terms of the contract.  Knowing all of this in advance, the contracts would usually turn out to be worthless.  The strategy of bringing spurious objections to existing contracts in order to trigger renegotiation at more favorable terms is called holdup. The holdup problem is considered by some economic theorists to be the fundamental friction that shapes most of economic organization.Case in point, Skype and eBay.  eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) acquired the Skype brand and much of the software from the founders, JoltId, but did not take full ownership of the core technology, instead entering a licensing agreement which grants Skype exclusive use.  Since that time, Skype has become increasingly popular and a strong source of revenue for eBay.  Now eBay is being held up.  JoltId claims that eBay has violated the licensing agreement, citing a few obscure and relatively minor details in the contract.  Litigation is pending.Not coincidentally, eBay has publicly stated its intention to spinoff Skype and take it public, a sale that would bring a huge infusion of capital to eBay at a time when it is reinventing its core business.  That sale is in turn being held up because Skype is worthless without the license from JoltId.  This puts JoltId in an excellent bargaining position to renegotiate for a better share of those spoils. (On the other hand, had Skype not done as well as it did, JoltId would not have such a large share of the downside.)Whatever were the long-run total expected payments eBay was going to make to JoltId in return for exclusive use of the technology, it should have paid that much to own the technology outright, become an integrated firm, and avoided the holdup problem.And don’t worry.  You got your Skype.  Hold up may change the terms of trade, but it is in neither party’s interest to destroy a valuable asset."

Tuesday they sold 65% of it for much less, valuing Skype at $2.75 billion. It seems like a big loss, and guys like Om Malik are saying eBay shareholders should be angry.I’m not going to argue with the fact that eBay was negligent in buying a company without taking control of its core intellectual property. But when I look at this deal, and how the market has changed in the last four years, it looks to me like eBay made out ok. Or even more than ok.First of all, eBay never paid the full $4.1 billion for skype. 2/3 of a $1.5 billion earnout wasn’t paid, so the total purchase price was around $3.1 billion. After the write-downs, eBay was carrying Skype on its books at a value below $2 billion dollars.Skype is projected to make $200 million of so in EBITDA in 2010, so theacquisition implies a 14x multiple on that EBITDA (thanks to Mark Mahaney at Citi Investment Research for the quick financial analysis). Mahaney says “From a non-strategic buyer, that would seem to be a high multiple.”  Clearly, ebay got more for Skype than they thought they would.Also, the market (and eBay) hasn’t done too well over the last few years. Half of the original purchase price was paid in eBay stock, which has declined by more than 50% since late 2005.Finally, Skype has been profitable, and eBay has taken those profits off the table.The market is way, way down and Skype is a somewhat damaged asset with the IP litigation ongoing. The fact that eBay is getting most of its purchase price back, in cash, is a big win for them. And they still own 35% of the company and can get additional gains in a later IPO or sale. And the best news is that Skype is finally free of the dragging effect of a huge corporate parent. They can now move forward and find their destiny.Original post"

153041,20302,2009-08-02T03:19:51-04:00,,"After its runup on last week’s earnings announcement, I think eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock is overpriced. But then again, it was overpriced before the runup too. Please let me explain.  I do not think eBay is a bad company. Much the opposite, in fact. After all, it has a retail business model that requires no inventory! It is the only legitimate player in its market niche, merchants often depend on its services for their very survival and eBay has found a way to charge fees at every level of the transaction. It is a beautiful arrangement, really. And this is likely what carried it through the dot com crash that destroyed just about every other meaningful peer company.  But today the company is mature, and I think investors have still not yet fully accepted that. I may even go a step further and say that the auction market itself is saturated. There simply isn’t the room for 30, 40, 50% sales growth that eBay enjoyed just a few years ago. Indeed, at this point it seems like sales may actually begin declining. This is a remarkable change in fortune for the post-bubble darling.  The company does remain strong from a profitability perspective – returns on capital as well as margins have stayed at decent levels – but it is a big mistake to confuse a good company with a good investment. I worry that many investors are still expecting too much from the future of the company because the company’s past has been characterized by such ridiculous levels of growth. Bear in mind that the stock has gone nowhere in the last six years. But I still think it could go lower.   I first noticed reason for concern shortly after the company acquired Skype Technologies about four years ago for about $2.6 billion, of which an amazing $2.3 billion was booked as goodwill. Adding insult to shareholders’ injury, as part of the acquisition, eBay also assumed obligations to pay nearly $1.3 billion in incentives to Skype executives should they meet certain targets. At the time of the acquisition, Skype had never turned a profit and was producing only $65 million in sales.   To put this in context, eBay had balance sheet totals at the end of FY2004 of only $8 billion. So in essence, eBay, the company with the dreamy business model and impenetrable moat, was wagering nearly half of its net worth on the future of an unrelated and unproven business. Why?  There are two explanations I can think of, neither of which is good for the eBay shareholder. The first is that eBay management saw that their auction growth (and, by deduction, stock price) was unsustainable and therefore sought to expand the business in other areas. That is the generous explanation. The other explanation is that management didn’t know what the heck they were doing and were simply empire-building. I don’t know which explanation is more likely.  Also, along the way, eBay has issued an enormous amount of new equity to finance everything from nutty acquisitions to outrageous executive salaries (Meg Whitman earned $16 million in her final full year as CEO plus another $14 million in the year after quitting). It is these things that have kept the price of the stock down, NOT a change in expectations for growth.  But yet the market prices expectations. Even if sales continue to grow, if they grow at a rate lower than what the market expects the price of the stock should fall.  eBay’s current stock price, though, implies that sales will continue to grow at a rate higher than 5% well in to the foreseeable future. While this may seem low compared to the astronomical growth the company experienced in the early part of the decade, it is very high on a forward-looking basis. eBay, quite simply, is no longer growing. Gross sales declined 2.2% in the twelve months ended in June and it’s RBP Probability – the likelihood that it will attain the 5% revenue growth necessary to support its stock price is a mere 51%.

Today the stock is hovering around $22.00 – more than doubling since it’s March 9th low of $9.91. eBay’s 2nd quarter earnings looked promising and the metrics look like eBay is finally capitalizing on the weak economy.eBay stock price since March 9th, 2009I wanted to provide data that would give investors as much information about eBay so they can make educated decisions about their investments.First, let me post here my own tables showing quarterly and annual revenue growth statistics.As you can see, revenue started contracting in the Q3 of 2008. This trend was not reversed until this most recent quarter when eBay's management was finally able to stem the bleeding - an impressive feat in this economy. I base my Q3 and Q4 forecasts on the 2.51% sequential growth trend of Q2Annually you see that eBay is on track to record a slight decrease in revenue. Again, this is based on the current trajectory from Q2. If eBay continues to execute and produce a strong Q3 and Q4 - we may see record revenues for 2009 which would be huge for the eBay investment community. There is a lot of opportunity here - with the marketplaces improving and Paypal/Skype growing healthily - it is a big possibilityMake sure you take advantage of eBay’s own investor page. eBay’s investor page has more then just regular earnings reports. Detailed PowerPoint decks and investor presentations are stored here.One of the more essential presentations was the presentation eBay gave for analyst day. It's a large powerpoint deck (over 200 slides - 2009 Analyst Presentation (14 megs).Another great site is Medved.net eBay Auction Counts. The site is a treasure trove of information and monitors eBay’s pages 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, at 1.5 hour intervals for their auction counts and now, the sell-through statistics.A look at the 2009 auction counts show a huge increase in listings. This is especially positive since the 2nd and 3rd quarter traditional have been eBay’s weakest and usually have a drop in listings. Having growth during these times is, I believe, a testament to eBay’s counter-cyclical nature. Some people have called eBay “recession proof”. I believe as the economy continues to struggle and more and more people are out of work – that old doohickey that they bought during the boom times are getting listed on eBay – conversely, people with limited budgets wouldn’t mind a “like new” doo-dad if they can save some extra money. The next sites that are useful are traffic rankings for ebay’s properties.

137126,22820,2009-05-12T04:24:06-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) filed its first quarter 10-Q at the end of April, and the stock price launched. With two highly lucrative toll-booth businesses—brokered sales and payment services (Paypal)—and an exceedingly low price (briefly selling below $10 per share earlier this year), it caught our attention earlier this year. Though we haven’t found the recent decline in eBay’s GMV (gross merchandise value) concerning, we do continue to worry about eBay’s capital allocation, its managerial compensation, and its emphasis on favoring high volume sellers (see our previous analysis of pretended problems, potential problems, and rejoinders).Regarding capital allocation, eBay repurchased no shares in the first quarter, despite seeing its lowest share price since early 2001. And true to habit, eBay entered a definitive agreement to acquire Gmarket Inc. after the first quarter closed, in April. Over the years, eBay’s management has clearly preferred acquisitions to share repurchases, and not all of the acquisitions have been prudent uses of capital (see e.g., their recent sale of Stumbleupon back to its founders for less than their purchase price). Though it is possible that Gmarket at 27x trailing earnings is a better investment than eBay’s own shares at 13x trailing earnings, the former clearly anticipates robust growth that may not materialize. In my view, buying Gmarket rather than eBay’s own shares is the riskier route.Our second worry has been eBay’s managerial compensation. Despite sub-par performance in their core marketplace business in recent years, compensation has decidedly increased. And the first quarter confirms the trend. Year over year, stock-based compensation expense grew from $87.4 million to $113.8 million, or a 30% increase. This in a quarter in which both net income and free cash flow were down significantly YOY. Though one should acknowledge that stock-based compensation expense can be lumpy and not consistently spread across all quarters, the first glance does not offer a pretty picture. We’ll be keeping watch in the quarters to come.Our third and last lingering worry—that favoring high volume sellers may alienate too many sellers—is difficult to assess from quarter to quarter. Over at eBay Strategies, Scot Wingo has highlighted some of the recent changes in eBay’s marketplace business. Early indications show that buyers appreciate the reliability of eBay’s largest and favored sellers, and buyers consistently show their preferences for free shipping. Though management’s push for ‘free shipping’ strikes me as nothing more than silly irrationality (i.e., sellers will just increase list prices to compensate), the data so far seems to confirm management’s side.All told, I must say that I was disappointed with eBay’s capital allocation and stock compensation expense for the quarter. Though their actions fit seamlessly with their past, I had hoped that a $10 share would have been too tempting not to bite. Given these three worries, the unexpected comprehensive income loss of $27.7 million for the quarter, the broad macroeconomic picture, and the recent 70% run-up in eBay’s share price, we have closed our position and will now watch from the sidelines.Disclosure: No Position."

Even as eBay's core auction or marketplace business saw revenue drop 18% in the last quarter to $1.22 billion, the PayPal division grew revenue 11% to $643 million.At the recent analysts' day a few weeks back, eBay CEO John Donahoe and PayPal President Scott Thompson both clearly spelled out how the PayPal group was poised to dominate the world of online payments for years to come: Think the online equivalent of Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA).Donahoe even went so far to say, the ""opportunity at PayPal is bigger than the opportunity at marketplace.""Today, Visa trades at a forward P/E of 18 times, Mastercard is at 13 times and eBay is at 10 times. eBay has roughly the same market cap as Mastercard. I'm not a fan of quick fixes, but there's a compelling argument to make for changing eBay's name to PayPal with a PYPL ticker.It doesn't make sense to do this today perhaps, but it will soon. PayPal is the core to an eBay turnaround in the next couple years.Disclsoure: No positions"

Online Auction pioneer eBay (EBAY) and electronics darling Apple (AAPL) continued a slew of positive earnings reports cementing tech's leadership role in the road to market recovery.The auction business for eBay had been stumbling for quite sometime, in fact even before the recession, so Wednesday's quarterly report may just be what is needed to turn the corner here. eBay, is trying to rein in its businesses and truly become the global auctioneer. This was most evident of late as management outlined a plan to take its Skype Internet Phone product and churn out an IPO next year, separating the unit after years of failed synergies. eBay also bought a controlling stake in Gmarket, a South Korean online auction house. Best way to break into new markets? Why, buy local of course!These recent announcements meant eBay's dragging share price was finally finding some life, rising 22% over the last month, including 3% Wednesday before their numbers. Investors had more to smile about as eBay delivered a solid report, sending shares higher by 5% in after-hours trading.Highlights from eBay included earnings of $357Million ($0.28/share) based on GAAP. Non-GAAP numbers, the numbers that analysts were looking at, included profits of $500Million ($0.39/share). Expectations were beat by 5 cents a share and eBay also generated free cash flow of $577Million from its quarterly $2.02Billion in Revenues. These totals point to overall revenue declines of 8% and profit declines of 11%. Analysts however, certainly feared for worse. eBay guiding within expected ranges also helped its cause in after-market trading.So where does eBay's growth and strength come from? PayPal, classifieds and Skype were the main drivers of Revenue year-over-year to the upside, so the main auction businesses still remain mostly catatonic. But with eBay looking to expand its online presence, investors are likely to chalk this one up to the economy. Auction-related business fell 18%, while Skype and Payments (PayPal etc.) growth on a revenue basis was 21% and 11%, respectively.Granted the online auction slide doesn't look all that fantastic, but with economic recovery, the expectation is that this business can pick up again. With eBay looking to expand into more markets, the additional global reach of the brand will certainly broaden the revenue stream. With its collection of shopping and auction websites, including Shopping.com and Stubhub.com et al, eBay finds its reach expanding into specific niche businesses making it that much tougher for any start up or smaller competitor. Ebay has also ramped up its online classifieds business, and that grew 23% year over year. Taking all these together, CEO John Donahoe's vision and three-year growth targets look that much more likely.Given eBay's recent run-up, it is intriguing but not ideal to jump into the company stock tomorrow. However, these numbers and the guidance that came with them confirms that eBay is very much ticking and should be watched.Disclosure: Author holds no position in EBAY"
131667,21382,2009-04-19T14:38:24-04:00,,"While eBay prepares to unload Skype via a sale or IPO next year, it is busy looking for new ways to make money off its 405 million global users. They already account for an estimated 8 percent of international calls, and many of them are increasingly paying for SkypeOut calls to regular phones. Its revenues last year were $551 million, but it wants to get to $1 billion by 2011. To get there, it might have to start thinking local.In fact, it has already started trials in Europe and New Zealand with Yellow Pages businesses that turn business phone numbers on the Web into free calls. Mike Boland at the Kelsey Group explains the concept:The SkypeFind feature he mentions is basically a local business directory within the Skype client which nobody uses. But currently there is a browser plug-in that works with Skype 4.0, the latest version, that turns any phone number on the Web or search result into a clickable Skype call. In order to use the feature, you need to pay the normal SkypeOut rates.The idea Skype is playing with is to make those calls, or at least some of them, free to consumers. Instead, a Yellow Pages company would buy up the calling minutes in bulk and either offer it as part of the fees it charges businesses to list their numbers in its directory or charge the businesses on a click-to-call basis. How they decide to price it will probably vary depending on the type of businesses being called. Lawyers and plumbers, for instance, would be more likely to pay for phone leads on a click-to-call basis. For other businesses, the Skype feature would act more as a retention strategy.Click-to-call ads have been tried before, but this turns the actual phone number into an ad. Click it, and you call the business you were looking for, and the call is paid for by either the business or the Yellow Pages partner. The $32 billion Yellow Pages industry is quickly moving to the Web and Skype has the ability to light up any business phone number found on the Web.Presumably, the Yellow Pages partners would only pay for numbers in their directories, so Skype would have to come up with a way to indicate which calls are free and which ones are not. And there is no reason to limit this to local calls. As people continue to use Skype increasingly for free long distance calls, making money from local calls might be the key to getting to that $1 billion in revenues.Original post"

But, with an IPO, eBay can “have its cake and eat it too.”  Basically, an IPO will raise a slug of cash and, in turn, there will likely be a huge chunk of equity left over.Of course, the IPO market can be extremely fickle.  Although, there are glimmers of optimism, especially in light of the successful ChangYou (NASDAQ:CYOU) offering.In other words, there is an appetite for hyper-growth plays – and Skype fits the bill.  Besides, the company has a massive global footprint, especially in China.  In fact, Skype is the biggest provider of international calls.  Thus, there’s a good chance that foreign investors will buy up shares.So long as Skype can keep up its growth ramp – which seems reasonable – the valuation could be rich, say $2 billion to $3 billion or more.Either way, the IPO filing is good news for Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which has been retained as the lead underwriter."

On April 14, eBay made it official.The company announced that it plans to separate from Skype with an initial public offering (IPO) scheduled for the first half of 2010. Skype is eBay's fastest growing business segment. In 2008, Skype generated revenues of $551 million, up 44% from 2007, and segment margins of about 21%. Skype had 405 million registered users at the end of 2008, up 47% from 2007. eBay expects Skype to top $1 billion in revenue in 2011.Interestingly, that announcement came shortly after Skype's founders and group of private equity firms reportedly made eBay an offer to buy back Skype. According to The Wall Street Journal, the private equity-backed offer is well below what eBay hopes to get for Skype.Hmmm, maybe the company's IPO announcement is a negotiating tactic to drive up the private equity offer. Clearly, eBay has a minimum asking price in mind. eBay bought Skype in 2005 for $2.6 billion and paid another $500 million in earnouts.In 2007, however, eBay wrote down the value of Skype to $1.7 billion, taking a hit of $1.43 billion to its book value. eBay wants to avoid another writedown, which means it needs to pull in at least $1.7 billion in a Skype sale.This news begs the question as to why eBay would want to sell a fast-growing business that appears to be gaining momentum. eBay's president and CEO, John Donahoe, best answered that question: ""[I]t's clear that Skype has limited synergies with eBay and PayPal.""Agreed. Selling Skype and focusing on the core auction business and PayPal is a smart move."

Why? Another entity will buy Skype before it goes public. EBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) on Tuesday announced plans to launch a Skype IPO in 2010 (Techmeme), but what the company really accomplished was establishing a price band for the VOIP service. Meanwhile, eBay also indicated that it would be more focused on e-commerce and is serious about shareholder value. In a research note, Gabelli analyst Robert Haley reckoned that Skype was worth $1.5 billion to $2 billion as a publicly traded company. But by signaling an IPO for Skype eBay also seems to have opened the auction floodgates. He wrote:Haley noted there are multiple possible Skype acquirers including:William Blair analyst Jack Murphy is also arguing the Skype-will-be-bought-before-an-IPO case. Murphy wrote:We believe that management has been actively looking for buyers, but concluded that a Skype IPO would create the most value for eBay shareholders. While management plans on a 2010 IPO, we would not be surprised if a private market deal transpired first.In any case, eBay could seriously cut its losses on Skype deal. EBay paid $2.6 billion and payouts for Skype in 2005 and still carries $1.8 billion in goodwill on its books. If eBay could get $2 billion for Skype that would go a long way toward closing one big detour from its core business."

130887,22820,2009-04-14T14:19:21-04:00,,"Rumors and news about eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) are popping onto the business newswire these days. Whatever they’re sizzling in their pan, it smells and looks like a new recipe. For a corporation with two excellent, high margin, wide moat businesses—auctions and Paypal—shareholders would welcome and do deserve a “dish” with better capital allocation in the years ahead.So what’s the news?  For one, Skype’s founders want to buy their creation back, though eBay denies that they’re close to a deal.  Also, today, StumbleUpon’s founders disclosed that they had brought their baby back home, which they had sold to eBay for $75 million two years ago.  And lastly, eBay appears close to purchasing a 34% stake in Korean online auction operator Gmarket.One discerns the trend in these moves—increased concentration on auctions, retailing, and payment processing, and a decreased interest in Web 2.0 and 3.0 technologies. Originally eBay had expected more synergies with Skype, using VOIP as a new delivery channel for its auction and retailing site. But at their recent analyst day, eBay’s management acknowledged that such plans were unsuccessful. Going forward, eBay said it was content to cultivate and grow Skype into a great standalone business; of course, it now appears that they could be tempted to part, for the right price.All this movement should make investment bankers salivate. Though we don’t yet know the final sale price for StumbleUpon, it is unlikely that eBay commanded much more than its purchase price. For Skype, rumors place a likely sale price at $2 billion; this for the business that garnered $2.6 billion from eBay four years ago.The waste of time, talent, and resources on these two acquisitions is paradigmatic of eBay’s capital allocation over recent years. Though some cash has gone to repurchasing shares, more went to overpriced acquisitions—acquisitions for which there was no natural home in their fragmented bureaucracy. In the months ahead, shareholders should hope that this new recipe bears little resemblance to the old.Disclosure: I, or persons whose accounts I manage, own shares of eBay at the time of this writing."
130733,20468,2009-04-13T23:56:09-04:00,,"StumbleUpon is a startup again as the original founders and a few well-heeled investors bought it back from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). The next question: When will Skype leave the eBay fold?In a statement, StumbleUpon said its two year run as a subsidiary of eBay is over. StumbleUpon founders Garrett Camp and Geoff Smith and investors such as Ram Shriram of Sherpalo Ventures, Accel Partners and August Capital are buying the company back. Camp will be CEO. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.Why the breakup? Camp said:The good news for eBay is that it only blew $75 million on StumbleUpon. That sum is basically a rounding error for eBay. Way back in May 2007 eBay thought StumbleUpon would “provide eBay with in-depth exposure to a fast-growing community-based service with approximately 2.3 million users.”However, when you check out eBay’s list of acquisitions StumbleUpon never made much sense. Most of eBay’s purchases were e-commerce related, but StumbleUpon was a browser plug-in. Meetup is another head scratcher, but the biggest detour had to be Skype. That e-commerce meets VOIP concept never made a lot of sense.Next up for eBay is figuring out what to do with Skype. The New York Times reported that Skype founders Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis were in talks with private equity groups to raise about $1 billion to buy Skype back from eBay. eBay bought Skype in 2006 for $2.6 billion and tossed in another $500,000 later.Om Malik outlines why it makes sense for eBay to sell Skype back to its founders and a big reason is a pending lawsuit. Look for eBay to sell Skype back to its founders too. I wonder if this could be a new model for entrepreneurs. Start company, sell out to eBay and then buy it back for less than you sold it for. Not a bad gig at all."
130844,21376,2009-04-14T09:06:53-04:00,,"So StumbleUpon, a social bookmarking site that lets users browse and discover new websites by clicking a button, was a subsidiary of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) for just less than two years. The acquisition made the startup’s founders extremely wealthy, given that they raised just $1.5 million in venture capital, and sold for $75 million.You’d think that the founders (Garrett Camp, Geoff Smith and Justin LeFrance) would be quite content to go into semi-hibernation at eBay and contemplate their vacation homes for years to come. But like so many already-wealthy entrepreneurs, some fire kept driving at them to keep themselves challenged. It may be the deep rooted insecurity that leads most entrepreneurs to try to build companies in the first place - getting bought doesn’t necessarily give them the self confidence they thought it would. Or it may a simpler explanation - the certain knowledge that StumbleUpon hasn’t yet become whatever it is eventually destined to be.So when the opportunity came for the founders to buy the company back from eBay and start over, they took it. The struggling eBay had been looking to sell off StumbleUpon for months, even hiring investment bank Deutsche Bank to help them get back their $75 million, but there were no takers. That left the door open for the founders to buy it back themselves.What’s next for StumbleUpon? Presumably Ebay got some cash in the deal from the injection of capital from the founders, Sherpalo Ventures, Accel Partners, and August Capital. Some of that new cash must also be used to capitalize the newly independent company. StumbleUpon has a revenue model that forces ads on users every few pages they view at a flat rate of $0.05 per ad, and since they have 100% click-throughs on the forced feeding of these ads, there is presumably some very real revenue flowing to the company. StumbleUpon doesn’t cost much to run. Remember that they only raised $1.5 million before the original sale, so keeping the lights on shouldn’t be a problem, even if growth continues to stagnate (in fact, Comscore shows StumbleUpon with the same number of unique monthly visitors today, 1.5 million, that they had two years ago).Growth will almost certainly kick in again now that the team has a renewed incentive to better the product and compete. StumbleUpon had terrific growth prior to the eBay sale (see chart); my guess is they’ll get healthy again soon.What I love about the spin off is that the company is now able to allocate resources properly, without having to deal with the bureaucracy of a huge public company parent to slow things down and drain off people and cash. There have been other examples of sales followed by buybacks in the past. My favorite is Webshots, which was sold to Excite for $82.5 million in 1999, bought back by the founders for $2.5 million in 2001, and then resold to CNET for $71 million in 2004 (CNET later sold it to American Greetings for $45 million in 2007). Listen to the first few minutes of this podcast, where Narendra Rocherolle, one of the founders, for that story.It would have been different if eBay had integrated StumbleUpon into its core business somewhere along the way, or synergies between the products allowed StumbleUpon to shine in a way that it never could as an independent company (like YouTube has at Google). But none of that happened. So by far the best thing was for the company to once again fight it out as a small, nimble startup. Resources have been allocated efficiently, and the startup ecosystem is healthier for it.Original post"
130579,22762,2009-04-12T13:31:32-04:00,,"By Leena RaoAs the New York Times reported, Skype’s founders, Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, are in talks with several private equity firms and are amassing their own financial resources to make a bid for the internet phone business. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) bought Skype from Zennstrom and Friis for around $3.1 billion in 2005. We reported last year that eBay would be willing to sell Skype if the company couldn’t support eBay’s core ecommerce business.eBay has been having trouble finding ways of using Skype across its other products. eBay removed Skype co-founder and CEO Niklas Zennstrom in October 2007, reportedly due to frustration at the financial performance of Skype. eBay also negotiated down the huge earnout due to Skype stockholders and took a $936 million one-time loss around the transaction.As we wrote last spring, a sale was projected to be likely late last year or in the first half of this year. Of course, with the economy in such poor condition, the sale was probably put off momentarily. There was something brewing between Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Skype last spring, but nothing came of it. Google recently launched its own voice product, Google Voice (formerly Grand Central).Skype recently launched a nifty iPhone app, which was downloaded 1 million times in the first two days of its release. Skype recently made a move to be a player in the enterprise space, but it wasn’t clear how much of a money-maker the new service would be.There’s no doubt that Skype brings a lot to the table but eBay was probably just not the right buyer. Skype’s scalable technology and a proven platform in the VOIP, VOIP2POTS and P2P Video is impressive to say the least. The service currently has more than 405 million registered users.Following their respective departures from Skype, Zennstrom and Friis formed VC firm Atomico and founded online video/TV site Joost.Original post"
130486,21293,2009-04-11T23:53:42-04:00,,"I read with interest the Brad Stone piece in the NY Times yesterday suggesting that Niklas and Janus might buy Skype back from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). I think this is a wonderful idea and I hope it happens.Back when eBay bought Skype in 2005, I was skeptical that eBay was the right home for Skype. I also thought the price was in the right ballpark. I got the first part right but the second part wrong. In hindsight, eBay paid too much and bought a non-strategic asset.Now eBay is rumored to be thinking of unloading Skype for $1.7bn to $2bn and the Skype founders are trying to round up as much as $1bn of cash (including their cash I assume) to combine with seller financing from eBay to get the deal done.Brad says in the Times that Skype did $145mm in revenues in the fourth quarter. If that's true, and I assume it is, then Skype could do as much as $700mm to $800mm in revenues in 2009 if it is growing at a reasonable rate. Is $1.7bn to $2bn a reasonable price for a business that is doing $800mm in revenues in the current year? I don't know, it really depends on how profitable that business is.I do know that Skpe is a great freemium business model. Most of the conversations on Skype are free because they are between Skype users. But some of them are paid and according to TeleGeography, Skype now makes up 8% of all international calling minutes. If Skype can be a $800mm revenue business this year and capture more than 10% of the international calling market, I think $1.7bn to $2bn may well be a very good price.But the best thing about this is getting the asset back into the hands of the entrepreneurs who created it and built it. We all saw what happened at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) when Jobs took back the reins of the company and I suspect Niklas and Janus would not be thinking about this if they didn't have a strong strategic plan for Skype.I've said this many times on this blog and I'll say it again. Big companies mostly mess up entrepreneurial companies when they buy them and it really is best that companies like Skype stay independant and run by their founders if that is possible. And it looks like that might be possible with Skype. That makes me happy."

126471,20503,2009-03-17T16:07:16-04:00,,"At web giant eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), it’s out with the new and in with the old both in terms of corporate strategy and product mix. After trying in vain to remake itself as an online “retailer” of fixed-priced items to rival the likes of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), eBay last week cried uncle when it announced it was returning to its roots as an auction clearinghouse for used goods and collectibles (in addition to overstocked items). Why the change? The past year has not been kind on the one-time darling of the web which has seen its traffic and fortunes decline.To compete in the fixed-price marketplace, eBay enacted a series of policies and site changes that favored power sellers at the expense of smaller sellers. As casual sellers abandoned the site, buyers have migrated elsewhere in search of the hard-to-find products upon which eBay built its business—traffic to Craigslist has risen 40% over the past year. In contrast, eBay’s traffic was down 5.2% last month over the previous year, while Amazon’s traffic rose 18.7%.Not only are fewer shoppers returning to the site, but average order values have stagnated at around $28 (other than the spike during the holiday season.) Since eBay’s marketplace revenues are driven by fees charged to sellers, declining traffic and flat transaction values have led eBay to raise its fees in hopes of meeting Wall Street’s expectations. As a result, eBay is squeezing the very sellers on whose backs the success of its business rests.The more eBay has tried to be a retailer, the more its customers have gravitated to sites offering better overall shopping experiences with lower total prices, better customer service, and predictable deliveries; not to mention the avoidance of the risk of fraud. The percentage of eBay’s visitors who shopped at Amazon jumped from 41% in February 2008 to 53% last month. Over the same period, Amazon visitors’ cross-shopping of eBay has remained unchanged at 58%, suggesting eBay’s fixed-price strategy has failed to attract significant numbers of new shoppers to the site.By focusing so much on fixed-priced items sold by large sellers, eBay has blurred the distinction between it and the litany of shopping comparison sites and tools on the web (such as shopping.com which eBay also owns). In so doing, eBay has traded away much of the brand equity that once set it apart from the rest of the online retailing universe.With its greater emphasis on fixed-priced goods, it’s not surprising that eBay has seen a steady increase in the number of shoppers making “Buy-It-Now” purchases over the past year. In February, 11% of eBay’s visitors, or 7.8 million customers, made a Buy-it-Now purchase (up 20% from the previous year). However gains in fixed-priced activity have been eclipsed by declines in eBay’s traditional auction business. The percentage of eBay’s traffic that made a bid on an auction-style listing dropped from 13.5% in February 2008 to 12.2% last month.  In total, 1.5 million fewer shoppers placed a bid on eBay last month than did last February. eBay’s challenges are multi-faceted, and it remains to be seen whether by simply returning to its roots as an auction site it can win back buyers and sellers who have long since given up on using the site. Online retailing has evolved significantly since eBay was founded over a decade ago. Savvy consumers have learned how and where to find deals online, but value intangibles beyond price when making their purchase decisions. Consumers expect a level of service that in some respects is beyond eBay’s ability to control in its role as middleman. Given that, eBay would be better served looking beyond product strategy and focusing instead on improving the shopping experience for buyers and sellers as its constant tinkering seems to be doing more harm than good."

125406,22287,2009-03-11T15:50:33-04:00,,"Apparently, fear of a deepening recession alone isn’t enough to maintain tech worker loyalty these days–mounting job losses be damned. This week,  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) repriced millions of employee stock options that had gone underwater as the company’s share price declined. Now eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) hopes to do the same. The reason: employee retention.In a regulatory filing today, the company said it has asked shareholders to approve a plan to offer employees the opportunity to swap underwater stock options for restricted stock. “Like many companies, we have experienced a significant decline in our stock price over the last year in light of the current global financial and economic crisis,” eBay explained in its argument for implementing the plan. “Because of the continued challenging economic environment and the uncertain impact of our efforts to change our business, we believe these underwater stock options are no longer effective as incentives to motivate and retain our employees.”And this may well be the case. That said, you’d think that the widespread and fast-mounting job losses in the tech sector would be enough to keep most folks still collecting paychecks coming in to work.  Nice gesture, though.Original post"
127360,20468,2009-03-23T09:53:05-04:00,,"Skype on Monday announced a beta that will allow it to connect to corporate telephone networks across the globe. Technically, Skype’s beta is dubbed Skype For SIP for Business users (statement, Skype blog, Techmeme). SIP stands for Session Initiation Protocol, which is a standard for voice over Internet protocol used it corporate networks. Simply put, Skype will now connect to corporate phone systems so you can Skype fixed line phones and mobiles from a traditional PBX system—your standard phone set-up. For now, Skype’s pricing once the beta runs its course is to be determined. In the meantime, standard rates—a little more than 2 cents for most global calls—apply. However, it’s likely that the margins might be a little better than its current a few pennies here and there to call a land line setup. If not, Skype may at least get more volume if it’s an official member of the corporate network club. Skype already works with corporate hardware and integrates with Outlook and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), but its latest move solidifies its corporate standing and at least allows for better enterprise support.Skype’s customer base is mostly consumer, but it has been reaching out to be more business friendly. Call quality and security have been ongoing concerns, but it’s not like Skype has been locked out of the business market—Skype calls for business happen all the time on the sly.Here’s what this latest move means to Skype:For the enterprise, Skype for SIP means businesses can manage Skype calls, use their existing equipment and software to route calls and buy online numbers. And the key point:That pricing, which is likely to be tweaked for corporations, is likely to translate into more revenue for Skype and its parent eBay, which may be looking to unload it. Perhaps eBay can use Skype to drum up more corporate business."
130692,21439,2009-04-13T12:25:29-04:00,,I was away for spring break and coming back Monday wanted to summarize some things going on in the world of eBay that is relevant for sellers:
124877,22521,2009-03-09T08:01:07-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is scheduled to host an Analyst Day on Wednesday, March 11, the first under the new CEO John Donahoe. At a share price of $10, the stock is trading at its lowest levels since 2001. The shares are down approximately 80% from all time highs set in late 2004. This compares to a 50% contraction in the S&P 500 over the same time period. Clearly, management has destroyed value. I am not anticipating any game changers from the Analyst Day and I am not coming out with a list of questions for management. However, I do have a few ideas which I will discuss later.But first, this is where eBay stands as a company:eBay’s Marketplace business, which includes the core auction and fixed price business represented 55% of revenues in 2008. The auction business accounts for half of gross merchandise volume but matured two years ago and appears to be in the decline phase of its product cycle. However, the business is still a cash cow and I think, contrary to some, that the business can be salvaged by focusing on categories that still lends itself to the auction model, such as Collectibles. The option here is to bifurcate the marketplace business by focusing the auction model on certain categories, and focus the fixed price business on rest, while simultaneously attempting to improve the user experience on the entire business.On Skype, the sale price should bring in about $1.8 billion in cash. eBay purchased the business for $2.6 billion in 2005 and recently wrote down the value by $900 million, implying a $1.7 billion value for the business. Alternatively, the business should generate close to $700 million in revenues in 2009 and assuming a 20% EBITDA margin, we arrive at $140 million in EBITDA. Apply a 12-13x multiple to the business would yield a $1.7-$1.8 billion value or about $1.35 per share. I am not sure if the cash from the sale would be housed in the U.S., but if it is, eBay can use the cash to retire shares or maybe consider a special one-time dividend.For PayPal, I have argued that a sale is not optimal because the value of the synergies with the core business would erode over time. What management can consider is a spin-off of 50% of the business to existing shareholders. In that way, shareholders get a new currency of a business still in its growth phase, and management maintains control.Hopefully for eBay’s shareholders, management gives them something that would be catalysts for the shares."
123405,21382,2009-03-01T12:54:55-05:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is having second thoughts about how easy it will be to spread the Kijiji brand in the U.S. The company is testing out the name “eBay Classifieds” in two cities, San Antonio and Pittsburgh. A letter sent out to Kijiji members states:Maybe it also has something to do with the “j”s and “i”s blending together beyond recognition in “Kijiji.” It’s not just the name that needs work. The number of visitors to Kijiji sites worldwide was up only 7 percent in January to 23.2 million, while Craigslist grew six times faster and widened the gap. It ended January with 41.4 million unique visitors (comScore numbers).In the U.S., Kijiji is experiencing much stronger growth, but its 3.7 million unique visitors in January is only a tenth of that of Craigslist (which had 39.4 million U.S. unique visitors). A year ago, Kijiji vowed to become No. 1 in the U.S. It is still far from that goal. And Oodle, which just signed a deal to power Facebook’s classifieds (in addition to MySpace’s and AOL’s), is catching up from below.Kijiji is going to need more than a name change to challenge Craigslist.Original post"

123897,21376,2009-03-03T15:30:31-05:00,,"Skype’s new state of the art speech codec SILK will be made available to third party licensees for free, the company is announcing late Tuesday. Skype GM Jonathan Christensen will be speaking about the new program at the eComm event in San Francisco late Tuesday.SILK has been highly regarded by the guys that follow this sort of thing and is included in the most recent version of Skype for Windows (the Mac version with SILK will be coming in April). If both sides of the call have a version of Skype that includes the new codec, the call quality increases dramatically.Skype is now making the codec available for third party use on a royalty free basis. There are a number of speech codecs available on the market today, including iSac and AMRWideband, and an open source codec called Speex. Skype claims that SILK outperforms all of these.So why give it away to competitors? Christensen says its about setting standards in the industry so that VoIP services can spread more quickly, particularly to hardware devices that today are not optimized for voice over the Internet.It’s also a sign that Skype, with 400 million or so worldwide registered users, isn’t particularly concerned about the competition any more. They’re handing over a key piece of intellectual property to competitors that can reduce their costs and possibly improve voice quality. They wouldn’t do that unless they felt their pole position was fairly permanent for now.More importantly, it signals that Skype may be preparing to open up their service in the future. Skype has long been derided for being a closed service (by people like me, who continue, however, to use it daily). Their API allows developers to access limited features of the service, but a call requires the opening of the Skype client. If Skype were to open its core calling functions as a service, the number of applications that would build it in would explode. Skype would benefit from a surge in paid calls to traditional and mobile phones (Skype Out). Our guess is that the debate to open these core functions through the API is still raging within Skype, but that the proponents of openness are slowly starting to turn the tide.Original post"

Currently 90% of users are now using the new search engine and the company is aiming for 100% conversion. Jeff King, Senior Director of Finding, states that the new engine is cleaner and faster and will deliver better results. He stated that eBay incorporated user suggestions to make the search engine better – so yes, management is apparently listening to users. King said:eBay also stated that there are several new features in store. I have long held that search is extremely poor on eBay and the function should be outsourced to either Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Yahoo (YHOO), who specializes in search. Even with the new search engine in place, I continue to believe that search needs significant improvement. I am willing to give the new engine the benefit of doubt for about another six months to see if it is a material improvement or is at least comparable to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Remember that Amazon acquired specialized search knowledge through the development of A9.com, which itself was a failure from a commercial perspective. However, the knowledge learned was invaluable for Amazon and has been leveraged across the Amazon.com sites.At least eBay’s management is for once admitting that they are listening to users."
121717,21640,2009-02-20T06:45:58-05:00,,"The Windsor Lawsuit against eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Live Auctioneers is beginning to look like a road-map of sorts. Windsor Auctions filed a lawsuit against eBay in December 2007 alleging that eBay broke antitrust laws and various California laws. That lawsuit lumbered along at a snail's pace, as eBay filed numerous 12B6 Motions to Dismiss. Then one day, a new and improved version of the plaintiff's case was filed (along with another plaintiff) who alleged that they were also victims of eBay's willingness to allow a few preferred users on their eBay Live Auction platform to ""game"" the system to the tune of millions in revenues. As a side note, there are quite a lot of opinions posted online that Windsor's antitrust allegations were a long shot at best.One slight problem with the addition of the new plaintiff. The newly added plaintiff was a registered Delaware corporation and as such, an ""in your face"" diversity issue arose and the action filed by Windsor had to be dismissed without prejudice against eBay.Enter Tampa Bay based Saxon/Gilmore. Windsor and Jewelry Auctions (Florida corporations) decided to take the case into their own backyard by filing a new action against eBay and its partner (in the eBay Live Auction platform), Live Auctioneers, located in New York.eBay, in its infinite wisdom (once again) filed another 12B6 motion to dismiss and Live Auctioneers followed suit. In eBay's original motion to dismiss they stated that Windsor was ""obfuscating"" by NOT suing Live Auctioneers, eBay's partner.Windsor added Live Auctioneers, LLC   (including their CTO John Ralston) to its action filed in Florida. As eBay had done in the past, they filed a 12B6 motion stating that Windsor's original suit filed in the Northern District of California (and assigned to Judge Whyte) had been dismissed.Now for some factual information. The antitrust claim was dismissed by Judge Whyte, however, additional allegations within that action were not dismissed. The case was dismissed by the plaintiffs due to a ""crystal clear"" diversity issue involving the additional plaintiff. In other words, if the plaintiffs had NOT dismissed their action voluntarily, the case would have been dismissed (at some point) by either the judge or by eBay counsel when the diversity card was played.Now comes the revolving door of attorneys. Windsor retains the services of Berliner Cohen located in San Jose, California. The diversity issue (staring down Berliner) gets by those at Berliner and a complaint is filed naming the additional plaintiff from Delaware. Windsor then engages Saxon/Gilmore of Tampa, Florida and a new complaint is filed including not only eBay and Live Auctioneers, but, individuals as well. While Bay does business (worldwide), the judge in Tampa, Florida was presented with motions that convinced the court to send all parties back to the Northern District of California. The Florida judge does NOT dismiss the case, he sends it back to California.Windsor then files notification of a related case (the case filed by Balestriere/Lanza). The New York firm of Balestriere/Lanza are seeking class certification for their action against eBay, GoAntiques.com (.pdf), Neimans Jewelers and George Molayem (.pdf) (who operated Hot Jewelry Auctions and Paramount Auctions) on the eBay Live Auctions platform. The allegations? Shill bidding, (.pdf) among a litany of other claims. While the Balestriere/Lanza case was filed on behalf of the buyers on eBay Live Auctions, the Windsor/Jewelry Auctions action concerns the sellers who claim that eBay afforded an unfair competitive edge to Mr. Molayem. It appears as though the common denominator in both actions is Mr. Molayem and a platform that was anything but safe or fair. When the suits are placed side by side, Mr. Molayem's name (and his associated companies) are sprinkled throughout both actions like snow on Christmas Day. The judge presiding over the Balestriere/Lanza case is Judge Marilyn Patel who presided over the Napster (NAPS) case in early 2000.Never the twain shall meet…The old saying ""East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet"" might be very apropos for the next part of this article.When we last left eBay, Windsor Auctions, Jewelry Auctions and Live Auctioneers were sent back to the Northern District of California to duke it out. eBay filed a counter answer to Windsor's notification of related case (the case filed by Balestriere/Lanza) and eBay won another round.The case was assigned to Magistrate Zimmerman (.pdf) and eBay filed their consent and agreed to Magistrate Zimmerman presiding over the Windsor/Jewelry Auctions action. However, Live Auctioneers filed a notice of declination of Magistrate Zimmerman and the case was then sent back into the pool.After all was said and done, the case was assigned to none other than Judge Marilyn Patel who's presiding over the Balestriere/Lanza case (the case, which Windsor/Jewelry auctions attorneys filed notification of a similar case). eBay then filed notification with the court that Melina Patterson, one of the Cooley attorney's assigned to defend eBay against the Windsor/Jewelry Auctions action is no longer with Cooley and no longer represents eBay.So, the Windsor/Jewelry Auctions case has been on a wild ride of sorts. The case began in San Jose, California (was dismissed by the plaintiffs) re-filed in Tampa, Florida (their home state) and was then sent back to California, where it's finally found a home in Judge Patel's court. The case was beginning to look like an orphan of sorts but the plaintiffs continued their quest in seeking their day in court.In reviewing the notification of the related Balestriere/Lanza case (on the surface) there appears to be many similarities, one of which is Mr. George Molayem. Mr. Molayem operated under a number of eBay user-names, among them Hot Jewelry Auctions and Paramount Auctions. Windsor/Jewelry Auctions contends that Mr. Molayem used a tool which catapulted his jewelry listings to the front of regular eBay listings every hour on the hour, seven days a week (for a number of years). The placement of his listings at the front of eBay core listings, before other jewelry sellers (whether an eBay Live Auction or regular eBay seller), could have been detrimental to the ""fair marketplace"" claim eBay contends it operates.In the end, it appears as though Windsor/Jewelry Auctions had father time on its side. Over the course of any legal action, things will change. Judges will retire, motions will be filed and of course, with more than one defendant in the case, it can become a crap-shoot in getting co-defendants on the same page. This case has turned into the classic David and Goliath mother of all eBay cases. While many may not fully understand what this case (and the Balestriere/Lanza case) represent, the plaintiffs (both buyers and sellers) know what's at stake.Nonetheless. while the eBay Live Auctions platform was shut down by eBay on December 31, 2008, it's legacy lives on within the courts.Disclosure: no positions"
119641,22623,2009-02-10T09:33:59-05:00,,"On a radio interview a few weeks ago I heard Sherwood Schwartz, executive producer of Gilligan’s Island, say that he felt that it was entirely rational that the Professor, genius that he was, could never figure a way off the island, when all he had to do was nail some wood on the boat.“That’s true of mankind,” said Schwartz. “They can do except what they cannot do.”I thought of that analogy when I think about eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). eBay reminds me of the Professor, who with all the smarts, advantages and good looks, cannot figure out the obvious solution. With eBay, the issue is that it has to fix its core auction business. In order to succeed, eBay has to patch up its relations with its sellers, and re-win the confidence of its buyers. I cannot understand why it can’t execute this. Is it pride? Or is it the novelty of its holdings?Like the Professor, eBay is so enjoying wonderful academic exercises like Skype that it never figures out a way to lasting success at auctions. First, let's look at just a few of eBay’s assets, which in many cases would be prized companies on their own:Then, there are eBay’s general advantages:Yet, if you look at eBay’s stock, it is down close to where it was at the first tech bust. So what does eBay need to do to fix it? We don’t have the exact answers, but management needs to consider the following:eBay is one of the most fascinating companies in the U.S., and it is most certainly worth more than its share price. But that doesn’t mean it can’t screw things up in the meantime.Stock position: None."
117647,22406,2009-01-30T08:38:27-05:00,,"I’ve written before about the amazing potential of one of the most maligned and misunderstood acquisitions in my recent memory. eBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) purchase of Skype has been unanimously decried with such words as “irrational” and “foolish.”With such negativity, one must assume Skype is a dying, unprofitable, debt laden business!The Little Engine that CouldMalcom Gladwell is a widely read anthropologist with a popular series of books about the sociology of business and talent. One such book, The Tipping Point talks about those great paradigm shifts that disruptive technologies have created through history. Gladwell specifically targets that magical moment where an idea/product reaches a point of no return; where the positive feedback of user adoption creates a virtuous upward cycle that is unstoppable (hence the title of the book.) Is Skype reaching that point?An interesting thing is happening to Skype user rates that seem to be hardly reported.One often ignored metric that many analysts glance over is the concurrent user number. This number represents the total number of users that are actively on the Skype network. I argue this metric is one of the most important metrics when analyzing Skype; as it represents “real’ user adoption. Forget about user accounts registered (a user can register more then once or not even use it) – the real number you should be looking at is what number of users are actually logged in and USING Skype at the same time.This graph shows the million milestones of concurrent users and the number of days it took to reach each consecutive million concurrent user rate.On 1-26-2009 – Skype had a record 15,952,085 users. That’s almost an additional 1 million users since the last million milestone of 1-12-2009 – This is a record pace – only 16 days! At this trajectory – Skype is not only growing, but accelerating growth.You can always track the current user log in rates in this helpful site (Source: Borderless Communicator).Show Me The Money!Ultimately, I do understand that user rates aren’t worth a bucket of beans if it doesn’t translate to revenue.Skype Year End RevenuesThis represents a healthy 44% Year over Year growth.Assuming that the revenue declaration continues at its current pace and Skype grows revenues at 33% Year over Year for 2009, this would yield 2009 pro-forma operating income of $117 million and tax-adjusted pro-forma earnings of approximately $108 million. Skype's operating margin (excluding options) is expected to come closer to 16% in 2009. Again, just being very conservative and a forward P/E multiple of 30x (again restricting PEG to 1.0x) we get a current valuation of roughly $3.2 billion. 3.2 Billion Is more than the 3.13 Billion dollars that eBay paid and definitely more than what eBay has valued Skype at 2.23 B.I concede to Skype’s detractors that Skype revenue is slowing due to the natural effect of having free calls as more and more Skype users can talk free to fellow Skype users as more of their friends join. However, I’m not concerned about this as much as I am excited about what I believe to be the next paradigm shift that will ultimately take Skype to the moon.VOIP’s time may finally comeI mentioned previously that Gladwell's book The Tipping Point was all about that moment where an idea or technology reaches critical mass where there is no point of return. Gladwell’s book discusses many instances where for whatever reason, a technology sometimes take a while to catch on. Take texting for example, mainstream in Asia for years before the first teenager got sore thumbs broadcasting his or her life on Twitter. There is now a plethora of VOIP offerings, the most high profile disappointing offering being Vonage (NASDAQ:VG).I argue that the wild card is cell phone apps. Skype already has an application on Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android OS and is soon to complete one for the iPhone.For those not too savvy about what this means, well it entails very cheap domestic / international calling regardless of how many minutes you have on a phone plan (as long as you have an internet connection like the iPhone). I’ve been using the former applet on my cell phone to call internationally, and I’ve found no easier way for me to call the world cheaply on my cell phone than Skype. I believe the future of mobile devices will slowly move from a ‘per minute’ model to a flat rate model that includes voice and data. Think of this shift as like the early days of the internet (i.e. AOL) where you had to dial up and pay “per minute.” Eventually the ‘per minute’ model changed to a monthly flat rate fee. Many of the wireless providers already provide ‘unlimited’ minutes for a flat fee. With iPhone monthly user fees nearing $100 – the spread between the cost of unlimited minutes and a variable monthly fee is getting thinner and thinner.As users demand more ubiquitous internet access, to me it’s a no brainer that it’s a matter of time until a data connection becomes an “always on” proposition. This shift is further bolstered by the launch of “netbooks” (micro laptops that stress mobile internet connections). While unlimited minutes would ultimately depress Skype’s advantage for domestic calls (something that Skype was never used much for) – it would only amplify the value proposition for Skype’s main attraction: international communication. If my predictions for unlimited minutes never happens, Skype would benefit even more; by allowing users to circumvent their ‘minutes limit” for domestic calls and the international benefit still remains. I argue this demand will only grow as the world becomes more and more integrated and mobile devices continue to grow. Skype is right there ready to fill gaps from continued shift to mobile communications (on and off the desktopA Diamond in the RoughI believe Skype presents a tremendous opportunity, and has been so badly tarnished by its parent's (eBay’s) troubles that people are ready to throw eBay’s baby out with the bathwater. Whether eBay ultimately sells Skype or hangs on to it, it’s a great asset that is ignored by and large by the investing community and I hope this article brings to light the enormous opportunity of becoming the de facto standard of voice communications that Skype presents.Disclosure: Long eBay, short Vonage."

Its EPS of $0.41 also slipped by 9% from the previous year, though it managed to beat the Street’s expectations of $0.39. EPS recorded its first ever year-over-year decline.The company closed the year with $8.5 billion revenues, recording growth of 11% and EPS of $1.71 grew by 12% over the year.By segment, Marketplace transactions were down 16% over the year and contributed $1.3 billion in revenue. Active users grew by 5% on a trailing twelve-month basis. Classifieds grew 48% and text and graphical advertising were up 47%, but Shopping.com declined 50%.PayPal posted revenues of $623 million and grew by 11%. Total payment volume was $16 billion, an increase of 14%. Global active PayPal accounts grew by 23% to 70 million. Skype revenue grew by 26% to $145 million in the quarter. Skype-to-Skype minutes grew by 72% to over 20 billion. Going forward, eBay expects to generate revenues of $1.8-$2.05 billion with EPS of $0.32-$0.34.During the year, the company made quite a few significant acquisitions. It acquired Fraud Sciences, which should improve PayPal’s risk management capabilities; Bill Me Later to extend its leadership position in payments, but mainly to thwart Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN); and DBA and BilBasen to broaden its global leadership in online classifieds.After taking over from Meg Whitman, John Donahoe listed three clear priorities for the company:During the year, Donahoe’s game plan had varied results. Though eBay has made significant improvements in their user interface and migrated to a more balanced auction and fixed-price model, their user base is not growing substantially. Today, Amazon is a preferred e-tailing site over eBay. ComScore’s metrics also reported traffic to Amazon in December 2008 as rising by 9.8% over the year compared with eBay’s 2.5% drop in traffic.The company also doesn’t seem to be doing much with Skype, despite Donahoe’s admission that Skype is not likely to have many synergies with their other portfolio and that eBay is treating it as a standalone business. Why not sell it to someone who may not treat it as standalone and get some real value out of it, and be willing to pay commensurate cash in exchange for the opportunity? Yes, I am talking about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).The stock continued its drop and at the time of writing, had fallen to a record low of $13.28.

Recently, at the Q4 analyst meeting, new speculation found fertile soil. I added a little myself.There is an interesting case for incumbents to take a look at Skype (which is not a very new idea). Not only would they buy back some lost revenues, but they would also expand internationally (including emerging markets, where they all want to focus their investments at this point - talk about following the crowd). I particularly like the option to buy an international brand name that could be extended to include other services (such as operating the services and the active layer in FTTH networks throughout Europe).A very valued reader pointed me to a limitation regarding Skype's sale. It has to do with how Silicon Valley seems to work. Apparently, development activity in Silicon Valley is grouped together in a number of clusters, and the sale of proprietary technology that Skype sits on may be limited to companies within the cluster. It could possibly even be a little more pronounced than that: the technology (check out this 1998 company and see what has become of it) serves as the basis for VC groups to set up a range companies. In Skype's case: the Joltid Global Index software was first used for Kazaa, then for Skype and next for Joost.I'm not quite sure how these clusters are formed, but supposedly there is one around Redmond [Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) - don't mind the exact geographic location], one around Palo Alto [Sun (JAVA)] and one around Stanford [Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Yahoo! (YHOO), eBay]. This seems to preclude a sale to anything like a European incumbent. But how about KPN - doesn't its iBasis subsidiary have a deal for SkypeOut?"

113610,22521,2009-01-07T06:29:20-05:00,,"In a prior write-up on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) (see eBay's Demand Problem Worsens), I quoted data from Jeffries & Co. analysts Youssef Squali that eBay's global listings were up close to 40% YoY, but that traffic to the site was down 11% YoY, suggesting that the demand problem had not been fixed However, I have analyzed conversion rate data for the quarter and the data suggests a surprising improvement in auction conversion rates on a sequential basis. On the other hand, the fixed price conversion rates entered a tailspin in early September and never recovered in 4Q. Taken together, the overall company conversion rates remained steady from the third quarter.Wall Street Analysts have suggested that company wide conversion rates have deteriorated in the quarter, so if my data is correct, then the increased listings with steady conversions would be a positive for eBay and would suggest a possible beat for the quarter.However, it is too early to call a turnaround in the business because eBay's structural problems persist and the demand problem has not been corrected. Although eBay has been one of my favorite companies to watch over the years, I am staying on the sidelines as there are more attractive investments with better upside potential and with lower operational risks.From A Recent Note By JPMorgan Analyst Imran Khan:"
115475,22521,2009-01-20T08:09:08-05:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is scheduled to report 4Q08 earnings on Wednesday Jan. 21 and the Street is projecting revenues of $2.120bn and Adjusted EPS of $0.40. My work suggests that those numbers are achievable but 2009 Street estimates of $8.7bn and adjusted EPS of $1.65 could be a challenge to meet. As such, I believe that eBay should withhold providing guidance for 1Q09 and for full year 2009. Doing so should help stabilize the share price and reduce volatility in the near-term.It goes without saying that eBay's core business remains challenging, while results from the payments, classifieds, and advertising businesses are strong. However, in order for the shares to recover, the core business will have to start performing. My estimates are calling for a dramatic 12% FX-neutral decline in 4Q GMV and an 8% decline for full year 2009, as slow auto sales weigh-in more negatively. Ex-autos, I expect a GMV growth rate of -6%. Unless the GMV growth rate stabilizes the shares are likely to languish for some time.Listings trends have been strong and conversions on the auction business is stable per the data that I have analyzed. However, the BIN conversions are off sharply and ASP numbers are declining rapidly. In addition, it appears that listings quality has been declining. Further, per the comScore data, traffic to the site continues to decline as eBay's demand problem worsens. On the sell side, sellers are still departing the site in significant numbers to other channels such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) (buyers are going to Amazon as well). Clearly the business remains challenged.What is eBay's Management to do?Meanwhile I will remain on the sidelines but will continue to monitor the business for any critical turning points. The shares are trading at extremely cheap multiples for an Internet stock at 4x '09 EBITDA and 8.0x Adj. '09 EPS. But shares are cheap for a reason and for eBay it's the struggling core business."

Analysts are worried about the Q4 report, but they’re even more spooked about the guidance the company will provide for 2009 given the soft consumer economy.EBAY today is down 31 cents, or 2.31%, to $13.13.Original post"
113302,22627,2009-01-06T10:08:58-05:00,,"I thought that eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) may be a good play on frugality in 2009. The stock is off 53% this year. It is trading at historically low PE and similar relative value metrics, has lots of cash and no long term debt.The company did draw down a billion dollars from a revolver for thepurchase of Bill Me Later in October, but this should not be an issue to repay. The revolver matures at the end of 2012 and the company has lots of cash and also generates lots of cash.eBay has been a large growth company for some years. From 1998 through 2005,  eBay traded at anywhere between 1500 and 50x earnings, 33.8 in '06, 28.4 in '07 and now a meager 9.3x this year's expected $1.56 per share. We are three quarters into 2008 earnings and have tallied 1.17 per share in the first 3 quarters. We should be able to hit the required .397 in Q4. Such a figure would still be lower than quarters two and three and two pennies lower than last year.This year,  eBay has a broader product offering including Skype, better integrated PayPal, Stub Hub and Bill me Later, among others.These offerings, along with an ~ 35% increase in listings, will have to offset the 10% decrease in YoY unique visitors to the auction site and a whopping 25% decrease in total traffic. This is the main problem - a fundamental issue relating to its operations, its appeal and its model in the future.2008 was actually the first year that other auction sites finally were able to attract buyers. Some revolt among the old-guard of  eBay sellers vis a vis new policies on eBay (new listing fee structure, new rules about shipping fees and new seller rating systems) and disenchantment with new CEO John Donahoe contributed to the fundamental ops problems as well.A  sum-of-parts valuation may imply  eBay is selling for about what it is worth - applying a 1B valuation to Skype, 7x Ebitda for the marketing business (growing at a 10% clip) and 8x for the payments business (growing at a 25% clip) leaves about 5x for the marketplace. (7 x 788 * 55% = 3.05B) + (8x 1836 *33% = 605M) + (5 x 4,838 *44% = 10.64B) + Skype = Total of 15.24BeBay has net cash of about 3.3B for an EV of (18,719-3,300) 15.4 B.I believe that while this may seem to be a compelling value in times of expanded multiples and risk taking, right now, with  eBay's main marketplace business growth slowing to a near halt, with fundamentals, in my opinion, impaired, I think  eBay is fully valued right here at 14.Disclosure: no positions"
111564,21484,2008-12-19T04:33:46-05:00,,"This year can best be summed up as a year of change.  eBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) top executives left one by one, followed by buyers and sellers who vowed never to return.  Shareholders were stunned when the stock plummeted to 10.91.  The debt rating was lowered to A minus.  The site’s instability grew with each passing day and the number of lawsuits filed against eBay and PayPal increased spectacularly.  It hasn’t been a good year.eBay started the year with about 12M listings give or take a few and ultimately hit a high of approximately 18M towards the end of July.  Then a handful of eBay power sellers flooded the site with nearly 10M additional listings (reported to be free) from September to December but I’m not counting these listings because these aren’t paid listings.2008 was the worst year sellers have experienced since eBay’s conception.  At the beginning of the year, eBay’s Customer Satisfaction campaign stripped sellers of their rights and then sellers were told that their customers were now eBay’s customers.Detailed seller ratings (the dreaded DSRs) were introduced.  Sellers were suspended and their listings deleted when their DSRs fell below 4.3 because eBay told buyers to rate sellers on a scale of 1 to 5 and that a score of 4 was good.  DSRs were also mysteriously lowered immediately preceding billing resulting in no/reduced seller discounts.Sellers were banned from leaving negative feedback.  This opened the floodgates for non-paying buyers and competing sellers to leave negative feedback.  Sellers were left with no recourse because the check and balance system that made eBay work was removed.Seller tools.  Shipping calculator and markdown manager were never fixed.  The SYI (sell your item form) morphed into something that defies description because it’s so bad.Site instability.  This went from bad to worse.  The site was riddled with bad links & bad script.  Pages barely loaded if at all for dial up users due to too many bells & whistles (indicative of student programmers) that served no purpose and excessive advertising that sent buyers off site.  Cookies also flooded the site.It was a bad year for buyers too.  They couldn’t find IT!  Best Match was officially named the worst sort/search engine on the internet.  Search results were linked to everything but the kitchen sink and it took divine intervention to find anything.  Entire categories of search results are still missing and many sellers reported over a 70% drop in sales which explains the pitiful sell thru rates.Many lawsuits were filed against both eBay and PayPal this year.  Most are as a direct result of policy changes that thrust eBay well over the line of being just a venue.I found the following pending lawsuits interesting:eBay security has apparently not improved since I reported a problem last spring because a contest was recently held on eBay and hackers are reported to have won the prizes.  eBay offered no explanation and PayPal accounts continue to be hacked.No opt out!  Members’ personal account information was shared with eBay’s entire corporate family and unnamed eBay service providers (fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs, and co-branded credit cards).  I’m not sure when this change in the user agreement occurred but it scares the hell out of me.Summary.  The other night I watched an old movie called Scrooge and it reminded me of eBay’s Donahoe.  I wish that all three Christmas ghosts (past, present, and future) would visit John so he can be reminded of eBay’s past success as an auction site, its present failure as a wannabe retail site, and its future which lays in the internet graveyard, a victim of disruptive innovation.This author is giving new CEO John Donahoe an F on his 1st end of year report card.  I’ve never seen an e-commerce site nearly destroyed in such a short period of time.Happy Holidays!Disclosure: Dinah Balk is a long time eBay seller."
110639,21439,2008-12-14T17:06:22-05:00,,"In previous posts on this blog and in the press, I'm on the record pointing out many eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) issues that we see with DSRs, BestMatch/Finding, fraud, eBay's overall strategy, how they treat sellers, etc. Like everyone in the ecosystem I am very concerned about the future of eBay.Thursday, we saw an interesting datapoint I wanted to share.  Now it's one datapoint and I realize that, but it is a significant datapoint and could be an early signal that eBay's changes are working.eBay: A mile wide and an inch deep.For 8yrs+, ChannelAdvisor has been helping sellers of all sizes on eBay and we quickly learned that the eBay sweet-spot for sellers of any size is for wide (lots of SKUs), but not deep (lots of quantity of a single item).  Back in the day (2001-2007), we worked with eBay to bring some manufacturers and retailers on the site and also with larger powersellers to test the depth of the platform.  We've had IBM sell hundreds of laptops, Motorola (MOT) sell hundreds of handsets, and shoe sellers sell hundreds of great-priced shoes, etc.  While that sounds interesting, it's usually just a blip out of the total inventory available.In fact most eBay sellers of scale ($2m/yr+) have to run a wholesale business as they buy in such large lots, they can only sell a small % on eBay so they end up wholesaling the rest.  Large manufacturers and retailers turn to 'jobbers' or liquidators to move volume.  Some of that product comes to eBay, but the bulk doesn't so there's a huge opportunity GMV out there of 'deep sku discounts'.Companies like Overstock (NASDAQ:OSTK) and smartbargains and liquidation.com fill some of the gaps there as well.In retailer slang, it became well known that eBay is a mile wide and an inch deep.Houston, we have a problem?!Ok, back to today (December 12, 2008).  24x7x365 at ChannelAdvisor  we have 2-3 people on-call watching our production systems.  During the holidays we effectively double/triple that staff.  Aside from the obvious benefits from doing this, we are also able to see unusual trends and monitor them and react if needed.Thursday night around 6pm (start of ecomm prime-time), we started getting some massive alerts from our systems that there was some unusual volume.  One of our folks dug in and figured out what it was.  We had a single eBay listing that was selling at a rate of one every 5-7 seconds on average, but at peak we were seeing several per second.The system was keeping up, but it was actually causing some delays in the eBay servers (we were able to spread this around and avoid any latency).eBay - no longer an inch deep?It turns out that we have a customer, webbestdeals, that had an item selected by eBay for their new deal of the day program (you can read more about it here - clear your cookies if you don't see it).  The item is a Logitech Harmony Advanced remote contorl - these are pretty popular and the low price on the internet is $40-50.  This seller has it with free shipping for $29.99 - a SICK DEAL! (In fact, I believe the listing was hit on many of the popular sickdeal/fatwallet type sites as well).As of this writing they've sold over 6000 of these and are on pace to hit 9-10k easily.  At 6000 by $30 that's a whopping $180k in a listing. Sure there are cars and stuff that have achieved that, but this is 6000, $30 transactions in a 24hr period.  click on 'purchases' if you don't believe me!So while this is one datapoint, it is interesting to think about the implications.  As we enter this tough economic climate, I'm sure there will be a LOT of inventory that needs to be liquidated.  Historically a small % of this has made it to eBay.  Imagine if eBay could take this model and scale it.  There could be some pretty big opportunities out there with sellers of any size (webbestdeals is titanium PS, but not a 'diamond'/brand) that could bring some deep gmv to the 'new, deeper, eBay.'A word of caution to my Wall St. friendsThis reminded me that many of the analysts on Wall St. still try to calculate what's going to happen at eBay based on listings data.  They frequently go to the browse all category page and count the listings.  Then they look at completed listings to get an idea of conversions.  In most of these listings historically the quantity is 1 or close it (dutch auctions, fp7 and others allow multi-quantity listings, but they were rare).Well FP30 totally ruins that model.  First of all you now have lots of 30-day listings out there with more and more quantity 'hidden' behind them.  Take the example above.  That would have probably been 9000 listings, now it's one listing, quant=9000.Also, the conversion data is all wacky now too.  The reason why is the fp30 doesn't show up in completed listings until it's life is over or it is sold out.  So in the above example, you could have 30 days (you wouldn't 'see' until jan) before this listing shows in completed listings. Also, it only shows as 'one sold completed item' in completed search.To see each transaction, you'd have to dig into the listing and get into 'completed sales'.The bottom line is eBay is driving FP30 adoption HARD by increasing the mix of fp30 in search results (50% in most cases) and thus there are a material number of fp30's out there with a material quantity behind them and the old listing-count scheme is largely blind to all this activity.In conclusion...Yes it's one item and one datapoint, but I have to say I'm surprised and impressed that we're finally seeing eBay address the 'depth' problem.  eBay Strategies readers, what are your thoughts?  One-time anomaly, glimmer of hope, turnaround is working or rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic?Disclosure: Author is long Google and Amazon."

Since coming public in 1998 the sales, cash flow,  earnings and book value have all increased exponentially. The shares peaked in  late 2004 at a ridiculous price of $59.20 on trailing earnings that year of  $0.57 and an absurd P/E of 104x.Wednesday, EBAY shares closed at $13.48 or just 9.3x 2008's expected EPS  of $1.48.

Those are not misprints! Despite those  great growth numbers today's mind-numbing market environment is now offering up  EBAY shares are under 10x trailing earnings.How's the balance sheet? As of September 30, 2008 the company had zero  debt and $3.643 billion in cash. Value Line assigns an ""A+"" financial strength  rating to EBAY.Even presuming slower future growth rates and a much more modest than  typical valuation I could see EBAY shares trading at 20 times the now consensus  estimate for 2009 of $1.43 /share. That leads me to a 12 – 15 month target price  of $28.60 or 112% above the current quote.Is that a crazy goal? Only in being, perhaps, too conservative. These  shares hit peak share prices of $32.40 - $58.90 in each calendar year 2003  through 2008 all on fundamentals that were well below today's levels. The  absolute lows in those same years never came in below $22.80 - $31.20 (excepting  the past 6 weeks).The poor economic conditions may well lead to more people selling  unwanted items on eBay to raise cash and PayPal has proven to be a tremendous  moneymaker since their acquisition in 2002.EBAY shares represent the most favorable valuation in their 10-year  trading history. They are immune from the credit market crisis due their lack of  debt, high cash holdings and tremendous free cash flow generation. Capital  spending for 2008 is likely to come in at just around 23% of cash flow.Value Line  sees EBAY earning $1.85 /share over the next 3 – 5 years and commanding a 30  multiple by then for a 2011 – 2013 mid-point target of $55.50. I'm hoping for a  least a double by the end of 2009.Disclosure: Author recently purchased, and now holds, EBAY  shares."

Market volatility has existed due to bad weather in New York the last weekend before Christmas forcing shoppers to stay home.  Recently released data for online retailers showed an increase of 6, 8, and 10% of unique visitors to online stares for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) respectively.  eBay was down 16% in the same category.eBay still had a greater number of total unique visitors with 32.6 million, about 5.3 million visitors more than Amazon.  Amazon is saying that this was their greatest Christmas season ever; why should eBay not be just as ecstatic?  eBay, though down 16% in visitors, is still receiving more customers than their chief rival, Amazon.Also, we cannot forget the recent partnership between PayPal, a company owned by eBay, and Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart recently began allowing online customers to pay with PayPal on their website; it also encouraged customers to use PayPal by offering a twenty dollar credit to the customer's PayPal account if the purchase is over twenty dollars.  With Wal-Mart attracting over 18 million visitors to their online store and PayPal being offered as a payment method, eBay will be able to partially make up for the 6 million visitors lost this holiday season.  John J. Donahoe CEO of eBay says that merchants currently like PayPal even more in these economically challenging times because of the low costs that it offers.PayPal is now the backbone of eBay.  PayPal make up 28% percent of total revenues and eBay hopes that will increase to over a third in the coming quarters.  In its most recent earnings call, eBay reported that payment volume grew 12%  for PayPal on eBay and a whopping 49% off of eBay in Q3.  This quarter, PayPal had more payment value then eBay had total merchandise volume.eBay has the right idea: don’t be afraid of change.  PayPal is now becoming the backbone of eBay rather than eBay itself.  The company has not only accepted this fact, but also embraced it.  eBay has become a growth company that likes expansion. Skype has also become a key factor, driving revenue growth 46% this quarter.  Hopefully, the new acquisition of Bill Me Later can be as profitable as Skype.  eBay is undervalued right now and anyone who has faith in PayPal should have faith in eBay and buy.Disclosure: no positions"
107871,21376,2008-11-25T08:46:59-05:00,,"When eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) paid $945 million for BillMeLater in October, we blinked. The business assigns credit at the point of sale to ecommerce customers who can’t use credit cards because they don’t have them, have maxed out credit limits, or choose not to. It charges fees much like a credit card - currently 19% interest.The credit markets were already a wreck in October, with accelerating defaults on credit card accounts. And worse, the securitization markets were starting to shut down, meaning credit companies couldn’t get the debt off their books.Still, a BillMeLater investor said not to worry. Their model is different than the credit card companies, he said, because they only issue credit on a per-transaction basis.Fast forward a month and a half, though, and things are much worse. Credit default rates are expected to hit 10% next year as personal bankruptcies soar, and the securitization markets are flat out closed.And I don’t really buy the argument that BillMeLater has a better model than the credit card companies. Card companies can (and do) lower credit limits in bad times, so they don’t have much more exposure on credit limits compared to BillMeLater. Also, most of BillMeLater’s customers don’t qualify for credit cards in the first place, or are tapped out. That makes this debt super sketchy. And BillMeLater’s credit models were created in a world of 5% default rates (the average over the last ten years), which are nowhere near as bad as what’s coming. On top of all of this, BillMeLater is pushing incentives that give people zero payments until April 1. What a teaser to buy stuff people can’t afford for the holidays.This is adverse selection at work. People who don’t need to wait until April 1 to pay won’t use it. Those that do will, and those people are likely to be big credit risks.At the very least eBay seems to have overpaid for BillMeLater. At worst they may have huge losses on the product next year. In 2008 they’ll do $1 billion in payment volume. You can do the math on a 10%+ default rate.Original post"

No, he ignored the combined voices of thousands of sellers.  Now one of his disruptive innovations has come full circle and sellers are fighting back – in the courtroom.Yes it's true.  Another buyer reported being sued by a seller over feedback this week.But what the buyer didn't say is that he received exactly what he purchased, the item arrived in a timely manner, and shipping costs were stated and not unreasonable.This buyer is representative of many buyers being sued by sellers for leaving negative feedback (often due to shipping) because John left sellers no other option when he removed the check & balance system that made eBay work – two way feedback.I wonder if buyers expect Scotty to beam up their purchases for them.  I think they must but even Scotty has beaming costs and so do sellers.  Shipping rates have skyrocketed in the last 2 years and many buyers have no idea how much it costs to ship an item.But I'm not convinced that buyers are entirely to blame.  eBay has nothing conspicuously posted to let buyers know that 1) they can be sued over negative feedback 2) their payment may be held by Paypal for 21 to 180 days for no reason and 3) sellers will not ship until Paypal releases their funds.It's too bad John removed two way feedback.  That's why so many sellers' are suing - it's easier to get a court order to remove negative feedback (and DSRs) then deal with eBay's feedback removal system because judges look at facts – not buyer satisfaction.The following text messages began appearing in sellers' listings directly underneath the item cost a few weeks ago.  This is sure to create more negative feedback.Do two of these messages indicate free shipping?  eBay says ""no"" but a buyer of mine thought they did and told me that she was calling the BBB because she thinks the deal alerts are deceptive.

Tuesday, eBay announced a new holiday buyer incentive program (starts Nov 3 for 45 days).

Not me.This long time seller read the terms & conditions and discovered:What else is wrong with this sale?  It is nearly impossible for a buyer to find anything on eBay because Best Match doesn't work.  This means buyers may not be able to take advantage of the holiday incentives, which may be a blessing in disguise.The free shipping icon started appearing in many sellers' listings over a week ago despite shipping costs being stated.  Local pick up and delivery is also set to Free by default.  This may be enough to push small sellers over the edge because when a buyer sees Free Shipping he/she expects it to be free.  No resolution appears to be in sight.So what kind of sale is this?  I don't know but I'm beginning to think it was designed it to rid eBay of small sellers because sellers will probably get placed on suspension for dinged stars as a direct result of shipping that isn't free & discounts that don't instantly materialize.Small sellers will also have Paypal holds to deal with because many featured items are considered ""high risk"" (electronics, DVD movies, etc.) and subject to an automatic 21 to 180 day hold.

This comes on top of $209 million previously raised over two rounds.The new financing was led by Technology Crossover Ventures, with existing investors IVP and Redpoint Ventures participating as well. The financing is the largest minority investment of a U.S. Internet company in the last eight years, according to Venture Source.The pre-money valuation was around $1.15 billion, say a couple of sources, and at least $50 million of the round went off the table to earlier investors. The company was founded in 2005 and has grown primarily through acquisitions: They’ve acquired at least eleven vacation home rental sites, including VRBO, VacationRentals.com, Abritel.fr and OwnersDirect.co.uk.The company has revenues of around $150 million and $50 million in ebitda. In addition to cashing out some of the investors, our guess is that the additional funding will likely be used for further acquisitions.It’s also clear that the round was seriously overvalued. Ebay (NASDAQ:EBAY) was rumored to have mulled over an acquisition earlier this year at $1.5 billion, but it never came through with a firm offer. It’s not clear who else could be a buyer at this valuation. Also, since HomeAway has acquired just about everyone in the market, there’s little room for additional growth via acquisitions. 20x ebitda is a public company valuation for a company with real growth potential. Our guess is these new investors may take a bath.Original post"

101932,22406,2008-10-26T06:54:08-04:00,,"eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) acquisition of Skype in 2005 has been one of the many controversial moves eBay has been recently making.  The purchase was originally marketed as the missing piece to create the holy trinity in eBay's hallowed e-commerce halls (along with eBay's auction sites and PayPal.)  The thinking was that Skype would accelerate transactions among strangers as they communicated to each other more efficiently.  eBay later found out that people are more interested in buying/selling quickly then chatting it up about those transactions.Consequently, Skype did not live up to all the hype, and eBay has been paying for the acquisition ever since.  So the question remains, eBay goofed – but how bad?  How bad is Skype?   I think if you look at their performance; you'll find surprisingly that Skype is not bad at all…What did eBay pay for Skype?First things first, how much did eBay exactly pay for Skype?  I've noticed a lot of numbers floating around the web anywhere between 2.6 to 4.1 Billion. The variance stems from the tiered payment structure that was negotiated to be based on Skype's future performance.  EBay had agreed to initially acquire Skype for $1.3 billion in cash and $1.3 billion in stock and would pay up to $1.5 billion more if Skype met financial targets by 2008 and 2009.    eBay ended up paying 530 million out of the 1.5 billion performance portion to settle the transaction.  So the grand total paid was 3.13 Billion dollars.  If that wasn't complicated enough, eBay at the same time took a 900 Million dollar charge basically valuing Skype  at 2.23 B (out of the 3.13 B they paid).How is Skype doing anyway?So investors agree eBay overpaid and eBay agrees with them.  So, just how bad is Skype?  Well, let me breakdown revenue numbers and current growth rates and you be judge. Revenue in the past 4 quarters came in at 521 million vs. 332 million for the previous 4 quarters giving us a growth rate of 56.9 % Y/Y, a growth rate that currently eclipses Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Yahoo (YHOO) and yes…even Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). But what good is growth if that growth is drastically slowing down?  Amazingly, growth is not slowing down – in fact it's accelerating! Just this week Skype logged its fastest growth rate of user activity in its history – Skype logged an additional one million more concurrent users (a good measure of usage) in just 35 days. So here we are; we have a company growing 50+ percent year over year, is currently accelerating growth and most importantly profitable.  It sounds to me like we got the bases loaded for investors.Skype had Q3 2008 revenue of $143 million and is on track to reach 2008 revenue of $570 million. Let's be conservative and assume the current economic crisis hits revenue growth and causes it decelerate almost half to 30% next year, we can still expect somewhere around $741 million in 2009 revenue.Skype's operating margin (excluding options) is expected to come closer to 16% in 2009. This would yield 2009 pro-forma operating income of $119 million and tax-adjusted pro-forma earnings of approximately $107 million. Again, just being very conservative and a forward P/E multiple of 30x (again restricting PEG to 1.0x) we get a current valuation of roughly $3.2 billion.  3.2 Billion Is more than the 3.13 Billion dollars that eBay paid and definitely more then what eBay has valued Skype at 2.23 B Sometimes it's okay to be a third wheel.I understand Skype does not have any of the promised synergies with eBay.  As a standalone company however – it would definitely be valued much more then the unloved step child it is now.  Skype should be a net positive toward eBay, and at worse, have a neutral effect on investor sentiment.  Being a third wheel can be okay as long as that wheel is carrying its own weight…say, like on a tricycle.Disclosure: Long EBAY"
100598,22406,2008-10-19T07:36:54-04:00,,"In my first post I had made the point that investors have un-fairly punished the whole of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) for its struggling core site. I pointed out that eBay is now made up of a lot more then just auctions and their healthy high growing properties are now suffering ""guilt by association.""Paypal is sleeping with the enemyI received many challenges on how I breakdown my original revenue lines, and I want to thank those critics. My goal is always first give all the facts, and then give my opinion.Here are two good points that eBay shorts made:I want to tip my hat to people that pointed this out and take these  points into account.Let's take a closer lookSo how much of PayPal's revenue comes from the (now perceived as cancerous) eBay auction sites?49% and falling – here is the percentage of Paypal's revenue from eBay auction sites for the last 4 quartersAs you can see the trend is that more and more of Paypal's revenue is coming not from eBay auctions sites but from Merchant Services, like the non-widely known recent agreement for WalMart.com to accept Paypal.In an effort to sever revenue associated with eBay, let me be conservative and assume half of the revenue generated from Paypal's eBay relationship will go away – that still gives us a ttm (trailing twelve month) revenue total of $1.73 Billion (out of $2.34 B) in revenue and growing 27% Y/Y. During a recent investor conference John Donahoe disclosed that PayPal's operating margins (excluding options) is expected to come around 20% in 2009. That gives us a net income of approximately $346 Million for the Paypal unit for the last 12 months.Following the same exercise for Marketing Services (assuming one half of the advertising on eBay will be toast and a 40% operating margin) we get a (ttm) $263 million in net income and growing at 50+% Y/Y.We all can agree Skype has no synergies with eBay and we can safely claim its full net income does not rely on eBay auctions sites. So Skype's (ttm) contribution is approximately 89 million in net income growing at 40+% Y/Y (again using John Donohoe's disclosed operating margin of Skype of approximately 16% & 40% for marketing revenue)In total we get:$346 million from Paypal (excluding ½ of eBay transactions) $263 million from Marketing Services (taking out ¼ for 'foreseen' eBay losses in traffic) $89 million from  Skype ---- =(ttm) Net Income (excluding taxes) of $698 MillionThat gives us an EPS of non-Auction entities of .54 cents a share based on a diluted share count of $1.29 B.54 cents per share gives us a P/E (based on $15 as of early 10/17/2008) of 27*Okay, okay so what does this all mean?How does a P/E of 27* compare to other large dotcoms?As of early 10/17/2008, we get:So essentially you're getting healthy high growing companies like Paypal, Skype, Kijiji, Shopping.com, 25% of Craigslist, Shopping.com, and Rent.com (among others) for a reasonable P/E of 27*. This is in-line with other dotcoms, and more importantly completely taking eBay.com (and all its international counterparts) out of the equation.Don't throw the baby out with the bath waterI hope I've proven my point that the market has completely written off eBay auction sites as the next AOL. This may be true, but as I've clearly laid out above - investing in eBay today at $15 has this assumption already priced in; you're in effect getting eBay.com (and all its international auction sites) for free. I personally don't think eBay is going away any time soon, and I acknowledge the monumental challenges ahead. The fact remains that there is still no better place to sell or buy your vintage 1977 Led Zeppelin shirt...and as the Oracle says, if you can something for nothing, you're already ahead.*Will be higher depending on tax rate.Stock position: Long on eBay."

What am I referring to?  eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) cleverly wove the mandatory use of Paypal into its user agreement and now that it's gone into effect, Paypal holds on sellers accounts have increased by leaps and bounds.When is it going to end?  My guess is when the State Attorneys General unite and regulate Paypal or when eBay ceases to exist – whichever comes first.

Paypal did offer sellers a few pennies on the dollar for the use of their money (if they had a Paypal Money Market account).  Anyone want to guess how much money Paypal earned?One eBay member named Permacrisis has an interesting theory.  The extra load/artificial spike imposed on October 20th overloaded Paypal's servers (insufficient band with) and Paypal had to choose between collecting funds and disbursing funds.Sellers have also reported that their funds are being held from a few days to months.  eBay/Paypal excuses range from: 1) suspicious transaction; 2) no feedback from buyer; 3) less than 100 seller feedback; 4) false positives; 5) no shipping information; etc. etc. etc. none of which have anything to do with processing a transaction.I think this situation was best summed up by deltamaster who wrote ""If Wells Fargo, Bank of America, US Bank, or any other financial institution were to conduct business in this fashion there would be regulators crawling all over them like fire ants on a grasshopper.""Which begs the question, how can anyone trust Paypal because it is not regulated, profits from its failure to perform, and operates in a shroud of secrecy?Stock position: None."
100416,20521,2008-10-17T06:34:09-04:00,,"eBay continues to struggle against current economic conditions with rather lackluster Q3 performance. It has reduced its Q4 guidance, raising doubts about a merry Christmas for the company this year.Q3 revenues of $2.12 billion were marginally lower than the market’s expectations of $2.13 billion. Revenues increased 12% over the previous year. EPS of $0.46 rose 7% sequentially and 11% over the year. The Street was looking for EPS of $0.41.Marketplace transactions brought in $1.38 billion, lower than the $1.5 billion contribution the previous quarter, and thus represented a consecutive sequential reduction. Revenue from this segment grew 4% over the year. Active users grew 3% over the year to 85.7 million, and new listings increased 26% over the year to 700 million.PayPal grew at a much higher rate of 27% and contributed $0.60 billion revenue for the quarter with more than 65 million active user accounts. Skype’s user base also continued to increase by 51% over the year to 370 million and contributed $0.14 billion revenue.During the quarter, eBay repurchased 25 million shares at a cost of $623 million.eBay’s acquisition strategy also seems to be on a roll right now. The company acquired a leading online transaction credit provider – Bill Me Later – to add to PayPal’s leadership position in online payments, for $945 million. Previously, Bill Me Later was a direct competitor to PayPal, which eBay acquired in 2002, and was being financed by its archrival Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Bill Me Later already has over four million customers on sites like Amazon, the Apple Store, JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). For the year, it is expected to finance $1 billion worth of purchases with $125 million in revenues. The company is not yet profitable, however, and the acquisition will result in lower margins for eBay. It will be interesting to see what Amazon’s next steps will be following this acquisition.eBay also announced the acquisition of Den Bla Avis, a Danish classifieds specialist, and a vehicle site, BilBasen, for $390 million in cash. The company expects these acquisitions to strengthen its presence in Europe.Despite its acquisitions, in view of the economic conditions the company revised down its outlook for the full year to $8.525-$8.675 billion with EPS of $1.69-$1.71. For Q4, the company revised the guidance to $2.02 - $2.17 billion while maintaining EPS guidelines of $0.39-$0.41.With these acquisitions, eBay does seem to be finally moving somewhere directionally. Meg Whitman’s departure positioned the company for a turnaround, but John Donahoe was not taking full advantage of the opportunity. The strengthening of its payment business certainly seems like an astute move. It has been eBay’s greatest asset for a long time now, and over the next decade, I would not be surprised if eBay becomes more of a payment company than a marketplace.I am still not bullish on the stock. The company still hasn't sold off Skype, and its user experience still leaves a lot to be desired.The stock is currently at its lowest for the year, and lowest in the last five years, at $13.26. A year ago, it was trading at $40.67 – a 67% erosion of value. The market cap is around $18 billion. This can’t be fair! Disclosure: None"

I believe though that the investment community at large is missing key pieces of theeBay Empire. The only way current valuation makes any rational sense would be to assume that the other eBay properties (including their fast growing Paypal.com/Skype components) will undergo a contraction in revenue; something that even naysayers have trouble foreseeing.Just a few factseBay generated 2.11 billion dollars in revenue in the 3rd quarter; of this 952 million (or 45%) came from sources outside eBay.com!Let me break it down:As you can see, those are very healthy growth numbers (especially in this economic climate).

The firm sees the 10% headcount reductions as necessary as there is no growth in the core business. PacCrest thinks the negative news is priced into the shares trading at $17. Deutsche Bank likes the concept of ""bill me later,"" but ""not when there's a credit crisis,"" a decline in consumer spending and other issues to address and fix within eBay's core business. At the same time, American Technology Research believes things probably will not ""get much worse"" for the company and that its share price has taken into account all bad news."

But I was pretty accurate about the communications organization as ValleyWag noted yesterday with senior vice president of PR Alan Marks (formerly director of media relations at Nike) has cut his staff only to add more VP's.Not sure from what rock that thinking comes from considering how poorly he manages his underlings who feel free to send his memos to the free bloggers like Owen.  ValleyWag tells me he actually snapped at his team saying they sit and wait for permission instead of doing their jobs.  Wonder if they asked for his permission to send his War and Peace-like missive out? Or if he said, ""Just Do It?!""Enough Silicon Valley blathering.  Here's my next gem of wisdom for the future of eBay:Bringing my armchair MBA back out, I believe Donahoe is doing the right things to right the ship.  Focusing on the things he and the management team know best, cutting costs associated with headcount that doesn't drive sales, and slowly breaking up the 3-legged conglomerate Meg Whitman whittled.  Wall Street doesn't buy the story, so do the tough things that unlock shareholder value.  It's not a popularity contest running a public company, and by the level of negativity around eBay now I'd say Donahoe is taking the right steps.  For investors looking for a cheap stock this holiday season, eBay is certainly that. But the bottom is still a few months away. Skype needs to be sold and more jobs need to be cut before Wall Street props this dog up again. Hold on to your cash in this credit crunched economy."

98655,21439,2008-10-06T11:06:52-04:00,,"Monday morning, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) made a major multi-faceted announcement and held a conference call with analysts.First, eBay is laying off 10% of its employees as has long been rumored. This is 1000 employees, many temporary and contractors.  This will result in $150m in annualized savings.eBay then did a good job of lumping in a bunch of other announcements, so not much attention was given to the layoffs.  In fact no information was given to the departments or nature of the folks impacted.  We'll keep an eye out for that information as it becomes available, as sellers are very concerned about impact to customer service (buyer and seller).  eBay is going to take a $70-80m charge for the layoffs.Secondly, eBay confirmed Q3 guidance, with a low-end revenue and high-end EPS view.Thirdly, eBay announced some classified sites in Denmark for $390m.Lastly, and definitely the biggest item (in my mind riskiest), is the announcement that eBay has acquired BillMeLater (BML).BML is an interesting business with perhaps deeper retailer checkout penetration and TPV than off-eBay paypal.Background on BMLBML has had a great business over the last 3 years. BML really started ramping up in 2006 and in holiday season 2007 hit its stride by offering consumers off-credit-card credit on the fly.  The way it works is, a consumer goes to checkout and BML is there as a mark beside Visa/MC/Amex/etc.  When the consumer chooses BML, they enter their SSN and then are either approved or not approved.For many consumers, if they have a high enough score, they are given 'super sized' approval (e.g. $100 in cart, $200 is approved) and thus retailers love it because it improves the average order value.  Consumers love it because:Industry lore is that eBay tried to buy BML last year, but BML rebuffed and said they wouldn't sell for less than $2b.  eBay decided to compete by adding similar functionality to Paypal with something called PayLater (PPPL).    As best I can tell, PPPL hasn't had any traction as it was too conservative only working on transactions in the $50-100 range and was only offered in express-checkout which has very little retailer adoption.On the back-end, BML acquires loans from some institutional company and that's the piece I don't think anyone understands and wasn't really illuminated in the call.BML statsSome datapoints revealed Monday about BML's biz:The AcquisitionMy Risk concerns around BMLBML was huge last holiday season based on our data and there's a real business there and overall I think it does make sense to be part of Paypal, long-term and it does achieve some of the strategic pieces that Donahoe covered on the call (extend to larger retailers, etc.).However, I have three big areas of concern around BML:On the call, the BML CEO referenced their years in credit as being able to mitigate this, but that didn't really allay my concerns as we face a credit world unlike any ever seen  before so how do you model that?  The CEO also insisted that it isn't credit, which didn't make any sense to me - if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck....I left the call feeling like this was a bailout of BML and concerns around eBay+Paypal getting into the credit business in a BIG way.  I don't know how much experience they have with that and even if they had tons of experience, they are now subject to the crazy gyrations of the credit markets.  e.g. LIBOR going up now matters to eBay and historically nobody really cared. IntegrationThe trick as with any M+A is for eBay to integrate this right.  For example, if they shutter BML and try and offer it as PayPal PayLater, that wouldn't be smart.  The Paypal team has a better history of M+A (verisign, etc.) than the rest of eBay so I think integration risk is pretty low here.I wonder if they will report both TPVs or try to blend them and I also wonder if they will push for a Q4 integration - seems unlikely as the deal isn't even closed yet so they can't begin in earnest yet.Amazon and BML Last December, Amazon invested in BML and now offers it as an option.  It's going to be interesting to see if Amazon can get BML off the payment options before the holidays or will they chose to continue to partner here?eBay platform and BMLIt will be interesting to see if eBay can get BML out for the holidays and if they pass any of the benefit (free transaction payment) on to sellers or if they hose sellers over and charge them Paypal rates for something that would normally be free off-ebay.The Bottom LineThe layoffs will probably be viewed as net positive as they will reduce costs and improve profitability going into some severe Q4/09 headwinds. The BML acquisition is one that will have to be watched closely long-term.  Short-term given the unbridled fear of the word 'credit' right now, I expect the market to punish eBay severely for this acquisition and I suspect eBay will lose much more than the $1b it paid BML in market cap in the short term as investors flee in fear from the dreaded C word.  The only thing worse timing-wise eBay could have done is announced some kind of sub-prime lending effort.Long-term I definitely agree there are synergies in the two businesses, but I don't think we'll see them until Q409 and with the guidance BML won't even be accretive until 2011, so this is a very long-term play and right now the market isn't thinking past lunch, much less 2011.  We'll be tracking the integration very closely as it will have implications for eBay sellers both on and off eBay.Disclosure: Author is long eBay and Google."

(Full earnings slides embedded below). After three flat quarters, revenues declined 3.6 percent from the second quarter to $2.2 billion. Free cash flow has been going down each of the last four quarters, and so has the total value of goods traded over the auction and e-commerce site. eBay is leaning much more heavily these days on merchant-dominated categories like autos than on auctions between ordinary people.Even PayPal’s revenues were flat in the quarter at $597 million. Maybe the $945 million acquisition of Bill Me Later will help reignite growth. Its classifieds business (Kijiji) brought in a respectable $250 million in revenues.Another eBay business that is holding its own, surprisingly, is Skype. Revenues for the third quarter were $143 million. Although its growth rate is slowing, at least it is still growing, both on an annual (46 percent) and sequential quarterly (5 percent) basis. Its total registered users grew 51 percent to 370 million, and those people used up 16 billion minutes of talk time.The annual growth rate of those minutes (63 percent) is actually accelerating compared to the preceding quarters. And, most important of all, the number of minutes people actually pay for (2.2 billion Skype Out minutes) is also experiencing accelerating growth (54 percent).Unfortunately, at only ten percent of eBay’s total revenues, Skype is still too small to counteract its overall decline. Maybe they can still sell it."
98748,21382,2008-10-06T21:45:08-04:00,,"On the same day the public markets are tanking because of the spreading credit crisis, we see one of the biggest M&A exits of the year with eBay acquiring Bill Me Later for $945 million ($820 million in cash, plus an extra $125 million in options). This is for a company that lets consumers defer payment when they buy things online.  Remember, loose credit is part of the reason we are in the current economic mess.So is Bill Me Later part of the problem or part of the solution? I put that question to Michael Kwatinetz, the former Wall Street tech analyst who is now a partner at Azure Capital, the biggest shareholder in Bill Me Later.  He explained to me how Bill Me Later works, and how it actually has more stringent credit controls than most credit cards:Traditional credit cards, in contrast, let you run up your bill up to a pre-determined credit limit.  With each transaction, Bill Me Later checks your credit score, credit outstanding, status with credit agencies, and a few other criteria.  And it either approves your credit or it doesn’t for each purchase in less than three seconds.  Kwatinetz says that the company tightened its lending policies about a year ago, and claims that the nonpayment rate is “probably the lowest of anyone on the Web.”The value of the company lies in its algorithms that determine credit risk and in its ability to use the Internet as a platform for granting credit.  All of the data that its algorithms consider is pulled in via Web APIs from credit agencies and other data providers.For eBay, Bill Me Later will help expand its Paypal franchise to consumer credit.  Bill Me Later is already used all over the Web by more than four million customers at places like Amazon, the Apple Store, JetBlue, and Walmart.com.  This year the company is expected to finance $1 billion worth of online purchases and bring in $125 million in revenues.  Revenues are estimated to be $150 million in 2009 (a 20 percent growth rate), but the acquisition will also be dilutive to eBay’s earnings, meaning the business is not yet profitable on a net income basis.Still, you can see the appeal of an all-online credit service.  Traditional credit card companies pay about $150 for each customer who signs up for a new Visa or Mastercard, and it usually takes a couple weeks to process each account through the mail.  Bill Me Later acquires customers pretty much instantly at the time of purchase for less than 10 percent of what it costs the credit card companies.Announcing a large acquisition like this that is essentially a foray into the troubled credit markets may seem counterintuitive, but after a string of deals that didn’t make much sense for eBay (Skype, StumbleUpon), this could end up being one of its smartest non-core acquisitions since Paypal.Original post"
98931,21439,2008-10-07T16:07:38-04:00,,"Things are tough in eBayland right nowFor the last two weeks, I've been talking to literally hundreds of large eBay sellers to check in, see how their sales are doing, discuss strategy and share ideas+best practices around big change like FP30.  This is an annual process we go through at ChannelAdvisor to make sure everyone is ready for the holiday selling season. The overall mood isn't very positive as you can imagine and the one thing that keeps coming back up (as it should) is that eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has built many of the recent programs (FVF discounts, best match, etc.) on the wobbly DSR system that leaves sellers scratching their heads and unable to make improvements.  For the record, I think the DSR intent is good - clean up the marketplace, reward great sellers, get rid of bad sellers.  I am 100% on-board with that program.  What's painful is that the current DSR system is missing the mark in many ways and causing large great merchants to either jump through too many hoops or leave all together.  In fact, the calls are frequently met with what can best be called apathy.  ""Well it doesn't matter, my DSRs will keep me from doing X, Y and Z""Dear customer, your overall grade is a 'C'One seller used an analogy that really hit home for me - todays DSRs are like going to school and all you get is a report card with a single 'C' on it. You really want to make A's, but you can't see the individual test grades or even the subjects you are doing poorly in, just that your overall grade is a C.  The end result after dealing with this system for 9+ months without any improvement/visibility from eBay is that you resolve yourself to the C, give up because you can't possibly guess how to get to a B, much less an A and ultimately diversify to more transparent channels where you can control your own destiny, or even if you are partnered with a marketplace, you are given transparency and can improve any processes needed to have a better consumer experience.  It seems obvious, but transparency (e.g. knowing which customer/product had a problem) is good for everyone in a healthy marketplace.Here's a perfect real-world example.  I was talking to one customer (top 100 eBay seller by GMV) and instead of questions about FP30 or how to grow their business this holiday, they wanted to brainstorm some ideas of how to deal with having a 'lowered' search standing.  To their credit, eBay implemented a snazzy dashboard that provides the 'your grade is a C' level of transparency but it stops there.This seller noticed their search standing is 'lowered' because of a sudden dip in sales, checked the dashboard and saw why and then had to call their TSAM to get more information. It turned out that there's a rule (I vaguely remember this one, but can't find on the site - I think it was called buyer satisfaction level or something?) that is part of the umbrella Seller Non Performance policy (SNP in ebay-speak) that in addition to maintaining the 4.3 on all DSRs, if you get too many 1 DSR scores your search standing will be lowered.  This doesn't show up in the dashboard and you have to be told it's going on when your search standing is lowered. This seller has 4.6+ on all DSRs, yet eBay refuses to give the seller any more information than 'you are receiving 1's'.  The seller would love to know answers to basic questions like: ""Which of my products have this issue?"", ""Is this geographically specific - e.g. non-domestic?"", ""Is there a correlation between low feedback buyers and 1's - can I block them?"", ""Why are customers leaving me 1's, leaving me positive overall-feedback,not contacting me, yet clearly are not happy?"", etc.  The seller has given up and has accelerated their move from eBay because eBay's message is pretty loud and clear here: ""You are making 1's and we want you off the site.""Another seller has free shipping and can't crack 4.7, another seller can't break 4.5 because half their business is non-domestic, I could go on and on with stories like this.  I would say out of the top 1000 eBay customers, probably a solid 80-90% suffer from a major DSR-related issue.First, the good newsThere is a glimmer of hope.  Lorrie Norrington announced at eBay live that eBay would bring back a system to replace the mutual feedback withdrawal  (MFW in eBay-speak) by the holiday sellling  season.MFW was a decent system for customer-service focused sellers because it allowed sellers to say to buyers that left a negative : ""Hey you had a bad experience, I want to make that right."", then execute on that and be rewarded with the effective expunging of the negative should the buyer choose to do so.  In May 08, eBay's Trust and Safety dept canceled MFW because it was allegedly being abused by bad sellers to extort feedback from buyers, etc.eBay has been quiet as we waited and Tuesday via a developer blog post announced that it will launch what is now called Feedback Revision (FR anyone?).It remains to be seen how well this new process will work, but the important thing here is eBay listened to one area of concern and has reacted relatively quickly which is a positive.Scot's Top 5 DSR reforms needed ASAPSince eBay is in the mode of improving things, I wanted to share with everyone the top 5 (yes there are more, but let's get them to focus on the top 5 first!) major DSR issues that need fixing ASAP. Call to actionFor you sellers out there with a TSAM or access to eBay management, we need to work together for the longevity of the eBay ecosystem on these 5 fixes or I fear that eBay will continue to lump more and more programs on top of a wobbly DSR foundation and if you've ever played Jenga, you know how that plays out.  Right now these DSR flaws make the eBay Jenga tower feel like it has one little crooked block and is 20 stories high and the wind is blowing at 20mph.Disclosure: Author is long eBay and Google."

StumbleUpon says usage is growing at a fast clip, despite website traffic, because most users never visit the site after downloading the toolbar.Ok, but StumbleUpon didn’t mind pointing to usage stats in the early days before the sale to eBay. And the stats are likely irrelevant anyway, since StumbleUpon recently deprioritized the toolbar to let users “stumble” to new sites directly from the website.

97510,22345,2008-09-24T22:26:00-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) announced this morning that they were “introducing a new program called eBay AdCommerce.”The current version purports to “allow eBay sellers to promote their stores and listings via enhanced text integrations on eBay search result pages. The ads can be targeted by keyword or category, and eBay buyers who click on these ads will be taken directly to sellers’ listings or stores on eBay.”How does this compare with how our friend Ina Steiner at AuctionBytes described “Keywords on eBay” launched June 24, 2003? “‘Keywords on eBay’ enables eBay sellers to reach targeted buyers on eBay through “bid-per-click” keyword advertising.”So my initial impression is that eBay+DoubleClick=”Keywords on eBay” and eBay-Doubleclick+5 years=eBay AdCommerce.The most interesting part is that eBay dropped the Keywords on eBay program in September of 2006 (no doubt when the DoubleClick multi-year agreement expired).  While the program had some fans, eBay sellers apparently didn’t understand the concept of paying eBay a listing fee, a final value fee, and then some additional fee per click to drive traffic to the same listings they pay eBay a lot of money to drive traffic to.  Sophisticated sellers could identify a way to make the extra promotion work for their businesses, and eBay gave this placement gratis to some large sellers (particularly to large storeowners). Generally, however, a successful program would not have been terminated in 2006 without an inside effort already complete to take its place.  Indeed, eBay announced at the time that “The eBay Keywords program has been used by a very small percentage of eBay members since its launch in 2003.”So what changed? Why bring it back now? I think a lot, and today’s introduction hints at other possible changes to come.I wondered aloud a few things back in 2006 (on a no longer maintained personal blog). In a short post on the Keywords cancellation I wrote “I sincerely hope they don’t throw away the code used to enable sellers to bid and track the performance of the ad spots in the Keywords program.  If eBay later realizes that this system should be leveraged to drive more revenue from featured listings through competitive per click bidding, I’d hate to have them start over again from scratch. ”I had earlier written a VERY LONG post regarding some of the Store Item Format (NYSEMKT:SIF) inclusion changes in 2006 (remember that painful time?) and a long list of suggestions.  Included in that post were the following nuggets that scare me reading two years later.Seeing eBay purposefully limiting the number of listings displayed in search, I said, “My belief is that the problem isn’t too much content, but an inefficient mechanism for providing buyers the best buying option when they search.  The problem is with the search engine not doing a good job displaying to buyers items of best match.  [OMG, I actually said at the time items of ""BEST MATCH""].  While other comparison shopping engines are scraping the world’s servers to get the most shopping options for consumers, eBay is *limiting* what buyers can find in the hopes that the items remaining will be good buying options.  It’s a high-risk game, and I don’t like that answer.”As for recommendations to address this issue?:“First, change the ’standard’ listing and final value fees to a variable scale that is category dependent.  First run textbooks have very thin margins….Second, dramatically change the structure and pricing for featured listing placements.  The restructure involves a) shrinking this section to a manageable number (yes, like Google does with AdWords), b) identifying an appropriate algorithm for display that includes seller fees for that item, the item performance (how many folks visit it), the seller’s historical performance (i.e. does this seller give good pricing generally), and other data that may be available, c) don’t sort this section by time to close (it’s not going to be so big a section that causes issues for buyers finding the one closing soonest), and d) have this section appear on all search results pages above the main results.”I went on to suggest that eBay move away from flat rate pricing for category featured and into more of a bidding model (in a way similar to AdCommerce, but more on a listing fee/FVF approach).  My overall thought was that if eBay wants to be the World’s Marketplace, it should have incredibly affordable “base pricing” to get listed (this is similar to natural search in a search engine like Google or Yahoo!) and charge premiums for heightened site exposure (AdCommerce does the trick here as does more folks being able to afford Category Featured placement across more categories). Obviously, this latter part is essentially “sponsored search” on eBay.Could it be that eBay is moving more to a model that reduces fees for the masses but enables more price descrimination (to collect a higher take rate from those who can afford it) for search exposure?As for why they tout eBay AdCommerce as something new?  It’s always much more exciting to be part of launching a new program than bringing an old one back, even in a different form.

In the US the new format will be in addition to the auction and stores format and will replace auction/buy-in-now hybrid. We think these change reflect a more discerning eCommerce consumer, weak auction format GMV growth (just 2% in 2Q) and opportunity to increase PayPal adoption.Take-rate (revenue) impact likely negative, PayPal offsetsThe take rate impact will depend upon product category, ASP, and conversion rate. In many cases, however, the take-rate is lower for items using the new format, and since sellers will choose other formats when the new format is more expensive, we believe overall take-rates will be lower. This will be offset by greater PayPal penetration. We estimate a negative $125-150mn impact on ’09 revenues assuming about 30% of items move to new format and 10% lower avg. take rates, which should be offset by a $100-150mn PayPal penetration boost.Marginal impact on buyer experience, maintain NeutralWhile an increase in listings in September following fee decrease could be a catalyst, the new listing format alone is unlikely to significantly alter the buying experience, in our view, as inventory availability is not the core issue for eBay. Search improvements remain a wild card, and more uniform shipping fees and fraud prevention should help, but we believe the buying experience will still fall short of other fixed price retailers. At 13x 2009E EPS, we think stock will remain range bound into 2009 guidance (expected in January), which could be below street if changes don’t stabilize GMV growth, in our view."

It was unusual to read about this from a Home Depot press release vs. an eBay press release as they did with the departure of Rajiv.  They are inconsistent on these things and when they don't announce something major like the CTO leaving, the speculations runs rampant that they are either trying to keep it from being widely known or they weren't prepared themselves for the change (e.g. Carey let them know today or something).It all adds up to a tough environmentI'll leave it to readers to comment and weigh in - is this just an unusually bad news day for eBay, or are things starting to really worsen more than anticipated and executives are jumping ship, layoffs are coming, etc?Disclosure: Author is long eBay and Google"

Joseph writes that he now expects greater deceleration in global gross merchandise volume in Q3 than previously expected, with a possible year-over-year decline in the U.S. And he also cautions that eBay faces a “challenging holiday season.”Jospeh also notes that the company’s current issues are likely to linger: he cut estimates not only for Q3 and Q4, but also for 2009. “We have less conviction in eBay’s strategy to transform its core marketplace from an auction-based ‘thrift’ to a transaction-oriented platform that better addresses fixed-price in-season retail,” he writes. Jospeh says he had been thinking that the end of the company’s 3-plus year turnaround would come soon, but that “recent trends are telling us otherwise.”Joseph cut his Q3 EPS estimate to 40 cents from 42 cents. For Q4, he goes to 48 cents, from 50 cents. And for 2009, he goes to $1.91, from $2.04.Meanwhile, Pacific Crest’s Steve Weinstein Thursday morning wrote in a note that Q3 should be in line with his estimate of $2.16 billion in revenue and EPS of 41 cents a share. But he also observes that Q3 listings in the U.S. marketplace were below expectations. And he says international monetization seems to be deteriorating due to the weakening economy, the adverse effect of exchange rates and aggressive promotions in some countries, especially Germany and the U.K. His advice: “remains on the sidelines.”Thursday morning, eBay was down $1.12, or 5.4%, to $19.73; that follows a drop of $1.53 Wednesday."

Here’s my armchair MBA at work.  Given that the Street has been begging for gains for the high side of 3 years, it’s time to start making real moves at eBay or someone else is going to do it for them.  The stock today is trading at 12x going forward P/E – which means no one truly believes that this hodge podge of businesses has long-term growth potential together.  They’ve never been able to convince anyone short of Tim Boyd that the company is anything more than an auction business even though PayPal, Skype and StubHub are driving revenue and earnings.I’m betting my eBay Live 2005 pins that in the next 3-4 months John and company will be spinning off Skype to a company that actually understands what a tremendous Internet company this is or better yet let it go public and take in a couple of billion to fend off Google and Amazon on the Marketplaces front.  Let’s face it, this management team doesn’t know anything more than what is in the core business.Give the bloated 16,000 staff count a crew cut.  Take the GE (NYSE:GE) approach and just take 20% off for starters and get the existing people aligned against things that will grow the business.  See above on what that is – ahem, not Skype.

You can’t find it on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) anymore because of Donahoe’s latest disruptive innovation- eBay’s version of the game ""hide & seek"". Buyers are now expected to play and the only winner seems to be eBay.On August 1, 2008 Jeff King, Sr. Director of eBay’s Finding Team posted the following: How does the new game work? A buyer types one or two keywords in the search box and then eBay uses Finding technology, a.k.a Best Match, to sort listings and determine which listings are duplicates. If Best Match thinks it found a duplicate – then the item disappears into a void because only one unique item per seller is allowed.So what’s the problem? How could eBay possibly expect Best Match to tell the difference between similar items and identical items when eBay knows that Best Match has never worked since day one – otherwise they wouldn’t keep fixing it and millions of buyers & sellers wouldn’t keep complaining about it.How will hide & seek impact buyers? Negatively. Buyers usually know what they’re looking for and when they discover eBay is hiding it from them, then they’ll probably shop elsewhere. This may be a blessing because nothing works right, anyway.How will this change affect sellers? It’s a great big negative. Sellers woke up on August 1 only to discover that many of their listings had vanished into the void and that they paid listing fees for nothing. Those who took advantage of eBay’s Featured Plus listing sale held on July 29 through 31 were given no warning and watched their listings disappear one by one. Niche sellers are scrambling to find a new home.Does eBay really expect sellers to pay listing fees and get nothing in return? I think they do, which could explain why eBay has lost over 1 million listings since August 1 and why sellers are calling their attorneys.I suspect it won’t make any difference how much stock eBay repurchases to shore up their losses because any e-commerce site that has poor management, constant site issues, and no buyers or sellers isn’t worth much – not even at an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) auction.Disclosure: Dinah Balk is a part time eBay seller."

91872,21439,2008-08-20T18:07:35-04:00,,"Wednesday eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) announced (microsite and ebayink) another package of changes (fingers crossed this is the last of them for 2008!).  The bulk of these changes roll mid-Sept so there's some time to ponder them and change strategies (more on that after the summary of changes).There are some minor/expected/well predicted changes such as:The meat and potatoes - Welcome the new FP30 listing!Prior to today's announcement, sellers effectively had two listing types (and associated 'rate cards' for each): core and store.  eBay has now introduced a new, third, listing type that is kind of positioned in the middle.  It's a 30-day, multi-quantity fixed-price listing (I call it FP30 for short).  I say it's in the middle because it has the lower listing-fee and duration of a store-listing, but it has a lower fvf (by category) and it gets core exposure.   Sellers that wanted FP on core had to kind of wedge their item into the auction pricing (which is expensive because the listing tiers up based on price) and live with a shorter duration (7 days on avg).Taken individually this is not something that I think would be a big change, BUT when you marry this new listing type with the changes that eBay has made to BestMatch and Finding (de-dupe and 10-limit), eBay's strategy has become much clearer.With this new listing type instead of fixed-price seller wedging their listings into the auction marketplace, there is essentially a bifurcation of the marketplace.  You'll have the old auction world with it's rate-card  and search algorithm (BM that consideres ending-time)And now we have a new fixed-price world with it's own listing type, search engine (BM that ignores ending time) and fee structureThe new FP30 fee structureHere's how I've been thinking about the FP30's fee structure.First it has a .35 listing fee - regardless of start point.  You can list an item for $1 or $1m and it's still .35.  Also remember this is multi-quantity so you can list quant=1 or quant=1m and it's still .35.FP30 has different 'tranches' than auction-style listings (auction dips at $25, fp30 at $50).  I call them T1, T2 and T3.T1: $0-50 T2: $50-$1000T3:$1,000+And finally FP30 has FVFs for these tranches that vary per category.  Here's a quick summary of top categories:Computers: (this is the lowest and very aggressive IMO):T1: 6%T2: 3.75%T3: 1% CE+photo:T1: 8%T2: 4.5%T3: 1% Media:T1: 15%T2: 5%T3: 2%Motors parts+accessories and apparel:T1: 12%T2: 9%T3: 2%All other categories:T1: 12%T2: 6%T3: 2%Example of FP30 economicsTo make sure everyone understands FP30, here's an example.SellerX lists 20 pairs of shoes for $50 (each of course) and sells 10 of them over 30 days.Listing fee: $.35 (note this is not *10 as it is multi-quantity for one price)FVF: 12% * 50 = $6 * 10 = $60Effective take rate: $60.35 for $500 in GMV for an effective take rate of: 8.28%Comparing this to the auction rate card is a little apples to oranges because there are lots of variables, but let's do an exercise that gives the decent auction economics to see which comes out better.SellerX lists 10 items for $50 (well that would be dumb so they list it for 49.99) and they all sell (100% conversion rate).Listing fees: 10 * 1 = $10FVFs: 10 * (2.19+3.5*25) = $30.65total fees: $40.65.  Effective Take rate: 8.13%So in this scenario, auction-style wins. However if you drop the conversion rate to 33%, you get to where the listing fees are 30*1=30 and the total fees go over the $60 FP30 range.The other variable is ASP and I encourage everyone to experiment with this math for your items using your conversion rates and ASP to see what's right for you.Impact on seller's strategyIn the economic example above, 33% conversion rate was a tipping point where the FP30 listing's lower listing and higher FVF makes it less expensive from an effective take rate perspective.  So one strategy would be to consider auction+fp30 as essentially three 'buckets' driven by conversion rates (look at it per sku):The pitfall with this approach is my sense is eBay is going to really favor fp30 within BestMatch so most likely SKUs will behave differently under each and you'll have to experiment.  For an extreme example, you could have a boat load of an item that in auction format is basically hidden by bestmatch+dedupe and you get a 5% CR.  You'd be ready to move that puppy off eBay in a heartbeat.  However if you put it in FP where it's not de-duped and hopefully not going over your 10/page, you could bump up to 40/50% CRs which would indicate put it in auction-style, but that wouldn't be right in this case.Another way to think about this is the fp30 gives you the chance to stuff as much product (opportunity GMV) into your 10 listings/page as possible for great economics.  So there's a 'store shelf' play here too to consider if you are having dedupe/10-limit issues.ChannelAdvisor + FP30Realizing the strategic importance of FP30, we've made sure that both our MarketplaceAdvisor standard and premium offerings will launch with support when FP30 hits the streets in mid-Sept (we're ready now).  We're also holding a free webinar for customers and other interested parties to discuss the new format and some other strategy ideas we have.

91330,22870,2008-08-17T14:42:02-04:00,,"By Martin DenholmA high-growth retail play? Check.The firm saw its quarterly revenue growth bounce by 19.7% (year-over-year), while quarterly earnings growth jumped 22.5%. Its users sold $927 million in goods during the second quarter, which dumped $35.7 million into the company’s coffers in transaction fees. Not bad, given the sluggish state of the economy and inflation forcing consumers to cut back on purchases.A recession-resistant retailer? Check.The company is one of the most well-known and popular names throughout many parts of the world and has built a rock-solid brand. Ease of use, an extremely diverse range of products, and efforts to boost customer interaction translates to customer loyalty and a lot of repeat business.Over the years, the company’s robust business model has resulted in some outstanding gains for investors as a high-growth play on events like the Christmas shopping season and as a stock that offers protection during tougher times.Its strong cash flow (almost $3 billion over the past 12 months) has provided security for shareholders, as has the management policy of consistently initiating large share buybacks in the event of downturns, returning this cash flow to investors. These buybacks prevented dilution from management stock option grants, but also supported the stock price.The company is eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY). And while that’s the upside part of the story, a new development could shave as much as 20% from its share price.The unique aspect of eBay’s business model that has allowed it to consistently offer security to investors is a pricing model that relies on listing fees.Listing fees are upfront commissions that a seller must pay in order to have his/her item appear on eBay’s website. As a component of a single sale, listing fees typically account for 50% of the cost to a seller.However, if an item doesn’t sell on the first auction, online merchants must pay this fee a second time, making listing fees a much bigger factor in the calculation for eBay’s cost.In categories where eBay has a high sell-through rate, this has less of an impact on its profits. But in categories where the sell-through rates are low, it dramatically drives up the cost.And a possible change to eBay’s pricing model may force a 20% drop for its shares. Recently, two developments have exacerbated the pain of having to pay eBay multiple listing fees:Let’s look at each one…Limited Exposure & Listing De-Duplication: eBay now limits the number of items visible in a search by a given seller to 10. This prevents one seller from flooding the market with his/her items and eroding his/her competitors’ visibility. This category ownership is a strategy employed by eBay powersellers.But the introduction of Buy.com to the platform forced a rule change, since Buy.com’s business is considerably larger than the $5 million per month power seller who owns a niche category.With de-duplication, eBay removes items from the same seller that it believes are duplicates. However, this can present confusion in instances when items are similar, but not exactly the same. While de-duplication represents less of an impact to online merchants, it has sellers scratching their heads, asking why they’re paying listing fees for items that aren’t getting immediate visibility.Buy.com: eBay’s agreement with Buy.com aims to dramatically increase the number of listings on the eBay platform.This would be great if Buy.com was paying listing fees. But it isn’t - and it’s a fact that initially caused much concern. Since then, it’s come to light that Buy.com is not the low cost provider of goods that results in limited impact on other sellers. In fact, I’ve heard estimates that its sell-through rate is as low as 2%.This represents the first extremely large seller on the platform and likely also represents the first noticeable point of a change in strategy, where eBay uses one large vendor in a given category to act as an anchor tenant.Even though Buy.com is not having a material impact on many merchants, the mom and pop sellers are asking themselves why the vendors who helped eBay build its business over the last 13 years are paying upfront listing fees while new large sellers don’t seem to have to.So what’s the bottom line? Simple…The days of listing fees on eBay could be numbered - a development that could result in a 20% share price correction.In fact, there’s a growing rumor among the eBay Powerseller base that the company may well eliminate listing fees before the Christmas season.Such a move doesn’t mean that eBay will lose the revenue from listing fees entirely; it’s more likely to shift the fees to the back end after a transaction takes place. This would align the interests of the merchant and the marketplace and improve the relationships with eBay’s Powersellers.What concerns me, though, is that eBay would have to dramatically increase its back-end fees in order to account for the revenue that would be lost from listing fees on items that are listed multiple times.And that lost revenue translates directly into profits - which are incorporated into the company’s current earnings guidance and Wall Street’s consensus estimates. If the elimination of listing fees does occur - and there are many reasons for it to happen - there would likely either be a reduction in its guidance or an earnings miss that, in my estimation, could bring the stock price down 20%.Something to consider if you’re a current eBay shareholder. And if you’re not, you could look to play it by taking a bearish position on the stock and/or put options.Disclosure: None"
90923,21786,2008-08-14T07:25:24-04:00,,"The network effect, an effect famously exploited by AT&T’s (NYSE:T) predecessor Bell Telephone’s president, Theodore Vail, to achieve monopoly power (one telephone is useless, but if everyone has one, it’s priceless), has been a dominant business model for internet companies for over a decade. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is no exception, owing its success of its online auctioning business to that same effect (the more buyers and sellers trade on eBay, the more valuable the site becomes to its users, and the less inclined they are to go someplace else), and earning “de facto monopoly” status—or so it seems. However, it appears that the only thing that is keeping eBay alive anymore is that network effect, which may be drowning it at the same time.I have been an eBay member myself for eight years, and have noticed how increasingly cumbersome and error-prone its web site has become. But my personal experience pales in comparison to the dissatisfaction users have voiced all over the Internet on blogs and discussion sites (amazingly, this includes eBay’s own blogs: go to blogs.eBay.com and search blog titles for “eBay sucks”).Many blame the management, but eBay may also be a victim of its popularity: by trying to accommodate their hundreds of millions of users, eBay may have ended up displeasing many of them. Indeed, the site is so bloated and feature-laden that its programmers seem unable to manage it anymore, and its customer service has become overextended as a result. A recent decision to limit the ability to leave feedback on the site about the experience of a transaction with another user to buyers only, an attempt to solve an inherent problem with its previous feedback system (since feedback went both ways, users may have refrained from leaving negative feedback out of fear to also receive negative feedback in return), was not very well received by sellers (to put it mildly; another recent outcry was caused by fee increases).It appears that the very same network effect that caused its success may now cause its demise. eBay can either offer the same service to all (leaving many dissatisfied), it can continue to expand its user interface to offer ever more choices to customize the individual experience (which has already complicated the site to the brink of unusability), or it could split it into subsections (auctions versus fixed price, commercial “power” sellers versus individual sellers, local markets, etc.). The earlier options seem to have failed, while the latter gives up at least part of the benefits of the network effect.Indeed, eBay has already (and always) compartmentalized its site to some extent, namely by dividing the marketplace into categories. While this may be unavoidable if one wants to effectively enable users to find the items they seek, it also creates an opening for competitors: For example, someone looking for jewelry doesn’t really care whether and to what extend the same site also offers consumer electronics. This is exactly where some sites, like Silkfair.com (popular among users who like to buy and sell jewelry, while offering a very meager amount of listings in their consumer electronics section), have started to encroach. Other competitors include wigix.com, etsy.com, and oddle.com, to name just a few.And then there is good old Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which went online around the same time eBay did thirteen years ago. With a web site not riddled with errors and other issues, Amazon.com also offers an increasingly popular marketplace for individuals and smaller merchants to sell their items at their site.eBay’s troubles are aggravated by its ties to PayPal, which it bought in 2002. Indeed, eBay’s payment system is so closely tied to PayPal that it has drawn antitrust lawsuits, and PayPal is also known for its own legal problems, including allegations of improperly freezing customer accounts to derive economic benefit, which have made it widely unpopular (see, e.g., www.paypalsucks.com, or www.aboutpaypal.org).The Economist may have summed it up best when it wrote the following about eBay in a recent issue:Disclosure: NoneReferences Mylene Mangalindan, “Irked by eBay, Some Sellers Trade Elsewhere,” Wall Street Journal D1-D2, Aug. 12, 2008.“Yahoo!, eBay and Amazon – The three survivors,” The Economist 75-76 (week of June 21st-27th 2008).Kimberly Palmer, “Boycotting eBay? Here Are Three Alternatives,” USNews.com, Feb. 11, 2008."

This implies a 2009 top-line growth rate of 32% which would be a modest deceleration from current rates and assumes PayPal will continue to be able to counterbalance lower growth rates on-EBAY with an ever-increasing proportion of business coming from Merchant Services.PayPal's operating margin (excluding options) is expected to come close to 20% in 2009. This would yield 2009 pro-forma operating income of $660 million and tax-adjusted pro-forma earnings of around $500 million. If we assume a forward P/E multiple of 30x (restricting PEG to under 1.0x) we get a current valuation of roughly $15 billion.This would value PayPal at the low endpoint of the range Meg Whitman used to give back in 2007.

The once-iconic auction site is making cosmetic changes to its fee structure and moving away from the auction model to emphasize more fixed-price listings. But it’s hard to get excited these days about eBay. It seems that the Web has moved on and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is stuck in still waters.Don’t get me wrong. eBay is still a massive site and a cash machine. But once you reach 238 million visitors worldwide (comScore) and 26.4 billion pageviews a month, it’s hard to know where to go from there. Maybe that is why pageviews are actually down 15 percent year-over-year, and the stock is down 26 percent.This is not about fixed price versus auctions. The main challenge eBay faces is that it is becoming easier and easier to find things to buy on the Web simply by searching for what you want on Google. During the early days of the Web, people needed a few big e-commerce sites they could trust and that could organize everything that was for sale online. That need was filled by Amazon and eBay.But now people are comfortable trawling the Net for the best bargains, and eBay is no longer the first place they go. Partly that is because eBay has done such a good job creating a semi-professional class of online sellers, that it is harder and harder to actually find bargains there.

PayPal is fast becoming a more important business for eBay than its flagship Auctions / Marketplace business.Skype contributed $0.14 billion, an increase of 51% over the year and 8% over the quarter. Skype added 29 million registered users for the quarter, taking the total base to 338.2 million.Overall, international markets contributed 54% of overall revenue.The company gave Q3 revenue guidance of $2.1 billion-$2.15 billion with EPS of $0.39-$0.41. For the year, it raised revenue and EPS guidance to $8.8 billion-$9.05 billion and $1.72-$1.77, respectively.Even though CEO John Donahoe called the quarter a solid one, there are several areas of concern. The faster growth of lower margin segments – namely PayPal and Skype - has started impacting overall margins.On the positive side, eBay did make several significant advances during the quarter. The site is easier and safer to use, and a modified pricing structure and incentives for sellers have improved the value and selection offered to buyers. The company rebalanced its pricing by migrating from insertion fees to final value fees, offered free gallery photos in the U.S. and the U.K., rewarded sellers who provided the best buyer experience, and also offered sales ratings-based discounts to qualified power sellers. The company extended PayPal’s leadership position in online payments both on and off eBay and added a credit facility to PayPal through Buy Now Pay Later options.Despite these service innovations, the weaker economic conditions are affecting eBay’s performance. Gross Merchandise Volume [GMV] for its marketplace segment stood at $15.7 billion, an 8% increase over the year but a 2% reduction over the quarter. The reduction was due to customers’ shifting to lower-priced goods, a modestly lower take rate, higher discounting for the power sellers who continued to improve its service levels, and weakening car sales, which had grown 7% in the previous quarter.EBay may be getting more listings and improving security for its users, but what it is still not managing to fix is the core user interface and the ability to deliver a personalized user experience.I had envisaged a turnaround opportunity for eBay with the departure of Meg Whitman. Unfortunately, John Donahoe’s game plan continues to be hazy. Meanwhile, Rajiv Dutta, the head of Marketplaces, will step down in October, and with that, there might be a ray of hope.Given that eBay still hasn’t managed to hive off Skype and acquire more relevant vertical search engines and communities, I wouldn’t recommend the stock. It rose 5% to $28.23 during the regular trading session but fell 6.6% to $26.24 after market close.Disclosure: None"

In last week's Q2 report, the percentage of PayPal TPV from Merchant Services was already up to 49%, which means that sometime this quarter, PayPal Merchant Services will officially overtake PayPal on-EBAY in TPV.And there is still plenty of room for growth. As of Q2, only 32 of the top 100 US merchants and 13 of the top 50 UK merchants offered PayPal. That's a lot higher than in Q1 but still represents only a minority of merchants. Already in Q3, PayPal has announced the addition of OfficeMax and American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) to the PayPal roster."
87391,20378,2008-07-28T10:27:48-04:00,,"PayPal had Q2 revenue of $602 million and is on track to reach 2008 revenue of $2.5 billion and somewhere around $3.3 billion in 2009. This implies a 2009 top-line growth rate of 32% which would be a modest deceleration from current rates and assumes PayPal will continue to be able to counterbalance lower growth rates on-EBAY with an ever-increasing proportion of business coming from Merchant Services.  PayPal's operating margin (excluding options) is expected to come close to 20% in 2009. This would yield 2009 pro-forma operating income of $660 million and tax-adjusted pro-forma earnings of around $500 million. If we assume a forward P/E multiple of 30x (restricting PEG to under 1.0x) we get a current valuation of roughly $15 billion.This would value PayPal at the low endpoint of the range Meg Whitman used to give back in 2007.Skype had an encouraging Q2. Of the various publicly available metrics, the two most important are concurrent users (as a proxy for active users) and Skype-Out minutes (where Skype makes most of its revenue). Both of these metrics displayed a second consecutive quarter of accelerating growth in Q2, and now hover around the 40% mark.  Skype had Q2 revenue of $136 million and is on track to reach 2008 revenue of $570 million. Assuming revenue growth continues to decelerate until it also reaches 40%, we can expect somewhere around $800 million in 2009 revenue.  Skype's operating margin (excluding options) is expected to come closer to 16% in 2009. This would yield 2009 pro-forma operating income of $130 million and tax-adjusted pro-forma earnings of around $100 million. If we assume a forward P/E multiple of 40x (again restricting PEG to 1.0x) we get a current valuation of roughly $4 billion.  This would value Skype much lower than the 10x revenue multiple Henry Blodget suggested earlier this year.Marketplaces is a collection of properties across increasingly diversified e-commerce channels and monetization models. The division includes everything from traditional GMV-based marketplaces (ebay.com, stubhub.com, half.com etc...) to pure advertising-based businesses like comparison shopping sites (shopping.com) and online classifieds sites (kijiji.com, gumtree.com, etc...).  Notwithstanding the much higher growth levels of the advertising-based businesses, Marketplaces has seen its Y/Y revenue growth halved from 26% in Q207 to 13% in Q208. The business unit is now growing slower than e-commerce as a whole and has some significant strategic decisions and risks in the months/years ahead.  Marketplaces had revenue of $1.458 billion in Q2, with $1.233 billion (85%) coming from GMV transactions and 225 million (15%) coming from advertising. Despite its slowdown, the division is well on track to post its first ever $6.0 billion plus revenue figure for 2008 and assuming a modest 10% growth rate once the current economic environment starts to be lapped, should post somewhere north of $6.6 billion in 2009.  Marketplaces' operating margin is pretty stable at around 40%. This yields 2009 pro-forma operating income of $2.6 billion and tax-adjusted pro-forma earnings of around $2.0 billion. If we assume a forward P/E multiple of 10x (again restricting PEG to 1.0x) we get a current valuation of roughly $20 billion.  Apart from being among the lowest valuations for Marketplaces I have seen to date, this would put Marketplaces (as a stand-alone company) in contention for the lowest P/E ratio of any Nasdaq 100 company. To complete my sum-of-the-parts valuation I need consider EBAY's cash and minority interest positions. At the end of Q2, EBAY had $3.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and is on track to generate another $1.3 billion before the end of the year, bringing the 2008 cash total to $5.0 billion.EBAY also has several important minority stakes including ~20% of MercadoLibre, ~25% of craigslist, and ~49% of Tom Eachnet - among many other smaller stakes (fon, meetup.com, ChannelAdvisor, etc...). MercadoLibre's market cap is currently $1.5B, craigslist has been valued as high as $5 billion, and Tom Eachnet is holding its ground in a market already larger than the US. For the purposes of this analysis, I'll take a very simplistic view and value them all at $2.0 billion.Putting all the pieces together yields a total equity value for EBAY of $46.0 billion ($35.11/share) at the end of 2008, a 38% premium to the current market cap of $33.3 billion ($25.40/share)."

I've already mentioned my financial expectations for Wednesday night (follow the Q2 earnings release here). The only thing I would add is that I expect EBAY will have continued its aggressive buyback program, which will help EPS growth outstrip revenue growth for yet another quarter. So we are looking at around 26.5% EPS growth to about $0.43 (compared to my revenue growth of 24.5% to $2.28 billion).I also wanted to mention a few observations. The first is that my expectations are rather bullish compared to consensus (MarketWatch says analysts estimate EPS of $0.42 and revenue of $2.17 billion). The second is that EBAY has been on an M&A diet for 18 months. So despite an FX tailwind, that makes EBAY's growth that much more impressive. My final thought is that given the state of the global economy, these levels of growth are becoming increasingly rare (and EBAY's valuation discount therefore increasingly interesting)."

I would even say that if I knew beforehand that a seller uses an alternative checkout system, I would avoid them altogether. I can only imagine this nuisance can turn to complete frustration for less experienced buyers.It's not just that each system has its own peculiarities and problems (some require phone numbers, others require re-typing addresses, others try to cross-sell, others add you to a mailing list, others simply look horrible), it's that the EBAY marketplace simply shouldn't have such broadly different checkout experiences. I have nothing against third party checkout providers, but EBAY should really make sure the experience is completely seamless to the buyer.EBAY has at least now closed the door to new third-party checkout systems and indicated it might even phase out all third-party checkouts in 2009. In order to do so, I suppose EBAY may have to enhance its own checkout system to incorporate additional functionality for high volume sellers. This might cause some sellers to rethink their listing strategies but at least from one buyer's point of view, it's about time."

Just like last year, peak concurrent users stayed roughly flat throughout the quarter (at around 12.4 million). This compares with an average of around 11.8 million peak concurrent users in Q1 and would therefore represents approximately 5% Q/Q growth.Assuming flat revenue per concurrent user and adding 2% of Q/Q growth from a depreciating USD, we get revenue growth of approximately 7% Q/Q.I therefore predict record Skype revenue of $135 million for Q2 2008, a growth rate of 50.0% Y/Y (or 7.0% Q/Q).

Will the ""Disruptive Innovation"" happening at eBay be an example of how to re-invigorate a stagnant business model or how to kill a ""good thing"".During the show, they profiled numerous companies that had undergone ""disruptive innovation"" and not only survived the changes but succeeded in fundamentally changing their business. Do you remember the Korean electronics company called GoldStar? I know I only had a faint recollection of the company. I was surprised to learn that Goldstar is now known as LG a leader in many consumer electronics and household appliance categories -- they changed their brand in order to succeed. Some of these companies are still a work in progress; take the venerable Eastman Kodak.Kodak is a great example of a business that was in crisis. They made their money selling film and chemicals for film processing and were a hugely profitable, well-known and respected brand, but the winds of change in technology had brought them to a crossroads. Digital cameras had taken over the market and very quickly the once vibrant company was in crisis.In Nov of 2006, Business Week profiled the struggle at Kodak (EK):The parallels between Kodak and eBay are numerous; eBay is a global leader in auctions with 90% of the worldwide auction business, much like Kodak was the leader in film, but auctions are not growing fast enough for investors and it is clear that consumers want Fixed Price convenience over ""Shopping Victoriously"" with auctions, so eBay is changing the way they do business and now want to become the global leader in Fixed price sales.Just like Kodak became a successful Digital Camera company, eBay feels they can become a successful Fixed Price company, but if eBay doesn't take into consideration the lessons Kodak learned along the way, they are doomed to follow in their footsteps and in a few years they will once again have to revamp their business model, each time moving further and further from their roots.History is a great teacher, if we actually choose to listen to her. eBay can be a successful Fixed Price leader, but like Kodak not at the profit margins they are used to. There is a reason Amazon is the current leader in the Fixed Price business, they spend money on the ""buyer experience"" they don't have huge margins because they have exchanged huge profits for huge growth and their whole business model is built on constant innovation. They have a long-term plan and they are aggressively pursuing that goal. eBay, on the other-hand, has a short-term plan and they are aggressively pursuing that goal, the major difference is that eBay will be working on a new plan in a couple of years while Amazon will just continue to innovate.In my view, eBay has made a fundamental error, they are killing their high margin auction business in favor of a low margin fixed price business, thinking somehow that they can magically make the two co-exist on the same platform-- it isn't possible.So will eBay succeed in changing their model like Kodak did, only to find that their profits are squeezed and investors are still unhappy 1 year from now, or will they step back just for a second and look at some history?There is certainly a need for change in the eBay business and many of the changes currently being made are correct in theory, but they are based on a fundamental flaw with the business model. Until, that flaw is corrected these changes will not succeed.What I love about the Internet is that a year from now you will be able to find this post and quickly decide for yourself if I was correct.

We have used a flat EBITDA margin of 37.5% from 2008. We have used a terminal growth rate of 4.8%. We calculated this terminal growth rate based on year three growth of 12.2% dropping to a 4% stable growth rate by year 10. We used a terminal capital expenditure number of US$800 million. We have used a WACC (discount rate) of 11.5%.See the Valuecruncher's valuation here. Our analysis incorporates the cash on the eBay balance sheet – Valuecruncher calculates a net debt number. Our analysis also incorporates Skype within the current eBay structure.

80142,21640,2008-06-05T02:50:25-04:00,,"The ""buzz"" this week is that on line  auctions are falling to the wayside in favor of fixed priced venues. Is it possible that the CEO of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has access to a crystal ball (or medium), which told him that the future of on line auctions is not in eBay's future? Or, is all this ""buzz"" the result of eBay sellers simply being maneuvered to leave eBay on their own accord and/or adapt to a 100% fixed price format?It would be unreasonable to think that eBay sellers would wake up today and find an eBay announcement proclaiming that eBay will no longer be an auction venue by the end of 2008. Then again, eBay recently made an announcement that eBay Live Auctions will close by the end of 2008 and while it's not known how much revenue eBay Live Auctions generated for eBay in 2007, their partner, Live Auctioneers, LLC reportedly earned $100M in 2007. If this number is true (as reported by Live Auctioneers, LLC) one has to wonder how much of Live Auctioneers revenues contributed to eBay's bottom line. The next question would be, ""what Fortune 500 company gives up any part of $100M in revenues"", especially in these uncertain economic times?The changes to eBay during the past few months have been dramatic. eBay sellers have responded to these changes by posting negative You-Tube videos, blogs, articles, posts, organizing boycotts and sharing their negative experiences with both eBay and PayPal. The CEO of eBay has referred to all of the negative press as ""noise"". However, the ""noise"" has elevated to a point where eBay sellers are spreading their wings and flying the coop! Is this what eBay wants? In my humble opinion, eBay is strong enough (financially) to withstand eBay sellers who refuse to adapt to change. If the end goal is to move eBay to a ""pure"" fixed price format venue, eBay sellers who adapt to the current changes and those who sell exclusively through BIN (Buy it Now), may benefit in the long run. Could their be a culling of eBay sellers in progress? Culling is the process of picking out others, especially something rejected because of inferior quality. In other words, the ""herd"" of eBay sellers may be being thinned out in order to move forward with a grander plan. The name ""eBay"" can stand for anything..While the brand has come to designate eBay as the on line auction giant, what's in a name? eBay has methodically acquired and/or launched mini-venues (within its own venue) for quite some time. Half.com, Shopping.com and StubHub.com are good examples of what a venue can do to cull the herd from within. There are some benefits to eBay in moving to a ""pure"" fixed priced format:Can eBay morph itself into another Amazon? While eBay could begin building fulfillment centers across the United States, this process would take some time. Those holding eBay stock (in long positions), might have some patience but, it's might be unreasonable to expect shareholders to ""watch and wait"" while eBay reinvents its business model. This may be where the help of others is needed. The deal (partnership) with Buy.com may prove that eBay can open its core to partners, who can flood the marketplace with merchandise. Buy.com did just that by listing 500,000 items for sale on eBay, however, their sell-through rate of 5% was a bit disappointing. Who suffered from the Buy.com flood? eBay sellers offering merchandise in the same categories. What eBay may or may have not overlooked is that sellers are buyers, buyers become sellers and it can be one glorious food chain - if balanced correctly. The invitation to Buy.com to flood eBay core with BIN's, upset that delicate balance. What's NOT fair?Those selling on eBay have little recourse against bad buyers. Sellers can no longer leave negative feedback against those buyers who abuse, berate and threaten to leave negative feedback if the seller does not bend over backwards to please them. Those who worked for years to build their eBay feedback did so for nothing. eBay decided that only the last twelve months of feedback makes a difference. In addition, eBay sellers quickly learned that neutrals turned into a ""new kind of negative"" and many found their overall feedback percentages had declined to the point of the last straw. Just how many straws can placed on the camels back before it breaks? Why include neutrals into the equation at all? What was the purpose? Who did it help, who did it hurt? Here's some speculation..There was nothing to be gained by calculating neutrals back into overall feedback percentages. Neutrals are just that ""neutral"". The transaction was neither good nor bad. No doubt, the decision to count neutrals into the overall scheme of feedback percentages was bad for the sellers (only). There was absolutely no purpose (no foreseeable gain) to eBay in upsetting its sellers - unless you want to ""cull"" the herd.How does it ALL add up?Judging from what could only be described as a ""Seller Exodus"" off of eBay (coupled with the major changes), one might think that eBay has a long-term plan. It may be that the plan for the future was concocted when Amazon leap frogged over eBay with stellar earnings reports. Meg Whitman retires and Bill Cobb is on his way out. The eBay seller conference for 2009 has been canceled and eBay's new CEO (for better or worse) has taken hold of the helm of the ship with a map in hand, however, he may be in need of a GPS for a more accurate read on eBay's final destination.Disclosure: none"

That's not just a business problem for eBay, it's a deep corporate culture problem, like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) finding out people no longer like hamburgers.I've been writing about eBay since its earliest days. The company's core has always run on the energy generated by on-line auctions. It wasn't just selling stuff like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) -- it was a game. eBay attracted certain employees, sellers and consumers because of the auctions. It's always been why eBay was different than any other retailer and different, too, from Craigslist or newspaper classifieds. eBay's TV commercials, even now, emphasize auctions and ""winning"" the item you buy.But as Business Week reports, auctions my soon, for the first time in eBay's history, become the minority of transactions on eBay. The site's ""Buy It Now"" fixed-price transactions already make up 42% of all goods sold on eBay, and it's growing 22% a year. Consumers increasingly prefer to use search to find good fixed-price deals, instead of hassling with auctions. The auctions might be a fun game for a segment of consumers, but for a lot of people, an auction sucks up time and effort for a product you might not end up winning.New CEO John Donahue may have a bunch of tactical issues to address, but if the decline of auctions threatens eBay's culture -- corporations have trouble recovering from that kind of mess."

Anyone checking their feedback in the last twenty-four hours was in for a quick reality check. While the new changes to feedback increased overall feedback totals, feedback overall percentages (for many) went straight into the toilet. If you were a seller, who was on the cusp of surpassing that magic number (in total feedbacks) to achieve a new star rating, you might have just went from red to purple but, got double-slapped when you noticed that your overall feedback percentage took a whack as well.   Want to link to your off-eBay store? Guess what? More changes there as well. In fact, the changes just keep coming in waves. The Keyword Spam policy is changing to more of a Search & Browse Manipulation Policy which will level the playing field and ensure that the Buyer Experience is NOT harmed. Is your DSR below 4.5?

If you have a DSR of 4.7 or higher then you just might find yourself at the top of the food chain. In my humble opinion, all of these changes makes one wonder if eBay is simply showing sellers the door. If eBay is moving more toward an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) business model, then it might be that these little announcements (which are not little at all) all add up to the self-removal of many eBay sellers and in essence, showing them the door without any of the fuss that might come along through a variety of legal claims.

In Communication, the long-term margin objective is 20%-25% and the actual margin in Q1 was closer to 11%.  The obvious takeway is that in both Payments and Communication, despite margins steadily increasing in recent quarters, there is still quite a bit of upside left.

In fact, ex Motors, Q108 GMV grew at 13.6% Y/Y. In other words, EBAY Motors is becoming a significant drag on overall GMV growth.
In Q208, the drag on GMV growth will be even more pronounced. QTD, some analysts put EBAY Motors listing growth at around 6% Y/Y. Compared to overall listings growth QTD of around 24%, its clear Q208 GMV growth will take a hit from EBAY Motors.
The good news, if any, is that the take-rate on EBAY Motors is much lower than the rest of EBAY. So as long as EBAY Motors GMV growth underperforms overall GMV growth, EBAY's take-rate on overall GMV increases. In other words, Marketplace transaction revenues are much less affected by weak auto demand than GMV.

fees at $600,000. I was told, both by eBay and Buy.com, that this
partnership was ""economically feasible"" for both parties, but that no
details would be released.Lieberman went on to say:So, I couldn't let this go and I contacted Brandon Dupsky of PeSA/ECMTA and asked if any of the top eBay sellers in his organization were getting a special listing deal. He replied:I'm all for
allowing sellers to negotiate volume deals with eBay; I had asked to
negotiate my fees every year that I sold on eBay and was always told ""that is not going to happen,"" but in light of eBay founder, Pierre Omidyar's, recent quote about ""the level playing field"", you can see that this announcement will not sit well with eBay sellers.Pierre said, in a recent quote from a video clip:Most
long-time eBay sellers have felt that it was just a matter of time
before a major online retailer started selling on eBay, especially with
eBay's drive to create a more retail experience for the buyer, but we
all knew it wouldn't happen with the current eBay fee structure, which
is not conducive to scaling a large business. Well, after this breaking
news, ""this ain't your Mama's eBay any longer.""Granted, Buy.com's
listings serve as a sort of ""Best Practices"" for the new eBay, but the
economics haven't changed for the existing eBay seller. They can't
afford to list 150,000 Fixed Price listings because they still have to
pay ""Rate Card"".Buy.com is a beneficiary of this new way of
thinking at eBay and I guarantee they won't be the last retailer to
launch on eBay, now that the economic barriers have been lifted. Mr.

the company has filed a countersuit accusing the online auction company
— which owns a 25-per-cent stake in Craigslist — with “unlawful and
unfair competition, misappropriation of proprietary information,
deceptive passing-off, business interference, false advertising,
phishing attacks, free-riding, trademark infringement, trademark
dilution, and breaches of fiduciary duty.” According to the blog post by CEO Jim Buckmaster:As you may recall, eBay sued Craigslist last month alleging a variety of behaviour on the part of co-founders
— and controlling shareholders — Craig Newmark and Jim Buckmaster,
including the issuance of shares that diluted eBay’s stake below the
25-per-cent mark, as well as the creation of an even more dilutive
“shareholder rights” agreement, otherwise known as a “poison pill” that
had the effect of making it impossible for eBay to sell its stake to
anyone other than Craig and/or Jim. Craigslist later made the statement public.They’ve now done the same thing with their countersuit
by posting the entire thing online. Among other things, the suit
alleges that eBay tried twice to put executives from its Kijiji unit —
which now competes head-to-head with Craigslist in the U.S. — on the
board of the classified site. The lawsuit also says that eBay “has used
Craigslist’s mark and name in commerce to confuse the public and
illegally divert Internet traffic from Craigslist to eBay and its
Kijiji site,” which appears to involve the buying of Google ads that linked to the eBay site but used Craigslist’s name. The bulk of the suit seems concerned with what Craigslist says is
eBay’s desire to gain access to “proprietary competitive information”
to help Kijiji. My friend and fellow mesh organizer Rob Hyndman, a lawyer who specializes in technology startups, says that the lawsuit seems to be an attempt by Craigslist to “accomplish by litigation what it failed to accomplish by business planning and sensible precautions.”"

post up entitled “Kettles and Pots” which notes that
many of the things eBay is accusing Craigslist of doing are things that
eBay has either also done with its own shares, or has previously argued
should be done with Craigslist shares. For example, the Craigslist blog
argues that eBay has:
Of course, as at least one commenter
on the post has noted, eBay is a large public company with
freely-tradeable shares and a broad public ownership. Craigslist is the
opposite: a private company with only two major shareholders and a
board consisting of… wait for it… those same two major shareholders.
Even if the things it implemented were identical
in every way, those facts would be enough to change the picture, since
there are protections for minority shareholders even in private
companies. I think Craig and Jim are going to have to do better than
that."

According to Khan, international growth remains very strong, with listings up 35.4% Y/Y.Week 3 data represents a surprisingly small deceleration from week 1 and week 2.
Given part of the strength in listings is from promotions in UK and
Germany in early Q2, I would expect the listings growth to continue to
decelerate in the coming weeks.According to the StumbleUpon homepage, the service yesterday surpassed 5 million users.  The milestone comes less than five months after crossing the 4 million user mark.  Although still impressive, this is a very significant slowdown in user growth.The official press release from SU includes the equally interesting fact that they are celebrating
their 5 billionth 'stumble' (with over one billion 'stumbles' YTD). This is a very very very rough guesstimate but assuming 10% of 'stumbles' are from their  recently introduced contextual ad program, that would mean 100 million paid 'stumbles' YTD.  And guessing revenue / paid stumble is around 30 cents, that's $30 million in YTD revenue and close to $100 million in annualized revenue.This is complete guesswork, but pretty darn amazing - even if I am off by a longshot.  Not bad at all for a company that was purchased for an all-inclusive $75 million.It was a day of milestones for more than one eBay site yestesrday.  Joining StumbleUpon is Kijiji, which has reached 400,000 concurrent listings on the US-only site only 90 days after reaching 300,000 listings.

75210,21513,2008-05-01T15:56:38-04:00,,"A week or so ago, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) filed a lawsuit against Craigslist, alleging
that the controlling shareholders of the classified site — namely,
founder Craig Newmark and CEO Jim Buckmaster — had taken certain steps
to dilute the auction provider’s minority stake in the company, and
thereby had breached their fiduciary duty and injured eBay as a
shareholder. EBay has now made the statement of claim public,
and it reads like a corporate version of a divorce court filing. These
two parties are married, but they really don’t want to be, and each one
is trying its hardest to get out of the relationship without losing
everything.According to the statement (which obviously has only one side of the
story) eBay says that Craig and Jim got mad when Kijiji — the eBay
subsidiary that competes with Craigslist — started up operations in the
United States, so they took a number of steps
to dilute the company’s stake below 25 per cent (including issuing
themselves a bunch of shares), and thereby removed a bunch of rights
that eBay had as a shareholder. They also, according to eBay,
instituted a “poison pill” that threatened to flood the place with
cheap stock.In other words, they did (or are alleged to have done) pretty much what Valleywag and others, including yours truly,
thought they did when the lawsuit first emerged. Of course, what eBay
is talking about isn’t really a poison pill — pills are typically
designed to prevent hostile takeovers, but no one can take over
Craigslist because Jim and Craig control it. This pill isn’t so much
designed to prevent someone from buying as it is designed to prevent
someone (namely eBay) from selling.Can Craigslist do that? Obviously eBay is arguing that it can’t. And
while you might think that the classified site is a private company and
so Craig and Jim can do whatever they like, it’s not quite that simple.
Ebay does have rights as a minority shareholder — and it argues that
even if it did engage in competitive activity, the clause it triggered
did not give Craig and Jim the right to prevent eBay from selling its
stock to anyone but them. This could get ugly."

Portfolio colleague Amy Wallace interviewed just-departed eBay CEO Meg

years. Never heard of a CEO predicting her departure eight years in
advance. But you stuck to your word. Why?A. Ours is a business where the pace of change is dramatic.
Technology change. Changes in competitors. Changes in the nature of the
company. eBay went from 30 people to 16,000 in 10 years. And I just
felt, even as long as eight years ago, that 10 years seemed just the
right amount of time. After that, the company would need a fresh set of
eyes, new leadership, someone who would have the same energy and
enthusiasm as I did for the first 10.Q. As the 10 year mark approached, did you have pangs? A. You know, it felt like the right time. I had been thinking about
it, obviously. I'd brought in some new executives to the company and
was really planning for the future. Last year we did about $8 billion
in revenue. Hopefully 10 years from now, we'll be a much bigger
company. So I was trying to get the leadership in place to take the
company through the next 10 years. So it was not that hard.Q. You often responded to criticisms and complaints from users personally.A. There is quite a personal relationship between the CEO and the
users at a company like eBay. You have to remember, many of our users
make their living on eBay. They have connected with people who share the
same interests. When you talk to some of our top users, they will tell
you that their relationship with eBay is more than a business
relationship. You could argue we were the first social network. But
eBay is community anchored in commerce. It's not just community for
community's sake. Q. What was the most unusual complaint you've received from a user?A. Well, a big percentage of the user community has my email
address. So I can get anywhere from 50 to thousands of emails a day.
And because we are the locus of their economic life and also in some
ways their social life, there is lots of commentary on almost anything
that we do. And I think that's a good thing. We made the decision early
on that it was better to have a community that really cared, that was
really involved, that had a point of view, than to have a community
that was not engaged.Q. That requires you to have a varied set of skills, I'd imagine. What would you say are the three most important?A. First of all the ability to scale an organization. People
underestimate what it's like to take a company from 30 people to
16,000, from $4 million in revenue to almost $8 billion, from 300,000
users to 250 million users. You have to be able to scale with the
company. The second thing is you have to be able to walk in the shoes
of the customer. Many companies just have buyers. We have buyers and
sellers and they have very different needs and wants. So you have to be
able to manage that dichotomy. And then you have to be able to decide
what is in the interest of the greater good. Q. Your management style has been described as information gathering, not dictatorial. You've been called a consensus CEO.A. You have to make decisions. What will kill a growth company is
someone who can't make decisions. But you have to listen very hard,
recognize which constituencies are speaking and then make a decision
for the greater good. Q. Are there any decisions you regret?A. Particularly in the early days, at eBay we made more decisions in
a week than many companies make in a year. There've been pricing
mistakes over the years. User interface mistakes. There've been
strategy mistakes. But we have listened hard and made the determination
- we need to fix it. We're hearing a lot of noise but I still
think it's the right thing to do. Q. Give me an example of a strategy mistake.A. The early days of eBay Motors. It was a big success, but we quite
quickly made some user interface changes probably in the middle of
2000. And we did it without as much consultation with the community as
we should have. We rolled a new UI for the Motors part of the site, and
there was a massive uproar. That day I think I got 5,000 emails. So immediately we made it so you could keep the old user interface
or use the new user interface. If you built your business selling cars
on eBay, you are not excited about a new user interface, even though it
tests better and people like it. Q. You've been given this window into how people think and behave. What have you discovered?A. People are basically good. That is the key thing I've learned in
the past 10 years: People are basically good. When we started eBay, you
were going to buy something over the Internet from someone you'd never
met, likely in a different state, maybe in a different country. You
were going to send them money. And you were going to get the item.
There was tremendous skepticism about this. The investors who didn't
invest in eBay at the IPO roadshow in 1998 didn't for that reason. They
just looked at us and said, ""I don't believe this is going to work.""
Their view was there will be tremendous fraud and theft and all kinds
of bad behavior. It was quite the opposite. 99.99% of people did the
right thing.Obviously you have to be incredibly vigilant around trust and safety
and keeping the .01% in line. But last year, our users traded nearly
$60 billion in product in the marketplace and it's because people are
basically good. It's not that all people are good. But people are
basically good. And it's true in every country in the world. It's
remarkable. Q. What was your worst moment?A. The site outage in June of 1999. I was not a technologist, so I
had just really begun to learn the underlying technology that powered
eBay. And so when the site crashed - it was down for 22 hours, then it
came back up for eight, then down for eight. The darkest hour was when
the engineer said to me, ""I'm not sure we can bring this back up.""
Because we had corrupted the entire backend data base. That was not
perfect. (Laughs.) And there was nothing I could do other than be a
cheerleader and a coach to the technology team. We had CNN parked outside the building wanting an update on the
status every 60 minutes. The parking lot turned into a media campout.
Every hour I had to go out, looking more tired each time.It was a real growth opportunity for me because effectively what I
did is I moved into the site operations center for almost the entire
summer. I literally camped out there. I said to my assistant: ""Go get
cots, sleeping bags, pillows, toothbrushes, toothpaste, razors for the
guys, because we're going to be spending a lot of time here."" It was a
crash course in technology which has served me in good stead since.Q. You really slept on a cot?A. Oh, yeah. For multiple nights. In some ways it was a bonding
experience. And if I was there all the time I could demand the best
help from our vendors. And I will tell you, Sun (NASDAQ:SUNW), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Veritas (VTS), all
sent their very best people into battle with us. So it was in some ways
just leadership by being there.Q. Your acquisition of Skype for $2.6 billion in 2005 has been controversial. Will it ever pay off?A. What we loved about Skype was the disruptive nature of the
technology and that it was one of the fastest growing web properties
that we had seen. In fact, it just finished its fourth year. It is
bigger after four years than eBay was, than PayPal was, than Yahoo (YHOO) was,
than even Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) was. We thought there might be some synergies with
eBay and PayPal and we decided we would place a bet on this new company
and new technology that we thought held tremendous promise. And there's
no question in the first couple of years we struggled with management.
We struggled with integrating a company in London into San Jose. And
ultimately last year we made a number of changes. We bought out the
earn-out, changed out management. It will be interesting to see, but I
think we will be proven right here. This is a tremendous technology. We
were early. But I think we will end up with a very valuable asset in
the eBay family.Q. And when you say proven right, do you mean cash will start flowing in?A. It will become part of daily life. It will be a very big and very
profitable company that will justify the price that we paid for it. And
you can start to see it: Oprah did a whole segment on Skype. When you
move into Oprah, you have crossed the chasm and gone mainstream.Q. What of the whole idea that buyers and sellers would use Skype to talk to one another?A. It has not worked out as well as we had hoped in part because we
had some trouble integrating this very entrepreneurial company based in
London with big eBay here in the United States - especially with the
original entrepreneurs running it. Now, we have eBay people running it.
The new president of Skype is a longtime eBay exec. So stay tuned.Q. eBay has been criticized over the years for providing a platform
for heinous commerce - whether its Nazi memorabilia or a serial
killer's shaved calluses.A. ""Murderabilia.""Q. Thank you. What sort of soul-searching did this prompt in you?A. eBay was originally founded with the notion that if the item was
legal for sale in the country in which we were doing business, then it
would be legal on eBay. And that's pretty much how the company ran up
until the first quarter of 1999. In the first quarter of 1999, there
were a number of issues that caused me to say: is this something that
we want? The very first categories of items we decided to ban were
firearms, alcohol and tobacco. All were legal for sale over the internet in the United States. But we made a decision that while they
were perfectly legal, they were not something we wanted to be involved
in. Frankly, it's a judgment call. Our community of users pushed back
on this, not because so many of them felt selling firearms was a great
thing, but they were worried, well today firearms, next week maybe my
category. There is now an eBay lookalike site that does nothing but
sell firearms.I said I understand that. But we are a big company. We are building
a brand. We want to be admired and around for generations. And it is
the CEO who has to make those judgment calls. So over time, we'd make
incremental calls - Nazi memorabilia was one. Perfectly legal for sale
in the U.S. Not legal for sale in Germany or France. Ultimately we
said: not a business we're going to be in. Murderabilia - the catalyst there was Jeffrey Dahmer's refrigerator. I said, you know, not sure we want to be in this business. Q. Dahmer's refrigerator?A. I had gotten emails from customers not only about Dahmer's
refrigerator but autopsy photos - the whole category of items around
murders - so-called ""murderabilia."" And we heard from victim's
families. The team talked about it and decided we don't want to go
there.Q. So historical items are okay - Lizzie Borden's hatchet say. But items that might cause pain to people still alive are not?A. Right. There are nuances to this. On the Nazi memorabilia, what
do you do about Mein Kampf? Do you want to be in the business of
censoring books? And we decided: No. Do you want to ban stamps from the
Third Reich? Probably not.Q. What have your conversations with Pierre been like about your departure?A. We're very close friends. We've known each other for 10 years. Of
all the CEOs in the Valley, I drew the prince of a founder. When I met
him he was 29 going on 40, with a calm and depth of perspective that is
very rare for a computer scientist under 30 in Silicon Valley. So when
I told him that actually in fact we were going to stick to 10 years, he
said, I've been hoping this day would not come. He is so wise that he
understood why I thought it was the right thing for me and for eBay.Q. John Donahoe, your successor, is facing a host of challenges in
keeping the brand competitive. What do say to those who say Meg was the
perfect person to grow the company, but not to run a huge company?A. As CEO you have to be on top of all the changes all the time. If
you look at the 10-year record, one would have to say it was a pretty
good 10-year record with a very high batting average. It was also the
reason that I felt 10 years was the right time. I think you DO need a
fresh set of eyes, a new perspective, and that same 24/7, 365 days a
year, 150% effort. And I thought it was the right thing to turn over
the reins. I hired John three years ago. He's been running the eBay
business for 3 years. He knows the people, the challenges, the brand.
So he is stepping into a situation he knows well. Q. What sacrifices have you made as a wife and a mom?A. For the past 10 years, I've really tried to do three things as
best as I could. One was eBay. The other was being a good mom to my
kids, who are now 22 and 19. And the third was to be a good wife to my
husband. There were lots of other things that just didn't get done. We
weren't particularly social. We went out on the weekends only when we
could bring the kids. I have a lovely home, but it doesn't necessarily
look like Martha Stewart just left. I wouldn't say that I'm a fashion
forward executive. There was no time. Something had to give. My husband deserves a huge amount of credit. He has been a
incredible team player. He's a neurosurgeon, so there was lots of pinch
hitting. He took responsibility in many ways for running this household
for the last 10 years. And households do not run themselves. The
boys got quite used to the fact that mom would, from time to time, be
interrupted. Things like this happened a few times: we were all set to
go to Yosemite for the weekend and I was in the process of interviewing
new chief technology officers to help solve our technical problems. So
the guy we ultimately hired, Maynard Webb, flies up from LA where he
was at Gateway. I said to my family: OK, we're going to get in the car,
we're going to drive to the San Jose airport, I'm going to interview
Maynard for 45 minutes and then we're going to keep on driving to
Yosemite. And my husband and two boys sat in the car in the parking lot
at San Jose airport for an hour. That's the kind of thing that from
time to time just had to happen.In many ways, being married to a neurosurgeon - when you're in
residency training, when you're on call, the phone rings all the time.
All night long. My husband was on call this weekend. The phone probably
rang 50 times on Saturday and 60 times on Sunday. I'm married to
someone who understood that when you were on call you were on call. He
was remarkably supportive and I'm not sure I could have done this had
he not been. Q. Have your kids ever reflected on the impact on them? They'll probably marry very strong women.A. Or the opposite! (Laughing.) I've worked since they were little.
They've never known their mom not to work. So it's part of the fabric
of their upbringing and I think what they'd tell you they appreciate is
they have been to parts of the world and they have been exposed to
people that they would never have met. And they have an exposure at a
young age to things that I didn't. I think they would tell you the
negative is that sometimes they had to share their mom a little bit. I
am quite grateful that I don't have a Blackberry. Kids know about
Blackberrys. I have colleagues who have little children who actually
take their parents' Blackberrys and hide them. One of the things I
really tried to do is when I was with the kids, I was with them. I tell
my friends: when you walk in the door, turn it off.Q. So you do not own one?A. Nope. I said I cannot bear it. Talk about 24/7. And the good news
is, being the CEO, if something really bad is happening, they will
track you down. Sometimes I have to turn off the cell phone too, though
it's usually with me and usually on.Q. Are you going to run for California governor?A. I've heard the rumors too. What I am focused on right now are a
couple of things. One, eBay has first call on my time through 2008. I
will be on the board and Pierre and the board are very anxious for me
to make sure this transition goes well. I'm anxious for the transition
to go well. I'm available to John at a moment's notice. The second
priority is to our family foundation, which is funded, yet it doesn't
have a mission statement. We don't have a system yet for how we're
going to make these grants, how we're going to measure them. We don't
have someone yet to run the foundation. So I would like to spend a lot
of 2008 really focused on that. And I still sit on the board of Procter
and Gamble (NYSE:PG), DreamWorks, obviously eBay. And then I'd like to have a
little time to power down. I totally enjoyed my time working for Mitt
Romney, who was a 30 year friend. It was great fun. I hadn't been
politically active. But my focus remains: eBay and the family
foundation. And it's pretty funny -- my husband the other day I came
down for breakfast and there was a ""To Do"" list he'd left for me.Q. What was on it?A. The pool cover is broken. Could you call the pool cover guy? And
six other things that he would have historically done that he said, I'd
just love it if you'd do them. Q. A hypothetical: Carly Fiorina, who McCain has just named to his
fundraising committee, is also rumored to have political aspirations.A. Yep.Q. If you ran against Carly for governor, who would win?A. I can't answer that question. I've known Carly for years, I have
tremendous respect for Carly. Carly was an inspiration to a generation
of women. I remember when she was made CEO of Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ), all of
us were cheering on the sidelines. So she is an excellent speaker and
was an inspiration.Q. What's your user name?A. I don't release that, for obvious reasons. Q. What have you bought and sold over the years?A. Lots of things. Almost everything we're going to buy, I try to
check eBay first. The preponderance of items we've bought tend to be in
the consumer electronics or sporting goods categories. We got virtually
all the kids' sporting goods on eBay. Everything from cleats - I just
bought my son a pair of rugby cleats on eBay. And then we sold a lot of
their sporting goods over the years. We bought most of our computers,
laptops, TVs - that big TV was bought on eBay 7 or 8 years ago. We have
a couple of flat panels upstairs. They were bought on eBay. That lawn
furntiture out there. Some of our collectibles. Those two white pots
the orchids are in. We have a condominium in Telluride, Colo. Virtually
all the kitchen equipment was bought there. Over the years we sold
things we don't need.Q. You've often been described as being ""nice."" Campaigning for
office is anything but. If you decided to go into politics, do you
think you could roll with that?A. You know, I think the attribute of being a nice, high-integrity
person is a good thing - in politics, in business. It's a good thing as
a stay at home mom or as a doctor, lawyer, Indian chief. It's one of
the things I'm most proud of at eBay. Whenever I meet people who deal
with our employees - just yesterday this happened, a woman told me,
""Your people were so nice and easy and competent."" I hear that from
almost every vendor, every partner. I think that's a very good thing.Q. Do you feel like you've gotten particular scrutiny or faced criticism at times because you are a woman chief executive.A. I think I got a little more attention as the head of eBay as a
woman than I would have gotten as a man. The interest level was higher.
My point of view on this has been: it kind of is what it is. There's no
changing it. From my earliest days, when I first graduated from Harvard
Business School, I just decided I was going to put my head down and do
the very best job I knew how to do at whatever I was assigned to do.
And that was the only thing I could do. Do the very best job I could.
Be fun to work with. Be easy to manage. Because when you're a senior
leader at a company, when you have two people of equal competence and
you have somebody who's easy to manage - you'll pick them every day of
the week over the hard to manage person.Q. When you talk about powering down, is there a particular closet you're going to clean?A. I would be delighted to show you my pristine garage. Two weekends ago I completely cleaned it out. Q. Could you fit a car in it before?A. It was challenging. I'm working my way through the house. First was the garage. Last
week was the office. We cleaned out 10 years of stuff from the office.
Now it's a mess again because my other project is I'm sorting through
10 years of family photographs that have been in boxes. Were going to
get them all scanned and store them all digitally. Then, I'm moving up
to the master bedroom. Then, after we get done with the master bedroom,
we're moving out to the poolhouse. Those are the kinds of things that
don't get done. Frankly, whether the garage is clean or not doesn't
actually matter. It certainly doesn't matter to the kids. But now that
we have the time, it's kind of nice. Q. You've given a lot of money to Princeton. Could you imagine being involved in higher education in some more formal way?A. Maybe. I sat on the board at Princeton for four years. That might
be a board that might be fun to go back on. I love Princeton and loved
my time there. Stanford Business School is right here. So that would be
fun as well, maybe to teach a course in entrepreneurship of something.Q. But you've worked for your last corporation?A. I have said I do not think I will do another business job. I
can't imagine it could be more fun, more interesting. This was a once
in a lifetime opportunity. Q. You might get bored of cleaning the garage.A. It was really fun when I did it."
75124,20468,2008-05-01T09:20:40-04:00,,"EBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has gone public with the details of its lawsuit against
Craigslist and its two shareholders Craig Newmark and James Buckmaster.
While suit details alleged self-dealing by Newmark and Buckmaster and a
rift over eBay’s Kijiji unit, which competes with Craigslist, it’s
worth pondering the motives – and perceptions – here.
Obviously, eBay thinks it has a strong case and that’s why it went public with the complaint. The short version:
eBay bought 28.4 percent of Craigslist in 2004 and there was a right of
first refusal on share purchases that would be lifted if eBay became
a competitor. In 2005, eBay launched Kijiji.com overseas and brought
the site to the U.S. in 2007. Craigslist balked and said that eBay was
engaging in competitive activity, ending the right of first refusal
provision in June 2007. That July eBay removed Josh Silverman from
Craigslist’s board because he worked on Kijiji.In July, eBay tried to appoint Thomas Jeon, a company lawyer, to
Craigslist, but “Newmark and Buckmaster engaged in a series of
clandestine transactions (a poison pill and other moves to make eBay a
minority stakeholder) designed to ensure that eBay would not be able to
elect a director, and to either impose new transfer restrictions on
eBay or dilute its interests.”On July 23, 2007 eBay’s then CEO Meg Whitman told Buckmaster that
the company put a firewall between Kijiji and its Craigslist investment
and said eBay “would welcome the opportunity to acquire the remainder
of the company we do not already own whenever you and [Newmark] feel it
would be appropriate.” Whitman reiterated that it was happy with its
Craigslist investment and had no intention to sell.Does eBay have a case in the court system? You bet. How about the
court of public opinion? The answer here is not so clear. No matter how
solid eBay’s complaint it is, the spat is going to be portrayed as a
David vs. Goliath story. Big bad eBay will be pushing around Newmark
and Buckmaster.Frankly, it doesn’t matter whether Newmark and Buckmaster cooked up
a scheme to dilute eBay’s holdings in the perception game. Why?
Craigslist is a community service controlled by two guys that obviously
care about controlling their company, but aren’t nutty about making
money. Personally, I don’t get it since I’m a capitalist pig, but there
is a certain appeal to Craigslist’s approach. Craigslist is a movement,
an Internet icon. eBay represents corporate America.Realistically, how can eBay compete with that Craigslist perception?"
73526,21513,2008-04-23T05:13:46-04:00,,"Update:A post at the newish Craigslist blog says that the company is:And the post goes on to say that eBay has no reason to feel threatenedSo there you have it. Not much clearer than before, but it certainly
lends some support to the “poison pill” idea. It’s possible that
Craigslist implemented some kind of provision that would change the
share structure in the event that eBay mounted some kind of hostile
takeover attempt. Don’t you wish the court hadn’t sealed those
documents? Maybe we can buy copies on Craigslist.Original post:It seems that now, along with other Craigslist mysteries — such as
why the site sticks with that 1996 design, and why Jim and Craig don’t
just sell out and buy a small Latin American country — we have the
mystery of what the dynamic duo did to make eBay so mad.
The auction site, which has about 300 employees and $2-billion dollars
for every one that Craigslist has, is suing Craig and Jim for “unfairly
diluting” eBay’s 25-per-cent stake in the classified service. As some
readers may know, eBay wound up with a stake after an early employee
sold his shares, something Valleywag has covered in great detail and was also confirmed by Craig in an interview with Sarah Lacey on TechTicker.So what did Craig and Jim do to get eBay’s knickers in a knot?
Dilution implies that shares were issued that reduced the value of
eBay’s stake in the company. But why would Craigslist do that? Peter
Kafka at Silicon Alley Insider says it’s likely because
the classified site was raising money — although even he admits that
doesn’t really make any sense. Why would a company with about
$100-million in revenue and costs of about $30-million have to raise
money? My friend Paul Kedrosky wonders whether Craig introduced some kind of poison pill that would reduce eBay’s stake if they pulled something the site didn’t like. And what might that be? Well, what if eBay went into competition
with Craigslist? That’s exactly what happened when eBay-owned
classified site Kijiji announced last year that it was moving into the
U.S., and it has quickly become a major competitor to Craigslist. The
dilution eBay is complaining about took place in January — which is
about the time that Kijiji was talking all kinds of smack
about eating Craigslist’s lunch. Did Jim and Craig issue themselves
some more stock around then? After all, they make up the entire board,
and they own preferred voting shares while eBay owns common shares.As Ashkan Karbasfrooshan at HipMojo says: “Put down the bong,
the honeymoon is over.” And as my friend Rob Hyndman notes, this is an
excellent lesson for all you startups out there — another example of
why you need to maintain control over your stock."
72704,21640,2008-04-17T11:25:30-04:00,,"eBay put out its earnings statement on Wednesday, which
reflected a forward looking picture of improvement. In the wake of
their earnings report, eBay also announced that they will close down the eBay Live Auctions platform at the end of this year. The big question would be why?Jim Ambach, Vice President of Seller Experience stated,
""As we work to improve the buying and selling experiences which you've
heard our leaders talk about - including significant investments in
Trust & Safety and customer support - we need to make sure our
resources are aligned with our priorities. In the case of Live
Auctions, maintaining and improving this platform falls outside our
immediate focus, and will, therefore, be retired at the end of the year.""Can
the aforementioned statement be interpreted to mean that eBay did not
view the Live Auction platform as a priority during the past few years?
Just how many employees operate and maintain eBay Live? No one knows.While
eBay's announcement did not affect the millions of regular auction
sellers on their system, it did affect hundreds of live auction sellers
who contributed (and created) an impressive revenue stream for eBay and
its partner providers. According to Live Auctioneers, LLC they stated on their web site that they earned more than $100M in 2007 in fees. Live Auctioneers also issued a press release dated July 16, 2004 in which Live Auctioneers announced that eBay had entered into a seller referral agreement whereby eBay Live Auctions sends live auction clients directly to Live Auctioneers. In contrast, Able Auctions (a partner of eBay Live) earned a bit less with revenues of just $700,000.00. Who is Able Auctions? Able Auctions operates iCollector.com and was also a partner of eBay Live. However, iCollector.com (as a stated partner of eBay Live) seems to have lagged behind Live Auctioneers, in gaining eBay Live clientèle - by the hundreds.If
the platform generated $100M in revenues (as stated by just one partner
of eBay - Live Auctioneers, LLC) then it stands to reason that the
""resources"" are (and were) available to police the system, maintain it
properly and improve the overall platform.The last known update
to the eBay Live Auction platform improved the selling experience for a
few direct to eBay live auction sellers, who had access to a tool,
which manipulated the end times on their live auction items. The items
were pushed to the front of eBay core on an hourly basis, as opposed to
waiting in line with the vast majority of other Live Auction seller
items (who patiently waited for their items to flow through eBay core).Manipulating
the end time auction duration was through the use of a tool accessed by
eBay direct clients. The advantage was clear. Manipulate the end times
on live auction lots and one could corner the market within specific
selling categories. This does not take into consideration the
harvesting of eBay email addresses and then re-directing that traffic
to an off-eBay e-commerce web site.One can draw their own
conclusions as to the value of front page placement on eBay core, let
alone, flooding core hourly. eBay Live Auctions charges $1500.00 per catalog and a Live Auction seller may upload up to 10,000 lots into the system. eBay Live charges a 5% Final Value Fee on every lot sold through its system (as per eBayLiveAuctions.com). A
Live Auction seller pays just 0.15 per listing (if the seller lists the
maximum number of lots allowed). Non Live Auction eBay sellers can
compare their average listing fees to arrive at their own conclusion,
as to any disparity in listing fees between regular eBay listings and
those paid by eBay Live Auction sellers.A number of lawsuits allege that eBay violated Antitrust and Unfair Competition laws,
while a recently amended action alleges shill bidding and conspiracy on
the part of eBay and seller defendants. Could it be that the announcement
of the winding down of eBay Live Auctions is more likely a result
of (multiple) pending legal actions and an attempt to stem the tide of
potential future legal actions? Who knows.There's no doubt that
there are fine auction sellers on the eBay Live Auction platform who
supported the platform for a number of years. Those sellers shaped and
molded the platform by way of creating online catalogs and expending
millions in listings fees and advertising dollars to drive traffic into
a system - that will simply disappear by the end of the year.It
would seem that eBay Live Auctions partners are stepping up to the
plate to create their own live auction platforms and bidder applets.
However, can they command the traffic of eBay? Are they up to the task
in expending the millions they've made in seller fees (over the years)
and re-investing those fees into multi-million dollar ad campaigns to
drive traffic into a new platform?The first question one would
have to ask of eBay's partner providers is why did they wait so long to
step up to the plate. The second question is not a question at all but,
an answer. The applet and platform was there all along and was created
by Able Auctions a number of years ago.Disclosure: No positions"

are strong signs Marketplaces has turned a corner. Active user growth
on the eBay platform, at 1% Y/Y (or 6% Y/Y excluding China/Taiwan),
finally seems to be bottoming out. And if a flat user base is
generating 14% Y/Y growth in Marketplaces transaction revenues in Q1,
you can imagine the opportunity if EBAY revive even a tiny portion of
the massive pool of dormant users over the remainder of the year (EBAY
mentioned early testing of ""couponing"" showing positive signs in this regard).Equally
important, non-transaction revenues (classifieds, advertising,
shopping.com) continue to be on fire, with growth accelerating to 56%
Y/Y in Q1. This group now accounts for 15% of Marketplaces revenue, up
from 11% in Q1 last year.PaymentsQ1 revenue came in at $582 million, representing 32% Y/Y growth.PayPal continues to be a pillar of growth for EBAY.  The growth of PayPal Merchant Services, at 61% Y/Y, continues at full pace and now represents 46% of PayPal TPV.  And with only 31 of the top 100 online merchants in the US offering PayPal, there is still an amazing amount of headroom left.On-EBAY
penetration rate continues its steady increase, and at 54.5%, also has
plenty of room for further gains. Management mentioned making PayPal the exclusive payment alternative in Australia would be closely monitored in the context of other markets.CommunicationQ1 revenue came in at $126 million, representing 61% Y/Y growth.Skype was the only disappointing performance, in my opinion.  Skype-Out minutes, where Skype
derives most of its revenue, were up only 33% Y/Y. And although it’s a
significant improvement over Q4, I was simply expecting more.Very little color was given on Skype,
except to say EBAY are once again going to explore integration with
Marketplaces and Payments. I personally think this is just the standard
official response and that it’s certainly not a priority anytime soon.
A sale of Skype has been rumored for several months and, reading between the lines, is not incompatible with EBAY's report.Disclosure: Long EBAY"

Expectations on the company’s results have been ratcheting up into this afternoon’s report, and it turns out, for good reason. For Q1, eBay reported revenue of $2.19 billion and pro forma EPS of 42 cents a share; the Street had expected $2.08 billion and 39 cents.  For Q2, eBay sees revenue of $2.1 billion to $2.15 billion, with non-GAAP EPS of 39-41 cents; the Street consensus has been $2.11 billion and 40 cents.For all of 2008, the company forecasts revenue of $8.7 billion to $9 billion, with non-GAAP EPS of $1.70 to $1.75, above the current consensus of $8.79 billion and $1.68.In a statement, eBay CEO John Donahoe said the results “reflect the strength provided by our diverse portfolio of businesses.”The company’s Marketplaces unit grew revenue 19% year over year to $1.48 billion, but down 1% sequentially; that is hardly surprising, given that Q4 is typically the company’s strongest due to the holiday shopping season. Non-U.S. revenue was 55% of the total in Q1. Gross merchandise volume in the quarter was $16.04 billion, up 12% year over year, but off 1% sequentially from the seasonally strong fourth quarter.PayPal revenue was $582 million, up 32% year-over-year, and up 3% sequentially. Global active accounts for the payment services totals 60.2 million, up 17% year-over-year.Skype revenue totaled $126 million, up 61% year over year, and 9% sequentially. The service added 33 million users, increasing the total to 309 million.eBay’s cash position at quarter end was $4.11 billion, down from $5.04 billion one quarter earlier, reflecting the repurchase of about 37 million shares in the quarter for about $1 billion. (That would suggest an average price of about $27 a share.)U.S. revenues were up 16% year over year, but off 1% sequentially; international revenues were up 32% year over year, and up 2% from Q4.Some additional Marketplaces metrics: Active users inched up to 83.9 million from 83.2 million one quarter earlier. New listings stood at 647.4 million, up 10% year over year and 2% sequentially. The number of eBay stores stands at 547,000, off 13% from a year ago, but up 3% sequentially.Towards the end of today’s regular session, eBay was up 53 cents, or 1.7%, to $32.11; the stock had rallied 25% since March 19 on rising expectations for the quarter."

71710,21640,2008-04-09T07:55:18-04:00,,"Can a little company like Windsor Auctions, Inc. take on a Fortune
500 company? As reported a few weeks ago, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) had informed Windsor Auctions that their eBay user
names would be suspended on April 6th.April 6th
came and went and Windsor
was still in business. However, on April 8th, just before Windsor was
to begin their 6:00 P.M. sale, eBay pulled the plug on their auctions,
eBay stores and suspended all of their eBay user names.One has to wonder why Windsor Auctions
is perceived as a threat to an organization as large as
eBay?  I contacted Windsor
Auctions located in the United Kingdom and was informed by the owner of
that eBay account that their Windsor Auctions, U.K. eBay user name had
been suspended without notice nor cause.  Ms. Allan, President of the
company stated that her company has long-term agreements in place with
both Live Auctioneers, LLC (eBay's partner) and eBay Live Auctions. The notice posted by eBay on Windsor's accounts
proclaims that WindsorAuctions-USA and JewelryAuctions are no longer
registered users. This brings up
the question as to why were three user names (one of which belonging to
a Ms. Allan located in the United Kingdom) suspended? Did they have
terrible feedback? Did they not ship customers their packages in
a timely manner? Were they the worst possible sellers in all of eBay
history? One look at their feedback reveals
positive ratings. Comments left by buyers praise these companies for
providing excellent customer, quality products and fast shipping. This
leaves the all important question as to why would eBay (who featured
Windsor Auctions in their own eBay Entrepreneur Magazine in 2007)
suspend a seller with a stellar reputation? One
may need to look no further than the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California, San Jose Division, for the answer. Windsor
Auctions filed a lawsuit against eBay in December 2007 which alleges
that eBay violated Federal Antitrust and Unfair Competition
laws. It doesn't take a
rocket scientist to figure out these suspensions may be directly
related to the filing of the lawsuit.  As I reported in a recent article, I brought up the question
of who owns an eBay users name. Does eBay own the user name, the
reputation and the links flowing in from the search engines into that
users eBay store or, is that user name the rightful property of the
original owner? Can a seller (newly registered
or established) request an eBay user name, which is no longer being
used by its original owner? The answer would be ""yes"". eBay can release
a user name. In fact, if an eBay seller is fortunate enough to have an
eBay account representative, that representative may even send out a
reminder notice that the user name will be available (and up for
grabs) on a specific date. In searching for
Windsor's link popularity in Google and Yahoo, I was presented with tens of
thousands of links. I found links into their eBay store, eBay guides,
product listings and eBay blog. No doubt, once the search engines crawl
these links (and find no pages to crawl), the links will either
disappear from the search engines and/or be re-directed to other eBay
pages, as the majority of these pages are tagged with eBay
address extensions. What's puzzling is that
Windsor (who was suspended) is the plaintiff and eBay is the defendant
in this case (and a case it is). The broad strokes of Windsor's lawsuit brings into question potential claims from regular eBay users, those utilizing the eBay Live Auctions platform, those selling through the eBay
Live Auction platform, those who consign their goods
to global auction houses and third party partner providers of eBay
Live. A newly amended case against eBay (and
sellers utilizing the eBay Live Auction platform) was filed on
or about April 4th and totals a staggering ninety-four
pages. The contents of that lawsuit will published
online within the next few days.

Q1 results heading into its announcement after the close on Wednesday.
This morning, a number of analysts weighed in on their expectations for
the quarter, with most anticipating a strong report. This trend has
been building for several weeks; eBay shares have gained more than 22%
since mid-March. Given rising expectations, you have to wonder if the
stock can continue the rally unless the company really does blow away
expectations.Here’s a rundown on some of today’s commentary.

At Monday market close, eBay was up 50 cents, 1.52%, at $31.37. There was continued upward activity after hours."
71350,21640,2008-04-07T03:47:07-04:00,,"If anyone can sort out the eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) mess and bring the people together it's Oprah! Oprah has a business acumen that could put all of eBay management to shame. While eBay is a four-letter word and easy to find on the net, Oprah could develop out a rival auction site and call it Harpo's Place.
Would sellers and buyer' flock to Harpo's Place or stick with eBay? I think people would take a liking to a site, which deals in a fair handed manner with ALL people - buyer's and seller's alike.
The business of the Internet is no longer just based upon technology and how much of it you have at your disposal, it's now about the people. What's missing on eBay is the ""people connection"" and I don't care how many professional bloggers eBay hires to smooth out the rough edges, once the damage is done, it's done - you're toast.
There was a time when large corporations truly cared about losing even one customer. If you lost just one customer, others will follow.On eBay, sellers are also customers and are at all times ""buying"". What do they buy? They buy time for their listings, they buy store space in which to sell their items and they buy enhanced listing services.
In the scheme of things, a site such as eBay may be able to afford to lose ten thousand sellers or maybe even a hundred thousand sellers, however, what if they lost a quarter million sellers (or more) in any one fiscal quarter? Where would the flow of product come from to appeal to the buyers?
I don't think eBay has enough horses in the stable to get into the business of opening warehouses and morphing itself into an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). What was nice about eBay's business model is its simplicity in being able to make money.
Yes, it's good to be able to have a war chest of cash to settle lawsuits at every turn (and even have money leftover to pick up little companies along the way like Skype), however, the ability to simply collect billions in seller fees (over the years) has its appeal.
There is something known as the ""chaos theory"" and eBay seems to have created a state of chaos between itself and its own sellers. People don't take kindly to being part of a ""chaotic"" situation and will eventually look elsewhere for ""peace"".
It's no longer about how much eBay charges in fees or, how they match up results or even how they DSR sellers into an unknown zone, it's about people skills and eBay is lacking in this department. With 14,000+ employees worldwide, one would think that some of them have basic people skills.
Could Oprah close the gap between the people? She seems to be fair handed with her talk show guests and gets them talking. She has built a multi-media empire (single handedly) and is a stickler for details. She's diplomatic in how she handles people (in general) and is one of the few celebrities who puts her money where her mouth is.
The question is whether Oprah is up to the task of building eBay sellers/buyers a new home on the net. Oprah's website is beautifully designed and offers everything but an auction component. Oprah's ""Big Give"" series is cool way of showing what people can do for each other and she makes no bones about wanting to help people.
Again, this is about people; while those selling on eBay are not celebrities nor have the finances to launch an eBay type auction site, they are the backbone of what made a small company into a multi-billion dollar enterprise (hint, hint Oprah).
The biggest give of all (no pun intended) would be to bring the people together into one place where there's peace of mind (chaos free). As Oprah's own web site tagline reads: ""Live Your Best Life"".

it has never made any sense as part of eBay, and certainly not
$4-billion worth of sense, and it doesn’t make any sense now. Meg
Whitman managed to sell that idea to a gullible board desperate for

Manhattan, which they eventually wrote off.Skype could have a huge amount of value

Google has made it obvious that it wants to move into mobile with

And when John can’t find a reason to hold seller funds, PayPal will do it for him because they granted themselves absolute authority to hold sellers funds hostage for up to 21 days without having to give an explanation. Feeling safe yet? Not me. John has yet to fix a serious security issue he was notified of 2 years ago by US-CERT that allows hackers to steal the following information without exerting any effort whatsoever: 1) Name, address, eBay User ID, email address 2) Last 4 bank account numbers and routing number 3) Last four credit card numbers and expiration date 4) Watched auctions, saved searches, favorite sellers   This begs the question of how can eBay be ""better & safer""? It can’t. A member of John’s staff, Usher Lieberman, put a cute SPIN on the security flaw after it was demonstrated by Ina Steiner a few weeks ago. He must have failed SPIN 101 too because “disabling script” doesn’t make sense. eBay is a script dependent site and the programmers seem to write nothing but bad script because nothing works right anymore. This author surfed eBay for about an hour this morning and wished she hadn’t. Best match was a joke, site links were broken, listings wouldn’t load, page not responding errors were numerous, shipping calculator didn’t come close, checkout wouldn’t, live chat was dead, discussion boards were shut down, and then it got worse – eBay went completely offline (confirmed by my ISP) for the umpteenth time. Is this the new “better & safer” buyer experience John has been touting? This author suspects it is, which helps explain why eBay is fast becoming the internet’s largest ghost town despite John’s apparent belief that sellers are working for him.How else could the “stars” be explained? In reality, sellers work for themselves and John works for eBay. John has an “at will” contract which means he can be “invited” to leave at a moment’s notice without explanation and sellers have choices. I suspect that on May 7 sellers will shout “Take this Job and Shove IT” because that’s the day PayPal will start “sharing” all eBay members' personal account information with John and the entire eBay corporate family.

71046,20378,2008-04-03T05:28:42-04:00,,"So there we have it, my top-line Q1 predictions for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) Marketplaces (see below), Communications, and Payments. If my fortune-telling skills are any good, each of the three divisions will post all-time record revenues - quite an achievement given the tumultuous quarter eBay has found itself in.Putting my three individial forecasts together, I predict that eBay as a whole will report Q1 revenue of $2.24 billion representing Y/Y growth of 26.6%. What is even more impressive, compared with previous quarters, is that this growth is completely organic, with the last material acquisition having finally been lapsed (StubHub in Jan 2007).Recall that eBay's 2008 guidance is for revenue growth of a paltry 11-14%. You can rest assured that if Q1 comes in as I expect - more than double this - then eBay will also raise its guidance.eBay reports Q1 results on April 16th.There is no doubt eBay Marketplaces has had an eventful quarter including new fee structures and feedback policies, the roll-out of best match, a seller boycott, the launch of eBay Desktop, continued success of classifieds, and news of a new in-house affiliate program. So what top-line growth can we expect in Q1?Analysts estimate that eBay listings grew by approximately 11% Y/Y in Q1. To this, I add 1.5% of net Y/Y growth to adjust for SubHub/China and 4.5% of Y/Y growth from FX. As per analyst estimates and anecdotal evidence, I also assume a flat Y/Y effect from conversion rates and ASPs. This yields 17% Y/Y growth in GMV.But as we know from previous quarters, revenue is growing faster than GMV because of the relative success of non-GMV businesses. That said, a lower overall take rate for eBay as a result of the fee structure changes partially offsets this gain. I suspect the net effect will be an additional 4% of Y/Y growth, bringing Marketplaces' Y/Y revenue growth to 21%.I therefore predict Marketplaces revenue of $1.513 billion for Q1 2008, a growth rate of 21% Y/Y. If correct, this would represent another all-time record quarter for eBay Marketplaces, albeit a second consecutive quarter of decelerating growth."
70726,20378,2008-04-01T07:38:47-04:00,,"PayPal had another record quarter, signing up new accounts, pursuing innovative promotions, increasing existing merchant penetration, and benefiting from strong cross-border trade. PayPal even managed to complete the acquisition of Fraud Sciences. So what growth can we expect in Q1?Well, just this past Friday, Scot Wingo (CEO of ChannelAdvisor) stated that they were seeing very little, if any, broad macro-economic weakness in the 3rd party sales channel. This echoes a statement two weeks ago by PayPal CEO Scott Thomson that PayPal had not seen any signs of a slowdown in online business. So as far as PayPal Merchant Services is concerned, it is fair to expect another quarter of 60%+ Y/Y growth in TPV.The more difficult estimate is on-EBAY TPV. PayPal is clearly a benefactor of eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) recent fee structure and policy changes. Not only is the reduction in eBay take-rate absorbed exclusively by the Marketplaces division but some policy changes have required higher PayPal adoption across a variety of listing types. Based on accelerating growth in GMV and a slight jump in PayPal penetration, I expect we will see 20% Y/Y growth in TPV.Putting both of these together, I expect overall PayPal TPV to grow by 35% Y/Y. Taking TPV growth as a proxy for revenue growth, I therefore predict PayPal revenue of $593 million for Q1 2008, a growth rate of 35% Y/Y. If correct, this would represent a fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth at PayPal.  It's been another busy quarter at Skype that has included improved To Go services, a new CEO, a partnership with Oprah, and the prospect of Skype on the iPhone. But with the passing of the last day of Q1, what about Skype's financial performance?Skype had a strong quarter, starting at just under 11 million peak concurrent users, and ending at around 12.5 peak concurrent users. This would yield a 13.6% Q/Q growth rate in peak concurrent users, the highest Q/Q rate jump since Q4 2006. Even if we take the conservative assumption that Skype's local revenue per concurrent user has remained flat, and only add 2% of Q/Q growth from a depreciating USD, we still get revenue growth of approximately 15.6% Q/Q.I therefore predict Skype revenue of $133 million for Q1 2008, a growth rate of 68% Y/Y (or 15.6% Q/Q).For completeness sake (since I update it every quarter), at $133 million of Q1 revenue, Skype's annualized revenue is up to around $532 million. Given eBay's all-inclusive consideration for Skype totalled $3 billion, this results in about a 5.6x revenue multiple. This is still arguably high but continues to drop fast with every passing quarter."

Combined with the estimated 89MM store listings we have tracked QTD, they estimate total listings growth improved to +13% Y/Y, tracking ahead of Citi's 1Q08 growth estimate of 11% Y/Y. - Jefferies notes eBay's February pricing tweaks are having positive effects on 1Q results, with 1Q listings pointing to a healthy 9% Y/Y growth and translating into results likely at the higher-end of expectations. With the stock's pullback, EBAY is the cheapest among large cap internet plays, providing an attractive risk/reward profile. Based on their weekly tracking of eBay listings worldwide, they're estimating 630-650M listings for 1Q08 vs. our original projection of 602M (up 9% Y/Y at the mid-point). All else remaining constant, this should result in upside to revenue, EBITDA and PEPS of $81M, $31M and $0.02 for 1Q. Jeff co. is raising their estimates to $2.11B, $780.5M and $0.39, respectively. Consensus estimates stand at revenues of $2.05B and PFEPS of $0.39. They are also raising FY08 revenue and PEPS estimates to $8.78B and $1.67 vs. consensus estimates of $8.70B and $1.65. Reiterate buy rating and $40 target. Notablecalls: This is certainly good news. With the dollar down vs. the euro since management guidance, there's some upside in store from there as well."
70671,21640,2008-04-01T04:03:27-04:00,,"Windsor Auctions, Inc. and Jewelry Auctions, Inc. filed an unfair competition/antitrust action in December 2007 against eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). In response, attorneys representing eBay filed a motion to dismiss Windsor/Jewelry Auctions action. In filing their motion to dismiss, eBay’s attorneys have argued that eBay is not subject to the Robinson-Patman Antitrust Act, as they do not offer commodities. Interestingly enough, eBay may have opened the door to writing law, which may have its disadvantages for future litigations to come. Does eBay Offer Commodities? When the Robinson-Patman Act was drafted over 50 years ago, the act
did not take into consideration that technology would be where it is
today. In fact, technology has advanced at such a fast pace that laws
specific to technology are - to this day - being defined and tested in
courtrooms across America. What is a commodity? A commodity has varied definitions. A tool such
as a shovel or a rake can be deemed a commodity. The operative word is
“tool”. In this case, eBay offers “tools” such a Turbo Lister (a
management tool which is used by eBay sellers to upload their wares
onto eBay).  On the other side of the coin, we have the example of offering a
commodity as offered through a venue (services). We’ll use the local
flea market as a way to illustrate just how services offered by a venue
may be deemed a commodity.  John goes to the weekend flea market and pays $20.00 for an empty
space in which to offer his wares. His competitor (who operates five
booths) pays $20.00 per booth as well, however, also receives a cash
register, light fixtures, display tables and chairs at no extra charge.
The shelving, cash register, light fixtures, display tables and chairs
(received by John’s competitor) are commodities.  Sellers on eBay have many tools at their disposal. They can elect to
pay a monthly fee for an online store and the majority of eBay sellers
use PayPal as their cash register (PayPal charges sellers a fee per
transaction). Additional tools offered by eBay assist the seller in
dressing up their storefront with promotional advertisement boxes and
sellers can even select specific store themes, which are applicable to
the items that they offer through their eBay store. All of these tools
help sellers to compete and thus, create a safe and fair marketplace
(as claimed by eBay). While Windsor/Jewelry Auctions had the same advantages (as their
competitor) in utilizing the aforementioned tools offered by eBay in
designing their online stores, the competitor had access to an
additional tool, which pushed its listings to the front of eBay core
thus, offering the competitor an unfair competitive edge against ALL
other live auction sellers.  
Can Downloaded Software be Defined as a Commodity? There was a time when those seeking to purchase a software program
hopped into the car and drove to the nearest mall to pick up a new
release of a software program. Times have changed and Internet users
can purchase software programs online and download the program upon
completion of purchase. Does eBay offer both tools and services, which
make them vulnerable under the Robinson-Patman Act? On March 28, 2007, outside counsel for eBay filed a reply in support
of its motion to dismiss Windsor/Jewelry Auctions’ complaint.  eBay claims the plaintiff’s (Windsor/Jewelry Auctions) elected to
interface with eBay Live Auctions through an intermediary (Live
Auctioneers, LLC), while other auction houses elected to interface with
eBay directly. Although Live Auctioneers disclosed it entered into a
partner agreement with eBay, eBay claims that Live Auctioneers is
nothing more than an intermediary, middleman and/or third party
provider.  It is not known exactly how many auction houses interface directly
with eBay, however, a quick review of eBayLiveAuctions displays only a
handful of auction houses, which do not display the logo of partner
providers such as; Live Auctioneers, ArtFact and iCollector.  According to a press release posted by Live Auctioneers, Live
Auctioneers services 670 global auction houses. ArtFact displays a
total of 2,396 searchable auction houses (on its web site) and
iCollector’s site displays approximately seventeen auction catalogs by
various clients. It is not known exactly how many auction houses are
serviced by iCollector. The Auction Duration End Time ToolIn reviewing eBay's answer, it becomes clear that any reference to the ""end time duration tool""
is missing from the equation. This tool is not accessible through Turbo
Lister. In fact, the screen shot of this ""tool"" clearly shows that it
is NOT accessible through the use of Turbo Lister. The
tool is utilized to place a more accurate end time on eBay Live Auction
lots. As a Live Auction seller, Windsor Auctions uploaded listings
through eBay's partner Live Auctioneers. When a catalog is uploaded in
eBay Live, the auction seller is presented with an option to select how
long their auction event will last. In the past, all Live Auction
events were automatically set to last for twelve hours (no exceptions)
however, as the years passed, the option to select a shorter auction
duration were offered to clients who were direct to eBay Live. The option to select the duration of the auction (from a set
twelve-hour period) was changed to allow eBay (direct) Live Auction
sellers the ability to select the duration of their auction for a
minimum of three hours on up to twelve hours. In this case, if a direct
to eBay Live Auction seller averages 60 pieces per hour, the seller
could initially upload 180 pieces for the first three hours and then
upload 60 pieces per hour thereafter. The complaint filed by Windsor Auctions alleges that a competitor
(within the jewelry category) batch uploaded listings into eBay Live
using the time duration tool. While the competitor initially set his
auction for the twelve-hour duration, he also utilized the same tool to
batch upload his products into eBay and timed those listings to flow
through core on an hourly basis. The advantage of flowing hundreds of listings through core (on an
hourly basis), while hundreds of live auction sellers must patiently
wait, as their listings flow through core (for up to a twelve hour
period), places the timed listings of the competitor at the forefront
of eBay core. Who’s Using the End Time Duration Tool?A review of current live auction sales (March 30, 2007) posted on
eBayLiveAuctions.com shows end times displaying on Paramount
Auctions/Jewelry Overstock Auctions are flowing through eBay core on an
hourly basis. A review of all seventeen auction sales, as displayed on
eBayLiveAuctions.com homepage, reveals that all seventeen auction
houses (with the exception of Paramount Auctions and Jewelry Overstock
Auctions) are displaying end times on lots, which are not flowing
through eBay core on an hourly basis.Windsor’s complaint filed in December 2007 alleges that eBay Live
Auction clients had access to a tool, which was not made available to
those using eBay partner providers such as Live Auctioneers, LLC. One
would most likely question that if all eBay Live Auction clients have
access the tool, why is only one live auction seller is utilizing the
tool? Downloaded Software Programs Not a Tangible Good?Attorneys for eBay contend that such tools are not tangible goods
constituting commodities under the Robinson-Patman Act; rather, such
tools are merely functions of the intangible services offered by eBay
and/or Live Auctioneers. In addition, the technology services allegedly
offered by eBay and Live Auctioneers cannot be produced, felt or stored
even in small quantities. eBay claims the plaintiffs do not by a
quantity of it, store it and resell it to their customers.Turbo Lister is downloaded onto a users desktop/laptop where it is
stored (along with automated updates) within the users desktop/laptop
memory. No doubt, Turbo Lister is not delivered in a glossy package,
however, Turbo Lister is downloaded onto a users desktop and stored in
memory. It is not known how millions of eBay sellers have downloaded
and stored Turbo Lister onto their desktop.The Core of the MatterThe advantage of flowing hundreds of listings through core (on an
hourly basis), while hundreds of live auction sellers must patiently
wait as their listings flow through core (for up to a twelve hour
period), places the timed listings of the competitor at the forefront
of eBay core. The ability of every Live Auction seller (direct to eBay
or not) to push their listings through eBay core on an hourly basis
would undoubtedly clutter core and essentially set both regular eBay
listings and eBay Live listings on the ultimate collusion course.  Is the use of the auction end time tool similar to the auction
extender tool? The auction extender tool allowed regular eBay users the
ability to extend their auctions if their listing received no bids. The
developer of the auction extender tool was Ethical Technologies, which
is no longer in business. In the case of the auction extender tool, all regular eBay sellers
were afforded a “known” opportunity to extend their eBay listings
beyond their initial end time - if they received no bids on their
items. In the case of Live Auction sellers, one seller (maybe more)
within the jewelry category (operating multiple auctions, seven days
per week, twelve hours per day) flooded eBay core (hourly). In fact,
any live auction seller who offered one or more pieces of jewelry
(within their catalog), may have been placed at a disadvantage.One can draw their own conclusions as to the value of flooding core
hourly. eBay Live Auctions charges $1500.00 per catalog and a Live
Auction seller may upload up to 10,000 lots into the system. eBay Live
charges a 5% Final Value Fee on every lot sold through its system (as
per eBayLiveAuctions.com). A Live Auction seller pays 0.15 per listing
(if the seller lists the maximum number of lots allowed). Non Live
Auction eBay sellers can compare their average listing fees to arrive
at their own conclusion, as to any disparity in listing fees between
regular eBay listings and those paid by eBay Live Auction sellers. Live Auction fees, unlike regular eBay listing fees, were not
increased and/or adjusted during the latest round of fee changes
affecting regular eBay sellers on February 20, 2008. Sellers listing
items on eBay with a starting or reserve price of $0.01 to $0.99 pay an
insertion fee of $0.15 for auction-style listings (comparable to Live
Auction sellers).However, auction-style listing insertion fees for regular eBay
sellers increase to $0.35 per listing for items with a reserve/start
price of $1.00 to $9.99 and go up to $3.00 per listing for items with a
reserve/start price of $200.00 to $499.00 for regular eBay sellers.If a regular eBay seller elects to purchase add-ons (such as
Featured Plus and Pro-Pack) fees are $9.95 for items with a
reserve/start price of $0.01 to $24.99 and go up to $19.95 for items
with a reserve/start price of $200.00 to $499.99. Live Auction sellers pushing their lots through core on an hourly
basis pay just $0.15 per listing (flat) if they upload 10,000 lots per
catalog. In contrast, a regular eBay seller would pay $3500.00 to list
10,000 items with a reserve/start price of $1.00 to $9.99. If a regular
eBay seller elected to list 10,000 items with a reserve/start price of
$200.00 to 499.99, the cost would be a staggering $30,000.00. Is eBayLiveAuctions.com a Profitable Business Model? Live Auctioneers, LLC reported that sales revenues for their company
exceeded $100 million in 2007. Live Auctioneers also reported that
their site attracted more than 50 million unique visitors during the
twelve-month period. In addition, the sell-through rate for online live
auction sales was 26%. It is not known how much revenue eBay derives
from its relationship with its live auction partners such as Live
Auctioneers, LLC, iCollector and ArtFact.com. In reviewing eBay’s SEC
filings, it appears as though eBay Live Auction revenues are not
discernible from revenues achieved through regular eBay listing fees
revenues.   Disclosure: none"
69876,21640,2008-03-25T13:59:39-04:00,,"Sellers, who boycotted eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) last
month, may be back in May for round two. The driving force behind
""everything"" eBay are eBay sellers who have simply had enough.
There
was a time when eBay sellers were too afraid to speak out publicly
against the auction giant. Those days appear to be over. The
fear factor has been replaced by
anger and sellers are devoting their time
to speaking out against their venue partner. While those selling on eBay have
also begun to search other venues in which to sell their wares, there
is (no doubt) a bit of trepidation of leaving eBay completely.
Over
the years, eBay has continued to grow at a staggering
pace. Those
seeking a venue to sell their wares came to eBay and now consider eBay
their ""home"". It's a place for sellers to communicate through message
boards (and forums) on topics ranging from how to sell on eBay, to
politics, to announcing births and deaths.
The
thought of leaving eBay may be likened to that of experiencing a loss.
If we lose our job/career and/or experience a financial loss, we
eventually bounce-back. In essence, we are a resilient bunch and once
we accept a loss, we may simply go back to being angry but channel that
anger in ways that make us super men and women.
No
doubt, the fear of leaving eBay is deep rooted in the simple fact that
once you leave, you can't take much with you. You may have spent years
building your eBay business and even the thought of closing down your
eBay store can send a shiver of fear down your spine. This is the ""fear
factor"" that plays into the success of the auction giant.
While
another boycott appears to be on the horizon and message boards expound
on real and/or perceived injustices (wielded like a sword toward eBay
sellers), sellers keep coming back for more.
Powersellers may be the most vulnerable of all eBay
sellers. They have spent years building their eBay business and
reputation. They have changed the color of their stars over a period
months and/or years and eventually get that shooting star, which
basically lets everyone know they're an eBay success story.
However, when it comes to picking up stakes and taking your
tent elsewhere on the net, you have to leave behind your feedback, your
store and your traffic. Your most valuable asset is your eBay username. If you're a
high-volume eBay seller, you more than likely have established hundreds
and/or thousands of links into your eBay store, however, once your
username ceases to exist, so do your links.
One
other slight problem that many may encounter is that if you were to
sell your eBay business tomorrow, you must have the consent of eBay to
transfer your username to the new party. What if eBay informs you that
you may not transfer your username to a new entity? There is very
little information available within eBay's Help pages, which addresses
the all-important question of how to sell your eBay
business.If you spent years building an eBay business
(and do not have a brick and mortar presence), your initial goal in
opening your eBay business may have been based upon the premise of
selling your eBay business as part of your exit strategy. If you have
eBay store with high-volume sales, you've got a business worth
money.Who owns your eBay username?When
registering on eBay, one has to select a username. In fact, eBay offers
some good advice within its Help pages on how select your username.
This Help section expounds on how valuable
your username can be to you and how to distinguish your
""brand"" from that of other eBay sellers.
Ebay uses words like ""you and yours"" when
offering good advice on how to select your username. In other words,
selecting an eBay username is a valuable
asset - not to be taken lightly.
If you
leave eBay, your username can possibly be released by eBay to a new
seller after a period of time. It's possible to contact eBay and
request that the username be placed back into circulation. If you're
lucky enough to have an eBay Account Manager, you may even receive an
email reminder letting you know that a specific username was placed
back into circulation and will soon become available.
There
do not seem to be any clear-cut rules and/or answers on eBay's site
concerning the sale of an established eBay business. While an eBay
search for domain names yielded 160+ results, there do not appear to be
any eBay usernames up for grabs.For all of the publications available on how to ""sell on
eBay"" or ""how to make a million on eBay"" there are none, which tell you
how to sell your eBay business once you have made that first

yesterday that starting immediately eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) will require new sellers to
specify S+H costs and then in the 'coming months' will require this
from all sellers.  I totally get this from the buyer's perspective.There are so many problems with this from a seller's perspective it's not even funny.Thus eBay is implementing a policy that is going to reduce buyer

69999,20378,2008-03-26T07:08:27-04:00,,"In the UK, approximately 95% of listings already offer PayPal
as a payment alternative. As far as eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) country sites go, this is
already very high. But starting in ""late April,"" eBay has decided to make PayPal mandatory as a payment option on all listings (eBay Motors excluded).  This means the last 5% of listings which currently don't offer PayPal will either have to change their ways or move elsewhere. I find this policy a little extreme.  On one hand, I accept that this 5% of non-PayPal listings shelter much more than 5% of fraudulent users and that making eBay
safe is the first priority. But on the other hand, there are a number
of completely legitimate reasons for not offering PayPal,
the most obvious being cash on delivery or pickup of bulky items. After
all, even though a buyer may be indifferent between paying by cash or through PayPal when picking up an item, there will be legitimate sellers that prefer the better economics of a cash transaction.I
expect eBay will be monitoring the effects of this change very closely.
Even if it sees a slight fall-off in listings, if it is accompanied by
better conversion rates and lower fraud rates, I think it is safe to
say this policy will be rolled out to other countries with a high level
of PayPal penetration.Here it is,
from one of the most respected finance publications in the world, the FT's report on war in the online auction community.
Speaking of wars, it seems to me like the war between objective

listings data to 24 March 2008 continue to exceed estimates. ""On a
reported basis, we have tracked 627.5 million listings on eBay’s sites, up
13.1% Y/Y, ahead of our estimate of 5% growth for the quarter.
Excluding China, listings are tracking up 13.7% Y/Y.""According
to Khan, this is now the seventh consecutive week of Y/Y growth
acceleration in listings and I suspect the momentum is likely to carry
into the 13th and final week of Q1."
69162,21640,2008-03-19T06:42:12-04:00,,"This article is a continuation of my piece from yesterday regarding eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) lawsuits.**************************************************Windsor Auctions' lawsuit against eBay alleges that a competitor within the jewelry category (on the eBay Live Auction platform), utilizes the auction end time duration tool to batch upload listings into eBay Live, thus gaining an unfair competitive edge by way flowing listings through eBay core on an hourly basis.  One reader likened the use of the auction end time duration tool to that of the auction extender tool, which allowed regular eBay users the ability to extend their auctions if their listing received no bids. The developer of the auction extender tool was Ethical Technologies, which is no longer in business. As there’s no one to speak to concerning the initial use of this tool on eBay (and its intermittent history on eBay), we can reconstruct the events leading up to its ultimate demise. As one reader has stated:In August 2005, eBay spokesperson Hani Durzy stated:Durzy further stated: (Source: AuctionBytes August 9, 2005). Durzy closes the interview with the following statement:That is a good thing and eBay encourages them, he said, but eBay ""must do what is right for the overall marketplace."" In late September 2005, Durzy announces that eBay will allow Ethical Technologies to offer its sell-through tool to eBay sellers. In January 2007, eBay changes its circumventing fees policy, which then prohibits the use the auction extender tool for everyone. Ethical Technologies closes it doors – end of story or, is it? Durzy clearly uses phrases such as “search manipulation”, “bad buyer experience” and “eBay policy violation”. One can draw their own conclusions as to the value of front page placement on eBay core, let alone, flooding core hourly.  eBay Live Auctions charges $1500.00 per catalog and a Live Auction seller may upload up to 10,000 lots into the system. eBay Live charges a 5% Final Value Fee on every lot sold through its system (as per eBayLiveAuctions.com). A Live Auction seller pays 0.15 per listing (if the seller lists the maximum number of lots allowed). Non Live Auction eBay sellers can compare their average listing fees to arrive at their own conclusion, as to any disparity in listing fees between regular eBay listings and those paid by eBay Live Auction sellers. In the case of the auction extender tool, all regular eBay sellers were afforded a “known” opportunity to extend their eBay listings beyond their initial end time. In the case of Live Auction sellers, one seller (maybe more) within the jewelry category (operating multiple auctions, seven days per week, twelve hours per day) flooded eBay core on an hourly basis.  One hour before a live auction begins, the auction duration plus, one hour is added to the end time of each lot. Before a live auction begins, the end time is reflected by the auction start time. The inaccuracy of the end time may lead to bidders missing an opportunity to bid on a lot of interest. Some Live Auction sellers have resorted to placing disclosures within their listings advising potential bidders that the end times on their lots are inaccurate.  In order to combat the confusion, live auction sellers may also opt to disclose how many pieces per hour they may bring up to auction on average. While such disclosures may assist potential bidders in gauging when a specific lot will come up at auction, situations may arise where the auction moves slower or faster than the auction seller originally anticipated. If the auction duration tool has the capability to offer a more accurate end time, then it stands to reason that such a tool is extremely valuable to live auction sellers. However, its use by all live auction sellers could clutter core in many popular categories. As of this writing (Tuesday evening, 7:17 PST), there are seventy ruby rings offered by one live auction seller on pages one, two three and four of eBay core. This search was conducted using “best match” and not “time ending soonest”. It would appear as though “best match” may actually enhance “timed” live auction listings.Disclosure: none"
68994,21640,2008-03-18T05:40:36-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) now has its hands full with two lawsuits aimed at the eBay Live Auction platform. One eBay Live Auction seller is suing eBay for affording an unfair competitive advantage to another eBay Live Auction seller who's being sued (along with eBay in an unrelated lawsuit) for allegedly shill bidding on the platform.   eBay Live Auctions (eBay, Inc.) has not been without its hiccups with its live auction platform. In October 2006, GoAntiques, which sells its wares on eBay Live Auctions, was accused of creating the appearance that a live auction was taking place when, in fact, a computer was generating the bidding to protect reserves. Judge Sargus for the Southern District Court of Ohio approved a class settlement on behalf of consumers. Now it appears that Hot Jewelry Auctions, which operates under the eBay user names of Paramount-Auctions, Jewelry-Overstock-Auctions and WJoutlet has been sued for shill bidding on eBay Live Auctions. In a separate matter, Windsor Auctions, Inc. operating under the eBay user name WindsorAuctions-USA has sued eBay under federal antitrust laws and California's anti-competition laws. Windsor's suit alleges that George Molayem (who operates Hot Jewelry Auctions) had use of a tool, which afforded Mr. Molayem the opportunity to batch upload his products/listings in small groups on an hourly basis, thus, driving his listings through the front of eBay core during an entire twelve-hour auction event. In essence, Mr. Molayem's products flowed through eBay core ahead of ALL other live auction sellers and even those of regular eBay sellers within the jewelry category. eBay has demanded that the court dismiss the suit contending that Windsor Auctions could have gone to eBay directly and taken advantage of all of the tools offered to eBay direct clients. However, Windsor Auctions was directed by eBay Live Auctions to Live Auctioneers, LLC when it originally applied to eBay Live in 2005. According to Live Auctioneers, LLC website, Live Auctioneers issued a press release dated July 16, 2004 in which Live Auctioneers announced that eBay had entered into a seller referral agreement whereby eBay Live Auctions sends live auction clients directly to Live Auctioneers. Windsor Auctions began selling on eBay Live in July 2005. eBay has also informed Windsor Auctions that their eBay user names (corporate and personal) will be suspended on April 6th. The suspension affects WindsorAuctions-USA, JewelryAuctions and all personal user names associated with the CEO of Windsor Auctions. On April 11th, eBay and their attorneys will appear in court to argue their motion to dismiss, in the interim, WindsorAuctions-USA will be suspended five days before the hearing of the motion. WindsorAuctions-USA has traded on eBay for over three and a half years and has maintained a feedback rating of 99.9% and has sold over 27,000 items through eBay Live. In fact Windsor Auctions was a centerfold featured article in eBay Entrepreneur entitled ""Beyond Borders"" in April 2007. This begs the question of why eBay would suspend a user, which has proven itself over a period of years to be an exceptional eBay seller. In contrast, Hot Jewelry Auctions has message boards on CNET devoted to its business practices and complaints filed on RipOffReport.com (keyword - Paramount Auctions). No doubt, the suspension of WindsorAuctions-USA will cast suspicion upon eBay, as a retaliatory response to Windsor Auctions in exercising its constitutional right to file an action against eBay. The Core of the Problem...eBay core is what drives listings to potential buyers. As eBay announced last month, the default for all eBay listings will result in buyers being presented with items that serve up the ""Best Match"" based upon specific keywords and associated values. The current eBay search default is ""Time Ending Soonest"". The advantage to flowing through eBay core (with timed accuracy) is that products/listings under the current search default of ""Time Ending Soonest"" appear at the front of core based upon how much time is left before a product/listing expires. If a seller has the ability to push their products/listings to the front of eBay core consistently, every hour on the hour, then it stands to reason that such a seller will gain market share from top placement exposure. In the past, many sellers on eBay paid for eBay keywords in order to drive traffic into their eBay stores or straight into specific listings. The eBay keyword program served up banners and promotional boxes in all eBay categories. If your eBay store offered jewelry, you could buy hundreds of keywords within the category of jewelry and your eBay keyword ad would pop either at the top of the search results page and/or on the left hand side navigation bar. eBay sellers paid for these ads based on a pay-per-click basis. The amount charged per click was based upon what a seller was willing to pay by bidding on keywords specific to their product line. If a seller selected a keyword such as ""diamond jewelry"" the seller/advertiser would have the option to display their ads at a rate based upon their daily budget. The higher the budget a seller/advertiser set for their eBay keyword ad campaign, the more clicks they would receive. The ability for any eBay seller to flow product through eBay core, would negate the need to advertise through the now expired eBay keyword program and/or through existing pay-per-click ads offered by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Yahoo (YHOO). As a Live Auction seller, Windsor Auctions uploaded listings through eBay's partner Live Auctioneers. When a catalog is uploaded in eBay Live, the auction seller is presented with an option to select how long their auction event will last. In the past, all Live Auction events were automatically set to last for twelve hours (no exceptions) however, as the years passed, the option to select a shorter auction duration were offered to clients who were direct to eBay Live . The option to select the duration of the auction (from a set twelve-hour period) was changed to allow eBay (direct) Live Auction sellers the ability to select the duration of their auction for a minimum of three hours on up to twelve hours. In this case, if a direct to eBay Live Auction seller averages 60 pieces per hour, the seller could initially upload 180 pieces for the first three hours and then upload 60 pieces per hour thereafter. The complaint filed by Windsor Auctions alleges that a competitor (within the jewelry category) batch uploaded listings into eBay Live using the time duration tool. While the competitor initially set his auction for the twelve-hour duration, he also utilized the same tool to batch upload his products into eBay and timed those listings to flow through core on an hourly basis.

that goes by. As painful as this would be to earnings growth across the
board, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is particularly well placed to resist, if not benefit from,
a downturn to the economy. One could argue that each of eBay's
three main businesses (Marketplaces, Payments and Communications) has a
significant counter cyclical component. A recession could even unlock
new sources of growth for each.Marketplaces.  We have already seen how eBay will probably see renewed growth from casual sellers,
which currently account for 50% of revenue. Not only that, this could
be accompanied by renewed growth in casual buyers that are suddenly
more focused on value for money than they have been the past 5 years.

slowing economy.""Communication.  We have already seen Skype going through a growth spurt in 2008 YTD.

I say 'relatively' because Apple has been quick to point out that it will allow VOIP over WIFI but not over the carrier network. Regardless, it is critically important we see a great application coming from Estonia. As mentioned in a couple of industry blogs, this could represent a paradigm shift in how the telecom industry functions and as the runaway VOIP leader, it's Skype's game to lose.Update: Jonathan Christensen, general manager of audio and video at Skype, opened the eComm conference Mountain View last week with the prediction that free Internet calling will make its way to mobile handsets.

SIIA has settled a few of their lawsuits with great success. Adobe Photoshop costs approximately $700.00 to purchase through retail stores. Those claiming to offer the same product on eBay for $100.00 may be passing off versions of the popular software, which may be defective, without manuals and/or pirated.  Software and Information Industry has stated it went to eBay with proposals to reduce the sale of pirated software on its site, however, rejected the proposals. The trade group also created a banner advertisement, which would serve to educate potential eBay buyers but, their advertisement was rejected. While SIIA’s lawsuits are not aimed at eBay directly, Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) took the bold step to sue eBay last year in a highly publicized legal battle in which Tiffany sued eBay over the sale of counterfeit Tiffany products. That lawsuit is pending a decision. In 1997, the FBI commenced Operation Bullpen. The goal - set up a phony company, wire undercover agents and purchase fake sports memorabilia from unwary forgers. The operation collected memorabilia purportedly signed by deceased celebrities such as Mickey Mantle and DiMaggio. The sale was these goods were conducted on eBay and other auction sites.  Ultimately, the FBI’s investigation raised questions as to eBay’s responsibility for the sale of such merchandise on its web site. After a few years of legal wrangling, eBay was exonerated based upon the Communications Decency Act (under Rule 230). In short, the CDA immunized eBay from such claims.  The Communications Decency Act:Exactly what is the Communications Decency Act? (source: Wikipedia)
The Act was Title V of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. It was introduced to the Senate Committee of Commerce, Science, and Transportation by Senators James Exon (D-NE) and Slade Gorton (R-WA) in 1995. The amendment that became the CDA was added to the Telecommunications Act in the Senate by an 84–16 vote on June 14, 1995. As eventually passed by Congress, Title V affected the Internet (and online communications) in two significant ways. First, it attempted to regulate both indecency (when available to children) and obscenity in cyberspace. Second, Section 230 of the Act, authored by Representatives Christopher Cox (R-CA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR), declared that operators of Internet services were not to be construed as publishers (and thus legally liable for the words of third parties who use their services). The most controversial portions of the Act were those relating to indecency on the Internet. The relevant sections of the Act were introduced in response to fears that Internet pornography was on the rise. Indecency in TV and radio broadcasting had already been regulated by the Federal Communications Commission—broadcasting of offensive speech was restricted to certain hours of the day, when minors were supposedly least likely to be exposed. Violators could be fined and potentially lose their licenses. The internet, however, had only recently been opened to commercial interests by the 1992 amendment to the National Science Foundation Act and thus had not been taken into consideration by previous laws. The CDA, which affected the Internet and cable television, marked the first attempt to expand regulation to these new mass media. (source: Wikipedia)
It is Section 230 of the CDA that is most often used as a defense:
Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was not part of the original Senate legislation, but was added in conference with the House, where it had been separately introduced by Representatives Chris Cox (R-CA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) as the Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Act and passed by a near-unanimous vote on the floor. It added protection for online service providers and users from action against them for the actions of others, stating in part that:Effectively, this section immunizes ISPs and other service providers from torts committed by users over their systems, unless the provider fails to take action after actual notice or is itself involved in the process of creation or development of the content[1]. As a result of the Seigenthaler incident, and other incidents where individuals have been allegedly libeled by anonymous or judgment-proof parties, this section of the Act has come under fire, with numerous calls for revisions to the Act to restore service provider liability in some cases. Through the so-called Good Samaritan provision, this section also protects ISPs from liability for restricting access to certain material or giving others the technical means to restrict access to that material.ConclusionWhile lawsuits will continue to abound over the sale of counterfeit goods on the net, the venues, which offer the sale of such goods, can dodge potential actions under Rule 230 of the CDA. As funds are expended in the courts to bring the sellers of such goods to justice, it is Rule 230 which provides the loophole for the venues. The call to revise the Act could potentially remove the “empty chair syndrome” and place the venue (along with the seller) in the hot seat."

To find it as a seller, login to eBay and go to My eBay, then My Account, ""Seller Dashboard"".Not every reader is a large seller and I'm sure there's a lot of curiosity around concerning what this looks like. So, as DSRs are such a hot topic with the community, I thought you may enjoy a little walk through.Keep in mind that this is what eBay is calling the lite version of the dashboard and more will be coming in May.Here's a screen shot of what it looks like for a real live titanium powerseller.I've marked up this screen shot to highlight some things:In this example, the seller is clearly making the 5% discount tier. Now, thanks to this 30-day data, sellers can start to change some things and test to see if the 30-day average starts going up or down based on their changes.So, for example, with this seller, we now have a much clearer path to the 15% discount. If we can work and get the shipping time and charges DSRs up, then we can get there.Why do/should sellers care about DSRs?The 5+15% discounts in the U.S. are pretty widely known, but now that BestMatch is live, we're seeing conversion rates pop as much as 15%-30% for those sellers that are being advantaged. One point I've been making to some sellers that say, ""Well I'm going to stay at a 4.5 and not really be advantaged or disadvantaged and keep charging high $ rates,"" is that in a world where sellers are being advantaged, if you are not being advantaged, that in itself can effectively be a disadvantage.For example, let's say you are selling shoes and are at a 4.6, but some of your larger competitors are at a 4.8. It's not only possible, but probable, that you are now pushed off the front page of listings even if you have a high saturation strategy. Start doing some searching with BM selected and you'll see what I mean. Think of it this way:The moral of this story is that sellers who take selling on eBay seriously need to work to get to the 5% level short term, and in the long term they need to think about what it takes to get to 15%. If you don't, you can say hello to page 4 and maybe even page 6.How to improve your DSRsIn mid-February, we ran a webinar on DSRs and came up with 11 best practices here. One thing sellers have been constantly leaving in the blog feedback is that eBay wants them to do free shipping, but eBay isn't paying for it.Well what these folks aren't listening to is that we keep saying that our data say that sure cost does play a role. However, what's equally important and sometimes more important, are the options (do you offer combined shipping, expedited shipping?) and communication. With some tweaks to communication alone we've been able to move a seller's 30day DSRs from .1 to .3, so it's more about setting expectations and living up to them vs. giving away shipping free.  To those readers who hate DSRsEvery time I write about DSRs, I get about 10 comments from sellers (most of them the leaders of the recent boycott) that fundamentally argue the system is flawed, evil and the work of Satan. Their argument goes something like this:I'm being kind here, for there's usually some reference to communism, a class action lawsuit or some such kind of thing.This makes me think back to one of my first engineering classes at the wonderful University of South Carolina (go Gamecocks!). This was a weeder class and super hard. I was really proud on one of the first tests to get a 95, but somewhat perplexed to see the grade marked with a 'B'. The professor went on to explain that he was free by the university to grade on a curve and according to the bell curve, enough fellow students did better than I did such that I was now in the 'second quartile' and a B. Well I can tell you that that really got my attention, and I certainly started to strive not only to get above the 'A' rank - which was usually a 93 - but to get in the top quartile of my fellow students.This is exactly what eBay is doing to sellers. Sure they are telling buyers that 4 is good and 5 is excellent. Then what they are doing is putting all of the sellers in a distribution curve, and it turns out that when you do that, you end up with the buckets that Brian Burke outlined a long time ago. So there really is no correlation to what eBay tells the buyer and where they draw the lines for advantage/disadvantage/carrots/sticks. What matters is where you rank against OTHER SELLERs.Sellers that are stuck on this aspect of DSRs need to move on or be forever relegated to page 6 (and really what's the point at that point?).Finally a message for eBay (need sellers' help here too - call your TSAMs!!!) While the seller dashboard is a neat app and give sellers some new data, we believe that third parties like ChannelAdvisor could do some innovative things with this data. However, alas, eBay has not made it available via any API. We have literally thousands of sellers using our free DSRWatch utility, and would love to add some advanced charting/trending/alerting around the 30-day data, but eBay has this data locked up in its servers and is not providing access to anyone but eBay."
67731,21090,2008-03-09T09:07:59-04:00,,"I'm a divorced dad, so I have some personal experience with what
happens to a marriage that is failing. In my case, I tried to make the
marriage work until we had a “Come to Jesus” moment when she said she
didn't want to. I wasn't going to stay in a marriage that didn't work.
Many of my friends, going through the same thing, have not left for
various reasons (kids, financial, fear, etc.)Why do I bring up
divorce in a financial blog? Because, marital problems are exactly
like what is happening between eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) management and eBay's sellers. They
are in the middle of a bad marriage and looking at their options.I'll
try not to take the analogy too far, but somebody in the field of
Psychology should do an in-depth research piece on this situation; the
relationship between eBay and its seller community. The parallels to a
bad marriage are as clear as a bell.For many sellers, eBay was
their first love, but they have taken so much crap, for so long they've
lost any hope that the relationship can be saved.So
what is the result? Sellers basically have heard ""eBay Speak"" for so
long that they no longer believe anything that eBay says and are not
likely to ever again.In my marriage, when the problems started
to become evident, my wife and I would have these deep discussions
about every 3 months. I would say, ""I'll change"" (because of course it
was all my fault) we would get through the pain of the moment and
then three months later it would happen again. Soon I was calling these
little get togethers ""The Quarterlies"". By the way, not a very good idea if
you want to have peace in the household. I got tired of the complaints;
she got tired of the lack of progress. We separated, got back together
and then decided this wasn't going to work.The relationship
between eBay sellers and eBay management is very similar. When things
were going great back in ""the day"", everyone was happy, but soon
sellers began feeling neglected or talked down to. eBay management
publicly state that sellers are important and they care about their
businesses, yet their actions say something completely different and
behind the scenes (around the water cooler) they say ""all they ever do
is complain, nothing I/we do is ever good enough for them.""Sellers
on the other hand, look for fulfillment elsewhere, trying different
marketplaces in the hopes that they can make one work, so they can
leave eBay all together. They go on the discussion boards and bitch
with their friends. They get advice from friends, who say, ""why don't
you just leave"". They hold out hope that they can still save the
relationship, yet they won't believe anything that eBay says.So, eBay hires a ""Corporate Blogger"" (No Dr. Phil) who says all the right things:
Yet
he has no experience selling on eBay, so immediately his views mean
nothing. eBay needs a marriage counselor that both sides can agree on.
Someone who can tell sellers when they are out of line and someone who
can hold management accountable, but you know that will never happen
because this is business not a marriage.eBay management would do
themselves a big favor, if they looked in the mirror and said ""this is
much more than a business"". They have to understand that eBay is
everything to many of its sellers. Unfortunately, I fear that the
damage has been done and nothing that eBay management can say will
improve the situation. You may think this analogy is a stretch,
but if you look at the situation honestly you can see there is a lot of
truth to what I'm saying.eBay is much more than a business!Just my 12%."
67586,21439,2008-03-07T04:22:00-05:00,,"I've received many reports about recent eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) surveying activity that is very interesting.At Duke recently, eBay paid students (I heard from the MBA folks
there) $75 to take a survey. Evidently during the survey they asked
many selling questions, specifically asking students what they thought
sellers would do with ""prominent competitive ads right on listing
pages"".  They also asked from a buyer perspective if the buyer would
find this more or less helpful.I'm sure 99% of things from eBay surveys don't become reality, but this
one was kind of scary sounding.  Let's hope it stays in the 'Survey
says: Don't do it!!"" bucket.Then in Seattle, I've heard they are looking for the 'recent mom' demographic to do some buyer surveys. Finally, I'm hearing from sellers that evidently Bain and Co (Donahoe+Meg's
alma matter) is calling and doing in-depth Q+A (takes about an hour). 
Bain won't identify who they are representing, but the questions are
all things like:""Which channel drives more margin for you?  eBay, Amazon or website?""Most sellers think it's pretty obvious that eBay has retained B+C
to do some kind of strategic analysis on what eBay should do about
Amazon.Finally, an anecdotal story. (Disclaimer: Yes I know this is one random person, but that's the point).About 2 years ago, I decided to stop telling people that at
ChannelAdvisor we help sellers sell on eBay because I was always hit
with some sad tale of fraud.  Given all the changes eBay is making,
I went out to test the waters recently to see what the vibe is out there
now.I rented a car earlier in the week and upon seeing the company name
on my CC, the very nice rental car lady asked me what we do and I gave
her the 'we help people sell on eBay' line.  I could tell the way her
eyes popped and nose flared that I was in for an eBay story.Turns out she bought one time on eBay.  She purchased some expensive
perfume at a 10% discount and when it arrived it was a bad knock off. 
She said she'll ""never buy anything on eBay again - it's all fakes and
frauds.""  She was pretty intense on this last part and I tried to break
the ice by saying, ""Oh come on Marilu, we need you back."" But she
reiterated, ""No, never ever again - I learned my lesson.""  Where are
the active buyers going?  If you talk to enough 'people on the street',
you quickly realize there are a LOT of Marilus out there and they seem
to outnumber the people I meet that like buying on eBay 2:1.While I applaud the increasingly bold changes eBay has taken on the
Finding and Fees, I'm still worried that only the tip of the
fraud/trust iceberg has been addressed so far."
67432,20378,2008-03-06T06:27:10-05:00,,"I posted a couple of weeks ago about the amazing six-year long P/E compression that has affected the eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) share price. Thinking about it this, I want to make two further observations.
1. Calculating a 2008 Ex-Cash P/E Ratio
Putting share buybacks and acquisitions aside for a moment, eBay will finish the year with $7.5 billion of cash. That means eBay's market cap of $35.5 billion could arguably be viewed as a $28.0 billion for the actual business and $7.5 for the expected cash. In calculating a ""true"" P/E, it is arguably more appropriate to use the $28.0 billion (or $21.10 per share) as the numerator as this is the pure equity value of the business generating the earnings. If we apply a modest 10% premium to eBay's uber-conservative 2008 EPS guidance of $1.65, we get $1.82. Therefore, I would argue that eBay is currently on sale for a forward P/E of around 11.6x.
2. Putting eBay's P/E in Context
According to Thomson Financial, the S&P is currently trading at 14.0x 2008 projected earnings. This would mean that on a P/E basis, eBay is actually trading at a 17% discount to the S&P as a whole. The discount is even larger if we assume that there is a lag in Thomson Financial's revising 2008 earnings downward in the context of an economic downturn. For a global business with leading positions in e-commerce, payments and communications online, I suspect the pendulum may have swung too far to the downside.
According to JPMorgan analyst Imran Khan, week 9 listings data and YTD listings data to 3 March 2008 continue to exceed estimates. ""On a reported basis, we have tracked 456.6M listings on eBay’s sites, up 11.7% Y/Y, ahead of our estimate of 5% growth for the quarter. Excluding China, listings are tracking up 12.5% Y/Y.""
Y/Y growth in Q1 YTD listings therefore posts a fourth consecutive week of acceleration. That said, the new development this week is a sharp uptick in U.S. listings. This is, of course, what the fee structure change was intended to do. While it's still early days, the listings data suggest the controversial fee changes are already having their intended effect.
Listening to a recent conference by eBay CFO Bob Swan, it struck me that in terms of eBay revenue, the split between casual sellers (those selling the odd item to make an extra buck) and business sellers (those making a living through volume), is roughly 50/50. While Swan did not elaborate, I would assume that in years of economic prosperity, the growth in business seller volumes outpaces the growth in casual seller volumes. If we were to look at eBay 5 years ago, I would not be surprised to see the casual/business mix at 70/30.
The question is really: What happens in a deep economic recession? Intuitively, I would guess the balance of growth shifts back to the casual seller, for whom the incentives to sell on eBay are suddenly increased. Conversely, the balance of growth shifts away from business sellers who face tougher economics as a result of soft consumer demand. In contrast, perhaps, to other e-commerce destinations that focus exclusively on business sellers, the net effect for eBay is not at all obvious. Will 2008 mark the return of the casual seller?"
67016,21521,2008-03-04T05:27:44-05:00,,"An excellent development occurred for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) on Monday March 3rd. Skype has teamed up with Oprah and bestselling author Eckhart Tolle for an exclusive, Skype-sponsored, worldwide online class. For starters, this is huge news as it allows Skype to enter the U.S household. Oprah appeals to many viewers in the United States. Although Skype is well known in Europe and Asia, it is virtually unknown in the United States. Oprah wouldn't team up with Skype if she felt it was a fly by night outfit. Thus, I believe this is ground breaking news. One of those little cracks that fall through and barely create a whimper until millions of households throughout the U.S. begin to familiarize themselves with Skype.   On a side note, why was it necessary for Reuters to issue a press release stating eBay's mention of their risks in their annual report. Every company lists their risks in their reports. For example, a company goes out of its way to list every possible risk. One wonders why they didn't add the following: if a meteor was to strike earth, this may hurt eBay's chances of doing business or in the event of a nuclear war, eBay may have difficulty operating. Thus, Reuters took it upon itself to dedicate an entire article to this common annual report news of potential risks. A novice investor upon viewing this report would have alarm bells going off in his/her head. Reuters should take more responsibility in their actions or else they may have many angry people on their hands who sold on this news, which was very biased indeed. Shame on you Reuters.

66710,21521,2008-03-02T02:43:28-05:00,,"After several years of battles in the media and the courts, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has finally settled with MercExchange.  Originally, MercExchange’s founder, patent lawyer and engineer, Thomas Woolston, argued in court that eBay was illegally infringing on various patents that he had created. One of the patents in questions was the very popular “Buy it Now"" technology prominently featured on many eBay auctions. Woolston promised to do everything in his power to have the courts issue an injunction against eBay. His goal was an immediate injunction to prevent eBay from using the “But it Now” feature until they promised to pay for the license. Spokesmen for MercExchange argued in court that Tom Woolsten invented this patent before eBay was a twinkle in investors' eyes. eBay countered that Woolsten was jumping on the bandwagon and trying to rob the company for as many millions as the legal system allowed. Woolsten wasn’t going to stop there; if his “Buy it Now” patent successfully held up in court, he was going to go after eBay and others for additional patents, mentioning eBay, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and countless others. It is debatable whether Woolsten actually did invent these patents as eBay’s lawyers argued that some people were using this technology on the internet for their businesses long before Woolsten patented this feature. Thus, the major question was whether eBay is telling the truth - or Woolsten. After many trials, the courts came to the conclusion that eBay was to pay MercExchange $30 million, which was further reduced to $25 million. eBay was in the process of appealing this decision, stating that they believed they owed MercExchange the lump sum of zero dollars, when on February 28th, we were greeted with the news that eBay has finally decided to purchase these patents and has settled with MercExchange. Why the sudden change of heart? Perhaps President-to-be Donahue would like to start off fresh and wipe away any old headaches from the past? One can only wonder. Additionally, if MercExchange was very disappointed with the $25 million they received, what would it have taken to acquire all three patents? 50 million? 75 million? 200 million? Had eBay acquired all three patents for $25 million you can be sure that you would have seen a press release stating that “eBay has prevailed in court by receiving all 3 patents for $25 million."" Thus, my guess would be that eBay paid $100 million.Now that eBay has possession of the 3 patents, will they up their fight against Amazon and take them and others to court for infringement? One can only wonder. If it did cost $100 million, eBay still came out of the deal way ahead, as they now hold the patent technology and can sue other companies at will. Additionally, MercExchanges’s goal from the start was to shut down eBay’s ""Buy it Now"" feature and eBay prevailed. However, what happened to all of the work around patent technology that eBay was promising us if they had lost the court ruling?"
67102,20378,2008-03-04T07:33:08-05:00,,"I was browsing traffic statistics to PayPal and was surprised not only at the fivefold increase in 2007 traffic, but at the resilience and continued strength of 2008 YTD traffic. In fact, for the moment, Q1 08 traffic is actually higher than the holiday Q4 traffic. Given the modest growth of the eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) Marketplace platform over the past 12 months, the obvious driver of this explosion in growth is PayPal Merchant Services. PayPal Merchant Services is benefiting from three trends, which are set to continue for the rest of 2008. First, it is quickly signing on new merchant accounts. The good news here is that 81% of the top 100 online retailers still don't offer PayPal. Second, as PayPal becomes more ubiquitous, the percentage of merchant sales going through PayPal is increasing. Again, the good news is that only 10-15% of the typical merchant's sales currently go through PayPal. Third, e-commerce traffic as a whole is still increasing at 17% a year. Even in a very conservative worst-case scenario, e-commerce will still grow at double-digits for years to come. Put these three trends together and you see why PayPal is likely to charge ahead despite any downturn to the economy. Two big changes take effect this week. First, 'Best Match' becomes the default sort method site-wide. Read news of the roll-out here. Second, user ID's for all auction-style listings regardless of price will be masked to enhance fraud protection. Read news of this roll-out here. Skype is sponsoring Oprah and bestselling author Eckhart Tolle as they teach A New Earth in an interactive online class every Monday for 10 weeks. During each class, Oprah and Eckhart take questions from readers around the world through a live Skype video call. Oprah.com reports that this week's initial session was watched live by over 500,000 online viewers. Over the course of the 10-week campaign, this event is likely to generate Skype brand awareness for millions of American users."
66806,20378,2008-03-03T03:58:28-05:00,,"With the USD hitting all-time record lows against the Euro this week, it is worth thinking about implications this has for the world’s most visited e-commerce destination. Cross-Border Trade. The U.S. site is still Marketplaces’ single largest country, accounting for 45% of total GMV. With the current exchange rate, increased activity from foreign buyers is a massive opportunity (and already accounts for 15% of total volume). eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is ideally suited to capture this trend and needs to be looking at how it can further facilitate cross-border activity. 2008 Guidance. eBay’s 2008 guidance is based on a very much stronger USD. For the moment however, eBay is still enjoying peak tailwind levels. For example, Q108 EUR/USD rates are now roughly 13% higher than Q107. As an approximation (the GBP/USD is roughly flat Y/Y), this will add about 5% of Y/Y growth to Q108 revenue alone. Currency Hedging. eBay’s business is not currency speculation and given its ever-increasing proportion of international business, the company is increasingly exposed to FX rate risk. Fortunately, this has helped it for most of the last 5 years but, going forward, it could be interesting for eBay to start thinking about hedging part of this risk. Non-US Acquisitions. Last week, Lorraine McDonough of eBay Corporate Development, mentioned a host of potential M&A deals coming back to the table. Conversely, the weak USD is making any non-US acquisition more and more expensive for eBay. It will be interesting to see what kind of opportunities come up in 2008. Foreign Stakeholders. On a more imaginary note, one has to think that buying a strategic stake in a U.S.-denominated asset like eBay would be increasingly interesting and inexpensive to a number of international players like Naspers (OTCPK:NPSNY), Softbank (OTCPK:SFTBF), TOM Online or even Alibaba Group. It was just this past December that the eBay vs MercExchange trial seemed to be headed towards yet another round of appeals and more waiting. Thankfully, seven years of lawyer fees seem finally to be enough for both eBay and MercExchange to decide a settlement is the best solution, regardless of the merits of the case. The price was not disclosed but eBay said the figure would not materially affect its financial results. Next up. Tiffanys.  Nothing like a little déjà vu to finish the month of February. Within the grand scheme of things, eBay investors actually got off lightly. Happy leap down day. Here it is, eBay's first promotion under the new fee structure. Listings have already shot up under the new structure so it will be interesting to see if this has any effect. If so, we could see record March listings start at historical records."
66482,20378,2008-02-28T08:09:46-05:00,,"In an interview with Reuters yesterday, Lorraine McDonough, of eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) corporate development team comments on eBay's M&A plans in 2008. She states that while the company has recently passed on a lot of potential deals that, despite being good strategic fits, were considered expensive, those opportunities may return in 2008 as a weak U.S. economy takes a toll on valuations. ""We've kept our powder dry and been disciplined in our approach over the last couple years, not to overpay,"" she said. ""We're extremely well positioned to capitalize on any bargains that might be available."" It was only this past January that I wrote about eBay Classifieds overtaking Craigslist in global traffic thanks to eBay's vibrant international classified businesses. But if we take the U.S. market only, Craigslist (in which eBay owns 25%) continues to be the market leader. But that is quickly changing. Jacob Aqraou, Kijiji vice president and general manager, states that winning in the U.S. is their objective. In an interview with TechCrunch, he states: ""We play to win. We will win in the U.S. Six months in, the U.S. is the best launch we have had and we have not put any money into it. This year we will make significant inroads. And we will be No. 1 in the U.S.""  According to JPMorgan analyst Imran Khan, week 8 listings data and YTD listings data to 25 February 2008 continue to exceed estimates. ""On a reported basis, we have tracked 402.5M listings on eBay’s sites, up 11.0% Y/Y, ahead of our estimate of 5% growth for the quarter. Excluding China, listings are tracking up 11.9% Y/Y."" Well past the halfway mark for Q108, I think it is safe to say we will see a third consecutive quarter of accelerating listings growth. While 11% Y/Y growth is still far from the 35% Y/Y peak eBay reached in Q206 (prior to a prolonged growth deceleration), it is nevertheless an early indication that changes made to the buyer and seller experience are starting to show results. Update: At the request of our ""resident eBay critic"" (in the most positive sense of the title), I include the same chart but only including U.S. listings (which currently account for about 44% of the global eBay total). The result is the same, albeit with lower growth rates. I have kept the scale the same for easier comparison."

In January, Kijiji had 2.3 million U.S. visitors, which made it the sixth largest classifieds site in the U.S., according to comScore. In six months, Kijiji has grown to be about ten percent the size of Craigslist (which had 26.7 million unique visitors in the U.S.). Worldwide, the numbers are much closer. Kijiji had 21.6 million visitors in January, compared to Craigslist’s 27.8 million. Yesterday, Jacob Aqraou stopped by my office. He is the eBay executive who runs Kijiji and eBay’s other classifieds sites around the world (including Marketplaats in the Netherlands, Loquo in Spain, and Gumtree in the UK, Australia, South Africa, and Poland). All told, Kijiji operates sites across 700 cities in 20 countries. But Aqraou was pretty clear about who he wants to kill:He is not claiming that he will pass Craigslist this year, but he does not strike me as a patient man. Why did eBay launch Kijiji in the first place back in 2005? Says Aqraou:And that is not his only problem with Craigslist. He contends that the bare-bones site has failed to evolve:Now, there is revenue—advertising. And that is bringing the sharks into Craigslist’s once-friendly, non-profit waters. Kijiji is eBay’s fastest growing business. Revenues worldwide grew 104 percent last quarter (from what base, eBay will not say). Expect to see a big marketing push this year on eBay’s part to drive traffic to Kijiji in the U.S. Fees for featuring items, improvements to the site’s navigation, and tools for easier listings are also coming soon.It doesn’t matter how beautiful a classifieds site is if you cannot find anything there. In terms of the sheer number of listings and things you can find on each site—the single most important factor for success—Kijiji still has a long way to go to catch up with Craigslist. But Aqraou does have a point about Craigslist’s user interface. Searching for stuff is hard. You can’t sort by price. And there are no images in the results pages (only on individual item pages). Does Craig Newmark have anything to worry about, or is Aqroau just talking smack?Here is Kijiji:   And here is Craigslist:"
67369,21521,2008-03-06T02:58:05-05:00,,"Not a day passes by without word spreading of another eBay seller boycott. If you were truly to believe each seller, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is the most evil of all companies. There is never a word of praise for the company that made them what they are today. Before eBay existed, these sellers were likely selling their wares at various markets throughout the United States. Yes, they would freeze on cold days and sizzle on those days that were scorchers. If they sold their wares through trade shows, etc, they would pay steep fees. Then along came eBay and turned them all into instant business gurus. The sellers started to whine with each seller increase, albeit it a few cents there a few cents here. These sellers lambasted eBay. ""How dare such a company take food from our table"" was their common mantra. Little did they see the improvements on the site. For example, eBay purchased PayPal, which made it easier for buyers to pay with credit cards and thus these buyers made more purchases. eBay purchased Shopping.com to draw more eyes toward eBay's seller's wares. eBay even started up a free classified listing sites in the U.S. called Kijiji for all of those sellers who would like to list for free. Yet all these moves are still not enough. eBay announced earlier this year that they were going to reduce fees, but the sellers are still not satisfied. It has reached a point that these sellers will always whine and complain. I have come up with a simple solution that will make both the seller community and eBay happy. eBay can post a link on their website with the following info: ""For all of those sellers who are upset with eBay, please click on this link and complete the following to be removed permanently from our site. We understand the difficulty you are experiencing. We tried to satisfy your needs to no avail. If after leaving the site you continue to harass us through vile messages, threats etc, a restraining order will be put into place. If you have had a change of heart and decide to come back, you would have to go through an appeal process that may take up to two years. We understand your complaints and are satisfying your request."" There you have it. Simple, indeed. A way to satisfy both eBay and the sellers. Did you know that Channel Advisor did away with their lifetime guarantee of 120 per year to subscribers of their service and are forcing their loyal subscribers to pay $29.95 per month? How is that for price gouging? How about your local gym membership charging $200 extra per year to sign up? Have the prices in your local supermarket changed this year? How about your transportation costs? Movie tickets? Sports Venues? If you are a whiny eBay seller, put all of those costs into perspective and you will see how ridiculous your complaints truly are. I have been a seller on eBay since its inception and have never complained about a fee increase since I realize eBay is still and will always be the #1 place for e-commerce. Period."

Silverman is currently the head of Shopping.com and will take the post effective March 24. See his blog post here. eBay named Andre Haddad to replace Silverman as Shopping.com CEO. Haddad most recently worked as senior vice president of products for eBay.  eBay has launched the first out-of-beta version of eBay Desktop (version 1.0). Having played around with this application, I am truly impressed with the ease-of-use and functionality the team led by Alan Lewis have managed to build into this first official version. Apart from having most of the buyer functionality of the web-based eBay sites, the eBay Desktop application includes a number of unique and innovative features. My favorite is the ""feeds"" tabs, where users can monitor real-time feeds of listings from any search query or any seller. Another new feature, which I have often wanted, is the ability to sort search results by number of bids. And finally, the application deserves an award in the aesthetics category, given how tidy, neat and seamless everything is from browsing to bidding. To give it a try, download it here."
66733,21550,2008-03-02T06:29:25-05:00,,"John Donahoe, eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) newly elected CEO and president, has yet to take his role, and yet has caused the largest rift between eBay and the eBay community ever. eBay's position is strong, no arguing this point. But, the question is, has eBay peaked? Is there room for growth? Is it all downhill for eBay from here? The answer to this question is being debated among investors. Personally, I cannot help but wonder how Donahoe's direction can strengthen its position with the choices they are making. Donahoe has made it clear he wants to rid eBay of its ""fleamarket"" image, by eliminating those very people who made eBay the strongest online market place in the world. The idea is that by ridding itself of the low-priced items, they can concentrate on larger retailers, and boost revenues with higher end items. Sounds great, right? On paper, yes. In reality, however, not a chance. Donahoe has taken a huge risk here. By alienating your members, Donahoe loses those same people he needs to buy from his wealthier retailers. Of course, that is the problem with any dictator. When you crush and defeat your community with iron fist dictatorship, your community falls apart. Unlike terrorized communities, however, eBay cannot force its community to stay. Therefore, defections are not only likely, but, a reality that will hurt eBay's image, and bottomline. Let's look at the image of the new eBay, and ask yourself, is this the company and the image you want to invest your money into? 1. A man who's leadership has caused TWO planned boycotts within one year? (Feb. 18-25th, 2008, and an open-ended boycott slated for May 1st, coinciding with the new feedback policy changes). 2. A company who has people questioning eBay stock manipulation. (The question has been raised as to what is happening with eBay execs dumping stocks in huge numbers). 3. A man who's idea of great leadership is to hurt those people who have helped create the eBay corporation, by virtually pushing out families who depend on their main source of income. These include single parents (many with handicapped children), retirees, disabled persons who would rather not abuse the system, but, can still be productive members of society by working on a schedule that suits them, students and so many others. 4. A man who is willing to take unnecessary risks, with your money. Rather than pace and research the effects of his ideas, Donahoe is forcing ideas that could actually cripple the eBay name. 5. A man who spins and denies the truths. Donahoe had more spin in one week than eBay has had in all the previous years. Unfortunately for investors, his spin was based more in untruth than in reality. He and his media consultants have said the week-long boycotta had little or no effect on its bottom-line. Oh really? Is this why eBay's listings were by down 3-4 million listings, the week prior to the boycott? Let's understand the actual amounts of money we are talking here. The lowest insertion fee is .20 and is for items under $1.00. The typical user lists between 24.99-49.99 and $50.00-199.99 which was $1.20 and $2.40. Additionally, eBay has many ""extras"" that can be added to enhance the visibility of one's auctions. These include extra photos, at .15 per photo, and double category listings, which doubles all the fees including extras, which can double the highest listing fee of $4.80 to 9.60, and all the extra photos, gallery fees, highlight, or even bold lettering. In other words, eBay can make more off all the extras than they do on just the listing fees. Based solely on a very conservative 3 million auctions, and the 1.20 listing fee as an average, NO extras, and not including their commission fees, starting at 5.25% eBay's losses are incredible: $3.6 million PER DAY! Now imagine all the extras and you can see how much damage Donahoe has caused eBay already. Oh, yeah, and let's not forget, he hasn't even taken office yet. Yet, his plans are already costing investors money! And then comes round two. Donahoe thinks that the worst has passed. Not according to www.myspace.com/boycottebay which announced this week that eBay will be faced with a boycott far worse than the young company has ever seen. According to said website, this past boycott has enabled eBay members to unite, and become a strong force, like never before. And while those involved with ""spreading the word"" none of the ""leaders"" of that boycott planned it. Yet, they have become the loudest and most vocal boycott chapters. And, their sister site on DelphiForums is boasting message views of over 10,000 a day for the last week, and 10 of the last 13 days. Together, these two sites are saying they are taking the time between now and May 1st to organize the largest strike, and they will not back down until either eBay agrees to their terms, or, Donahoe is replaced, and the changes be re-evaluated for the better of the entire community. Team leaders say they are willing to discuss negotiations with ebay executives; but, such requests have fallen on deaf ears. The new face of eBay. Is this a company you can afford to invest in?"

I would think the UK and Germany would be perfect fit for a roll-out.Many of these sites and ideas start out real promising, but when eBay does their ROI evaluation they find that growing them will cost more money than they want to spend and require resources, so they get put on cruise control. What is the old saying? ""If you don't grow you die!"" In many ways this is the same thing that has kept eBay's marketplace business from growing because they aren't investing enough in the business to make it grow. They continue to milk the asset and even though they have made some significant changes in the marketplace this year, they aren't radical enough to reinvigorate the business.So, 10 years down the road will the question just be ""What happend to eBay?

According to JPMorgan analyst Imran Khan, week 7 listings data and YTD listings data to 18 February 2008 continue to exceed estimates. ""On a reported basis, we have tracked 349.1M listings on eBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) sites, up 10.6% Y/Y, ahead of our estimate of 5% growth for the quarter. Excluding China, listings are tracking up 11.7% Y/Y."" Just as last week, the themes continue to be strong international growth (16.8% Y/Y) mitigated by lower growth in the US (5.4% Y/Y). That said, US growth is higher than in week 6 as a result of the promotion.   Given the headline-grabbing changes eBay foreshadowed during its Q4 earnings release, not too many people noticed the company also announced its third-ever share repurchase program of an additional $2 billion. Together with the amount remaining from the previous program, this brings eBay's current repurchase capacity to $2.85 billion. At today's depressed price, this would allow eBay to purchase around 103 million shares, or 7.6% of the total shares outstanding. In rough terms (i.e. holding earnings constant) completing this repurchase in 2008 would, on its own, amount to increasing eBay's EPS by 8.2% from the reduced number of shares. But hold on, eBay's own guidance for 2008 non-GAAP EPS is $1.65, which implies a paltry 7.8% growth over 2007. Talk about underpromise and overdeliver."

Of course, many of those calls would never have been made if Skype didn’t exists, so you cannot count the entire 100 billion minutes as a loss for the phone companies. But a significant chunk of that has got to be eating away at phone company profits. Skype’s owner, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), is not necessarily the winner here either. While Skype has been a boon for consumers, it’s eBay that is footing the bill. Even at the reduced $3.1 billion acquisition price after the write-down, eBay still ended up paying roughly 3 cents a minute for all of those calls. I think I pay less with Verizon."
65568,21199,2008-02-21T14:33:17-05:00,,"Daily charts on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) may be hinting that the stock is bottoming out, presenting a buying opportunity for bottom fishers and buyers of long term options, or LEAPS. But for those whose rules prevent them from buying until we're out of our bear market and until weekly and daily charts say 'buy' may need to be a bit more patient. Technical indicators on EBAY's daily charts are giving buy signals. The weekly charts are still bearish. And the monthly charts turned bearish a couple of months ago. Point and figure charts suggest the stock is headed lower to about $21. What's interesting is that EBAY's options look cheap. Implied volatility of 0.392 is way below historical volatility of 0.671. And both implied and historical volatility are below their 12- and 24-month highs, although they look high compared with some other stocks. So traders who are at all optimistic that the bear market will end during the next 12 months and that eBay's stock will recover during the next 12 to 18 months might want to look at the EBAY Jan 2010 35 calls, which are trading for about $3.40 a share. That's about 12.5% of the current stock price of $27.24. Thus, call buyers are speculating that the stock is worth more than $38.40 a share, and there is a 55% probability that the stock will touch that price before the options expire. The trick, of course, is to manage losses. Where do you put the stop loss? A 8% drop in the stock price is $2.18 per share, or 64% of the option price. Since options are volatile, it often pays to let an option trade lose more than you would let a stock drop from the buy point before you'd sell it. If the stock drops with the overall market, be more patient. If it drops on bad EBAY news, I'd cut my losses as soon as possible. LEAPS options markets are thinly traded, which makes it difficult to take profits and to cut losses at the prices you want. EBAY's Jan. 2010 35 calls are relatively liquid with an open interest of 2,098 contracts, but only traded two contracts Wednesday and the bid of 2.80 is pretty far from the offer of 3.40. Typically, you give the market maker two thirds of the spread, which means you'd try to buy at $3.20. If you're a bear on EBAY, the EBAY Jan 2010 25 puts are $3.60 bid, $4.00 offered with an open interest of 2,275 contracts but virtually no trades nor liquidity. This means put buyers think the stock is going to about $21, or where the point and figure charts say they're headed.  Full Disclosure: I don't have a position in EBAY."

Craigslist, possibly feeling the heat, has extended their ads to last 30 plus days. Additionally Craigslist is so cluttered that one gets lost visiting the site. 
Many people still do not even know that Kijiji exists as advertising has been limited. However, Kijiji's clean interface and easy to use map make it a prime favorite to overtake Craigslist in the not too distant future. Now if only eBay can make money from the site. Note to eBay: Please at least start putting some display advertising on the site. If you wait too long, there will be too many users and we will start hearing the crying whining pains of ""We will boycott Kijiji if ads appear."" eBay is allocating a lot of resources to Kijiji. One can also say that eBay's 25% investment in Kijiji was used to learn the classified trade. Thus Ebay needs to monetize the site and soon."

I don't know wheter the posts on CNN.com are representative or not, but they make several things clear. eBay has a major trust problem with buyers and sellers. The negative viral demarketing has been and will continue to be devastating for eBay's stock, which is down sharply from last fall. Investors and speculators should pay a lot of attention to what eBay's customers are saying, because they're offering more market intelligence than any stock analyst ever could or would. The most important themes of the comments are that ratings of buyers and sellers can't be trusted, and there are a lot of dishonest sellers out there gaming the system. There also are dishonest buyers, but the sellers are frequent users and know much more about how to game the system and are more likely to than most buyers. That's why I've never bought nor sold on eBay. Another important theme is that eBay's customer service, which I've never experienced, is as bad as Paypal's, which I have. Here are some questions for businesses trading on eBay and for investors: 1. If you don't trust or like the eBay system, what are your alternatives? 2. How can you check out trading partners on eBay if you don't trust the rankings? 3. Is it better to setup an online store independent of eBay and use pay-per-click advertising on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Yahoo (YHOO) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) search? 4. If you're an eBay seller, how do you reassure potential buyers and protect yourself from the deadbeats? 5. Under eBay's new search algorithm, high-volume sellers' will be ranked ahead of the low-volume sellers. How can the low-volume sellers beat this system, and is the system fair? (High-volume customers get preferred treatment where ever you go.) 6. Does it pay to shop the auction sites for so called bargains, or would your time be better spent buying new and getting on with business? I've always bought new rather than mess with eBay much even though I""ve been a member for a long time and sometimes search eBay to check out prices. 7. As an investor, do you want to own a company with so many vocally unhappy customers? 8. Microsoft has thrived despite millions of unhappy customers. Can eBay? 9. Will the boycott work, given that similar efforts never have? 10. Will eBay have to change its operations? 11.

65640,21550,2008-02-22T02:38:08-05:00,,"In response to the big question, ""Will a week long boycott have an impact on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)?"" I have decided to respond with this article.   I am very curious where eBay ranks when it comes to the number of times they have been boycotted, compared to other companies. It seems every year eBay is being boycotted. Unfortunately, these boycotts have never worked. Analysts have debated this and have determined the reason is because it's a week-long strike. I have considered the reasons, and have determined that while an open-ended strike would have longer term effects, the main reason is that boycotts have been word of mouth, and without planning, strategy and a united front. In an interview last week, I was asked ""How can you tell if the boycott is working?"" Thanks to sites such as Powersellersunite.com we can see hourly updates as to how many auctions are live. For the most part, eBay was hovering in the 15-16 million listing range the weekend prior to the boycott. As word spread of the boycott, people began an early boycott, and listings fell below 13 million. On a conservative determination, we will call it 2 million auctions. eBay's lowest insertion fee is 20 cents. Based on that fee, eBay would have lost $400,000 just on listing fees alone. This does not include any extras that range in price for 15 cents for each addition photo, to double listing fees (which includes any extras used), bold lettering, borders around the listing, which adds $1 or $5 per listing (and again, if listed in two categories, that can be as much as $10) or any number of other extras. Just the minimal 20 cents and eBay is down $400,000. But, let's take a more realistic look at the bottom line. Insertion fees are as high as $4.80 for the typical auction. Autos, and real-estate are different. So, let's take a more average $1.20 listing fee, which is for the $25-49.99 pricing. Based on that fee, we still have not hit the real numbers of eBay's losses. But, it is still quite astonishing! At $1.20 for a conservative estimate of 2 million auctions eBay is down, that translates to $2.4 MILLION dollars. Again, these numbers do NOT reflect extras, that will certainly add an extra million or five. This number does not include the number of stores closed at $9.99 per month. Or those listing fees, Final Value Fees. Nor does this reflect the Final Value Fees of the auctions not listed. But, just the basics, what company is happy to lose a MINIMUM of 2.4 MILLION dollars a day? Usher Lieberman, media spokesperson for eBay was quoted as saying that the boycott had little effect, because they jumped from about 12 million auctions to 16 million auctions by Wednesday. True. But, what the spin does not show is at what cost? eBay had to do two promotions last week to get back to where they were before the word of mouth boycott efforts took effect. One of the promotions was to have a 20 cent listing day, which most items will end tomorrow. By doing this second promotion, eBay forfeits fees of up to $4.80 per listing. While most sellers take advantage of these promotions to list higher ticket items, not everyone is listing items over $500. Regardless, most items are definitely between $1.20 and $2.40 to list. My best guess is that eBay had to lose an average of $1.00-$2.20 to artificially inflate their numbers. By Usher's own words, that is about 4 million auctions, meaning it is realistic to conceive it cost eBay between 4.8 million dollars and $8.8 million dollars. Possibly more. But, a good number for ball-park figures. eBay can spin all they want. These numbers are just fast and ugly rough estimates, and they are minimal. What happens when eBay sees the 20 cent listings (that helped sellers list items before the strike took effect) fall off the charts? eBay is already down to the 14 million mark. By today it is conceivable that eBay will be at or under 10 million listings. NOW we are talking real money lost. 1.2 times 6 million a day is painful. Now, consider this. The boycott is simply because the community at large is opposed to the changes. Contrary to the spin, the majority of the eBay members are opposed to the announcements Donahoe is proposing. We DO agree things need to be shaken up. BUT, we do NOT agree that these changes are the answer. All Donahoe is doing is shifting the balance away from the sellers (leaving retaliatory feedback) to buyers who are already reportedly extorting sellers. Consider that this boycott could be avoided if eBay would just listen to the community as a whole, and not just the top 200 US sellers. eBay has been target of many boycotts before. But never has eBay been targeted BEFORE the incoming CEO has taken over. What eBay, and Mr. Donahoe, have to realize is that while they look to the past, unorganized, unsuccessful scattered boycotters with no direction, no purpose, no unity, we are uniting, becoming stronger and are purpose driven. Thanks to the MySpace.com/boycottebay pages and the http://forums.delphiforums.com/boycottebay/start forum, we are able to organize ourselves, and grow stronger each day. According to stats within the control panels, that venue alone is showing message views in excess of 10,000 over the weekend. Numbers that exceed only the most popular and long term forums. While Mr. Donahoe is not yet CEO, his leadership is angering many of the community, and far worse than outgoing Meg Whitman ever did. With a potential second boycott being planned, one has to wonder if Mr. Donahoe will slide by so easily, as being the reason eBay strikes twice within three to four months time. His already questioned incoming may lead investors to question his ability to turn things around. Well, we see he is turning things around. But, I don't think that is the direction investors are hoping for."

been rumored for years. Every time management makes a change, raises
fees or adds sponsored links, sellers say they will walk.I've
been following eBay since 1999 and I've seen and heard it all. Still
eBay continues to be the 800 lb. gorilla of e-commerce. So it didn't
surprise me when eBay sellers were once again on the warpath. Granted,
this time the unrest seems less about fees and more about the changes
to feedback; the perception is that eBay is taking away the ability for
sellers to protect their business. In fact, during a conference call Tuesday between PeSA members and eBay management, I did not hear one
question concerning fees; instead I heard about DSRs and Feedback.Sellers
are upset for many reasons, but in my view, many of them are concerned
that they are losing control of their businesses. I believe if sales
were great, they certainly wouldn't be complaining. (Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) exerts much
more control over their sellers, but they don’t complain as much
because they are selling a lot of products.) Profitable sales are hard to
come by on eBay and sellers are fighting very hard to maintain control
of their business. The feedback issue is just a symptom of the feeling
of helplessness. By not allowing a seller to leave a negative rating
for a buyer, sellers believe the buyers will hold them hostage. This
may not mean anything to those outside of the eBay ecosystem, but to
eBay sellers, Feedback is their reputation and you don't mess with their
reputation without a fight.So, once again, sellers are upset
and threatening to strike. I've never felt that a seller strike would
be very beneficial; especially a one-week strike. The one difference I
see with the seller unrest is that it's not just limited to one segment of
sellers. In August of 2006, eBay raised fees on Store sellers but left
Auction sellers alone. Earlier fee increases have affected one group
more than another, but this time eBay has messed with Feedback, the
most sacred aspect of eBay, and it affects every seller.So what
does all of this have to do with “Death by a Thousand Cuts?"" February
of 2008 is much different than August of 2006. In 2006 the options for
eBay sellers were limited to Amazon and a few small upstarts. Amazon
was just starting to expand their categories and open them up to 3P
sellers, so there were not very many places to go. Today is much
different; Amazon has expanded their 3P offerings, adding WebStore and
FBA in addition to opening up more categories. Those upstart companies,
that were around in 2006, have grown steadily and are much more viable
this time around and paid search isn't so scary to sellers any more.
Heck, they can even buy paid search ads on eBay that gives them more
exposure than eBay store listings.I came across a great article at Money.CNN.com entitled EBay rivals circle vulnerable auctions kingpin about
the many options available to eBay sellers today. What was interesting
were the numbers and trends these sites are seeing. Many of these sites
saw an increase in registrations around the time of the eBay
announcements. Sure, most of these sites are not seeing huge numbers in
real terms, but the combination of the number of available sites and
the measurable increases in registrations for each, begins to add up.
Blood is in the water and each of these sites is stepping up their
efforts to reach out to the unhappy eBay seller. “Death by a thousand
cuts” just means that not any one cut is fatal. In fact it may take a
thousand cuts to finish off the victim and all the while the victim
doesn't feel they are in danger, until it is too late.Lets start to counts the cuts: (Most data is from the article)Not one of these cuts will be fatal, but when you add them up they are beginning to drain the lifeblood of eBay, the seller. I'm
not predicting the imminent demise of eBay, but if they don't do
something quickly to stop the bleeding, they may find themselves as
just another marketplace and my guess is that this 800 lb. gorilla is going
to weight a lot less."

At least eBay still owns Skype and Skype is growing and contributing revenues while all of these other firms are up to their necks in billions of losses. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) invested in Countrywide (CFC) at $20 per share and is now buying Countrywide for $6 per share. How is that for an investment? Are we to trust these analysts on investment advice? Just think - if one of these analysts had asked their firms to stay away from subprime and buy Skype they would be lauded as geniuses on the Street today.   Additionally, to all those sellers who whined about eBay raising final value fees etc. - why don't you take some of the money you made from all of your sales on eBay and purchase eBay stock? It would have been a win win situation. These same sellers who whine about a nickel or dime increase are the same who are spending $5 for a cup of coffee, $7 for beer and $80 for dinner. What do these sellers do when their gym membership goes up by $50? Do they stop purchasing milk, orange juice etc? eBay is growing on all fronts: Stumbleupon, Kijiji, Rent.com, Skype, Stubhub, etc. Of course listings are down on the auction site because many listing are now fixed price and disappear quickly.

64402,20378,2008-02-13T04:38:09-05:00,,"In the midst of the ongoing turnaround of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) Marketplaces, it is easy to forget about eBay's crown jewel, PayPal. For PayPal, 2007 was arguably the most spectacular year in its entire history, with TPV growth of 32.5% over 2006. Even more impressive is that Y/Y growth on a quarterly basis accelerated in Q2, Q3 and Q4 - ending the year at 34.5%. This growth is due, in large part, to PayPal Merchant Services, which posted Y/Y growth in TPV of 65.9% in Q4, also the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. Despite an economic slowdown, 2008 is also set to be another great year with one very symbolic milestone. For the first time in the company’s history, Merchant Services TPV will outstrip eBay Marketplace TPV. In finally leaving behind the nest that has nurtured it for over a decade, PayPal is making itself less dependent on a single property and much more aligned with the global growth of e-commerce. In addition, eBay (or any potential bidder for that matter), can finally and seriously start to think about whether a spin-off makes sense. John Donahoe mentioned category-based pricing for media sellers as recently as 10 days ago at the Boston investor presentation. So while this week's announcement of price adjustments for the media category doesn't come as a surprise, it's still nice to see that eBay is actually listening and following through with sellers. Update: It seems the reaction to this announcement is very positive (for a change). See the posts from bloggers Scot Wingo, Randy Smythe, TameBay, and seller Kevin Harmon."
65117,20378,2008-02-19T05:12:36-05:00,,"Despite the long weekend in the United States, Skype still managed to break through the 12 million concurrent user mark. This new record comes only 42 days after breaking the 11 million concurrent user mark and represents another month of accelerating growth. While Q4 and Q1 have always been strong quarters for Skype, this latest milestone is further proof the 4.5 year old company is still in a period of hypergrowth and still the runaway leader in VOIP communication. With eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) new fee schedule coming into effect on Wednesday, there is at least one group of sellers calling for a week of sales boycott as a way of voicing their discontent. After all, even though the fee changes will result in lower average fees for eBay sellers as a whole, they do imply a fee increase for a small proportion of sellers. In fact, Steve Grossberg, President of Internet Merchants Association, claims that as many as 1/3rd of sellers could face a fee increase (although this estimate precedes eBay's readjustment of fees in the media category, which was the hardest hit by the changes). With the success of last week's 20 cent promotion boosting listings until February 20th and the new fee schedule thereafter, it will be difficult to determine the effect, if any, of a seller boycott. If past attempts are any indication however, it will be a moot point.  This is a spectacular illustration of the P/E compression that eBay has experienced over the past six years. The chart shows share price to trailing twelve month [TTM] earnings for each quarter since Q1 2002. We can see that on both a GAAP and Non-GAAP basis, eBay's trailing P/E has come down from triple digits to a record low of around 20x today (and into the teens if we were to take forward 2008 earnings). P/E ratio compression is expected as high growth companies mature and earnings growth comes down. In eBay's case, the compression has already led to a P/E ratio that is approximately on par with the much lower-growth broader market average. To the extent further P/E compression is limited and eBay continues to grow earnings faster than the broader market (not a very high bar), we can expect attractive share price performance going forward."

This is clearly one of eBay's core strengths as an integrated global e-commerce destination. With PayPal's expanded seller protection to 190 countries around the world, it will be interesting to see how cross-border trade evolves in 2008. Update: If you consider the new international PayPal seller protections together with a sustained weak U.S. dollar, this should provide a nice tailwind in 2008 for U.S. sellers. I don't think there is any other online destination in the world that can deliver international buyer traffic like eBay. Here is Jim Griff's take on the recent and controversial feedback changes. Griff is unsurprisingly in favor of the feedback changes, but his explanation has more information and history than some of the other explanations I have seen."

Now it appears that eBay is much more than “just a forum” and specializes in iPods that can be purchased anywhere. What happened to eBay's magic? John Donahoe gave it away.   His gross mismanagement of the site has resulted in an unprecedented erosion of listings as a direct result of Donahoe making one fatal mistake after another while trying to implement his “buyer experience” plan. Now he blames sellers for his failure and raised their fees. This did not go unnoticed and sellers are leaving. How did Donahoe break eBay? 1) Off site advertising competes with sellers. When Donahoe took away the free advertising premium store owners got and replaced it with off site advertising, a number of seller listings started looking like a toboggan run. When was the last time you saw Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) put Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) advertising on their site or Wal-Mart(NYSE:WMT) put ads on Target’s (NYSE:TGT) site? 2) He opted millions of buyers into guinea pig tests without their consent. These buyers vowed never to visit eBay again because tracking cookies were downloaded into their computers making escape difficult if not impossible. 3) The site is technically unstable. What buyer is going to tolerate a site where they are stalked by tracking cookies, links that don’t work, abundant page loading errors, page loads as slow as molasses if at all, and site issues that are never announced much less fixed? 4) Best Match doesn’t work! What buyer is going to search through thousands of meaningless search results just to find one item? There are literally thousands of complaints on eBay Discussion Boards because buyers can no longer find it, causing listings and sales to plummet. 5) Seller tools are broken. The shipping calculator doesn’t work because is not designed to calculate dimensional weights (a well kept eBay secret). Markdown manager never has worked and the ""sell your item"" form works intermittently at best. 7) Rolling server blackouts. Sellers pay for their listings to be shown 24/7 yet eBay selectively shows listings to predetermined regions of the country and blacks out all other areas. 8) Sellers are canceling Paypal accounts. Donahoe’s new “plan” includes a provision by which all a buyer need say is “I’M NOT HAPPY – GIVE ME A REFUND” and a 21 day hold is automatically placed on the seller's Paypal account – even after the purchase has been shipped.

62426,20378,2008-01-31T04:48:27-05:00,,"This week saw many changes at eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) flagship marketplace ebay.com.
And as with all changes to fees and policies, certain groups benefit
more than others. So while it's no surprise to see mixed reactions, it
is always important to focus on the ecosystem as a whole. Lets look at
the major marketplace changes around the four areas of pricing, seller
standards, feedback, and search - for a full list see eBay's announcement board.
Note these changes are for the U.S. site only. Other marketplace sites
have also introduced similar but country-specific changes.Two big changes.  The first is the much rumored rebalancing of fees with lower insertion fees and higher final value fees.  The second is making gallery absolutely free.  CEO John Donahoe
made it clear the net take-rate for eBay will actually drop on a
like-to-like basis, so regardless of how anybody spins the announcement,
for the marketplace as a whole, this is a fee decrease. But much more
important, it better aligns eBay's fees with seller success.Of
course, there are a few categories that benefit more than others. In
particular, some low ASP sellers, that don't use gallery in the first
place, may actually feel disadvantaged by the changes. But overall, I
think these pricing changes are a big positive for everyone - eBay
included.eBay is making the minimum standards for selling on the site more
stringent. A small percentage of the poorest sellers will have to deal
with decreased listings exposure in search, and will be forced to offer PayPal
or a major credit card as payment options. There will still be a place
for this type of seller, just not top, front and center as it has been
in the past. Again, while some sellers, who risk falling into this
category, will certainly complain, the overall community will benefit
from increased customer satisfaction.This
is possibly the most controversial change at eBay. Going forward,
sellers will only be able to leave positive feedback for buyers (at the
seller's option). At first, this may seen completely irrational. But
eBay has good reasons for doing this.First and foremost, eBay
wants feedback to be honest. In its current form, buyers are discouraged
from leaving negative feedback for fear of retaliatory negative
feedback. And when retaliatory feedback happens, it not only puts the
buyer off the seller, it puts them off eBay as a whole. So in this
respect, the change is positive and frees buyers to give honest
opinions.Some sellers have complained buyers can now hold them
'hostage' and make unreasonable demands. This sounds extreme to me but,
in any case, it is the same for all buyers, so the relative ratings
still become more meaningful within the ecosystem. And on top of that,
eBay is taking a number of steps to protect sellers from inaccurate
feedback.Best-Match
is going to become the default sort method site-wide in March. This is
a massive change that I have covered in the past. The difference this
time is that eBay has specifically said that since it started
testing it as a search option, it has seen that Best Match helps
buyer conversion more than any of our other sort methods. This is
excellent news for everyone (myself included) that doubted the
effectiveness of Best-Match. This is also more evidence that eBay is
moving towards a fixed-price environment."
62417,20378,2008-01-31T04:03:22-05:00,,"It seems research analysts are as divided about eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) as the readers of
this blog. Here are the post Q4 research opinions and targets where
available. The
changes are a step in the right direction,but more work is needed to
revive the core business. These guys are going to have to become more
like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). We expect no insertion fees eventually on some categories.
But they can't shock the marketplace too soon.At
this time, we view the investment positives as reasonably balanced
against investment risks. Investment positives include: 1) Secular
growth of e-commerce; 2) Strong international presence with 50% of
revenues from outside the U.S.; 3) Leading platform position in most
international countries; and 4) An increasingly diverse revenue base,
including a very robust PayPal segment. Investment negatives include:
1) Market share losses/heightened competition in core marketplace
business; 2) Softening consumer risk to growth outlook; 3) Uncertainty
related to initiatives geared towards revitalizing U.S./Germany growth.The
price changes - rather than saving sellers money - actually will cost
them dearly. Sellers who specialize in items under $40, in particular,
will end up paying eBay more and likely will flock to rival Amazon.com.
As opposed to dramatically lowering listing fees (and almost completely
aligning its business model with those of sellers), the company appears
to have dramatically raised fees again."

According to the press release: The acquisition of Fraud Sciences fits into eBay’s recently announced plans to significantly improve trust and safety across its sites in 2008. “Integrating Fraud Sciences’ risk tools with PayPal’s sophisticated fraud management system should allow us to be even more effective in protecting eBay and PayPal’s hundreds of millions of customers around the world,” said Scott Thompson, President of PayPal.
This acquisition highlights Israel’s technological superiority in the security and fraud sector, and that big global firms are turning to Israel to provide technological solutions, instead of developing the solutions internally. Israeli firms should continue to benefit from this move to R&D outsourcing. As soon as we get some stability in the public markets, I would expect to see some very big deals concerning Israeli companies."

Here is a very 'back of the envelope' buyout game plan. 1) Acquire eBay for $40 per share or $54 billion. Nearly a 40% premium over current prices. I think this would just be enough to walk away successful. 2) Distribute the $5 billion in existing cash and complete leveraged recap of another $10 billion. That's still a conservative debt level for a company with ebya's cash flows. (net equity investment $39 billion) 4) Sell PayPal for $20 billion. Could consider both private sale as well as spin-off. In any case, buyers would be lining out the door. (net equity investment $19 billion) 5) Sell Skype for $4 billion. Less than 10x revenue for the undisputed world leader in VOIP communication. I think very achievable. (net equity investment $15 billion0 6) Sell global classifieds network for $4 billion. A network larger than craigslist, this is probably aggressive but look at the growth rates. (net equity investment $11 billion) 7) Sell stakes in MercadoLibre and Craigslist for $1 billion. This is small fish but makes sense to monetize as soon as possible. (net equity investment $10 billion) I know that's a lot of work and perhaps includes generous valuations (give or take a few billion). But the point is that a buyer could potentially end the year with less than $10 billion of equity investment for the core eBay Marketplace business (which would still generate close to $2 billion FCF a year) and focus exclusivly on turning the business around.  In an effort to efficiently manage a mix of auction and fixed-price listings, eBay is testing an early prototype of a split-screen user interface. The auction listings on the left are sorted by 'time: ending soonest' while the fixed-price items on the right are sorted by the new 'best match' method. With fixed-price listings now comprising nearly half of all eBay listings, I think an approach such as this would make a lot of sense. Update: This is not some sort of secret screenshot violating NDAs and the like. It is taken from eBay's January road show presentation."

So anyway, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) today announced that. PayPal has agreed to acquire Fraud Sciences for $169 million in cash. According to the press release, ""Fraud Sciences’ risk tools and analytics are expected to enhance eBay and PayPal’s proprietary fraud management systems and accelerate the development of next generation fraud detection tools. The acquisition of Fraud Sciences fits into eBay’s recently announced plans to significantly improve trust and safety across its sites in 2008.""Most importantly, ""key personnel from Fraud Sciences, including Yossi Barak, Fraud Sciences’ COO, and founders Shvat Shaked and Saar Wilf, will join the company’s technology and fraud management teams. Gadi Maier, Fraud Sciences' President and CEO, will provide strategic and operational support to the company during the integration period.""eBay have always provided conservative guidance but this time around they have truly outdone themselves. For example, lets take eBay's 2008 revenue guidance of $8.500 to $8.750 billion. This would imply 2008 organic revenue growth of 11%-14%. Now, lets look at where eBay's revenue is currently coming from. If we take Q4 2007 and make a few guesstimates for StubHub and Non-GMV businesses (Classifieds, Advertising and Comparison Shopping), we can arrive at the following revenue sources.Even if we calculate a disaster scenario of 0% growth in all eBay branded properties, and very conservative growth of 20% at PayPal, 50% at Skype and StubHub, and 80% in non-GMV businesses, I still get 14%+ growth overall. In the end, I suppose it is more important for Donahoe to comfortably exceed guidance in his first year and declare victory, than it is to risk falling short of high expectations. At least that is what Donahoe was most likely thinking in signing off the 2008 guidance that he will be responsible for delivering."

Fraud Sciences is has developed online risk management tools over
the course of five years, creating propitiatory technology that
identifies fraudulent transactions and suspicious bidders before they
impact, with high rates of accuracy. The company offered its customers
insurance against Internet fraud - if Fraud Sciences failed to detect
the attack in time, the customer was guaranteed his money back. Not
bad. For PayPal and eBay, the acquisition is expected to enhance their
proprietary fraud management systems and accelerate the development of
next generation fraud detection tools.Fraud Sciences was founded in 2001 by Shvat Shaked (NYSEMKT:CTO) and Saar Wilf, both former employees of Trivnet (Wilf was also the founder of Trivnet).
Both founders will join PayPal’s technology and fraud management teams
along with Yossi Barak (NYSE:COO) - although they won’t need to worry about
money. According to some estimates, Shaked and Wilf will clear 20-25 million dollars each from the deal with eBay.
Fraud Sciences had only received $11 million dollar in two rounds of funding
raised by Eli Barkat from BRM Capital ($5M), US-based Redpoint Ventures
($2M) and other US and Israeli seed investors, including Guy Gamzu. BRM
Capital held 40% of Fraud Sciences and effectively made 12 times the
original investment - about $70 million in cash. The rest of the
proceeds ($30-40M) will be divided between the company’s employees and
the remaining investors.In the official press release, Scott Thompson, President of PayPal said:This is another impressive exit made by an Israeli firm, third in
one month.  The acquisition, which is subject to the satisfaction of

selling standards and dangling carrots in front of sellers to move more
volume. The effort is new CEO John Donahoe’s first move in an effort to
boost eBay’s growth.Donahoe, technically president and CEO elect until March 31,
unveiled the changes, which are designed to improve “the overall
experience for eBay customers.” The crux of eBay’s problem is making it
more easy to shop. Safety is also a concern.Among the big changes outlined in a statement:Listing fees: eBay is cutting its listing fees by
25 percent to 50 percent. The fee changes will vary by country. To
offset, eBay is increasing fees it charges when something is sold–so
called final value fees. The goal is to get sellers to list more and
align interests–eBay benefits when sellers get success. eBay also wants
more pictures on its site and is eliminating gallery fees.More stringent selling requirements: eBay said it
is “making its minimum standards more stringent.” In other words,
sellers will have a tougher time charging high shipping fees and
posting these great descriptions when the goods are crap. eBay will
cull sellers with poor ratings from its search tool.Power sellers will face new requirements: eBay said
it is raising the bar to be considered a power seller. If you hit those
requirements, eBay will give you fee discounts, “better payment
protection from PayPal,” and more search exposure. What this change means: eBay is trying to reward good behavior.eBay will update its feedback system to encourage more trading. Details on this change were sparse.It’s a good start, but the jury is out on whether it’ll work. These changes were already reflected in eBay’s financial outlook for 2008."

Under Meg Whitman, the company’s growth since 2001 has been remarkably steady, both in terms of traffic and revenue growth. The chart below shows U.S. Quarterly Unique Visitors and U.S. Quarterly Revenue, including data from revenue-producing subsidiaries PayPal (acquired July 2002), Skype (October 2005) and StubHub (February 2007).Lest anyone doubt that traffic is the life-blood of eBay (like most consumer internet companies) note that the correlation between Unique Visitors and revenue is an astounding 94%.Performance has been remarkably steady in terms of traffic and revenue. However, in the past couple of years, traffic growth has been a bit choppy while revenue has accelerated steeply. Here is eBay’s U.S. Revenue per Unique Visitor since Q2 2001. The “Competers” highlight the gains from previously mentioned acquisitions.Revenue per Unique Visitor is a key meter of sales efficacy and eBay’s current R/UV is at a record high of $12.65, up from $7.92 seven years ago. Most of that gain in sales efficiency has come in the past couple of years from initiatives like the well-received Fixed Price option and raised fees for sellers.If eBay can successfully execute on the vision that CEO Donahue laid out last week, which will “make eBay an easier and safer place to shop,” Unique Visitor growth will return to a steady trajectory, and revenue should continue to accelerate."
61813,20726,2008-01-28T08:11:41-05:00,,"Last week, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) announced a rather lackluster earnings report citing several factors for the miss. In addition, the long acting CEO Meg Whitman will also step down, making room for new ideas that may help to stop the ongoing share decline. If you were one of the unlucky ones who bought the stock in January 2004, you could be sitting on a whopping 54% loss. That translates to an 85% increase from this level in order to break even.The timing of her departure could not be any worse. It translates to more like an “exit, stage right,” than a graceful departure towards a comfortable retirement. It may be a signal to shareholders that there are more problems that lurk beneath the surface and an indication that this earnings report is simply the horns blaring from the bell-buoy warning ships of the imminent danger ahead.There is no doubt that eBay has been an amazing success story and a pioneer in the online auction business. Unfortunately, the way that you can recognize a pioneer is usually from the arrows in their back.When a company invents successfully, you can be sure that fierce competition will soon follow. While eBay has cornered the market for online auctions since their inception, today there are several competitive alternatives such as uBid and even Bidz.com. In addition, what may not be so apparent is the fact that there has been a focused trend toward developing auction sites that do not seem to “look” or “feel” like auctions. The fact is that some people cannot bear the anxiety of the bid-wait-bid-wait-bid-bid-outbid-wait-bid/won or lost process.Online giants, Amazon.com, MSN Shopping and Yahoo! Shopping each have person-to-person stores that are very similar to the eBay, Buy It Now program. In reality, eBay auctions that use Buy It Now are no different than any of the non-auction online stores. The seller prices the item and if a buyer wants that item, he or she will pay the stated price. There is no bidding, haggling or negotiations.Then, there is the matter of the very successful PayPal division, which was acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Now, its dominance is also being challenged. In an apparent move to steal market share, Google’s checkout is waiving transaction fees through February 1, 2008. So, online merchants that decide to use Google Checkout rather than Paypal will not pay related transaction fees. Adding insult is Google’s offer to merchants that provides $10 in Google Checkout credit for every $1 spent through AdWords campaigns.Perhaps, more concerning than competition from Google is the ongoing infiltration of scam artists that are upsetting the fine balance of trust between buyer and seller. These range from the well-documented online gangs that pilfer retail establishments and re-sell stolen goods to the international crime rings that attempt to hijack sales by posing as well-rated buyers. The latter group will attempt to close auctions early and send false PayPal payment information in an attempt to obtain free goods. (See TDI “Crime and eBay – Recipe for a Short Position” 3/19/07 and “eBay Follow up – Still Coming Up Short” 6/11/07)The latest revelations that eBay’s competition is to blame for the continuing bad news can be found within the earnings release, as Reuters reports:In an economic environment that will see more people looking for ways to enhance their revenues from alternative sources, eBay should be doing much better. Even Whitman states this obvious point, yet there is something much greater at work here as the company is coming up short in a time that they should be raking it in.The stock could be headed for more trouble if management cannot prevent the interference of auctions due illicit activity that has become more common as the Internet continues to become an online playground for international scam artists, particularly with regard to high-ticket electronic. Unfortunately, it has been reported that nothing seems to be too precious to sell at auction, including body parts, ivory and several other unsavory items.In an exit interview with TechCrunch, Meg Whitman maintained her cavalier attitude with regard to the questionable Skype acquisition and only cited disappointment with her career as not being able to do a better job with Japan:In a few years, when we have the advantage of hindsight, eBay’s stock price may be as much as $10 lower if they are unable to curtail the international interception schemes seemingly spreading like a cancer in their auction business. One thing is for sure, the timing on Meg’s departure seems right.What to do from here? Buying seems to be a mistake unless management can show some plan of turnaround. Investors could consider a short position or purchasing a put contract close to the money. If you are long, consider hedging with either covered-calls or puts.

62236,21439,2008-01-30T06:31:54-05:00,,"Here are some selected seller feedbacks/highlights from eBay's e-commerce forum held this week in Washington.
Ok we were just on a 30 min break and the buzz was definitely very positive around the PayPal seller protection improvements.  The elimination of limits, confirmed addresses and international expansion are a big win for sellers.
The negative buzz is around the fee changes.  Many feel calling it a decrease isn't really the case. Let's dig into this.
I have talked about three general buckets of eBay sellers.  Here they are again for reference:
Media seller reaction:
Auction traditionalist
The auction traditionalist seem to be falling into two buckets:
   Fixed price seller:
The next topic of concern is definitely the changes to feedback. The doomsday scenario I've heard is that buyers will now have all the power on the site and hold sellers hostage for positive feedbacks/DSRs.  More on this later as eBay expands on the changes and it settles in.Q: What do you think about today's [Tuesday's] announcements:
S1 - generally happy
GVH - feedback, not sure if negative or positive
S2 - feedback is very concerning.
FP - I got hit with fee increase and VERY concerned about the power the new feedback rules put in the hands of buyers.
Q: Moviegoods.com - I've cut store listings with 30k store items
A: GVH - we use store listings as an added chance at selling something.
Q: This is for GVH, you guys are 4.6/4.7 on DSRs, can you get your DSR up?
A: GVH - no, I don't think we'll get to 4.8, feels like free ship required.
Q: Is there a better time shoeA sells better than shoeB?
A: GVH: evenings are the best, some day time activity.
Q: (from MattL) Do you publish your shipping and handling policies?
A: Free shipping gets 4.8/4.9
****Ah, Seller1 is Michael@gainesville coins [GC] and Seller2 is Stephen@ Thrilling Audio [TA]
(Audience getting kind of worked up over shipping+handling DSRs, lots of rumbling and agitating).
Sellers at mic:
Q: I have a 4.8 on shipping and have free insurance and shipping.
(nxt) Q: There's no way we should be accountable or have to explain what we charge for shipping!
Q: Debbie@snappy - we found when people leave feedback they don't remember, so the closer to feedback time you can touch them, the better. You can try to put something in the box that says 'we take great care to package everything,' etc.
A: TA - we do do that and send the fees with the feedback request email.
Q: How do you nudge people to your website? 
A: GC - websites are expensive
GVH - we prefer website sales.
Q: How do you drive sales to your website?
How do you look at multi-channel?
GVH: Let customers know.
TA - we use google adwords and flyers
FP - we have tons of content on our website
Q: DSR Shipping question - some guy said in the last presentation said that his international feedback DSRs were lower. How did he know?
A: ML - Bill told me that international is lower than US, we shared it with him.  We are looking into how we can get more info on feedback.
ML - think about these as starting points.
Day Two general session that is Q+A about the changes announced Tuesday am.  On stage we have CEO John Donahue, Cobb (retiring), Rajiv (new eBay leader) , Scott (new PayPal leader) and Lorrie Norrington (fills in for Bill).
Q: With the FVF on the < $25 tier increasing to 8.25%, will lots of items leave the site?
A: The intent is to listen to you and decrease insertion fees so you have more back-end fees vs. front-end.
Q: What are you doing to bring more buyers?
A: Lorrie: we want to really retain buyers, how do we in get them to do more (mentioned couponing). 
Q: Raise your hands if you hit 4.8
A: About 10-20 hands went up.
Follow-up: You missed the number.
Q: 66% of PS'ers  have 4.6 or above 15% of PS'ers have 4.8 on all DSRs
F: We have members that offer free shipping, but have 4.7 DSR on S+H
A: Sellers that get 4.8 and above are being very clear in their listings, vs. offering free S+H
Q: If I have free shipping, why wouldn't eBay put in an auto 5.0 for me on S+H DSR?
A: (Stephanie T) We are listening and looking at that.
Q: (emovieposter) I'm a .99 no reserve seller, I have 100% feedback, I have 10x feedback repeat business.  I'm seeing a big increase in fees from these changes. The other .99 sellers, jayandmarie/hessfine are going up as well.
A: We like how you sell on eBay and want you on the site. (Rajiv echoed)
Q: simon sunshine electronics - Thanks for the changes.  I understand that if we take care of the customer, you'll help us.  International customers are killing us on DSRs. Did you consider handicapping DSRs for intl sales?
A: LN - This goes back to expectation setting.  Those that are setting expectations clearly are able to move their DSRs up.  If we learn from data that we have an unfair penalty for cross-border-trade that would be great.
Q:Izzy 9000 positive fb.  As seller, where is the trust?  Person wins, does UPI, buyer responds 'who cares', leaves seller a negative.  Seller out FVF and gets a neg/dsr hit
A: LN - If you report a buyer, we'll take care of nuking the neg and comments"

is going to be a crazy week.  The big eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) e-commerce forum commences
this evening in Washington DC and runs through mid-day Wednesday.
Unless you've been living under a rock, you've heard that they are set
to announce major changes to the eBay marketplace.  They've said for
sure we'll hear about fees, and then there have been some hints, like this NYT piece,
something major (and beyond Finding 2.0 it seems) with the eBay search
engine.  The hints point to some kind of magical new way for
fixed-price and auction to live together in a blissful BestMatch
harmony.  Hmm, sounds too good to be true?  Also on the conference call
there were some hints about trust and safety changes coming too.If you've been reading the blog for a while, you're familiar with my
""3 F's to fix eBay: Finding, Fees and Fraud"".  Well it sounds like they
are going to be doing something in all three buckets this week.  You wanted change - you got it! (gulp)"
61483,21382,2008-01-24T17:05:00-05:00,,"I just got off the phone with Meg Whitman, eBay’s departing CEO, and John Donahoe, her successor. Whitman talks about her biggest successes (going global and buying Paypal) and her biggest mistake (losing Japan), gets a dig in at Skype’s founders, and ruminates about whether Facebook can become a platform for commerce. Donahoe talks about eBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) renewed focus on fixed-price items, its commitment to distribute listings across the Web, and how he sees those listings as a huge advertising inventory. Here is the interview: Q: If you had to pick one thing you did over the past decade, what was your best move?Meg Whitman: I would say that the best move was that Pierre’s idea was a really good idea: using the Web to empower regular people and small businesses to do commerce. For me, the international expansion of eBay was the best idea. We are now in 35 countries, and have a huge global network. The second best one was the acquisition of PayPal—the wallet on eBay.  Q: What was your biggest mistake?Whitman: I am not one for regrets, but I still regret we don’t have a presence in Japan.  Q: What about buying Skype?Whitman: We liked Skype and still like Skype as a standalone business—a $400 million, four-year-old. Skype is doing more business as a four-year-old than eBay, Yahoo (YHOO), or even Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) did. We saw potential synergies between Skype and eBay. The next year or so will prove out if we were right. We’ve only had our management team in there for three months. Prior to that we had the founders, who are brave individuals, but were motivated by the earn-out.  Q: If you were starting out at eBay now in 2008 instead of 1998, what would you do differently?Whitman: Guess what? The world changes. eBay has defined e-commerce. But John recognizes we are going to in many ways reinvent eBay.John Donahoe: Buyers and sellers have more choices and higher expectations than in 1998, but the guiding principles are the same—the best values, the widest and most abundant selection, and a fun shopping experience. We will make it easier and safer to shop on eBay. The second thing we are going to do is build on this fabulous auctions business that is unique and is the best format for many items. But we have used an auction approach for fixed price. We are not optimized to get those values in fixed price. Time-ending-soonest makes sense in auctions, but does not surface the best items in fixed price.  Q: eBay, along with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Yahoo, is now one of the elder statesmen of the Web. Do destination sites matter anymore?Whitman: My view is that, just as in many businesses, brands really matter. There will always be a role for destination sites. Eighty million users come to our destination. I think that will be the vast majority of our future business. That said, we must be in distributed commerce in the future, taking listings for auctions and Shoppng.com and distributing them to other sites. If they are not going to come to us, we are going to come to them. We are not at all averse to distributed commerce.Donahoe: In many ways, our buyers will lead us there. We are making it much easier to bring eBay listings to your Facebook page, Myspace page, and shopping listings to various sites. eBay’s unique inventory offers better alternative [than other sources].Whitman: Here is the interesting thing that I wonder about. You look at the tremendous success of Facebook. To my mind there is not a lot of commerce going on in these social networking sites. eBay is a community anchored in commerce. It is a commerce site that built a community around it. What has not been proven is if the reverse can happen and people will go to community sites to do commerce.Donahoe: In payments, we are enabling faster checkout and easier payment on thousands of Websites off of eBay. In reputation, we think that reputation is something we can increasingly outtake.Whitman: We wonder if there is a way to embed reputation into Paypal. Is there a way to travel across the Web with your Paypal wallet and some other aspect of reputation?  Q: Do you want to get into the advertising game?Donahoe: You could say we are already in the advertising game with millions of listings a day and expanding that with other advertising on eBay and off. We have our Yahoo and Google partnerships and we will continue to find ways to get our listings out there."
61708,20378,2008-01-27T05:02:41-05:00,,"Kijiji U.S. continues to be on fire. Only 72 days after reaching 200,000 listings, the U.S. site has now reached 300,000 listings (that's over 750% annualized growth). Kijiji's U.S. business is still only a small part of the Kijiji network, with France, Canada and Germany being the leading franchises. However, given the potential size of eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) home territory, it's fantastic to see this kind of momentum. As I have asked on previous occasions, I wonder what Craig Newmark is thinking? eBay already own 25% of craigslist and the Kijiji platform is slowly gaining market share in the U.S.  I have been asked by a few people why Marketplaces growth decelerated so much in Q4 when it had shown signs of improvement in Q3. As you know, the 21.3% Marketplaces growth in Q4 was below my expectations and, together with the light guidance, the reason for the market's concern. I have broken down where the 21% growth in Q4 is coming from, and compared it to where it was coming from in Q3. If we do this, the most alarming difference is a drop of 10 points from conversion rates and ASPs. There are two reasons for this. The first is that eBay's promotions encouraged a higher number of listings, and the simple economics of increasing supply more than demand has an downward effect of price. The second reason, as mentioned by eBay on the earnings call, was the relative lack of the must-have new-release consumer electronics items that we saw last year. That drove up ASPs in Q4 of 2006 and was therefore a difficult comparison for Q4 2007. The other drags on growth were some pricing pressure from the promotions (3 points of growth) and lower contribution from China/Taiwan and StubHub operations (4 points of growth). On the flip side, we had a large boost from new listings (9 points of growth) which should continue (and get much larger) throughout the year."

eBay CFO Bob Swan says the company’s cautious outlook on the economic
environment and how it will impact consumer spending was one of several
reasons for guidance this afternoon that came up short of Street expectations.Swan said the company continues to see “great momentum” at PayPal
and its advertising and classified business. But he also said the
company expects the rate of growth in e-commerce to slow in 2008 from
2007. As I reported earlier, eBay sees full year revenue of $8.5
billion to $8.75 billion, with pro forma EPS of $1.63 to $1.67. The
Street has been looking for $9.02 billion in revenue and $1.66. The
revenue guidance represents growth of 11%-14%.Swan notes that eBay had a “great” fourth quarter, with revenue over
$2 billion for the first time, up 27% year-over-year, and EPS of 45
cents, well above guidance. He notes that they company had strength in
all of its major businesses, and bought back $300 million of stock.But the focus for investors is on the disappointing guidance - as
well as changes the company is making in its listing fees. Swan says
the company is about to start rolling out announcements of changes in
its fee structure in various markets; Swan says they will take 4-6
weeks to implement. The basic idea is that the company is reducing
insertion fees, but raising final value fees. In other words, it will
be cheaper to list stuff on eBay, but it will cost you a bit more for
completed transactions. The idea: move more risk onto eBay and away
from its sellers. Swan says the changes will result in a “modest”
reduction in the company’s take rate - the percentage of the gross
merchandise value that eBay gets to keep.The point, he says, is to insure that sellers have better economics
than anywhere else on the Web. (What he didn’t say, but obviously
meant, is someplace like Amazon.com.) For shoppers, he says, the goal
is to make sure they can find more “well-price inventory” than anyplace
else online.In after hours trading Wednesday, eBay was down $1.43, or 4.9%, to $27.51."

61647,20521,2008-01-25T07:35:43-05:00,,"The big news this week was eBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) CEO change. Meg Whitman retired, and John Donahoe will be taking her place. There is wide-spread skepticism about John Donahoe’s choice as the successor to Meg Whitman. We just completed a comprehensive analysis of eBay’s business and a comparative analysis of eBay vs. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). After Wednesday’s closing bell, eBay came out with a stronger than expected Q4 results. During the quarter total revenues stood at $2.18 billion, up 27% Y-O-Y and 15% sequentially, driven by strong holiday sales and robust performance at PayPal, Skype and StubHub. Operating income in Q4 was $755 million, which is a growth of 31% Y-O-Y. PayPal, however, will need to watch Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) CheckOut and BillMeLater, which Amazon has endorsed. Skype should be divested. Adjusted Net Profit was $611 million in Q4, and EPS was $0.45, which is an increase of 45% Y-O-Y. Its operating margin increased to 34.6% in Q4, from 33.4% in 4Q06. The company ended the year with over $5 billion in cash. It generated $665 million in free cash flow. Overall, my assessment is that eBay should reduce its dependency on Google for customer acquisition. It should also acquire some product search engines that offer good user experiences, along with customer acquisition. It has enough cash to build up an arsenal of product search engines that gives it more control over the entry point to the web. More than 65% of the company’s revenue comes from the marketplaces segment, where revenue growth slowed to 21.3% Y-O-Y, and ended at $1.5 billion in Q4. The site attracted around 80 million visitors during the holiday season, and registered over $16.2 billion of GMV a Y-O-Y increase of 12.3%. Shopping.com, classifieds and advertising grew 26%, 182%, and 104% Y-O-Y during the quarter signaling successful diversification in the company’s marketplaces business segment. Its outlook is soft as the core auctions business continues to slow. Amazon is luring power-sellers away. Rajiv Dutta, the head of this division, will need to figure out why, and how to stop the exodus. 54% of its marketplace revenues came from outside the U.S., and were driven by a robust growth in international listings. Global Active users for marketplaces grew 2% Y-O-Y to 83.2 million. Total listings were up 4% Y-O-Y at 637 million, and international listings were up 5% Y-O-Y. PayPal’s revenues grew 35% Y-O-Y to $563 million in Q4, and it has a 8% marketshare in global online transactions. Active registered accounts at PayPal increased 16% Y-O-Y to 57.3 million. PayPal reached a global penetration rate of 54% on eBay. The company is leveraging technology to minimize transaction losses. Net TPV (Transaction Payment Volume) grew 66% at merchant services. Net number of payments were up 22% Y-O-Y to 203.9 million. Its transaction revenue rate was almost flat at 3.84%, and transaction loss rate improved significantly to 0.27% from 0.43% a year ago. Revenues at communications segment (Skype) grew 76% Y-O-Y to $115 million driven by the launch of Skype phone. Skype had a total of 276 million users, a growth of 61% Y-O-Y. Skype to Skype minutes grew 26% to 11.9 billion minutes. Total SkypeOut minutes were 1.6 billion in 4Q a growth of 10%. For the full year revenues at eBay rose 29% to $7.67 billion, and non-GAAP net income was $2.11 billion or $1.53 per diluted share. It generated over $2.18 billion in free cash flow in 2007. The company has guided for revenues of $2.0 - $2.05 billion in 1Q08 and $8.5 - $8.75 billion in 2008, which were below the street’s expectation and the stock was down over 8% in after hours trading. Non-GAAP EPS is forecasted to be $1.63 - $1.67. Operating margin is expected to be 32%. The stock is currently trading at $27.13 with a market cap of $36.75 billion and 52 week range of $26.02 - $40.73. I’m afraid I cannot recommend that you buy this stock, especially not until I hear some concrete thoughts from Donahoe on how he plans to address eBay’s rather hairy issues."

After a decade at the helm, eBay CEO Meg Whitman is preparing to retire, reports the WSJ (subscr. req.). John Donahue, the president of eBay Marketplace, who was trotted out on a press tour about a month ago, is said to be the front-runner to be the next CEO. During most of Whitman’s tenure, eBay seemed unstoppable. But the network effects that made it so powerful in the Web 1.0 era began to dissipate as destination sites began to lose some of their appeal. Now that people want to bring the Web to them—to their blog or MySpace or Facebook page—eBay needs to adapt to the new realitiesIt is not for lack of trying (see the bungled Skype acquisition). The old network effects still have a mighty pull, and generate a lot of money for eBay. Whitman maintained eBay’s dominant position in online auctions. But it just seems less and less relevant today. Here is a ten-year stock chart. During the last two years, eBay has lost about half its value. Not a great note to leave on."

that CEO Meg Whitman is planning to retire - the Street is expressing
some fresh worries about the outlook for the online auction giant.RBC Capital’s Jordan Rohan Tuesday cut his price
target on the stock to $37 from $44, and trimmed his estimates on the
company. Rohan’s 2008 EPS estimate goes to $1.62 from $1.68; for 2009
he’s now at $1.85, down from $1.96. Rohan says he would view Whitman’s
retirement as a slight positive, “as the pace of strategic change could
accelerate after her departure.” Rohan, who has a Sector Perform rating on the stock, says there are
four factors that could make him turn more positive on the stock:
Rohan says eBay has big changes coming. He expect the company to cut
insertion fees, revamp its search algorithm, introduce
category-specific pricing and offer volume discounts to sellers.Meanwhile, American Technology Research analyst Tim Boyd Tuesday upped his Q4 estimate by a penny to 42 cents, from 40 cents. But
he also reduced his 2008 estimate to $1.68 from $1.70, and 2009 to
$1.98 from $2. The estimate cuts reflect “the deteriorating outlook for
U.S. and European consumer spending.” And he says guidance could come
in even lower than his newly reduced estimates, given the company’s
tendency to provide conservative forecasts. On the other hand, Boyd
says he “cannot recall a time in the post-Bubble era when sentiment on
EBAY shares has been worse.” Ergo, he thinks the stock offers “an
attractive, contrarian trading opportunity.”Deutsche Bank’s Jeetil Patel Tuesday repeated his
Sell rating on the stock, but cut his price target to $24 from $30. He
says that “challenging buyer demand, escalating seller economics, lack
of reinvestment, near declines in transaction volumes and potential
operating margin pressures all represent key challenges at eBay.”Jeffrey Lindsay, of Bernstein Research, Tuesday wrote
that Whitman retiring would be a net positive for the company. While
she has “overseen incredible growth,” Lindsay says, Whitman has been in
her current role for a decade and “is likely ready for her next
personal challenge.”But Lehman’s Douglas Anmuth isn’t so sure this is
good news. “The potential change would come at a critical point in
eBay’s turnaround process as the company is looking to reaccelerate the
core auction business, possibly through dramatic fee changes and amid
broader macro concerns,” he writes. “We believe a potential change at
the top will put near-term pressure on eBay’s shares and potentially
raise concerns about the progress and timing of eBay’s core auction
reacceleration.”Tuesday, EBAY was down $1.08, or 3.8%, at $27.25."
60815,20378,2008-01-20T09:44:48-05:00,,"Bear Stearns analyst Robert Peck Thursday upgraded eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) to Outperform from Peer perform, saying investor concerns over competition from the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are overdone. He provides a $36 price target for 2008. ""At historical valuation lows, we believe that eBay's issues have been overly accounted for and that the investor pendulum has swung too far toward fear,"" Peck said. ""We believe that there are several catalysts to drive the stock in the near term, including a new fee structure for sellers next week,"" he adds.
Peck downgraded eBay only two months ago. Usually I am cynical of such short-term changes of heart without even a new financial release in between. But given Peck's argument is mostly about valuation, and eBay has shed 20% since his last report, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.
For now, you can download Peck's report here.
This upgrade reminded me of my 'Even Bears are Bulls' theme. Having read Peck's work, he is actually a bear at heart (unless he is being ultra conservative just to make his point).
For example, here are some of the more bearish assumptions embedded in Peck's sum-of-the-parts.
Despite these, he still calls eBay a Buy with a $36 price target in 2008. As I said last time, you know the valuation is out of whack when even the bears are bulls.
eBay started testing Best-Match as the default search results over 2 months ago in the UK. I already expressed my concern then, but gave eBay the benefit of the doubt and admitted testing was the only way to really see if Best-Match improved finding, conversions, and ultimately GMV.
Now, with Best-Match officially being extended to a few large categories in the U.S., one would assume the initial results were encouraging. In theory, this should be excellent news as a first sign the new finding technology improves the marketplace dynamics.
But given the public outcry against Best-Match, is it possible that eBay is rolling out a feature that actually damages the marketplace experience? I'm not into conspiracy theories so I don't believe eBay would ever, knowingly, do this. But I would ask that eBay be very very careful in trying to fix a feature which many have argued was never broken in the first place."

Based on previously discussed expected 2007 and 2008 EPS of $1.50 and $1.83, we are now looking at a 2007 and 2008 P/E of just 20.0x and 16.4x respectively. 16.4x 2008 expected earnings? That's actually less than the S&P average and the lowest forward multiple in eBay's entire history as a public company. At this point, if I were Meg and Bob, I would put aside all acquisitions and plow the full $4.5 billion in net cash plus some into the share buyback program. Bob Swan recently stated ""if and when we go the next step to lever up the balance sheet in a more extensive [buyback] program .... that's a decision we continue to evaluate on an ongoing basis."" Well Bob, if a leveraged buyback was ever a possibility, it seems now would be the time. I'll be listening on January 23rd.  With the recent rumors, started by a report in Seoul Economic Daily, that eBay is in talks to acquire South Korean Gmarket, it is worth noting that eBay already holds an equally attractive e-commerce position in Korea with its wholly-owned auction.co.kr platform. While a direct comparison is not possible given that eBay does not disclose GMV in the region, traffic statistics suggest the two companies have maintained practically equal market share for the past two years. So while an acquisition may make sense for a number of reasons, it is certainly not as much a make-or-break deal for eBay in Asia as some commentators have suggested."

He uses this information together with the time zones of major geographies to estimate the number of ""real users"" (users whose presence is detected daily) in various parts of the world. Apart from confirming the surprising growth spurt I commented on earlier this week, Barton's analysis shows that growth is relatively uniform across geographies, perhaps even with a slightly higher percentage growth in Asia Pacific. This sort of dispels the notion that a U.S. recession - and therefore U.S. users - is driving the growth spurt. Also surprising is how truly global the Skype brand has become, with approximately 30 million ""real users"" relatively evenly spread out all over the world. We have known for a while that substantial fee changes are coming in 2008. The latest information, coming from conversations between top sellers and their account managers is that changes to the fee schedule will be announced together with Q4 earnings on January 23rd. Furthermore, the changes are likely to include i) bulk discount for high volume sellers and ii) category specific pricing to allow for low listing, high final value fees in select areas.

This time around, we are going into the Q4 earnings report at a 52-week low below $30 per share. It's amazing to think that just three months ago, we went into the Q3 earnings report at a 52-week high of above $40 per share. In fact, if we take the peak after-hours price of $44 following Q3 earnings on 17 October, eBay has lost an astounding 36% of its value in 3 months (compared to a 20% drop in Nasdaq over the same time period). Having closed last week at $28.33, any guesses as to how the share price will finish this week?

One of S&P's predictions for 2008, as reported by BusinessWeek:
eBay will continue to focus on, and do better relative to, the expectations of two core constituencies -- users and shareholders. We expect further improvements to the eBay (EBAY; $33; strong buy) website and ""the customer experience."" We also would not be surprised by more aggressive share buyback activity. The stock is one of our top picks for 2008 -- its P/E was recently less than 20 times our 2008 earnings forecast -- and we think it's a compelling value.
As we get 2008 underway, few are more optimistic than Jacob Aqraou, Kijiji vice president and general manager. Aqraou states that Kijiji will ""market itself far more aggressively in 2008"" in hopes of putting a dent in Craigslist’s huge market-share lead. According to Nielsen data, Kijiji has already climbed to second among all classifieds sites in the United States, with 1.8 million visitors in November compared to Craigslist’s 20 million American visitors.

The announcement sent Naspers shares diving as much as 7% in early trading. Naspers's stock fell partly on concerns that it may be over-paying for QXL. The board of directors of QXL will recommend the offer to shareholders, making it difficult for a competing offer to come forth. Given the nosebleed valuation, I doubt eBay would have entertained outbidding Naspers anyway.   Meanwhile, eBay and Thai partner Sanook, a subsidiary of Naspers, have quietly launched a beta version of shopping.co.th to over 16 million Internet users in Thailand. The partnership between eBay and Sanook was announced back in May. It appears the site uses the eBay auction and fixed-price shopping engine but with a Sanook look and feel. The two companies have an undisclosed revenue-sharing agreement. Now that Naspers has made a recommended offer for QXL, what does this mean for eBay's partnership with Sanook? Is it a conflict of interest for eBay to share technology with Naspers in one geography, while Naspers owns a competing technology in others? Ticketmaster finally announced that it plans to launch a comprehensive secondary-ticket web site next where people can buy and sell tickets. To begin with, the site will focus on NFL tickets, having signed a multiyear deal with the NFL that includes branding and promotion for the site. I'm not sure why it has taken so long for Ticketmaster to react to StubHub's incredible growth, but they may find that they are too late to the party.

This raises an interesting question: in the case of eBay in particular, would more competition be good or bad for consumers?

Generally, of course, competition is a good thing from a consumer point
of view. And if eBay had more of it, maybe its customer service would
be better, or its website would be easier to use, or its fees would be
lower.

On the other hand, consumers benefit enormously from eBay's status as the
online auction site. Sellers all go there because that's where all the
buyers are, and vice versa, which means much more liquidity and a much
higher probability of a successful sale or finding what you're looking
for.
I have no idea how one would even begin to start measuring such
trade-offs. But it's rare enough just to find such a high-profile
situation where increased competition isn't obviously good for consumers."

While achieving or exceeding 4Q estimates will be a net positive and will reinforce firm's growth outlook, the bigger focus and stock driver will be management's decisions related to pricing and EBIT growth given margin comments. After assessing the debates and unknowns, they remain comfortable that eBay's decisions will be within a financial box of at least 15% operating income and EPS growth, while ultimately results could prove to be better. The pricing changes over the long term should increase the value of the platform to both the buyer and seller and could potentially re-ignite growth. Additionally, the potential margin pressure in 2008 due to a mix shift and investments will likely not come at the expense of overall operating income dollars, which should grow in the mid-teens. GSCO maintains their Buy rating with upside to their $51 price target.

56928,20378,2007-12-11T08:04:45-05:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has been testing different pricing promotion formats for the past three months. New longer-lasting promotions have helped to increase listings while reducing their overall volatility. But as eBay's Philipp Justus reminds us, the latest ""free gallery"" promotion ends tomorrow December 12th. The big question is therefore what comes next? At the UBS Media and Communications conference last week, John Donahoe, President of eBay Marketplaces, provided some hints. Donahoe explained that as fixed-price format gains importance (up to 41% of GMV), eBay needs to rebalance fees. He says ""the best fixed price formats have lower up-front fees and higher back-end fees."" This is essentially what the recent promotions have been testing. Asked when we could expect a rebalancing of fees to take place, Donahoe stated Q1 2008. So, provided the promotion testing has been successful, we can expect a permanent change as early as January. Interestingly, Donahoe claimed he believed eBay could rebalance fees in a take-rate neutral way. StubHub today announced that it has sold its 10 millionth ticket. But more important than the number of tickets sold is this additional piece of information near the end of the press release: ""StubHub's ten millionth ticket transaction took place less than a year after the five millionth ticket sale."" This means that over half of StubHub's total ticket sales ever have come since eBay acquired the company in January 2007 and that the company continues to grow at triple digit rates. Now it's time to expand this proven business model internationally! On a side note, if we assume a StubHub ASP of around $120, this means that 2007 GMV for StubHub will exceed $600 million. This may not sound like a lot but it would already account for over 1% of eBay's global GMV, and over 2% of eBay's U.S. GMV. Furthermore, considering the take-rate per transaction is higher on StubHub than on eBay, the proportion of total eBay revenue from StubHub is even higher. Not bad at all for a $310 million acquisition.  Having already presented PayPal's blockbuster Q4, there is now sufficient visibility for me to predict an equally impressive Q4 performance by eBay Marketplaces. According to the latest listings data, eBay listings are actually trending very nicely. In fact, if we look at total listings, we see that we are up a healthy 22% from compared to Q3 (a vast improvement from the same comparison last year). Using last year as guidance, we can predict this will come down in the last three weeks of the year, but we are still looking at approximately 20% growth in listings for Q4 over Q3. Conservatively, assuming the continued FX tailwind is offset by tougher conversion rates and ASPs, I predict Q4 GMV will also be 20% higher than Q3 GMV. Therefore, my first prediction is that eBay Marketplaces GMV will come in at $17.3 billion for Q4, a growth rate of 20% year over year. As with previous quarters, GMV growth is only part of the story. In order to get to revenue growth, we need to consider eBay's non-GMV formats and monetization methods. In Q2, these added an additional 14% of Y/Y growth. In Q3, these added an additional 12% of Y/Y growth. Given Q4's more aggressive promotions, I would expect this to come down further to about 10% of additional Y/Y growth. Therefore, my second prediction is that eBay Marketplaces revenue will come in at $1.61 billion for Q4, a growth rate of 30% year over year. If this is so, it will not only be a substantial acceleration from 26% revenue growth in Q3, but will represent the highest year over year growth for eBay Marketplaces in 2 years."

eBay executives are the first to admit that the company's market valuation does not fully reflect the value of eBay's set of diverse businesses. This was, after all, the rationale behind eBay's first ever stock buyback plan just over a year ago. It seems now is the time to get the word out.
The past two weeks have seen a raft of marketing presentations by eBay executives. First was CFO, Bob Swan, at the Credit Suisse Technology Conference. Second was President of Marketplaces, John Donahoe, at the UBS Global Media & Communications Conference. And third was President of PayPal, Rajiv Dutta, at the Lehman Brothers Global Technology Conference.
Having listened to all these presentations, I can say there is not very much new information on eBay's business fundamentals. That said, the presentations are a great way to get to know the top eBay executives a little better.
StumbleUpon last week reached 4 million users, almost double the 2.3 million users it had when eBay acquired the company less than 6 months ago for a transaction value of just $75 million. Furthermore, StumbleUpon have just recently started innovative monetization efforts, such as contextual advertising, as explained by founder Garrett Camp.
Apart from this impressive performance as a stand-alone company, the mentality behind the acquisition was the future possibility of using the StumbleUpon technology as an additional way of navigating through eBay listings. I recently heard CEO Meg Whitman reiterate this line of thinking although there has been no further explanation of how this might be accomplished."

eBay started working on eBay Media Marketplace in August 2006 after it won the bid to create the system from the Association of National Advertisers’ Television Advertising Committee. Despite a major setback in April this year when Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau (the trade group representing cable networks) said it would not participate on the sell-side, eBay launched a beta of the site this past summer.
In July, cable network Oxygen (ironically a CAB member) was the first to close a deal with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) using eBay's system. Since then, other cable networks have joined the Media Marketplace, and cable operator TV-One is also known to have closed a deal using the system.
Now, as part of its Q4 ""Shop Victoriously"" campaign, it has emerged that eBay, through its agency OMD, has also recently closed several deals with cable operators using the online exchange. It's nice to see eBay showing the confidence and commitment to its own products.
eBay has been buying back its own stock since July 2006. As of the end of Q3 2007, the company had repurchased 90 million shares for $2.8 billion. That's over 6% of the outstanding shares in just 15 months.
The first $2 billion buyback program, which was supposed to span 2 years, was actually completed in 9 months. The second $2 billion buyback program (also with a two year duration from Jan 2007), also seems to be running ahead of schedule. Assuming eBay's average repurchase level is maintained in Q4, eBay will have used up $1.4 billion of this program by year-end, and exhausted it by Q1 2008.
This makes it highly likely (especially if the share price remains around current levels) that eBay announces a third share repurchase program at the Q4 earnings release in January. In fact, if Bob Swan's recent tone is any indication, we may see eBay become even more aggressive.
Note: I almost titled this post ""eBay's 5% Dividend Yield"" as that is effectively what the ongoing share buyback has been equivalent to."

In reality, the $30 million fee is relatively meaningless (at least for EBAY). Much more important is the pending ruling that eBay's 2003 patent work-around was effective and there is no ongoing infringement and therefore no further payments due to MercExchange.

understanding management has of their value proposition and their
ability to mobilize interest, resource, investors, employees and
customers. It’s also something that a large chunk of time is spent
on. If one goes to an investor conference to present the company story,
the idea is generally to make it as engaging and compelling as
possible.  Over the years we have probably flicked through a few thousand
corporate presentations and these are pretty dull. But the
opportunities for a company like eBay should be electrifying. Amazon
(NASDAQ:AMZN) certainly can demonstrate that many things are possible. Like eBay,
Amazon has their share of failed offerings but the overall projection
of the company is innovation, excitement and turning it into money. We
should come away with the same perception regarding eBay.Given the market and the company, it probably can only be one thing:
management in general and Meg Whitman in particular.  We were
unimpressed with Ms. Whitman when we met her early on when she took
over at eBay. Our thoughts at the time were along the lines of ""what a
lucky break for her""  (The CEO record is still held by Eric Schmidt
for moving from Novell (NASDAQ:NOVL) to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)).As she nears the 10-year mark in the job, some, notably Henry Blodget,
are calling for her to step aside and turn over the reins. We have
never owned eBay and are still not inclined given current management. 
But if a change at the top occurred that was encouraging, we would take
another fresh look."

While less comprehensive than research analyst counts that take all the various eBay sites around the world, it is nevertheless interesting in analyzing the effect of various promotions in the U.S. In particular, if we compare 2006 listings data to 2007 YTD data, we can see that listings over the past 6 months have been much less volatile than they were over the same period last year. This can be attributed to the longer lasting promotions, that have avoided the listing binges associated with limited-time promotions. The reduced volatility of listings has positive implications for both buyers and sellers. By spreading out their listings over time without having to wait for specific promotions, sellers' conversion rates and ASP's are arguably better and more predictable. Similarly, with fewer peaks and troughs of listings supply, buyers are more likely to encounter consistent search results and product availability, thereby improving the buyer experience. Looking at the last few months of data, one could conclude that eBay's effort to provide a more consistent buying and selling experience in the U.S. is heading in the right direction. PayPal is having another blockbuster quarter. Apart from new account wins like AirTran (AAI), ShopNBC, Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK)), and WorldPay, it has launched several new services including a new international withdrawal service and PayPal Plug-In. So what can investors expect from PayPal this quarter? For starters, I predict we will see the third consecutive quarter of accelerating Y/Y total payment volume [TPV] growth to 35%. This implies a record-breaking Q4 TPV of $14.9 billion! The bulk of this growth will be coming from PayPal Merchant Services TPV, which I forecast to grow at an amazing 63.1% Y/Y. This would be the highest Y/Y growth in recent years. The balance, from 'On-eBay' TPV, will grow at a more modest 19.4% Y/Y. Despite being lower, this would still represent a slightly higher Y/Y growth than the previous three quarters."

This is an amazing statistic that demonstrates that regardless of monetization and growth rates, Skype is incredibly valuable property in the telecom space. I think recent reports that eBay is looking to unload Skype are completely unfounded, and that unless someone were to offer a ridiculous price, eBay is right to hold on to Skype for the long-term.  eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) CFO Bob Swan has hinted that eBay is evaluating the possibility of becoming more aggressive with its balance sheet. With over $4 billion in cash and an unused line of credit of $3 billion, I think a much more substantial share buyback program is now highly likely. Speaking at the Credit Suisse technology conference, Bob Swan stated: ""If and when we go the next step to lever up the balance sheet in a more extensive program .... that's a decision we continue to evaluate on an ongoing basis."" Recall that Bob Swan was charged with optimizing eBay's capital structure from Day 1, and was the catalyst for eBay's first ever share buyback program which, while relatively small, was incredibly symbolic of a more shareholder-friendly executive team."

(NASDAQ:EBAY) are a buy despite its very weak technicals which are indicating otherwise. On November 14, Barron's Tiernan Ray wrote that EBAY ""could easily move to $45, or even the low $50s a share over the next 12 months, say investors"". Morningstar.com gives the stock five stars based on a discounted cash flow estimated fair value of $49. Standard & Poor's also gives the stock five stars based on a discounted cash flow estimated fair value of $75, an estimated intrinsic value of $40 and a target price of $50. Average target prices from analysts are in the $43 to $44 range. The mean analyst rating is about 2.4 out of a possible 5, depending on who's counting. That's a hold. Equally important, LEAPs options traders are over valuing January 2010 40 calls by 32%, according to ValueLine.com's option service. The calls closed Friday at $5.60 bid, or a reasonable 17% of the stock's price. For the speculators to break even, the stock would have to close above $45.60 at expiration. Most LEAPs buyers close their positions some six months before expiration. The historical volatility of 35% and implied volatility of 37% also says the LEAPs buyers are looking for a strong rally in EBAY during the next 12 to 18 months. Is the stock really cheap? Morningstar calculates the PEG ratio at a low 0.92; Yahoo Finance says it's 1.11. The PE, which is rather meaningless, is about 23. The price/sales ratio is a healthy 6.39 and the price/cash flow ratio is a high 18.6. The company has no debt, which will be important if the credit markets freeze and interest rates soar. While EBAY is categorized as an Internet or Internet Content stock, it's really a retail stock, subject to the deteriorating confidence of consumers. And it may be feeling the effects of the subprime mortgage and housing markets' problems. When fewer houses are put on the market, fewer people have stuff to list on eBay. Putting a house on the market is a great motivator to have a garage sale for eBay merchants or to list stuff on eBay. A question, of course, is how will the stock do if the market's apparent weakness becomes a reality? It's Beta is somewhere between .89 and 3.35, depending on the service and its methodology for calculating the number. The stock is down 15.2% in the last month and 19.6% below its recent high while the market is down about 7% from it's recent high. Just one indication that the stock's technicals are weak is that it is trading below both its 50- and 200-day moving averages. It just flashed a new sell signal on its point and figure chart, which gives the stock a bearish price objective of $23, down 33.8% from Friday's close of $34.72. See www.stockcharts.com's Candleglance charts here.Yet, Barron's and most independent analysts I've read seem to be confident that the company has a bright future. Investor's Business Daily gives the stock a composite rating of 80 on one page and a 92 on it's Daily Graphs chart. It gives it an EPS rating of 97, which means EBAY's earnings per share have grown faster than 97% of listed companies. Fundamentally, EBAY earns low 8.34% return on assets and only a 1.5% return on equity, according to Morningstar.

55027,20378,2007-11-21T08:11:46-05:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) typically splits its business into three broad business units: Marketplaces, Payments and Communication - hence their 'Power of Three' tagline. But while Payments (PayPal) and Communications (Skype) are very neat and well defined, Marketplaces is actually a hybrid of different business models at different levels of maturity.
GMV Marketplaces are those whose economics depend on the Gross Merchandise Volume [GMV] that is facilitated. The most obvious examples are the ebay.com sites around the world but this also includes half.com and StubHub!. While still growing, eBay's GMV Marketplaces are generally more mature, stable cash-flow businesses.
Non-GMV Marketplaces are those whose economics are independent of GMV. This includes eBay's myriad of classified sites including kijiji.com, Gumtree, Marktplaats, Loquo, Slando, Tradera, mobile.de and Intoko as well as various comparison shopping properties such as Shopping.com. eBay's non-GMV Marketplaces are growing incredibly fast.
The problem with having both of these grouped into one business unit is that: i) the relative size of non-GMV business means it always takes the back seat; ii) the lack of transparency of the non-GMV Marketplaces prevents proper valuation; and iii) it falls short of demonstrating a commitment to non-GMV Marketplaces as a diversified income stream.
As an investor, I would like to see eBay more clearly divide the Marketplaces business into GMV Marketplaces and Non-GMV Marketplaces. Few people actually know that eBay owns the world's largest network of online classified ads. In order to unlock this hidden value, I think it would be wise for eBay to consider transitioning to the Power of Four.
eBay's Engagement team has today launched 'Best of eBay', a microsite aimed at highlighting eBay's most interesting listings as nominated and voted by users. Currently leading the charts is an interesting Hillary Clinton nut cracker with 15 votes although the site has only been live for a few hours.
eBay has several portals aimed at encouraging repeat visits and increasing user engagement. Apart from Best of eBay, these include eBay IT finder, eBay Match Ups, eBay Deal Finder, eBay Pop, eBay Want it Now, eBay Wiki, eBay Neighborhoods, as well as the What is it and Shop Victoriously microsites."
55609,20378,2007-11-28T09:49:37-05:00,,"I recently commented on eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) classifieds business becoming a fourth major independent revenue generator for the company, and complained about the general lack of transparency on this high growth business line. Albeit minor, eBay let out a hint at yesterday's Credit Suisse Technology Conference, where it stated classifieds revenue YTD through Q3 was up 106% from last year. Considering the vast majority of classifieds traffic is yet unmonetized, you can imagine the latent potential of this revenue stream if we are already seeing triple digit growth figures.  Here is eBay Marketplaces' buyer problem. Year over year growth in active users has slowed for 9 consecutive quarters to single digits. This is also the reason for eBay's primary focus going into 2008 to be on improving the buyer experience. Unless eBay can stabilize and re-accelerate this growth over the next few quarters, it is difficult to foresee how the Marketplaces business can sustain its current double-digit GMV and revenue growth for much longer. Non-GMV Marketplaces businesses growing at triple-digits could partially offset this decline but their relative size is still small. On the positive side, I am happy to see eBay has finally started to view the above chart as an opportunity rather than a structural weakness. After Black Friday's data points, here is some data released by eBay on Cyber-Monday: No surprises on any of the datapoints.  The past few weeks have been tough for eBay investors. After reaching over $44 a share in after-hours trading following Q3 results on October 17th, the stock had fallen 30% up to this week (closing at $31 Monday). The general market downturn over the same period has not helped, but with the Nasdaq Composite falling just 9% over the same period, it is fair to say eBay has substantially underperformed. With expected 2007 and 2008 EPS of $1.50 and $1.83, we are now looking at a 2007 P/E of just 20.7x and a 2008 P/E of just 16.9x (that's less than the Nasdaq average). For a company whose year over year growth (in both revenue and earnings) remains north of 30%, this is starting to look like a fire sale. In fact, it reminds me of summer 2006, where eBay was trading as low as $24 per share. The interesting thing is that the one-year forward P/E at that trough was still higher than it is today!"
54199,20378,2007-11-14T10:21:06-05:00,,"According to nearly all eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) analysts, listings growth quarter-to-date [QTD] appears flat when compared to the same time period in 2006. This inevitably leads to the now common headline ""sluggish listings growth continues"" and is the primary cause of the recent share price pressure.   But allow me to offer an alternate perspective on Q4 eBay listings. Be forewarned this is a ""second derivative"" approach and therefore less straightforward. Instead of comparing year-over-year [Y/Y] listings, I want to compare the Y/Y difference in quarter-over-quarter [Q/Q] listings growth. In other words, how does the growth in Q407 over Q307 compare to the growth in Q406 to Q306? If we do this, we see a very different, and arguably more representative perspective on eBay's health. Last year, Q406 QTD listings were growing at nearly 4% relative to Q306 listings in the first 6 weeks of each quarter [some increase is expected given the high seasonality that is embedded into Q4]. This year however, Q407 QTD listings are over 16% higher than Q307 listings in the first 6 weeks of the each quarter. In my opinion, this is a striking revelation. eBay listings are actually tracking much better in Q4 than last year's performance would suggest. Despite flat Y/Y listings, it is very likely that the improved buyer and seller experience initiatives put in place in the past few weeks are having a positive effect. If this turns out to be the case when year-end results are published, I suspect it will catch many eBay observers off-guard and provide a positive surprise for patient investors."
54585,20378,2007-11-19T02:30:00-05:00,,"This week eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has rolled out its previously tested 'Guest Buying' feature. The feature lets new buyers purchase Fixed Price and Store Inventory listings without having to register with eBay. eBay requires guest buyers complete their payment through PayPal before the item is theirs in order to prevent fraudulent purchases.
eBay has also disclosed that in the testing, they saw a significant increase in visitors converting into first time buyers using the new guest flow. If this is true, then this is yet another feature that will help reinvigorate active user growth metrics.
Only last week, I blogged about the substantial FX benefits that eBay will capture in Q4. This week, I wanted to wrap up with another significant but much less obvious tailwind that will enhance Y/Y earnings growth for the next few quarters.
When eBay took a $1.43 billion impairment charge in Q3 relating to Skype, it also reduced the accumulated goodwill by that amount. I don't know over what length of time eBay is amortizing goodwill from the Skype acquisition but let's assume 25-year straight-line amortization [could someone confirm if this is reasonable?]. If that's the case, we can expect a a net saving of $14.3 million compared to Q4 last year. That might not sound like much but it actually adds over 4% of Y/Y net income growth! No doubt a nice year-end bonus."
53618,20378,2007-11-09T06:03:00-05:00,,"A number of key developments to note for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) watchers:In Q207 and Q307, changes in FX rates contributed 3% and 4% to Y/Y GMV growth respectively.  This is because over half of eBay's revenue comes from abroad and a weak US dollar has made each foreign-denominated fee worth more when converted back to US dollars.Interestingly, this tailwind that has helped eBay in recent quarters will be even stronger in Q407.  The USD/EUR spot rate, for example, is today at 1.463 USD/EUR.
This is an amazing 13.5% higher than the average rate of 1.289 in Q406.
To put this in perspective, the average Q307 rate was only 7.8% higher
than Q306. And the average Q207 rate was only 7.3% higher than Q206.What does this mean?  Two things.  First, unless the USD/EUR exchange rate trend reverses by year-end, we can reasonably expect at least 7% of Q407 Y/Y GMV growth from FX-rate changes alone.  Second, eBay's own guidance (and analyst forecasts) for Q407 are based on a much lower USD/EUR rate. Combing this with eBay's strong Q4 performace to date, we can very comfortably expect eBay to once again beat both its own guidance as well as  consensus estimates.Earlier this week, StubHub! announced an agreement with ESPN that allows ESPN.com visitors to access StubHub's ticket service from across the site.  ESPN.com will integrate StubHub! branding, links and promotions across its site.  ""This signifies yet another level of mainstream acceptance of the StubHub ticket marketplace,"" said Ray Elias, director of marketing for StubHub!.The StubHub! acquisition by EBAY in January 2007 has
turned out to be a gem. It's growth has continued unabated and it is
has consolidated its position as the unquestionable leader in ticket
trading. As I have mentioned in the past, and as was successfully done
with Kijiji.com, eBay now need to use this momentum to expand StubHub! to new countries."
53219,20378,2007-11-07T08:28:05-05:00,,"A number of key developments to note for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) watchers:  Having closed the trading day at $34.10, eBay is 16.3% down from its 52-week high of $40.73 hit on the 11th of October. In that same time period, the Nasdaq Composite has been flat to marginally higher. At $34.10, eBay is now trading below all but one of the disclosed analyst price targets. Furthermore, on an Enterprise Value / EBITDA basis, eBay trades at approximately 15x 2007 estimates, about a 25% discount to peers which currently trade at 20x.Investor concerns over slow growth at eBay's core US Marketplaces unit despite a number of fee promotions is keeping the share price under pressure. Fortunately for eBay, the US Marketplaces business accounts for less than 1/3rd of eBay's total revenues. And as both international Marketplaces as well as PayPal and Skype are displaying very healthy growth, investor concerns may well be overdone.  While I've expressed my uncertainty over Alexa traffic charts in the past, it would strike me as reasonable to assume the relative spread between the statistics of two sites is somewhat meaningful. Which is why a comparison of eBay and Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) reach during the last year shows these two Internet giants face incredibly similar user dynamics (the spread has remained pretty much static throughout the last 12 months ago).Given the heavy valuation premium the Amazon continues to maintain, this further strengthens my positive conviction on eBay's share price."

Yesterday, Deutsche Bank analyst Jeetil Patel has reiterated his Sell rating and lowered his price target from $33 to $30. Patel says, ""In our opinion, challenging buyer demand [as a result of weakening consumer trust and increasing online ad rates], escalating seller economics, lack of reinvestment [to position for future growth], near declines in transaction volumes and potential operating margin pressures [heading into 2008] all represent key challenges at eBay.""   PayPal Merchant Services has been on a roll lately, acquiring new landmark merchants left and right. But PayPal Secure Card, set to launch today, essentially makes every single E-Commerce site that accepts MasterCard a PayPal Merchant. This is really a game-changing development. PayPal users can suddenly use their PayPal accounts to buy anywhere from Amazon to Expedia - without the merchant even knowing. The innovative software utility works by recognizing when a user lands on a checkout page, automatically helping to fill out payment forms, and generating a single-instance unique MasterCard number that is linked to the user's PayPal accounts. ""From a merchant's perspective, this looks like any other MasterCard transaction,"" said Chris George, director of financial products for PayPal. ""And it's just another PayPal purchase to the customer."" Equally impressive is that Secure Card has already been tested by 3 million PayPal customers, and that it is being rolled out this week, in time for the peak Q4 holiday shopping."

states: Following last week's speculation over a full takeover of QXL Ricardo, it has been reported by Polish daily Polska, that eBay has started buying a stake on the open-market.
Polska cites traders involved in executing the purchase as the source

investment.For eBay, an acquisition of QXL would not only
represent the opportunity to further penetrate high-growth Eastern
European markets, it would also prevent QXL from falling into the hands
of a competitor trying to penetrate Europe (i.e. Alibaba). QXL Ricardo
owns Poland's largest auction site Allegro and similar operations in
Hungary, Ukraine and Russia, as well as in Norway, Denmark and

53201,21090,2007-11-07T07:14:10-05:00,,"In 2007 eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) management said they were going to concentrate on the buyer experience and called 2007 the ""Year of the Buyer""; well I can't actually find any quote where they said that but 2007 was considered the ""Year of the Buyer"". Here is Bill Cobb's State of eBay announcement from January of 07'2007 - Year of the Buyer: Many of these changes greatly affected sellers who were still reeling from the fee increases of Aug. 2006. There is some evidence that a large number of sellers have left the site or moved large portions of their inventory to other sites, with Amazon getting a large share. So what does eBay do for an encore? Well, I'll help them out. They should make 2008 ""The Year of the Seller"". I would look for Bill Cobb or whomever is in his position (sorry couldn't help it) to announce initiatives that benefit the top eBay sellers, category specific pricing, free gallery etc. We are already seeing movement in this direction as management tests what type of pricing will give them the most bang for their buck (three extended promos since Sept. 1st, each very different from the next)The only question I have is: Will this new focus on the seller be ""a day late and a dollar short"" The seller/management relationship is tenuous at best. I would like to add a few suggestions to their list:I'm sure I can come up with about 100 other suggestions but these will suffice for now. So what happens in 2008 for Investors? Well, IMO, much the same as happened to Sellers this year. Investors will probably not be too happy with the changes. Bob Peck of Bear Stearns has already suggested that there will be margin pressure in 08' due to the need to improve seller economics and Jeetil Patel of Deutsche Bank says the margin pressure combined with problems with demand will cause further pressure on the company's profits. I would look for real volatility with the stock in 08' but that is just a layman's opinion. So, we can already see what these changes will bring in 2009 ""The Year of the Investor"" when eBay once again focuses on the bottom line and investors. (Can investors wait that long?)In theory, these changes should right the eBay ship and make all three constituents (Buyers, Sellers and Investors) happy come 2009. IMO, 2008 is the key year for eBay management. If their efforts on improving buyer experience take hold with buyers and they can keep sellers on the site then improvement will be evident towards the end of 2008 and eBay can once again concentrate on investors. If these changes do not accomplish what management wants then by the end of 2008 Investors will be jumping ship.Lastly, as I wrote this post I thought, ""this is actually a very nice plan"" and hope that it works out for each group involved. Sellers will come back to eBay when it once again becomes a viable marketplace for their business. Investors may sell their shares as margins are pressured but will come back when things improve. The jury is still out whether buyers will come back. Let's hope they do for everybody's sake.Just my 5 cents! Disclosure: none"

After all, increasing the velocity of trade with Skype buttons was always touted as one of the primary synergies of the acquisition.  Furthermore, Meg Whitman claimed tests showed Skype-enabled listings had higher ASP's than equivalent non-Skype-enabled listings well over a year ago.  So why did it take two years, a Skype impairment charge, and a competing product for eBay to push ahead such a basic roll-out?In the US, eBay's weakest geography, the company is still managing to grow as fast as E-commerce as a whole.

itself. If so, expect this to become a permanent change to the pricing
structure at some point in the near future.This news follows a 33% insertion fee discount promotion

50640,20378,2007-10-22T04:45:00-04:00,,"Having had a chance to review eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) Q3 results in more detail and analyze the various opinions of analysts, users and shareholders, I can't help but think eBay may actually be facing a best case scenario going into Q4 and 2008. Payments: No Longer Tied at the Hip Not so long ago, PayPal and Marketplaces were Siamese twins. PayPal relied heavily on Marketplaces for most of its business and Marketplaces relied on PayPal to increase the velocity of trading. As such, their fortunes had an elevated correlation. PayPal Merchant Services, dwarfed by the magnitude of the aforementioned relationship remained below the radar of most EBAY stakeholders. But take a look at eBay's Q3 results and you'll find PayPal Merchant Services has come from nowhere to nearly overtake ""on-EBAY"" TPV. Whats more, Merchant Services growth, at 61% Y/Y, is not only accelerating but the highest it has been in the past few years. All of this means that PayPal, which generates 25% of EBAY's revenue, is finally free. Possibly for the first time ever, PayPal's success no longer depends on EBAY's Marketplace. Why is this important? Many reasons, but I will give you just one. PayPal could finally be spun-off credibly as a standalone company.Communications: Underpromise and OverdeliverNow that eBay took an impairment charge of $1.43 billion and sent GAAP earnings into negative territory for the quarter, expectations for Skype are so low that some even expect it to die. eBay have finally reversed their Skype game plan to underpromise. But given 4-year old Skype is still the runaway leader in VOIP communications and still growing, this may well be the most intelligent impairment of recent times. Not to mention, the impairment conveniently adds something like $50 million in the form of reduced goodwill expense to EBAY's GAAP earnings every year for the next 30+ years. With a new CEO, the earn-out gone, and new partnerships in place, Skype could be setting itself up to overdeliver.Marketplaces: 'Why's Everybody Always Pickin On Me'This is the most misunderstood business at eBay. It's a classic spider web of variables including ASPs, Conversion Rates, Active Users, Registered Users, Core Listings, SIF Listings, Auction Listings, Fixed Price Listings, Listing Fees, Final Value Fee, Promotions, Gross Mechanise Value, Non-GMV Revenues, etc, etc, etc. Pull one vector and it tugs the others in different ways. So the only way you can objectively judge the Marketplaces business is by the end financial result. Which brings us to Y/Y revenue growth, which has accelerated two quarters in a row and which is double-digit even if you strip out acquisitions and FX benefits. But most importantly, this could be the trough before the benefits of Marketplaces' raft of changes to the user experience start to kick in. If so, and Q4 datapoints so far lend support, Marketplaces could catch a strong tailwind.At the time of writing, EBAY had just closed Friday and the week at a price of $36.72."

replacing Rob Chestnut as Senior Vice President of Trust & Safety.
Given how critical and topical the issue of Trust & Safety is to eBay, I am surprised an announcement on Chestnut's replacement did not
come earlier. That said, it is great to see eBay moving forward and assigning the role to an experienced and ambitious candidate.  Congratulations Matt.According to The Chatter, Halprin
has been responsible for recent changes including Feedback 2.0
(Detailed Seller Ratings), Buyer Requirements, anti-counterfeiting
initiatives, and recent efforts to raise seller standards to ensure
great buying experiences. Halprin joined eBay in 2002 after spending 15 years at Boston Consulting Group.Chestnut will assume a more consultant-like role and help EBAY's
legal team on some special projects - presumably as he prepares for a
new role beyond EBAY. Chestnut had joined EBAY in 1999 after spending
11 years as a federal prosecutor with the United States Attorney’s
Office. He had now been on sabbatical for 4 months.I have been an avid follower of MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) since before their IPO and have even blogged about them a couple of times.  Trading at $44.59 per share, MercadoLibre is today worth approximately $2 billion, making eBay's 18.5% stake worth a notable $365 million.  But an article yesterday in BusinessWeek reminded me that eBay still has important strategic decisions to make in Latin America.The article, generally positive, completely fails to mention that eBay's
non-compete clause lapsed only 1 year ago which means eBay could launch
a second competing platform at any time. After all, despite a 25% stake
(possibly now 30%) in Craigslist, eBay proceeded to successfully launch a second wholly-owned platform (Kijiji) in the US classifieds business.  Could see eBay keep, or even increase, their minority investment in MercadoLibre while at the same time launching their own eBay-branded platform?Speaking of eBay's presence in emerging markets, another focal point for growth is Southeast Asia.  According to a recent BusinessWeek interview with San McDonagh,
Director of eBay Southeast Asia, ""we're very optimistic about the
growth of the market, and it is not just Singapore but the Southeast
Asia region.""eBay currently hosts fully-operational sites in
Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines. Furthermore, as early as
December 2007, and in partnership with online portal Sanook, eBay will launch a fully-operational co-branded site in Thailand. And
as online payment restrictions ease in Vietnam and Indonesia, eBay will
also look to launch localized trading sites."

But there’s the fine print. Currency effects–if you haven’t noticed the
dollar has plummeted against every major currency to pad U.S. company
financial results–and a low tax rate are what delivered eBay’s upside
surprise.Derek Brown, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, hammered home eBay’s problems.By the numbers, Brown estimated that eBay’s revenue was boosted by
$54 million and operating income by $24 million because of a weak
dollar. Revenue collected in Europe looks a lot better when translated
into the peso, err dollar.But the currency crutch really didn’t help eBay’s earnings per share
all that much. The real crutch was a 10 percent tax rate compared to an
expected 25 percent rate, said Brown in a research note. That lower tax
rate added roughly 7 cents a share to 8 cents a share to eBay earnings.Meanwhile, the growth prospects aren’t looking so hot. eBay’s total
listings fell 5 percent in the third quarter from a year ago and active
users fell quarter to quarter (by roughly 300,000) for the first time
ever, but were up 4 percent from a year ago, said Brown, who rates eBay
shares a “sell.”This theme was reiterated throughout Wall Street research notes on Thursday and on eBay’s conference call.
In other words, there’s a reason eBay is lowering insertion fees by 35
percent for the holidays–it is losing market share and needs to
increase listings. Thomas Weisel analyst Shawn Milne said he expects
that eBay will tweak pricing going forward. The takeaway: The days of
eBay’s pricing power is waning.Deutsche Bank analyst Jeetil Patel said in a note that eBay may be facing a worst case scenario ahead.Patel leaves us with a key question: If eBay’s business was so good,
why is it cutting fees so aggressively? Indeed, if eBay’s core business
is beginning to wane, the Skype acquisition will be the least of its worries."

listing fees caught the market off-guard and will create headwind for the
stock. Boyd states:Despite this, Boyd thinks eBay is
undervalued.During Wednesday's Q3 results conference call, eBay's Meg Whitman announced that EBAY will experiment with lower fees in Q4.  More specifically, from yesterday until November 5th, there is a 33% discount on all your insertion fees (both BIN and auction format) and a 50% discount when you list for less than $1.This is an unusual move by eBay, who is more accustomed
to raising fees. Asked about the change, Meg Whitman said ""We've not
ever really decreased price, and it is possible that by decreasing
price, we actually increase the revenues and vibrancy of this market in
such a way that this price decrease is self-liquidating."" That
would indeed be great. With Q4 listings already growing much faster
year over year than in Q3, this move could add significant upside to
the Q4 holiday season. Let's wait and see."

The company reported a net loss of $935.6 million ($-0.69/share), versus a profit of $280.9 million ($0.20/share) last year. Revenues jumped 30% to $1.89 billion. EBay announced earlier this month it would take a $1.39 billion writedown associated with its 2005 purchase of voice-over-internet provider Skype (full story), saying Skype failed to live up to the expectations of eBay's management. Not including the writedown, earnings would have been $0.41/share. Analysts forecasted earnings, excluding the charge, of $0.33/share on revenues of $1.83 billion. PayPal net revenue was a record $470 million, a y/y growth rate of 35%.

""This is different because it is the first Web-based service for the everyday investor to invest in microfinance, and earn an investment return while addressing global poverty.""EBAY first revealed their purchase of MicroPlace back in an eBay Town Hall meeting back in March 2007, where it's synergies with PayPal where singled out (see PDF here). However Meg Whitman was talking about entering the social lending business as far back as this speech in June 2006.MicroPlace joins kiva.org, villagebanking.org and accion.org in this embryonic sector. While MicroPlace does charge a fee to organizations that offer investments through the website, EBAY claims that any profits generated by MicroPlace will be used to fund eBay’s socially beneficial activities like the eBay Foundation.   UK newspaper The Guardian carried an interesting article yesterday on the work of Vladuz, eBay's best known hacker and probably eBay's most-wanted criminal. The Guardian even claims it has seen evidence that Vladuz has successfully hacked eBay's phone system and can listen in on internal calls including those of CEO Meg Whitman - thereby adding corporate espionage to Vladuz's extensive list of crimes.While the recent interferences of the Romanian have affected an insignificant number of eBay users (think 0.0005%), the media attention and user paranoia he has generated have surely damaged eBay's reputation. No surprise then that eBay states:After last week's roundup of analyst opinions following eBay's Q3 results, I have taken all those that provide price targets and calculated a consensus target of $45 per share. Given eBay closed yesterday at a price of $35.80, this implies an attractive upside of nearly 26%."
51693,20307,2007-10-28T10:12:16-04:00,,"Time to buy eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)?Tim Boyd, an analyst with American Technology Research,
thinks so. Friday morning, he added the stock to the firm’s Focus List,
and advised investors to respond to a 15% drop in the shares since the
company’s earnings report by buying the stock “aggressively.”Boyd notes that despite “a clean beat-and-raise” quarter,
investors have soured on the stock. “Concerns about eBay’s 2008 margin
profile (which are based on vague commentary by management about
increased investment in its various business segments) are overblown,”
Boyd says. As Boyd notes, there also has been tremendous investor
focus on CEO Meg Whitman’s disclosure on the company’s post-earnings
conference call of plans to cut listings insertion fees by “at least
33%” from October 18 to November 5. Writes Boyd: “We ask which is more
likely: that eBay’s business model is on the verge of collapse, or that
management is conscious of tough Q4 listings comps and pulling levers
in response?”Boyd also expresses irritation with bears who
suggest ignoring the revenue contribution from FX-related factors.
“Scoffing at FX-related growth when the dollar has trended downward for
5-plus years seems an awful lot like dismissing the direction that the
wind is blowing when sailing,” he writes. “We view eBay’s
[third quarter] results and outlook as very solid and believe the
bears’ selective focus on a few well-known challenges continues to
obfuscate the many positive trends that have developed over the last
year,” he writes. Boyd notes that gross merchandise value growth is
“sub-optimal but accelerating,” while listings growth is accelerating,
revenue per listing remains strong, PayPal is “gobbling up share of the
massive off-eBay payments opportunity and that “perhaps most
importantly,” year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 30.4% in the
quarter. “Not bad for a mature company, eh?”Boyd has a price target on the stock of $50."
50328,20378,2007-10-18T05:02:47-04:00,,"A number of key developments to note for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) watchers:eBay reported Q3 results. You can download their results presentation and press release here. (See conference call transcript here.)I might as well have written my predictions today. For eBay Marketplaces, I predicted listings down 7.5%, GMV growth 12% and revenue growth 22%. Actuals came in at down 5%, 14% and 26% respectively - slightly better than I expected. For PayPal, I predicted TPV growth of 33% with 62% growth in Merchant Services and 16% growth On-EBAY. Actuals came in at 34%, 61%, and 18% respectively - pretty much spot on. And for Skype, while the impairment charge took central stage, the business produced $98 million in revenue - very slightly below where I was expecting.Overall, the businesses showed very robust growth. Consolidated revenues where up 30% from last year and earnings where up 59% (helped by a one-off tax benefit). FCF was up 32% to $510 million and eBay repurchased another $500 million of its shares.eBay shares traded up nearly 10% in after-hours immediately following the release but slowly gave back gains over the course of after-hours trading. A very similar pattern occurred following Q2 results only to see the share trade higher the following few days.  While everybody was busy awaiting eBay's Q3 results, Skype passed an important milestone.Despite competitive pressures, and coming in a few days behind my original prediction, Skype reached 10 million concurrent users on Tuesday. So for the first time since Skype's launch 1510 days ago, 10 million users were logged into the Skype cloud at the same time.Recall that from eBay's Q3 earnings report we know that Skype has 246 million registered user accounts. However, we also know many of these are inactive or duplicate accounts for a single user. For this reason, peak concurrent users is a much better metric by which to measure Skype's user growth.With this in mind, if we graph the peak concurrent users over time, we see that even though slope of the curve has decreased, we are still deep in a period of high user growth."

	 PayPal Taps into Massive Remittance MarketI was reading in the news this weekend how Philippine overseas workers'
remittances rose 10.6 percent in August from the same time a year ago,
posting double-digit growth for the fifth month this year. The
Philippine central bank claims remittances exceeded $1.2 billion in
August bringing the cumulative inflow for the first eight months to
$9.3 billion, on track to hit a record $14 billion in 2007. The
sustained growth in remittances was attributed, in large part, to
improved access to remittance services by overseas workers.Which of course, immediately made me think of PayPal and the launch of heir new international withdrawal service
to over 26 international markets including Brazil, Indonesia, India,
and Philippines. In some of these markets customers could use PayPal to send money but had limited ways to withdraw funds.  Which is why PayPal's new ability to offer account balance withdrawals to Visa-branded credit, debit, or prepaid cards makes so much sense.
	 
	 Store Listings Grow for First Time in Months
	 
    According to Justin Post at Merrill Lynch, this week saw total store listings
turn from negative to positive year-over-year growth. ""Total store
listings were up 4% in the US and 1% in international markets. We
estimate total store listings up 3% QTD
in Wk 2 versus down 3% in Wk 1. This is the first week of positive
store listings data in several quarters and reflects the anniversary of
the store listings fee hike in late August last year.""This is a very interesting datapoint.
Not only is it nice to see that year-over-year erosion has reached
bottom in time for the critical Q4 shopping period, but it also shows a
balance has been found. Whether or not this new balance is where eBay
should be is another question but at least eBay can view the full
effect the store fee hike last August had."
49471,21090,2007-10-10T09:16:09-04:00,,"eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) recent purchase of German Auction Service Provider AfterBuy got me thinking about eBay's end game in the auction tools business. I had always thought that it made sense for them to own that part of the business but with so many different service providers, how would they go about acquiring the right ones? Well, in the aftermath of ChannelAdvisor's acquisition of MarketWorks, this AfterBuy purchase is starting to make sense. So here are 10 reasons I think eBay will eventually acquire ChannelAdvisor:
	1. eBay wants to own the entire transaction, which means they want the roughly 2% that these large service providers like CA get for their services. With the possibility of rolling back fees or at least capping them for now in their main marketplace business, eBay is looking for growth elsewhere.
	2. They already own the low end of the listing business with the SYI (Sell Your Item) Form, Turbo Lister, Blackthorne, Seller Manager, etc. Now that ChannelAdvisor owns MarketWorks, if eBay were to buy the company they would have a high percentage of the mid-size to large seller business as well.
	3. They already own a small stake in ChannelAdvisor, some peg it as high as 15% but that is a simple investment, they do not have controlling interest in the company and in fact they do not even have a board seat. At least with Craig's List they have a board seat.
	4. The AfterBuy purchase makes more sense if you consider it one step in a strategy to own the listing process. ChannelAdvisor is growing internationally in markets like the UK, Germany and Australia. AfterBuy is a major competitor of ChannelAdvisor in Germany. Is it possible that CA has spurned eBay's advances before and eBay upped the ante by buying a competitor? This would be a very similar strategy to what they've done
with Craigslist here in the states with the introduction of Kijiji.
	5. AfterBuy is heavily involved in multi-channel selling in much the same way as CA. eBay, IMO, wants to be the shopping engine for the world's ecommerce. With a CA purchase they would own SearchAdvisor, Shopping Advisor and additional Marketplace listing tools. Of course, an eBay purchase of CA might cause some friction with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Overstock (NASDAQ:OSTK), but AfterBuy is heavily involved in Amazon listings so that doesn't appear to be a concern on eBay's part.
	6. ChannelAdvisor falls under what I call the ""PayPal dilemma"". It is a service that a high percentage of top eBay sellers use that eBay has no control of. eBay management likes control. At this point eBay's ownership of CA only pays off when CA goes public or is sold. Like PayPal, I'm sure there have been discussions or even offers for CA and as CA gets ready to go public the price just keeps going up. 7. CA's purchase of Marketworks consolidates the market segment enough to make an acquisition a no-brainer. The value of the company continues to rise.
	8. Investors in CA are in this for the money, unlike Craig Newmark and his Craigslist investors. If the price is right CA will sell. To this point, my guess is that the price has not been right.
	9. ChannelAdvisor is a great company with solid management and would be a much better fit for eBay than Skype was and it won't cost eBay over $2 billion.
	10. An eBay purchase of CA would let eBay control Scot Wingo, there would be no more wild outlandish speculations on his blog. (That was just for you, Scot.)
All of this is my opinion, based on observation and just a smidge of inside knowledge on how CA works. I think it would be a wise move on eBay's part and they better do it sooner rather than later if they don't want the price to keep going up.
Just my 5 cents!

    In recent weeks, there have been a few corporate actions around third-party auction service providers.  First, ChannelAdvisor acquired Marketworks to create the leading US-based e-commerce solutions provider - in which eBay owns a minority stake.  Then, only last week, eBAy acquired Afterbuy.com, the leading auction management company in eBay's second largest market, Germany.Here
is my take on these recent transactions. While I have no doubt this is
a business eBay would love to be more involved in, it is extremely
risky to do so via acquisitions. In other words, I do not see eBay
acquiring ChannelAdvisor outright anytime soon. The reason being that
they would risk angering a very fickle group of US sellers which would
no doubt view such an acquisition as losing more control and fees to eBay. eBay currently has enough seller problems to worry about before
they try fixing something that isn't broken. But they acquired
Afterbuy didn't they? Yes, but I think the dynamics of this acquisition
were a little different. First, I think it was a defensive acquisition
- aimed to keep it from falling into the wrong hands. Second, eBay does
not have such a vocal and critical group of sellers in Europe as it
does in the US. Third, it gives eBay a bargaining chip if
ChannelAdvisor does come into play one day. And fourth, and most
important, it gives eBay immediate access to a proprietary auction
listing/management technology.This last point is very important
because it now allows eBay to follow the same strategy they pursued
with Kijiji. In other words, they can take a successful tool in Europe
and simply open it's doors to the US and see what happens. Very little
risk and a large potential upside. And of course, peace with sellers.

Buyer"" page. After concerns from buyers and sellers, eBay has decided
to remove this information effective immediately. Not only is this a
positive change from a privacy point of view, it shows EBAY are
listening to their users. Starting
this week, eBay is replacing the existing ""Price"" sort option with
""Price + Shipping"" sort in most categories. Including the shipping and
handling costs in the sorting is something buyers have been requesting
for a long time to avoid the frustration of finding deceptively low
prices with unusually high shipping charges.Using its sophisticated fraud detection algorithms, PayPal
will automatically withhold payment of highly suspicious purchases and
immediately notify the seller. Within 24 hours, the transaction is
reviewed and either approved or rejected. This feature is already in testing and aims to roll out by year-end. According to The Sunday Times in the UK, PayPal will soon announce
an agreement with Worldpay, the division of Royal Bank of Scotland that
processes online payments, to integrate PayPal as a payment
alternative. Carl-Olav Scheible, head of PayPal UK, said the deal was a
significant step for the company. “Merchants who are signed up with
Paypal will be able to accept it without having to do the integration
themselves,” he said. “If they can get it through RBS, then it really
becomes a no-brainer.”This would be yet another major account win for PayPal.  WorldPay
is a very popular payment processing alternative in the UK (with
thousands of merchants) which I had always viewed as direct competition
for PayPal. Together with the recent integration into BT  TradeSpace, PayPal is setting itself up for a record-breaking Q4."
48696,20991,2007-10-02T07:27:29-04:00,,"Here's what I don't understand about eBay's 

  Skype write-down; I'd seriously love it if someone can explain it to me.As I understand it, eBay bought Skype for $2.6 billion upfront, with the sellers 

  potentially getting as much as $1.7 billion extra if the company performed well. 

  Today, eBay paid out $530 million of that $1.7 billion, and said that the payment 

  ""is reasonable given the progress and anticipated rapid growth of Skype's 

  active user base."" From eBay's point of view, then, Skpe is now worth at 

  least $530 million more than the $2.6 billion it paid.But at the same time, eBay wrote off some $870 million of the goodwill 

  associated with the Skype purchase: in other words, eBay is saying that Skype 

  is worth $870 million less than the $2.6 billion it paid.How can both these things be true at the same time? I suspect that the answer 

  has something to do with some crafty drafting on the part of Skype's sellers 

  at the time that the company was acquired – or else eBay is essentially 

  coming out and saying that the model it used to value Skype was seriously flawed. 

  But there's definitely a fair amount of cognitive dissonance here – much 

  more than there is in a silly market quirk like Citi's share price going up 

  as its profits go down."

    Helped
by a UK promotion, Q4 listings have gotten off to a great start.
According to Merrill Lynch, week 1 total listings came in at 7.4% Y/Y
growth. This contrasts with the negative Y/Y growth figures we've
become so used to seeing during Q3. Although we saw listings growth in
every eBay geography, the vast spread is something to note, with the US
lagging the group at 0.6% Y/Y growth and the UK and France leading the
group at 57.8% and 37.8% Y/Y growth respectively. On a different note,
core listings continue to fuel growth while store listings are still
eroding, particularly in the US.As some of you have asked, here is eBay's own advice on how to go about tracking listings totals.
	 
	 Piper Jaffray Raises Target to $42
	 
    Piper
Jaffray & Co. raised their price target for eBay yesterday from
$37 to $42 while maintaining a Market Perform rating. The firm modestly
increased eBay's annual earnings for 2007 and 2008 from $0.01 and $0.02
to $1.14 and $1.39, respectively. The firm also raised Q3 revenues from
$1,845M to $1,862M. This compares to eBay's own guidance of
$1,775-1,825M.
	 
	 Kijiji is on FireIt was less than 1 month ago that I reported Kijiji breaking the 100,000th listing
milestone in the US alone. In recent weeks growth has continued
unabated and, by my count, Kijiji US have now surpassed 130,000
listings. That makes Kijiji one of eBay's fastest growing properties
(ignoring monetization for now). And they didn't have to pay $3.0
billion for it either:)
These are exactly the kind of organic
business opportunities eBay need to pursue aggresively. Kijiji was
already a success in many countries and bringing it to the US was a
low-risk, high return proposition. Another perfect example of where eBay should expand to new countries is StubHub!. Europe, for example,
is begging for StubHub!.
Anyway, at a time when recent headlines
seem to imply eBay has lost its way, it's nice to see that the company
still has an entrepreneurial side ready to launch and grow
complementary ventures.eBay Launches Neighborhoods

48792,20404,2007-10-03T04:13:57-04:00,,"When eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) paid $2.6B for Skype - with earnouts potentially making the deal go as high $4.1B - people wondered: What's going on?Truth is, that as the leading person-to-person commerce site (that would be eBay), to acquire and integrate the leading VOIP communications platform (that would be Skype), it made a lot of sense.Did Skype co-founders Janus Frist and Niklas Zennstrom do a great job of selling their vision to maximize shareholder value? Hell yeah, and good for them. In fact, I’d say they did an even better job of selling their vision for Joost (disclaimer: WatchMojo.com is a content provider to Joost), for which they raised $45M in financing from well-tailored institutional investors Sequoia and strategic investors CBS et al.After all, Skype was the dominant player in Voip and #8 on CNET’s (NASDAQ:CNET) Top 10 Downloads since 1996, whereas Joost was one big fat pie in the sky, facing macro-level constraints (that would be broadband not being there yet in the US) and micro-level challenges (that would be YouTube being the Skype of the video space).But back to Skype: While Henry Blodget’s addition to the blog landscape is a great thing, I think that to criticize eBay for pulling the trigger on its Big Hairy Audacious Goal is unfair. The deal, while rich, made sense. The idea that a seller and buyer would have a higher propensity to make a transaction if upon the click of a link they could fire up a chat or instant message was in theory very accurate. In practice, this boils down to the fact that wildly viral applications and explosive startups have - sit down M&A bankers - no business in an established, maturing business… and we’re talking eBay folks, not GE (NYSE:GE) or Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS).Is it a coincidence then, that the day Joost launched officially while eBay announces Zennstrom is leaving Skype?  Hmm… to some extent, yes. Sure, as one of the leading brains and visionaries of Web communications, Zennstrom is probably focusing more and more on Joost, even though he and partner in crime Frist have lured former Cisco executive Mike Volpi to run day to day operations. And, that’s a good thing, because while KaZaa and Skype are great growth stories, Joost will have to deliver on its promise for Zennstrom (and Frist) to add visionaries of content, commerce to that tagline.In the broader picture, today a lot of folks are egging on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Yahoo! (YHOO) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) to pay astronomical sums for an equally unproven asset - Facebook - that would make Skype’s price tag look paltry. If eBay is wrong to have pulled this trigger, then Facebook is not worth more than a $1.5B (10x revenues). Yet, an asset’s price is what the market will pay for it, and naturally, if Facebook went on auction (on eBay perhaps), I’d estimate that it would fetch quite a bit more than that."

	 Niklas Zennstrom No Longer Skype CEOeBay announced yesterday that Niklas Zennstrom has stepped down as CEO of Skype but will remain as non-executive chairman of the Skype Board of Directors.  As readers will recall,  Zennstrom co-founded Skype
in 2003 before selling it to eBay for $2.5 billion. Equally important,
the announcement clarifies that the pending earn-out of an additional
$1.7 billion has been settled with a one-time payment of $530 million.This
is mixed news for eBay. On the one hand, Zennstrom is surely an
inspirational and iconic figure within Skype. On the other, Skype
really needed to find a fully committed CEO that was not involved in
peripheral ventures (such as Joost).The reduced earn-out
payment is clearly an indication growth at Skype has been far from what
EBAY had hoped at the time of the acquisition. Furthermore, could the
fact that the search for a full-time replacement has only just started
be indicative of a premature resignation on the part of Zennstrom
resulting from failed earn-out discussions? In any case, an additional
$530 million is not insignificant although it does elimiate an element
of uncertainty.eBay Desktop Beta LaunchedCongratulations to Alan Lewis and his team for launching the first public beta of EBAY Desktop.  As I mentioned in a previous post, eBay Desktop (previously known as Project San Dimas) is a program that

	 Harry Potter Sells for $37,000
	 
    Just
when you thought the Harry Potter mania was behind us, EBAY has set the
stage for another amazing charity auction. The British charity Books
Abroad has sold what is claimed to be the world's only full Harry Potter series signed by the author herself for £18,200 (about $37,000).The Spice Girls’ Comeback ConcertThe Spice Girls’ London comeback concert has sold out in just 38 seconds.
And as with any event or product in which demand far outstrips supply, eBay always benefits. In the case of tickets, eBay operates the
incredibly successful StubHub!
site in the US. In the UK however, eBay relies on its traditional eBay
marketplace to monetize ticket auctions. In fact, there are already over 2000 lots
selling Spice Girl tickets on ebay.co.uk. As with other recent high
profile events, this incredible reallocation of tickets to the highest
bidders (in some cases from speculators which bought low to sell high)
is likely to be criticized by organizers and select fans. This is where eBay UK could benefit from a local version of StubHub! whose sole purpose is ticket sales, in many cases by organizers themselves."

In other words, was there anything we knew at the time that would have let you to believe that Skype wasn't worth what eBay paid for it? My view, and I said it succinctly two years ago in a post, ""Color me baffled"". And I remain baffled at the deal given the absence of synergies, and poor performance to-date (judging by the performance payouts).But ... who really cares? eBay is still motoring along, and this is lots of reason to be optimistic about the auction company's future. Over-focusing on the lamentable (and lost past) Skype deal strikes me as a mistake."
48825,20378,2007-10-03T07:02:51-04:00,,"Given the harsh media reaction to yesterday's
news that Niklas Zennstrom stepped down as CEO of Skype and that EBAY
will take $1.43 billion as an impairement charge, you could be forgiven for thinking Skype is dead in the water. But think again.Baring
any surprises, the leading global VOIP company will tomorrow around
10am EST hit a record 10 million concurrent users online. That's 10
million individual users around the world logged in to the Skype cloud
at the same time. This is not only an important milestone but a very
clear signal that Skype is still growing. Yes, it took a whole 247 days
to go from 9 to 10 million peak concurrent users but that would still
place Skype at around 17% annualised growth. And in fact, the
annualised growth is even higher when we consider the summer months
have always been slow for Skype.Equally important, Skype
revenues are growing even faster than it's concurrent user figures
would suggest. This is because of the increasing penetration of Skype's
paid services among its userbase. Recall that Skype had revenues of $79
million in Q107 and $90 million in Q207. And we can reasonably expect
over $100 million in the just-concluded Q307 bringing Skype's
annualised revenue to over $400 million. And this excludes any
additional business to PayPal or EBAY from the various cross-selling
and integration efforts.EBAY's now final total consideration of
$3.0 billion ($2.5 up front and $0.5 earn-out) is still 7.5x Skype's
annualised revenue of $400 million. Perhaps this is not cheap given the
current valuations of VOIP properties but for a profitable business
that is still growing revenues at high double digits it is certainly
not as ludicrous as many have suggested.• • •BAY's Official Blog, the Chatter, has posted
this video from Alan Lewis providing a little more information on the

I
agree with the Chatter that EBAY Desktop has the potential to be a
really popular and fun application. It also demonstrates the incredible
breadth of EBAY's set of APIs. If EBAY Desktop does achieve a
substantial user following, can we expect a raft of similar third party

The latest competitive force
may come from a new online payment company called Revolution Money. It
is backed by Steve Case, the founder of the AOL, and offers a credit
card with sharply lower fees for merchants as well as the ability for
users to transfer funds for free. The payment system is currently in a
pilot stage.
An initial partner will be AOL, which will let
users make payments and fund transfers through its AIM instant
messaging service for free (this is similar to the recent integration
of PayPal into the Skype client). The company also said it will offer RevolutionCard,
a credit card with an interchange fee of just 0.5 percent (this is an
area that, if successful, could also be a potential new arena for PayPal).
Users
can also obtain an anonymous credit card with no name or account number
on it, something that could cut the risk of identity theft, fraud and
problems stemming from lost or stolen cards, Revolution said.eBay's Trust and Safety at RiskEBAY's official blog, EBAY Chatter, yesterday revealed
a potentially serious breach of sensitive customer data. Personally, I
appreciate how quickly EBAY dealt with the problem and informed the
public but the issue does, nonetheless, raise questions regarding the
security of the EBAY platform.
As EBAY explained, yesterday morning a ""malicious fraudster"" disclosed confidential information about 1,200 EBAY users on the Trust & Safety forum.
EBAY has confirmed the name on contact information of the affected
users ""appears to be valid"" although they also claim that the credit
card information disclosed is not that associated with EBAY or PayPal.
Therefore it is unclear whether the disclosed credit card information
is valid, and if so, what the source is. Regardless, EBAY took steps to
remedy the situation within an hour of the outbreak and is taking steps
to contact the 1,200 affected users by telephone to ensure they are
protected.
But how did this information end up on the EBAY forum
in the first place? The leading explanation seems to indicate the
information could have been fraudulently acquired through phishing
campaigns before being posted online by the fraudsters themseleves as a
hoax. Other explanations include a hacker attack on EBAY and/or PayPal.
In any case, although the breach seems to be contained, it is worth
following this situation closely in case it should escalate further or
reveal more fundamental risks to confidential customer data safeguarded
by EBAY.Under the Hood at eBay TechIt's not often you get a first-hand explanation of some of the technology issues EBAY deals with every day behind the scenes. In this interview, Dan Pritchett, EBAY Technical Fellow gives us an inside look at one of the largest scale architectures in the world.
Warning: suitable for tech-minded readers only.What Vonage's Mess Means for SkypeWhen EBAY acquired Skype
back in October 2005, Vonage was seen as one of their strongest
competitors in the VOIP world. Vonage's fanfare allowed them to IPO in
May 2006 at $17 per share. A short 14 months and Vonage is trading 95%
lower at less than $1 and is plagued by a flurry of patent disputes,
fines, class-action lawsuits and customer service complaints.
But
what does this all mean for Skype? In the first instance, it solidifies
Skype's lead and reputation in the industry as Vonage customers
continue to jump ship. Matt Asay at CNET Blogs, a long-time critic of
Skype, has even caved in.
But not all are positive effects. The recent collapse of SunRocket and
Vonage's current troubles, while extreme, do indicate more tepid
valuations for VOIP properties. For EBAY, who paid a total of $2.5
billion for Skype (assuming no earn-outs are awarded), this is not
great news. On the other hand, the current climate might allow EBAY to
reinforce Skype's slower growth with an acquisition or two. After all,
Vonage still has over 2.4 million paying subscribers.Monarch to Offer PayPal in European First 
Meg Whitman was not kidding earlier this year when she singled out
the Airline industry as a primary growth segment of PayPal Merchant
Services. In the US, there are now at least four airlines offering PayPal. And in Europe, it has recently been announced
that that Monarch Airlines will soon be the first European carrier to
offer PayPal as a payment option. While Monarch may be a relatively
small carrier, the news further demonstrates the momentum PayPal has in
this sector and also opens the door to Europe and its several dozen
airlines."

in 2002 and within a short period became the leading supplier of
auction management software in Germany. Terms of the agreement were not
disclosed.eBay vs. Internet Access TaxThe issue of Internet Access Tax
is heating up in Washington DC and eBay is leading the charge for a
permanent ban. The debate goes back to 1998, when Congress first
imposed a moratorium on taxing Internet access. Having been extended
twice, the current moratorium is set to expire on November 1st. But
this time around, Congress is considering both an extension as well as
a permanent ban.Brian Bieron, eBay's
Senior Director of Federal Government Relations, testifying before the
House Small Business Committee, Tuesday stated that fewer consumers
will use the Internet if a permanent ban is not passed. He said ""for
the small businesses using the Internet, that means fewer sales and
less opportunity to compete with the mega retailers."" Bieron estimates more than 720,000 small businesses use eBay as a primary or secondary source of income.eBay Gets Proactive About Fighting PhishingeBay and PayPal have traditionally been relatively reactive in fighting phishing attacks.  They have always tried to inform users how to recognize and report spoof emails but have rarely introduced steps to actively block fraudulent emails before they arrive in users' inboxes.  Which is why Tuesday's announcement that eBay and PayPal will cooperate with Yahoo! to completely block fraudulent emails through a technology called DomainKeys
is such welcome news. Furthermore, EBAY have stated they are now
working with all the major email service providers to implement similar
measures.This is a huge coup against fraudsters.  Just last week, I reported a breach of eBay customer data that eBay later attributed to a phishing campaign.  These new proactive protective measures will help prevent these sorts of mishaps in the future."

We are now very close to the $38 price target that regular readers will recall as my Strong Buy threshold. As I suggested in a previous post, while I still believe EBAY offers an attractive valuation above $38, I do advise taking some profits at this level. While I think Q3 is ""in the bag"" with an outstanding performance from PayPal, there are substantial risks going into the all-critical Q4. Most important of these risks is a lackluster performance by EBAY marketplaces in the face of fresh competition and flat buyer demand. Monitoring listing data will be critical from now until year-end so stay tuned.    ChannelAdvisor Acquires Marketworks ChannelAdvisor, which provides auction management solutions for professional sellers, has announced the acquisition of its principal competitor Marketworks, for an undisclosed price. The combination results in a powerhouse of third-party e-commerce solutions with 5,500 customers and $2.5 billion in annual GMV. For comparison purposes, EBAY's 2007 expected GMV is of $60 billion. While the transaction has been well-covered by the media and specialist blogs, none seem to mention that EBAY is a actually a principal shareholder in ChannelAdvisor. As recently as this past May, EBAY participated in ChannelAdvisor's $30 million fund-raising alongside New Enterprise Associates, Kodak Venture Partners, Advanced Technology Ventures, and Southern Capitol Ventures. EBAY thus becomes a principal shareholder in the merged companies. That said, it is unclear the strategic value of this stake for EBAY. Their notable absence for the board of directors suggests a lack of involvement. And ChannelAdvisor's increasing reliance on alternative marketplaces like Amazon and Overstock suggests a potential conflict of interests. That said, as we have seen with the success of EBAY's minority stakes in MercadoLibre and Craigslist, holding minority stakes in high-growth competitors can often be a profitable and viable option.    Serious Bug at ebay.com This problem has been reported on both EBAY's official Chatter blog as well as by AuctionBytes but both make it seem as though it is affecting a very small number of purchases. Frankly, I think the problem is more widespread than EBAY would like to admit and as a case in point, it happened to me this morning. Here is my bug experience: First, I found an item I wanted to purchase using 'Buy it Now' feature. After clicking 'Buy it Now' I confirmed the quantity and pressed 'Continue'. At this point, the correct shipping address appears on ebay.com with all the correct pricing information and I clicked 'Continue to PayPal'. However, within PayPal the shipping address is completely wrong. PayPal is trying to use an address I used once many months ago but which is no longer useful to me. If I try to edit the address I get returned back to the previous EBAY screen to start an endless loop. Naturally, after a few frustrating attempts, I simply gave up. This bug, however contained it may or may not be, is certainly causing fewer transactions to take place on EBAY. I can say this from my first-hand experience. Lets see how long it takes for EBAY to get it sorted.     Analyst Comments Last Week Monday September 10. Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto reiterates ""buy"" rating with a $43 price target. Merrill Lynch reiterates ""neutral"" rating stating website improvement and listing promotion efforts continue, but listings data still does not show concrete signs of listings growth or GMV reacceleration, in our view. Listing trends in 3Q remain behind 2Q, with QTD total unadjusted listings down 10% y/y, versus down 6% in 2Q and our 3Q estimate for down 4%. Tuesday September 11. Deutsche Bank reiterate ""hold"" rating with a $33 price target stating that EBAY is facing a tough environment and the share price is expected to remain range bound in the near term. Listings on EBAY's German site continue to be weak, while listings on the US and the UK sites are declining, the analyst says. Although EBAY’s US listings are likely to improve in September, due to promotions, the company is likely to continue to face challenges in generating demand. JPMorgan reiterate their ""overweight"" rating stating that EBAY has seen its listings trends improve considerably after the anniversary of the pricing changes made August 22, 2006. We remain comfortable with our 3Q and F’07 outlook. Since August 22nd, worldwide new listings are up 6.1% Y/Y. We estimate worldwide listings were down 6.4% Y/Y through August 22nd. Since the anniversary of eBay’s price changes, which were implemented on 8/22/06, listings have grown Y/Y, up 6.1% worldwide. Jackson Securities initiates coverage of EBAY with a ""hold"" rating and a target price of $37. The analyst mentions the company’s core business has been growing consistently over the past several years. Healthy growth in payments and communications is likely to offset the marginal decline in eBay’s core auction business. The company is expected to achieve earnings, margin and multiples expansion going forward.   More Legal Troubles for EBAY First was jeweler Tiffany's (NYSE:TIF). Next was luxury goods group LVMH Moet Hennessy L.V. (OTCPK:LVMUY). Now, it is cosmetics group L'Oreal (OTCPK:LRLCY) that has launched legal action against EBAY for not doing enough to combat the sale of counterfeits. And the list is likely to keep getting longer. According to sources, negotiations between EBAY and L'Oreal failed because EBAY found L'Oreal's requests to be unreasonable. ""We are truly disappointed"" by L'Oreal's legal proceedings, the eBay spokeswoman said."
47073,20307,2007-09-12T06:35:47-04:00,,"A pair of research notes on online auction giant eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) Tuesday address a similar theme: the company appears to be ahead of expectations on third quarter listings. J.P. Morgan’s Imran Khan says total quarter to date listings are down 3.4% year over year, which is ahead of his forecast for a 6% decline. He also notes that since August 22, worldwide listings are up 6.1%. As Khan notes, on August 22, 2006, the company cut listings prices in an effort to shift the balance of listings more in favor of its core offering and away from listings in eBay stores. Sounding a similar theme is Majestic Research analyst John Aiken. In a report Tuesday morning, Majestic finds that new listings are down 4.7% year-over-year for the third quarter to date, “toward the higher end” of the current Street range. Majestic expects total new listings for the quarter to be down 3.8%; they note that the consensus is for a 9% decline. Aiken notes that in the August 22-September 10 period, core listings grew 3.3%, after declining 3.9% July 1-August 21; he notes the same factor that Khan did - the anniversary of last year’s pricing change.

With only 3 weeks left in the quarter and with substantial promotions in key geographies, I expect eBay listings to continue gain back a few additional percentage points in the coming weeks. That said, it is obvious we will see negative year over year growth in listings in Q3.

I've been tracking listings data at Kijiji since its launch and have been seeing consistent double-digit growth rates week over week. Until this week. Total listings actually fell this week compared to last. I'm not sure what could have caused such a sudden change in listings growth but I suspect it could be an eBay crackdown on duplicate listings given I don't seem to see as many as I used to. If that is the case, we should see a return to 'normal' growth again next week assuming the listings clean-up/removal was fully completed. If anybody has alternative explanations, please let me know."

For starters, what's with the brand image and logo? I don't mind being reminded that half.com is an eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) company but having 'by eBay' feature so prominently in the logo and having no less than 3 eBay logos and several dozen eBay links on the half.com homepage is a bit much. And to top it off, visitors to half.com are redirected to half.ebay.com. Has this property just become a traffic generator for the eBay marketplace? Is it ever meant to develop as an independent brand and marketplace?
The announcement that half.com items will start appearing on eBay Express was nice. Just as nice was the announcement that Alibris merchants will have their listings appear in half.com. But that said, instead of trying to maximise half.com sales on other platforms or bringing additional inventory from partners, eBay should first help the on-half.com sales and merchants. Otherwise it won't matter how many or where listings are showing up because buyers will continue to go elsewhere.
One more thing, and this is particularly ridiculous, is half.com's refusal to integrate PayPal as a payment option. They even state in their help section ""at this time we have no definite plans to incorporate PayPal into the Half.com site."" Is eBay this hypocritical to extol the virtues of PayPal and then refuse to integrate it in a property they have owned since 2000? Are they implying that you need to have a large critical mass before integrating PayPal makes sense? Please, even if just for image sake, integrate PayPal.
Half.com still has potential as a fixed-price person-to-person marketplace focused on media. But in order to grow, eBay have to give the site more independence, more breathing room, and a new look."
46247,20378,2007-09-04T03:49:14-04:00,,"August was a good month for eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) CEO Meg Whitman. She sold 1.28 million shares at an average of $34.80 for total proceeds of $44.5 million ($32 million profit after the options exercise cost). And yes, that was all in August! That still leaves her with a whopping 26 million shares but still, selling nearly 5% of her shares a few short months before the all-important Q4 quarter is not a great signal.
I know from the investor's point of view, it is never a good time for insider's to sell shares. But in the case of eBay, I would have hoped Whitman waited until the long-promised recovery in US and German listings started to show progress. Selling in the current climate, frankly, does not inspire much confidence in eBay's ability to reaccelerate growth."

All of those reasons still hold. But I have to say, if it was already an interesting combination back then, it is an absolute no-brainer in the current competitive climate. To avoid repeating myself, I will focus this post on one often overlooked piece of Yahoo! that is sure to excite eBay. Alibaba Group. For those of you that need refreshing, exactly two years ago, Yahoo! exchanged Yahoo! China and $1 billion for a 40% stake in Alibaba Group. Yahoo! thus became Alibaba Group's single largest shareholder. Two years later, Alibaba Group has consolidated its leading e-commerce positions in China and is estimated to be worth north of $10 billion - a sum which I suspect is conservative at best. The Alibaba Group portfolio is comprised of various properties, but two in particular are most relevant to eBay. The first, Taobao.com is the leading online auctions website in Asia - claiming 30 million users and $2.2 billion in GMV. This would make Taobao.com less than 10% of eBay's size. But winning in a hyper-growth market that could eventually be larger than eBay's core geographies is worth a significant premium. Online auction markets are natural monopolies and by just about any metric, Taobao.com dominates China. The second, Alipay.com is China's leading online payment company. Just yesterday I posted about their international expansion and how they pose a greater threat to PayPal than Google Checkout (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon FPS (NASDAQ:AMZN). There is little public data on Alipay metrics but one has to assume they are the defacto payment option on Taobao.com. If PayPal's merchant services business is booming, I can only imagine the incredible potential of Alipay in China. For eBay, whose experience to date in China has been poor at best, Yahoo!'s 40% stake in Alibaba Group has to be incredibly valuable. That said, Change of Control and Right of First Offer provisions may make it impossible for eBay to ever actually own this stake following a deal with Yahoo!. But even in this case, the value they would generate from the sale would be far superior to that currently recognized in Yahoo!'s market cap.  YHOO/EBAY 1-yr comparison chart"
45857,20404,2007-08-28T15:47:42-04:00,,"Paypal is king of online transactions. E-commerce in the USA by 2010 will represent a $300B segment.  Online advertising is getting everyone excited but it will only be, at best, a $30-70B industry.  As such, Paypal will clearly prove to be a bigger and better acquisition as time goes by.
We’re not alone in that sentiment. Stifel Nicolaus Internet analyst Scott Devitt expressed something similar. In a recent post on Paid Content, it was mentioned that:
Wow.   While Rupert Murdoch, god bless his style, likes to argue that MySpace (NASDAQ:NWS) is now worth $10B, I think Paypal could easily be worth the ranges that Devitt throws around.  After all, Amazon’s 2006 financials read as follows:
I think for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), sales is somewhat irrelevant because their margins are slim.  But as an e-commerce play, seeing that they’re worth some $32.5B on $190M in net income is key.
Paypal does about $1.5B-$2B in sales, but given its fee structure:
I think you can easily argue that Paypal’s net income is equal if not higher than Amazon.com’s.  I’m not saying, of course, that Paypal is today worth anywhere near what Amazon.com is worth… but over time?
Forget the enormous fact that even eBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) CTO observes that Paypal will one day be larger than eBay. First, let’s see just how big Paypal can be.
Just assume that Paypal will in 2010 have 5% of the online transaction business worldwide. We don’t have figures for that offhand, but in the US, online commerce will be a $300B segment, at 5% of that pie, Paypal will generate $15B in the US alone! That’s 10x what it’s making now!
Yes, the multiples are very different, I know, but Google will make $15B this year in ad sales, and sure, it’s got a dominant position and all, but Google is worth $150B.  I’m not, in any shape, form or fashion telling you that Paypal will get those multiples etc., but Paypal’s defensible position will be quite strong.
Alas, even at 1x sales, that implies a $15B value for Paypal by 2010.  Not too bad…  Oh, that is in the US-only… start to play with the variables and you see why Paypal’s future is not necessarily within eBay.
Of course, anyone who knows the history knows that eBay bought Paypal on its terms because had eBay squeezed Paypal out, then yes, a lot of eBay shoppers would have been upset, but the flip side is that Paypal would have lost a massive amount of business, since it was getting then, as it is getting now, a lot of sales off eBay.  This is somewhat similar to what happened to Overture which sold to Yahoo! (YHOO) somewhat cheaply- because the bulk of its distribution came from other sites.
All to say, how much of eBay’s DNA is now in Paypal is a question only insiders know… but it doesn’t take an insider to realize that sooner or later, eBay will spin off Paypal and cash in, big time.
Let that serve as a lesson to buyers, and sellers, worldwide."

Promotions have always been eBay's secret weapon to boost listings and GMV with short notice. Q3 2007 is proving to be no exception. Starting today and for a period of an entire month, eBay is offering substantial listing discounts on nearly all items.
I have previously blogged about the listings shortfall this quarter with year over year core listings growth actually falling nearly 10%. We now see eBay's response. The 30-day promotion is an unprecedented deviation from eBay's typical 1-day promotions and interestingly ends on the last day of Q3.
There is no doubt that this promotion will contribute to a recovery in listings metrics, and judging from a few anecdotal seller reactions, it is already being very well-received.
 Alipay Encroaching on PayPal's Turf


The competitive landscape in online payments continues to intensify. As opposed to Google Checkout (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Amazon FPS (NASDAQ:AMZN), which simply offer landing pages for transactions, Alipay is a full blown payment service provider. With this announcement, they begin their international expansion and I suspect it will not be long before they welcome non-Chinese consumers. eBay's PayPal may soon have a formidable competitor."

It is reasonable to assume that without this promotion, eBay listings would have continued their more pronounced downward trend this week. But as eBay management are quick to point out, absolute listing data is not everything. While listings data is negative, core/store product mix, ASP's, conversion rates, and FX are all working in eBay's favor. As an example, lets take eBay's Q207 results, in which, despite having 6% drop in year over year listings, GMV actually grew 12%.  In Q3 we are likely to see similar effects. The problem is that instead of starting with a 6% drop in listings, it is currently looking like we will start at a 12% drop. This means that even if eBay manage to squeeze out 18 points of growth from mix, conversions, ASPs and FX, we will still only reach single-digit Y/Y GMV growth rates. This may not seem so bad given the circumstances, but for eBay, it will be the first time in its history as a public company that GMV growth is a single-digit. Not a great way to start the all-critical Q4."

 Is Ticketmaster's Loss StubHub's Gain?
IAC's Ticketmaster has announced that after a year of negotiation, it is not likely to renew a long-term agreement with concert promoter Live Nation, when it expires in 2008. Live Nation is Ticketmaster's largest client and accounts for up to 20% of Ticketmaster's revenue.
Whether or not this represents an opportunity for StubHub is unclear. Recall that earlier this month, StubHub closed a deal with Major League Baseball making it an official source of tickets. Something similar may be possible with Live Nation. In any case, anything that helps unsettle Ticketmaster as the largest ticker seller in the U.S. has to be positive for StubHub.
 And eBay's Loss is Taobao's Gain
Vnunet reports that turning eBay China into a local partnership with TOM Group has not helped to increase market share. Quite the contrary. eBay China's market share fell from 16% to 7% in the first six months of this year according to China-based consultancy Analysys International. As expected, China's Taobao picked up that gain and increased its share from 74% to 83%. Taobao is owned by Alibaba, China's largest online business auction firm.
Its interesting to see the ""natural monopoly"" that has played into eBay's favor in the US and Europe work against them in China. There is now little that eBay can do to compete in online auctions in China, one of the fastest growing online markets. In the minds of many investors, China is a complete write-off.
A few weeks ago, I suggested that eBay may try to go head-to-head with MercadoLibre in Latin America. If the China experience is any indication, eBay is much better of keeping, and even increasing, their minority stake in MercardoLibre. Which such a strong lead in a ""winner take all"" business, competing may not be an option.

August 21: Deutsche Bank reiterate their Hold rating with a $33 target. Deutsche Bank mention that the ""continued decline in eBay’s US and UK listings and weak German listings are exerting pressure on the company’s share price. eBay is finding it difficult to generate demand and is facing tough comps and seasonality in 3Q.

In other words, San Dimas is a program that resides and runs from your own hard drive but uses eBay's extensive breadth of API's to bring you the functionality of the website along with new desktop-only features. The primary advantages, apart from the added features, are that the application can be designed from scratch (as opposed to having to work within the boundaries of a browser), that the application supports offline use (such as listing an item offline which then syncs automatically when online), and that it offers users a much higher degree of customization.    The eBay Desktop concept has been in the works for ages. eBay were already showing a rudimentary desktop prototype back in 2004 at a Macromedia MAX event where they were a sponsor. But knowing eBay, it took another short 2 years until mid-2006 for a more formal project, San Dimas, to get started. Another six months later, and with the integral involvement of Adobe and EffectiveUI, we finally saw the first operational version of San Dimas at the Adobe Max event in October 2006. But then another long quiet period emerged where eBay, using the talent at Metaliq, presumably redesigned and rebuilt the application several times over. Finally, in June 2007, a restricted San Dimas beta was launched although we still have no visibility on when the a public version might launch. Despite the much-too-prolonged process to get this application off the ground, I am excited about the eventual availability of an eBay Desktop application. Having a neat, attractive and eBay dedicated program that can enhance the buyer experience while offering a completely new way to access eBay listings is great news at a very opportune time. In addition, this application could potentially offer eBay the opportunity to test the viability of new features in a low-cost, low-risk environment before rolling them out on ebay.com.

 World of Warcraft Now Accepts PayPal
This is a major account win for PayPal. Officially announced on the 14th of August, I am surprised there has not been more media coverage.

And its not just the absolute number of subscribers that make this so attractive to PayPal. In my opinion, it's as much to do with the subscriber demographics. A very large proportion of WoW subscribers will be underage and/or without credit card, thus making the PayPal funding alternative even more enticing.

It'll be a long weekend for Skype software engineers. As for EBAY investors, the blackout comes at a sensitive time when VOIP competition is at its fiercest. The outage will certainly have caused a few users to switch VOIP providers temporarily, and possibly permanently. The outage will also have caused concerns for potential business users over the stability and reliability of Skype as a business phone replacement service.

In less than a year, if current growth rates persist, EBAY Merchant Services will surpass the EBAY Marketplace as PayPal's largest TPV contributor. This is a huge deal. For the first time ever, PayPal is proving its worth as a stand-alone company.
Why a spin-off?
First, the valuation of PayPal deserves a much higher multiple than EBAY. In an interview with Bloomberg this past July, Meg Whitman went as far as saying PayPal accounted for $15 to $20 billion of EBAY's $42 billion market cap at the time. This means that it is probably EBAY's most valuable single asset. Only a spin-off would really unlock this value. This basically addresses the point analysts have been making for years that EBAY's sum of the parts is way above its market valuation. Investors don't seem to like PayPal and Marketplaces in the same business.

Second, PayPal needs to penetrate more retailers. I don't have hard data on this, but I suspect the association of PayPal with EBAY Auctions sometimes creates a conflict of interest. A hypothetical example, albeit perhaps less now, would be Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). In any case, I think an independent PayPal would have more credibility to attack all major online retailers.
Third, in the medium term, EBAY Marketplaces has to open itself up to additional payment alternatives like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Checkout and Amazon FPS. If management wants to maintain EBAY Marketplaces as the top buyer destination, this is inevitable. Being free from PayPal makes this so much easier to explain and implement. Obviously there would need to be a transitional phase agreed with PayPal where exclusivity lasted a prescribed length of time.
Finally, there is an element of business focus. I won't get into this but let's just say I think EBAY marketplaces could benefit from thinking more about themselves rather than how they fit into a portfolio of businesses."

This could be a clever strategy if we see the classified's business move toward a ""winner takes all"" scenario like online auctions.  eBay Hosts Free Listing Day to Boost Listings My previous post showed the grim listings data coming through from eBay. In an effort to halt the listings decline and perhaps even give it a nice boost, eBay are hosting an almost unprecedented free listings day (Scot Wingo, author of eBay Strategies, claims the last time we saw a promotion like this was in 2002!).  A few rules apply, but I expect this promotion will have a very pronounced effect on this week's listings - good and bad. On the good side, we will obviously see a much-needed pickup in listings. On the bad side, the quality of listings is likely to be lower, with the incentive being on quantity rather than quality.  Finally Some Changes at eBay Express eBay Express launched over a year ago and was the subject of a massive TV advertising campaign. And yet the little evidence coming through is that it has failed to attract a critical mass of buyers. So it is refreshing to read eBay's announcement Tuesday that they are working to increase the breadth of product on eBay Express. eBay points out that from earlier this year they already added items on Half.com to eBay Express, and in late August, the same will be true for qualified listings from Shopping.com. I think this is an excellent announcement. If buyers start seeing different product sets on eBay Express than they do on eBay, they will be more likely to visit one or both sites independently of the other. The strategy to continue to differentiate eBay Express from eBay is, in my opinion, the right one to follow."

Even though Gross Merchandise Volume [GMV] has more than doubled since Q4 03, the TTM Y/Y growth rate has continued its constant slide. The big question in most investor's minds is 'where does the slide end?' And the bad news, it will still take a few quarters longer to stabilize. We already have some visibility on Q3 and unfortunately, it's not great. Listings data is down Q/Q and Y/Y and based on this run rate, I predict Q3 GMV of around $14.32B, only a 13.3% growth rate Y/Y.  The good news? Apart from the fact that non-GMV based businesses are compensating this decline, GMV growth should hit bottom at around 13% as we start lapsing the higher fees of Q306 that caused a significant slowdown in store inventory on the system and as new initiatives to spur growth start to kick in."

That’s a bit of a surprise; Wednesday night the stock was trading higher on what appeared to be better-than-expected second quarter results and a slight uptick in full year EPS guidance. So why was the stock lower Thursday?
The short answer is that the Street has decided the numbers were not quite as good as they looked - and investors remain concerned about weak growth in the core eBay Marketplace business.

Cowen analyst Jim Friedland, who maintains a Neutral rating on the stock, Thursday notes that the majority of the upside in the quarter’s results were driven by a beneficial shift in foreign exchange rates and a lower tax rate. He also notes that there was a decline in total listings.


Derek Brown, of Cantor Fitzgerald, repeated his sell rating and $30 price target on the stock. “We strongly encourage investors to look through this beat-and-raise quarter and focus on the persistent sluggishness of eBay’s core Marketplace franchise, which ultimately drives 70%-80% of total corporate revenue by our estimate,” he writes. “We see little tangible evidence that eBay’s ‘fixes’ have fundamentally altered the trajectory of its core business and believe eBay continues losing mind share and market share at a rapid pace.”
RBC’s Jordan Rohan cautions Thursday that it could take at least two quarters to convince eBay skeptics that it can grow its core business at better than 10%. “Buying eBay now is a leap of faith, as it requires belief that user experience improvements will continue to enhance conversion rates and ASPs,” he writes. For now, he advises staying on the sidelines.
Even the bulls saw some flaws in the story. Citigroup’s Mark Mahaney said he saw two key negatives in Wednesday’s report. For one, he notes that eBay has promised to ramp up investment in the business. As Mahaney puts it, “when eBay says they will plow revenue upside back into the business, they mean it.” And he also notes that international gross merchandise value decelerated in the quarter to a record low 10%. He notes that Germany, the company’s biggest international market, showed just mid-single-digit growth in gross merchandise value. Comments Mahaney: “This HAS to reaccelerate.”

Morgan Stanley’s Mary Meeker strikes a similar note in her report, which is headlined “Now it’s about winning back the buyer.”

Jefferies & Co.’s Youssef Squali, who has a Buy rating on the stock, expects the second half to extend the trend of higher conversion rates and ASPs, with soft listings growth. But he notes that sustained long-term growth “requires re-acceleration in listings growth.”"
44133,20378,2007-08-10T06:04:29-04:00,,"There has been a lot of talk lately of what acquisitions eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) may pursue in the near future, particularly given its recent debt capacity increase. In this post, I briefly want to outline a few of the candidates that people are talking about (even if I don't necessarily agree with some).
Facebook. Currently number 2 social networking site in the world but catching up to Myspace very quickly. EBAY is already working to develop some apps for Facebook and a move like this would certainly mitigate buy.com's recent Garage Sale launch. This, however, would no doubt be an extremely expensive deal even for EBAY's standards.
Craigslist. Leading U.S. online classifieds business where EBAY already has a 25% stake. EBAY expanded Kijiji.com to include U.S. so they are now competing head to head. Craigslist founder Craig Newmark has stated he is not interested in selling out or even monetizing the site although with Kijiji gaining ground he may change his mind.
Yahoo! (YHOO). An acquisition, merger, strategic alliance has been rumored for years now. Yahoo! and EBAY are already partners in certain initiatives related to advertising and using PayPal but more meaningful integration could bring more muscle and substantial cost reductions. At a $32 billion market cap, this would also be a massive landmark deal.
Viagogo. Everybody agrees StubHub was a fantastic acquisition. Viagogo is the StubHub of Europe, interestingly founded by a founder of StubHub. Could he sell off to EBAY twice? To be fair, Viagogo is still far from mature but it is gaining traction quickly.
MercadoLibre. Leading auction business in Latin America (see a previous post) in which EBAY already has a 20% stake. MercadoLibre is supposed to be going public any day now so it's not clear how EBAY would go about increasing its stake other than through open market purchases at the moment.
IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI). Stifel Nicolaus suggests EBAY may be interested in IAC, or at least parts of the company. IAC owns brands like Ask.com, Evite, Home Shopping Network, Match.com and Ticketmaster. It is perhaps more digestible with a market cap of under $8 billion although the company has given no indication it would support a sale.
ValueClick (VCLK)/Commission Junction. ValueClick has a market cap of around $2 billion, is trading near a 52 week low, and, among other things, manages EBAY's affiliate program through Commission Junction. It also has activities in comparison shopping and advertising solutions. This could be a nice fit with EBAY.
Any other ideas?"

I'm not sure how successful the site has been overseas, but it's hard to imagine it doing particularly well here.  
First of all, there's nothing wrong with Craigslist -- no major sources of angst for it to fix.  The bigger problem, however, is that there's no sex.  In addition to its ads for stuff like no-broker apartments and free couches, there's a world of titillating come-ons for dates and mid-afternoon hookups.  Even if this kind of thing isn't your bag -- and for most people it isn't, the whole thing helps create a community/atmosphere that can't be replicated by some

In a research note Friday morning, UBS Internet analyst Benjamin Schachter wrote that “the longer-term opportunity is very large and eBay may monetize it in a variety of ways.” He says that while most postings will be free, the company can charge fees for certain categories, such as apartments and jobs. 
Schachter says the company can also run contextual ads. And he says the site could drive increased use of Skype and PayPal, as well potentially driving more auctions around local goods and services using eBay’s core engine.
“We do not believe this push into classifieds will yield any significant revenue in the near-term, and eBay may never reach its potential,” he says, “but we do believe the opportunity is conceivably as significant as its other core businesses.”"

After all, EBAY is up 12% in 5 days while the Nasdaq has been completely flat. Well, I certainly can't find any news as rationale. If my blog is anything to go by, the news the past 5 days has even been slightly negative, with the launch of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) FPS, the launch of Buy.com Garage Sale and uncertainty over the Latin America situation. Even listings data, which I have not gotten around to write about yet, shows that U.S. Marketplaces growth continues to be sluggish. And to top it all off, we are in what is usually EBAY seasonal lows.  So what do you think the reason could be? Has something leaked? Are people finally looking at EBAY's sum of the parts? Could it be the increased debt capacity in these increasingly credit tight markets? Any thoughts welcome."

Key points:
In my opinion, Skype has lost focus, allowing other companies to capture markets it should have owned (Google's new acquisition Grand Central, for example).  Skype has yet to roll out a satisfactory small-business solution (main number, PBX, extensions, etc.) and has yet to penetrate the much larger phone-to-phone market.  Skype's forays into community and commerce, meanwhile, smack of the core expertise of its parent, eBay, which has no strategic reason for owning the company.  eBay should sell Skype to Yahoo (YHOO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and focus on its core commerce business."

EBay gave Q3 revenue guidance of $1.78-1.83 billion and EPS of $0.31-0.33; analysts had been calling for $1.79 billion and $0.32. The company marginally raised its full-year guidance; it now expects $7.3-$7.45 billion revenue and $1.34-$1.38 EPS vs. $1.30-$1.34 previously. Analysts were calling for $1.34 and $7.4 billion. Much of the company's growth came from its PayPal and Skype properties. PayPal revenue was up 34% to $454 million. Skype revenue jumped more than 100% to $90 million; the VoIP service boasts 220 million registered users, up 94% y/y. Gross merchandise volume in its core business was up only 12% in the quarter, its second consecutive decline, and down 18% y/y. Listings fell 6% over the period. CFO Bob Swan attributed the lower core numbers to the company's campaign to prune 'low-quality' listings from the site in order to improve user experience.

Which is better - more from less or less from more? In other words, can eBay continue to provide revenue growth (a.k.a. More) from a shrinking number of listings (a.k.a Less) by increasing prices, or would it be better for the company to spur growth by driving More listings and perhaps charging Less? The company reported official earnings of $0.27/share vs. $0.17 a year ago, and when taking into account everything reported $0.34/share vs. the consensus $0.32/share. So shouldn't every thing be rosy with an earnings beat? Well not so fast because digging into core business metrics reveals another story. Listings, a staple of eBay's business, fell once again by 2% compared to a year ago. To make matters worse for the stock, management said that revenue growth would outpace listing growth.  eBay has made strong acquisitions in the past with PayPal and it's recent purchase of StubHub.com. It's purchase of Skype for billions is still up in the air, however revenues from that division were $89 million in it's second straight profitable quarter. But the question still remains, what happens to the company growth prospects if the current listings trend continues? There will eventually be a point where eBay customers will not want to pay more, so the company has to find some way to entice new customers. However, for the time being management seems confident in the overall business as it raised guidance for the rest of the year. Should you be as confident in the stock's resurgence mainly through other revenue streams? I for one would wait to see some sort of turnaround in the core listings business before paying 38 times earnings for a company that praises the performance of secondary revenue streams PayPal and Skype.

EBay spokesman Hani Durzy: ""We've learned a lot from Craigslist. We think this market has room for several classified services."" Durzy added eBay has no plans to divest its stake in Craigslist. Greg Sterling of Sterling Market Intelligence says ""there is definitely a conflict of interest"" in eBay's latest move, considering its stake in Craigslist. Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster said “One of the beauties of viewing our world through public service goggles is that there is no need to worry about what other companies are doing. Many companies offer classifieds, but since we don’t concern ourselves with considerations such as market share or revenue maximization, we don’t think of them as competition, or as a challenge to Craigslist.” While Kujiji will begin as a 100% free service, Durzy says that could change, with the possibility of generating revenue through display advertising or by offering premium services.

This time it's eBay's lost share to Craigslist, something that has eBay bringing its Kijiji free classifieds site to the U.S.
Trouble is, of course, eBay already owns 25% of Craigslist, the company causing it all the headaches. So why would it launch something directly competitive in the U.S. market? At least three reasons, so pick your favorite:
   1. eBay remains in a monstrously deep self-flagellating funk.

   2. eBay tried to buy more of Craigslist, was rebuffed, and is now playing rough.

   3. eBay doesn't think it will ever see any liquidity from the nutters at Craigslist -- they'll likely turn the whole company over to some Che Guevara preservation society or something -- so it's calling it quits on the thing."
40090,20347,2007-07-05T05:09:50-04:00,,"First, the good news: eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has finally decided to go into a business that makes strategic sense (instead of buying random phone companies and social-web-surfing companies).  Kijiji's classified ads are highly complementary to the company's core business, and they allow the eBay to use its core expertise of helping people buy and sell stuff.  Kijiji US also provides the company with a hedge in case Craigslist and other free listing sites begin to cannibalize its paid eBay listings.
Despite significant online classified efforts, moreover, the classified opportunity remains massive: The dying newspaper industry still rakes in tens of billions of dollars a year for printed classifieds--a less efficient, less informative, less convenient, more wasteful, and more expensive way to buy or sell products.  In another few decades, when the current (and last) generation of hard-copy newspaper readers dies out, printed classifieds will seem as archaic as whale oil.  The newspaper companies may be able to retain some classifieds business as it moves online, but given the success of Craigslist, Monster, et al (and the seriously weak newspaper efforts thus far), this percentage will likely be small.
Alas, there is also bad news about eBay/Kijiji.  First, Craigslist is about as dominant in general classifieds as eBay is in auctions, and both businesses are subject to the same network effects.  (If the potential buyers for your product or service are searching Craigslist, you'll put your ad on... Craigslist.)  Craigslist is also free, which is a hard price to compete with.  So Kijiji has some seriously tough competition.
Second, Craigslist is run by socialists who appear to have no interest in turning it into a real business.  This means Craigslist is likely to be free or near-free in perpetuity.  And this, in turn, means that if eBay ever tries to make Kijiji US a real business, the few buyers and sellers who ARE using Kijiji will probably laugh all the way to Craigslist.
Third, as ancient Internet observers will remember, ""free"" isn't always the best business model for an online listings business.  (eBay proved this in 1997-1998 when analysts were convinced that a free auctions service from Yahoo would put the company out of business).  The major flaw of Craigslist, one that opens the door for competition, is that it is overloaded with crap.  If eBay/Kijiji were emphasizing listing quality, seller reputations, or some element missing from Craigslist, the competitive story might make some sense, but right now Kijiji's problem is that it has NO crap (or any other listings).  And it's hard to see how ""Just like Craigslist--except no listings!"" is going to carry the day."
38313,20311,2007-06-14T05:47:37-04:00,,"On Complete Growth Investor, we calculate various measures of free cash flow on every stock we hold in our two real-money portfolios. On a company-by-company basis, we run true free cash flow [TFCF], structural free cash flow [SFCF], and/or maintenance structural free cash flow [MSFCF] on each stock we own or follow. Free cash flow is what creates and drives long-term shareholder value, much more so than earnings per share. Each quarter, we're able to review company SEC filings and update our free cash flow spreadsheets, seeing which companies are improving, and which may not be. Following its latest quarter, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is one that is improving.  First, if you need a refresher, true free cash flow is cash from operations minus capital expenditures minus tax benefits from stock options. Structural free cash flow (what Warren Buffett calls ""owner's earnings"") is net income from operations plus depreciation and amortization minus capital expenditures. These are two key ways to measure the health and growth of a business, as both show realities that mere earnings per share numbers often don't. You can see in the table that in the first quarter of this year, eBay's true free cash flow gained 10.6% year-over-year, while structural free cash flow leapt 82% as net income jumped about 50%. Trailing-twelve month results are higher, too, and put the stock at 25x TFCF and nearly 31x SFCF, lower than the 35x trailing P/E. Speaking of that: this year eBay's EPS is expected to grow 27%, followed by estimates of 18% growth in 2008. The stock trades at 19x that forward estimate. Management provides guidance of about 20% growth this year, so Wall Street is expecting more. The numbers we're looking at argue that eBay looks fairly priced for the next 18 months assuming no real premium is given to the shares. But remember, of course, that the stock market will continue to look ahead: starting next year, investors will be trying to value eBay on 2009 results or later, just as they now value it on at least 2008 estimates. Looking at other financials during our quarterly health check-up, the company's balance sheet remains strong with $3.2 billion in cash and investments and no long-term debt. But one area where we'd like to see some improvement is in dilution. eBay's diluted share count increased 2.3% last year to 1.425 billion shares, and in the first quarter of 2007 the diluted count increased another 0.8%, to 1.437 billion shares. But what we'll be watching even more closely the rest of this year are expenses. Last year, sales grew 31.1% to $5.96 billion, but total operating expenses jumped 43.5% to $3.28 billion. Cost of sales was a major contributor to the problem, increasing 53.5% to $1.25 billion. This year began with more promise, as expenses began to decline in relation to sales, but we need to see follow-through. Overall, eBay shares look reasonably priced. This argues that the stock may be able to appreciate at a percentage rate in the high teens each of the next few years, as long as FCF growth is in-line with that number or better. This year, it should be better. That said, the stock is not priced with a margin of safety, so any disappointments would not be met patiently."

One critical point I made in my previous analysis is that eBay needs to plug the leakage in its advertising budget. Today, they spend millions in customer acquisition costs. Improving on this piece of the P&L would add a lot to the earnings of the company.
The question is, what are the efficient ways of doing so?
One category that has heated up massively in the startup scene is Vertical Search. Collectively, the vertical search engines are driving huge traffic. I have previously written about some of the ones that focus specifically on Shopping: Wize, TheFind, Retrevo, etc.
Each of these have a unique way to pull users into the shopping experience. Wize and Retrevo focus primarily on Consumer Electronics. TheFind focuses on Lifestyle shopping. There are many others. It seems to me, that eBay’s next few acquisitions ought to come from within these Vertical Search portals. Most of them pay commissions to a merchant shopping network like Shopping.com. Under eBay’s parenting, they can all be forced to go through Shopping.com. However, the user experience they each offer have unique value propositions, and could also be great new entry points into eBay’s shopping engine.
Among other things like moving Shopping.com up the food chain, this would certainly be a good way to keep the advertising money circulating inside the company, rather than making Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) richer!"

Red Herring speculates the company may use the acquisition to steer eBay users to buyers’/sellers' favorite web sites, or add other eBay users to one’s StumbleUpon friends, similar to how a user can rate another buyer or seller and see their past purchases. This would increase eBay page views and traction, and make it more of a social destination rather than just a place to buy stuff. EBay director Michael Buhr said in its press release, ""StumbleUpon is a great fit within our goal of pioneering new communities based on commerce and sustained by trust."" EBay could also recommend products based on one’s friends. In February, eBay acquired online ticket vendor StubHub Inc., and has previously acquired transaction facilitator Paypal and VOIP vendor Skype.

38109,20726,2007-06-12T12:10:57-04:00,,"On March 19th 2007, I wrote an article concerning what looked like a widening, almost epidemic scam that was affecting me personally on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).   In doing so, I pointed out that this could be a recipe for disaster that could financially problematic for eBay as their reputation and trust could be at stake. At that time, the stock was hovering around $32. Fast forward to April 19th when the eBay earnings came out. The numbers looked solid and there was a good number of investors looking to ride an up swell, which never materialized. In fact, an article in Blogging Stocks was explaining how there was a great deal of potential that should be soon seen. The author stated: “We blogged earlier in the year that eBay was due to take-off again, which is proving correct. Stay with this stock and if you don’t own it, I’d consider getting into it.” Looking at the chart below, we can see that while the report from eBay was rather positive, investors did not feel that it was good enough. A drop in listings in the US and Germany markets were to blame as was eBay’s focus on higher priced items was not panning out at the time.  Since then, there has been a precipitous drop in the share price of eBay, down over 10% since the earnings release. Even Rosa, who was the #3 commenter on the Blogging Stocks article, should realize that even in the face of a bull market condition eBay shares are having some trouble. (Rosa pointed out that laughing at other people’s ideas is a fun pastime, but she incorrectly timed the comment) No harm, no foul. eBay is now approaching an important support level of $30. Since March 2006, it has seen that price as “hard support” four times and from a technical standpoint, if it breaches it, the stock could see $27.50 as its next support level. The biggest concern is that eBay has been sliding in a BULL market. If investor sentiment changes for the markets, eBay could move down quickly."
36971,20808,2007-05-31T07:22:17-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has confirmed month long rumors by announcing that it was buying Web 2.0, new media company Stumble Upon for $75m. Despite some confusion, the logic of the deal may actually make sense. Stumble Upon, which was founded in Calgary, Canada in 2001, is something of a computer-automated web surfing tool married to a community of users. Through either their website or browser-integrated buttons users can ask for a new page and then the website will redirect them (a “Stumble”) towards something related. The sites in the system, however, are not purely random. Web Publishers can buy placements from Stumble Upon that insure a certain number of page views from Stumble Upon users per day; just another form of website marketing. It is that paid search component, along with a feature launched in April called “Stumble Thru”, which is what likely attracted eBay. StumbleThru lets a user move through the pages of a specific site with the same semi-randomness of full internet stumbling. In other words, they can “stumble” through the listings of eBay auctions, or products at eBay property, Half.com While the pricing of the deal will raise some eyebrows, and the value of Stumble Upon in the eBay product portfolio will puzzle some, the deal is not completely illogical, nor is the price. eBay spends a tremendous amount of resources keeping its site and name well publicized around the web. Stumble Upon will be an asset in those ongoing marketing efforts. Here's a breakdown in more detail: With about 2.3m users (discounted in my logic and calculations to 2m for redundant registrations and inactive accounts), eBay is paying approximately $37 per head. As a lead generation fee, that’s not much more than what eBay pays affiliate network sites. If someone, for example, creates an eBay account and than makes one bid on an auction to activate the account, eBay will pay a lead referral fee of around $25-35 plus a revenue share of won auctions. The Stumble Upon purchase price is attributing, per user, an amount in the ballpark of what eBay pays for converted leads. Using that as the metric for the deal is admittedly suspect though. It’s true not all of the Stumble Upon users will be converted (many are likely already eBay users and a majority won’t sign up) but eBay gains marketing value as well. With five million web recommendations thrown out a day, and now, some large portion of those being sure to go to eBay sites, eBay is effectively gaining a new marketing channel for a fixed upfront fee. Stumble Upon also generates revenue. It’s probably not a cash cow, but it has managed to survive with almost no outside investment. (It closed on an angel investment round in 2006). Mix that revenue to cover operating expenses and then ask: is the value of converted leads, and web marketing, over the next year or two enough to justify the price? That’s debatable, but consider one more number in the calculation: $41 . $41 would be the CPM (Cost per thousand impressions or thousand displays of a web advertisement) if the only way to value this deal were in the terms of advertising and the advertising price. Specifically: At 5m impressions per day, over 365 days, assuming no growth or churn, Stumble Upon will serve 1.825b page views in a year. Broken down to CPM, or increments of 1000 displays, that equals a fee of $41 per ad (e.g. $41 CPM). (The math is the purchase price divided by Impressions in units of 1000) If the combined actual revenue from Stumble Upon plus lead generation revenue (from converted new eBay customer sign ups or increased transactions generated from in–site stumbling) generates $20m, the CPM rate would adjust down to about $30 (same math but with the purchase price lightened by $20m to account for the revenue income). Go one step further and split that cost over two years and the CPM is down to a not so crazy seeming $15? So, in the terms of marketing expenses is the valuation of this deal absurd? Doesn’t seem so. $50m would have bee better, but $75 is not a drug induced hallucination. eBay is not buying Stumble Upon for revenue; it’s buying them for marketing and it’s buying them as a tool to help its other businesses. That's particularly necessary these days when eBay's retailing businesses are growing more slowly. Within a marketing framework, there is a clear value proposition. And using marketing/advertising metrics to back out the price, the valuation isn’t crazy. Arguably, even, a company with a strong retailing component like eBay makes an ideal buyer of Stumble Upon (Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could have been another suitor) The acquisition may not be as striking or logical a fit with eBay’s core businesses as their purchase of StubHub was, but, on the flip side, it’s a lot more natural of a contributor to eBay’s resources than internet telephony company Skype (whose purchase by eBay still puzzles many).

36003,21620,2007-05-21T07:40:26-04:00,,"On the heels of a strong 1Q07 report by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), we decided to take a look at the actual contribution of the communications subsegment of eBay’s business and its prospects for further growth. Looking first to the standard reported quarterly numbers, we see impressive but slowing revenue growth and a steady 20%-ish QoQ increase in registered users, eBay’s standard measurement of user base growth. In 1Q07, Skype added approximately 28,000 registered users per day. Of course the registered user statistic is interesting, but it is generally accepted (albeit speculative and somewhat arbitrary) that the true number of active Skype users can be divined in one of two ways: by either taking 10% of the total registered users (or about 19.6M as of end of 1Q07), or by using a multiple of about 2x of the peak concurrent users (about 18.8M). For our purposes, we will be using an average of the two.    Luckily, we have been capturing raw usage statistics since July of 2006. This gives us a solid foundation upon which to build an accurate understanding of customer adoption rates and monetization. We can see that average active users have continued to grow, but it appears that the meteoric growth of the pioneering days of Skype is eroding some in the face of VoIP competition and alternatives. As Skype is based on a free peer-to-peer network, only a small portion of Skype users actually generate revenue. Predominantly it is those users who use SkypeOut, which allows Skype calls to connect with traditional land-based phones. SkypeOut calls make up less than 17% of total Skype usage, and this number appears to have peaked. In fact, while the YoY growth of SkypeOut minutes has been impressive, there was effectively no growth from 4Q06 to 1Q07. The quarterly growth in active users, at 13.5%, is rapidly outpacing the growth in both Skype-to-Skype and SkypeOut minutes, at 1.3% and 0.0%, respectively. This is worrisome because it indicates that each additional user is spending less and less time on Skype. The demise of service offerings such as SkypeOut may be a self-fulfilling prophecy. As more users join the Skype VoIP network, there is an inverse relationship with the demand for the ability to call land-based lines, as Skype members can still call each other for free. Regardless, slowing growth of the core revenue stream will need to be offset by follow-on, value added service offerings such as Skype Prime. While overall growth is slowing, there remain very positive trends. Over the last three quarters, the growth in average revenue per active user has been growing and even accelerating. This could be attributed to the sale of licensed hardware products (such as Skype phones) as well as the up-sell of value added services to the existing user base. Additionally, the average number of concurrent users is closing the gap with the peak number of concurrent users. This indicates that while maybe they're not actually reaching out and touching someone, more and more existing users are staying signed on for longer periods. Given current user adoption and monetization trends, we expect Skype to add approximately 31,000 users/day, or just over 2.8 million users in 2Q07. This should equate to approximately $90M of revenue in the second quarter, a QoQ growth of 15.9% and YoY growth of 102%."

The postal increase that went into effect on May 14 has been a nightmare for eBay sellers.  These are some of the comments I am hearing: Regarding my own personal experience, a couple days prior to May 14, I scoured the USPS web site for the new rates, but could not find them. But, I did find the press release which gave out a limited amount of examples of what rates would be. Today, I went to the post office to mail a DVD and I told the clerk that I wanted to send it the least expensive way. She narrowed it down to four choices: letter rate, large envelope, package, or media mail. Media was immediately ruled out because it is so expensive. It think it is only useful for heavy books that weigh over a pound. She then said it was too large for letter rate, and too thick [slightly over a quarter inch] for the large envelope rate, so I had to send it by the more expensive option - package rate. When I got back to my office, I checked the Post Office's website, and realized that I was probably overcharged. It seems to me that it would easily qualify for the large envelope rate, and maybe even the letter rate. However, there are some quirks. If it doesn't bend easily, like a photograph with cardboard, it is charged a ""non-machinable surcharge"" [sorry autograph dealers]. If it has clasps, it is also subject to a surcharge. If is has an address parallel to the shorter dimension of the letter or it contains a pen, it is subject to a surcharge. If this seems confusing and feels like a hassle to you, then you can imagine how the eBay sellers feel. I think there will be a short term revenue drop for several reasons: In the next couple days, I will be publishing an article about several ways of dealing with the higher postage rates.

According to BusinessWeek, for example, Skype-partner Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has just helped pump $20 million into Skype-competitor Jajah--which, unlike Skype, offers the convenience of making calls using regular telephones.
Skype's lead in PC-based VOIP is safe for now--no less a competitor than Yahoo (YHOO) launched a competing service a while back and has been met with a collective yawn--but the company's seeming desire to focus on anything but telephony is making it vulnerable. 
Taking down the traditional telco industry will yield a massive pot of gold for whoever ends up doing it. There are still plenty of problems to solve before this happens, however, and none of them involve local search."
35118,20347,2007-05-10T03:24:22-04:00,,"I like eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), and I like Stumble Upon, but Nick Denton nails it:
Assuming Om isn't completely hallucinating, another explanation might be: eBay is still trying to justify/save its un-related Skype acquisition...by buying another un-related company.  It's almost as though eBay's successful PayPal acquisition (which was actually closely related to the company's core business) persuaded it that buying any fast-growing companies with high margins and network effects would be a good idea.
The frustrating part, for us becalmed eBay shareholders, is that Skype would have a wonderful future--if eBay weren't intent on turning it into a social networking site.  Perhaps one of these days the company will come to its senses and sell Skype to Yahoo (YHOO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), or another company that is actually in the online communications business--and then refocus on its hurting commerce cash cow."

Burke explained how the new system improves the buying experience and increases conversion rates (at least in tests). Feedback 2.0 enhances eBay's current rating system by adding more detail (the current system is nearly worthless because so many sellers have 98%+positive feedback). Buyers can now rate sellers on four criteria: item description, communications, shipping time, and shipping/handling charges. Each category gets a 1-to-5 rating, and the average score is displayed on the seller's Feedback page. The goal is to drive traffic from bad sellers to good sellers and help all sellers improve. The system was tested for 2 months in 8 global markets prior to last week's U.S. launch. In the tests, 70-75% of buyers left detailed seller ratings, and overall conversion rates increased (conversion for sellers with ratings below 3 declined). This new system should help eBay continue to drive higher revenue per listing--one key to revitalizing the core commerce business. Recent RPL gains have come as a result of reduced listings after the Ebay Store pricing hike in August. Feedback 2.0 should modestly boost RPL in the second half of 2007. EBAY 1-yr chart"
36507,20413,2007-05-25T16:00:26-04:00,,"Last week, I wrote an article about how the increase in postage may affect the revenue, on a short term basis, of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) which trades on NASDAQ. However, that may be a minor problem, compared to what might be looming on the horizon.
I always thought that eBay would eventually turn into something like a utility, where earnings and revenues would steadily increase, and eventually it would start paying a regular dividend (as long as it kept its servers and customer service, up and running). People will always have stuff to buy and sell. eBay, as an online auctioneer, is practically a de facto monopoly, just like utilities. Unfortunately, utilities are affected by government actions, and this also appears to be happening with eBay.
The April 23 issue of Forbes Magazine had a great article, which I highly recommend as a great read, about how the IRS may start cracking down on the self-employed. But what really caught my eye was on page 37 where it mentioned that the IRS may eventually require eBay and other 'middlemen' to start reporting gross sales of anyone who sells more than 100 items per year. A hundred items per year is not that many - it's less than one item every three days.
So if this goes into effect, would someone like a housewife who sells off 25 of her kid's old toys, clothes, and other household goods every quarter have to reconcile this on her tax return? [Is there a CPA in the audience? What is the tax consequence of selling a personal item that has been used at either a profit or loss?] I have a friend who inherited a couple hundred books from his father, and gave his kids the job of selling them off on eBay, one at a time. I wouldn't even want to speculate about what the taxation of those transactions would be [inheritance cost basis, etc.], if there even is any, but there would still have to be some kind of accounting to match up with what is reported to the government.
Would some sellers create new accounts with eBay when they approach 99 transactions, creating more hassles for eBay? [Who wants to be a Power Seller now?] Would eBay be responsible for trying to aggregate these accounts? If this sales reporting proposal isn't nipped in the bud, it may not be a stake in the heart of eBay, but it would certainly be a stake in its foot, causing it to stumble.

Here is the description: 
This is a BIG deal for eBay. They are finally improving their core search experience.  eBay created a new search technology a few years ago codenamed Magellan and they used it as the search engine for eBay Express. While Magellan helps to find exactly what you search for, the eBay Auctions search technology embraces the concept of ‘finding new things’ and will often return complimentary items.
For example when I search for the “iPod Nano” on eBay Express I receive hundreds of listings for Nanos but when I search for “iPod Nano” on eBay Auctions I receive “NIB Wireless Stereo Headphones Ipod Nano Generation 1” as the second listing. eBay Auctions search returns a lower quality result, which hurts their conversion rates.
It finally sounds like the auctions team is making much needed improvements. If all goes well, these improvements will continue to propel eBay’s recent surge in revenue per listing.

He notes, however, that this will remain a faith-based opinion until at least mid-summer.

Big statement, but it just amounts to short term tricks. The $331 million repurchase represents 59% of net cash flow from operations. This ratio cannot stand without long term negative consequences. The $2 billion threat represents some 60% of their current cash and marketable securities. This threat also cannot stand.

Accelerating rev/listing and GMV/listing yoy growth to 20%/12% from 11%/8% in 4Q2006 demonstrate the steady improvement in the buyer experience by better converting demand into revenue resulting in higher conversion rates and ASPs. - Stifel notes the company was able to beat revenue expectations by 4% and EPS by 10% but the drivers were not as clean as they were in 4Q06. Organic revenue was 21% on a year-over-year basis as compared to 27% reported growth. Acquisitions made over the last 12 months contributed 1 point to top-line growth. Foreign exchange due to a weaker dollar contributed an additional 5 points of growth. EPS strength relative to guidance was driven primarily by strong revenue contributions from non-GMV businesses, expense leverage and productivity, a lower tax rate, and benefits from a weaker dollar. Free cash flow for the quarter was $479 million , or 27% of revenue in the quarter. Stifel says they track several metrics on a YOY growth basis: active users 10% (4% decel), marketplace net transaction revenue 22% (2% decel), PayPal 28% (7% decel), core listings 4% (6% decel), GMV ex-currency 10% (6% decel), and non-Motors GMV of $1B categories 15% (5% decel). Firm anticipates that eBay's organic growth rate will moderate into the midteens in 2008 and low teens in 2009. They believe the company is worth 25x 2008 EV/ulFCF justifying a Buy-rating and $37 target price. eBay is a maturing, high-quality company trading at a respectable valuation. As they have said in the past, they do not believe returns in eBay shares will ever be the same as they once were but they believe the shares offer a reasonable, risk-adjusted return. Would buy on pullbacks against the $37 target. - Banc of America says they remain positive on EBAY on expectation of continued stabilization of the Marketplace which should continue to drive improvements in ASP's, conversion rates and generally higher revenue per listing (+21% Y/Y); increasing traction and scale of key asset PayPal; other opportunities including on-platform advertising from YHOO and GOOG; and margin expansion driven by continued expense leverage in S&M and G&A lines. Significant stock buyback activity could provide support through seasonally weaker quarters. They are somewhat concerned about decelerating GMV growth in the US in Q1 (8% Y/Y) vs. Q4 (14%). In addition, GMV growth (ex-forex) also decelerated in Q1 (11% Y/Y) compared to Q4 (17% Y/Y). - Piper Jaffray notes eBay reported a generally solid Q1 with strength in non-GMV revenues and increasing S&M leverage, FX benefits, and a lower tax rate driving upside. Approximately $0.01 of EPS upside was from improved operating leverage and revenue upside, $0.01 from FX benefits, and $0.01 from a lower tax rate. While the continued slowdown in core eBay listings (2% y/y) and GMV (10% y/ y currency neutral) is somewhat concerning, eBay was able to offset the lower listings and GMV through improved conversion rates and ASPs. Also, eBay continues to experience strength in the non-GMV categories, including PayPal, Skype, Shopping.com, and 3rd Party Advertising & Other, which grew at 28%, 119% y/y, 29% y/y, and 65% y/y.  Piper if upping their tgt to $39 from $37 while maintaining Market Perform rating. Notablecalls: While at first glance it looks like eBay was able to pull a beat & raise quarter, most of the upside came from favorable FX and lower tax rate. Also, growth in active users was flat q/q and up only 10% y/y. Another concern is the apparent deceleration in US GMV. International is the main driver here. Can't say I see good risk/reward here.

All in all, the picture looks worse than it did last quarter.  Skype now appears to be on track to do just under $400 million in revenue this year, down from about a $435 million trajectory last quarter.

The revenue tally was disclosed as eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported strong first quarter results and upped its 2007 outlook. eBay reported net income of $377 million, or 27 cents a share, on revenue of $1.77 billion. Excluding items, eBay reported earnings of 33 cents a share, three cents better than Thomson Financial estimates. 
eBay said second quarter revenue would be $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion with earnings of 31 cents a share to 33 cents a share. In 2007, eBay expects to report earnings of $1.30 a share to $1.34 a share on revenue of $7.2 billion to $7.45 billion. All of those projections top Wall Street estimates. 
So why focus on Skype?
I didn't buy eBay's initial rationale for buying Skype, which was roughly based on click to call functionality integrated with eBay's marketplace. Let's face it eBay's $2.6 billion acquisition of Skype in 2005 was pricey.    
That doesn't mean it won't work over time, however. To gauge Skype's success it helps to picture it as a standalone entity. On that basis, Skype's business is just swell. 
Skype had 196 million registered users at the end of the quarter, up 107 percent from a year ago. eBay sounds like it isn't in a hurry to monetize Skype either, which may be good for building a mass of users. 
eBay said a bevy of new products from Skype are ""intended to build community engagement and fuel Skype monetization over time."" Was Skype worth the price? That's yet to be determined, but growth is headed in the right direction. Here are the sequential growth rates for the last five quarters for Skype.
Not too shabby. I may have to shelve my initial skepticism about eBay's Skype purchase if this growth continues. I'm still a few $100 million in revenue from that point, but getting closer."

Originally, there was no charge for the ads. Now they charge for paid job ads, and in New York City, paid broker apartment listings. Newmark still refuses to run banner ads and has no interest in maximizing revenues.
In spite of the fact that Craigslist is private, there is a way to invest in the company. Many investors are not aware that in 2004, eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) which trades on NASDAQ, bought a 25% interest in Craigslist, ensuring a distribution of shares or share sales proceeds to eBay shareholders in the event Craigslist ever goes public."
32775,20521,2007-04-19T03:47:34-04:00,,"eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has announced earnings; Skype numbers aren’t great, certainly not enough to justify the price they paid for it. Today, however, it looks like they’re acquiring Stumbleupon. Why?
Stumbleupon is a very popular “discovery” engine which helps users find what they would like via collective intelligence. There is always an element of surprise and I have often found charming things by using the service. eBay is about to pay ~$45 Million for the company.
The StumbleUpon site says they have 2.1 million users, up from 1.7 million in December 2006. 4+ million sites are “stumbled” daily. Comscore says StumbleUpon had 6 million U.S. page views in March, doubling from the prior month. Unique visitors continue to rise dramatically: 900,000 in March, which is a 3x rise over the last year.
These are great numbers and, if nothing else, it offers eBay an outlet for its massive advertising budget for acquiring customers. Today, that budget goes to Yahoo (YHOO) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), as well as numerous other media properties.
I will not be surprised at all if eBay goes shopping for a few synergistic media properties that can absorb some of this budget and check the leakage. Here are some that I would recommend for eBay to pick up:
For a long time, I have believed that eBay should have spent money on advertising venue oriented companies, and thought that the Skype acquisition was a stupid move. Only now, it seems to me that eBay’s leadership is coming to the same conclusion!
And if you push that logic further, we get back to the same conclusion that I was at earlier on: YahooBAY."
31447,20307,2007-04-04T03:21:59-04:00,,"There were several bullish notes yesterday morning on eBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) first quarter performance. Bear Stearns Internet analyst Robert Peck increased his revenue estimate for the quarter to $1.735 billion from $1.709 billion, and raised his adjusted EPS estimate to 31 cents a share from 30 cents. Peck cited rising conversion rates and improving average selling prices for his revised forecast. Peck estimates that the company’s total listings (excluding China and Taiwan) were up 8% versus last year, with overall listings up 4%. Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan’s Imran Khan asserts that revenue per listing in the quarter could be as high as $1.95, which would be 4% above his current estimate of $1.88. One final thing on eBay: Buried in Peck’s note there’s a brief mention that eBay has denied an assertion in the well-read eBay Strategies blog that the company is planning to increase listings fees for eBay Stores. On an eBay discussion board, an eBay spokesperson wrote that the company has no plans to increase eBay Stores fees at this time. Yesterday morning, eBay was up 86 cents at $33.86."

Morgan’s Imran Khan wrote today that based on analysis of both listings and revenue per listing, he is “comfortable” that the company is “tracking ahead of Street consensus” for the quarter of $1.71 billion in revenue and profits of 30 cents a share. He says quarter-to-date listings are tracking up 8% year-over-year, or 11% ex-China and Taiwan. U.S. listings are up 2%, ex-Motors and Stores, but down 0.9% overall. Khan maintains his Overweight rating on the stock, asserting that “better than expected revenue growth and improving margins will lead to multiple expansion and relative stock price outperformance.” Meanwhile, Scott Devitt, internet analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, this morning advised investors that there are four reasons investors should be buying the stock ahead of the company’s mid-April report on first quarter results: Today, eBay is up 24 cents at $31.98.

29646,20347,2007-03-15T06:09:10-04:00,,"In a move that says more about the revenue potential of its core business than any numbers reported to date, eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) Skype announced the launch of two new products that have little to do with the core service and are already widely available elsewhere: local product reviews and a monetize-yourself expert network directory.   This strategy, of course, mimics the one that resulted in eBay buying Skype in the first place (""Core business decelerating? Quick, acquire a fast-growing company in a completely unrelated business and then think of a way to explain it!""). Just because there is precedent for this strategy doesn't mean it's a good one. The local restaurant/product/etc review business is a tough nut to crack, and companies with far more resources than Skype's have found it slow going. Keen and other companies, meanwhile, have been at the telephone-expert opportunity for years, and they haven't hit the jackpot. If Skype didn't have another business to run, none of this would matter. But it does. And this Skype user, at least, can think of a hundred things that Skype could do to improve its basic service before it rushes off to compete with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Yahoo (YHOO), Ingenio, and others in un-related businesses. (Such as? Such as this wicked-cool one-number-forever service offered by GrandCentral) So then why would Skype do this? Perhaps because, as its skeptics have long suggested, it is finding VOIP revenue hard to generate. The last batch of numbers made it look as though things were fine, but today's announcements suggest that they aren't."
29755,20311,2007-03-16T02:54:33-04:00,,"Investors gain insight and confidence on their investments by applying metrics and analysis that not everyone has ready access to. While so many investors remain focused on the often misleading earnings per share [EPS] and P/E ratio (even fretting about quarterly results down to the penny), free cash flow is the true lifeblood of any company, and is the only accurate way to measure a firm's cash-generating health. At Complete Growth Investor, we calculate various measures of free cash flow on all of our stocks, from true free cash flow [TFCF], to structural free cash flow [SFCF], to -- where appropriate -- maintenance structural free cash flow [MSFCF]. True free cash flow is cash from operations minus capital expenditures minus tax benefits from stock options. Structural free cash flow (what Warren Buffett calls ""owner's earnings"") is net income from operations plus depreciation and amortization minus capital expenditures. These are two key ways to measure the health and growth of a business, and both show realities that mere earnings per share numbers often miss. So when we run the most recent numbers on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), look at what we find. The stock is less expensive than EPS suggests.  For the full twelve months of 2006, eBay's true free cash flow increased 12.8% year-over-year to $1.58 billion. (Interestingly to me, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) generated $1.8 billion in TFCF last year, so not much more than eBay, although considerably more per share, since eBay's share count is about four times higher than Google's.) Structural free cash flow was up 2.9%, not much, but still something. eBay was able to grow free cash flow even though expenses continued to jump much more than sales on a percentage basis. eBay's diluted share count increased 2.3% last year to 1.425 billion shares, while its cash, investments and equivalents increased 53.3%, to $3.2 billion, giving the company an enterprise value at today's $31 share price of approximately $41 billion. That puts the stock at 25.8x TFCF and (less meaningfully) 35.5x SFCF, much better looking than the stock's trailing P/E of 39x. Management expects approximately 20% sales growth this year, and if expenses are in-line, FCF could grow as much. That would make today's FCF multiples only a modest premium for a company with an immodest competitive moat. The question is, though, will expenses be in-line with sales growth? Last year, while sales grew 31.1% to $5.96 billion, total operating expenses jumped 43.5% to $3.28 billion. Cost of sales, surprisingly, was a major contributor to the problem, increasing 53.5% to $1.25 billion. Sales and marketing, which is what everyone complains about because eBay is spending so much to advertise, only grew 36.6% to $1.61 billion. It's still a very significant cost, to be sure (that's a lot of dough, and much of it is going straight to competitor Google), but at 36% this spending didn't grow much more than sales, which grew 31%. Meanwhile, general and administrative costs also took a big jump, up 50.6% to $978 million, partly the result of acquisitions and growing newer businesses such as Skype. With expenses up across the board, eBay's income from operations in 2006 actually declined, to $1.42 billion from $1.44 billion in 2005. And final GAAP EPS was just $0.79 compared to $0.78 the year before, thanks to interest gains. However, eBay's 12.8% growth in true free cash flow helped off-set this disappointment, even though some of it was due to management delaying payments. And with 20% top-line growth expected this year, alongside moderating expenses, bottom-line gains are expected to return in earnest, with growth estimates in the mid- to high-teens. Free cash flow should grow at least as much. Overall, in eBay's case, the true free cash flow numbers suggest a more reasonably priced stock, while the earnings per share multiple would only suggest an expensive one.

On a reported basis (incl. Taiwan and China), QTD listings are tracking up 8% Y/Y. Ex. Taiwan and China, listings are up 11%. As of 3/16, the firm has tracked 507.4M total new listing, with 369.4M in the US, UK, and DE. Based on analysis and checks, the firm believes that RPL in 1Q is tracking slightly above their estimate of $1.88 due to product mix and stable conversion trends, and as such, they are confident that 1Q is trending above consensus estimates.Based on their checks, the firm believes that keyword pricing remains stable. According to SEM executives at the JPMorgan Internet Conference, Yahoo!'s Project Panama launch has resulted in lower click prices for brand advertisers. As companies with strong brands such as eBay tend to attract more clicks, they in turn are required to pay less for the same ad position.

Needless to say I am an eBAY shareholder, albeit a rather restless one at the moment. Now that Skype is inside eBAY, however, I’d really like to see it perform, grow, deliver the grandiose numbers that were projected … Makes me look for strategic options to achieve exactly that! I found an answer, actually. Like many other Indians living outside India, I make a lot of calls to my family and friends. Recently, I have started using Skype out, which costs about 15c / minute. I found out, however, that Reliance has a much better deal : 11c / minute. That means that, even in cheap calling, Skype is not the best deal. That’s pathetic. I don’t have a number for how large the “Indians Calling Home” market is. I am sure it is very large, very dedicated, very stable. Because, culturally, Indians are close to their families, and being inherently community oriented they tend to CALL. (I call home religiously every Friday.) So, Skype, please wake up, and figure out how to offer a deal to this market segment that is significantly cheaper than what you are offering right now.

25605,20428,2007-01-31T03:24:49-05:00,,"eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) recent decision to prohibit all real-money trading [RMT] of items from virtual worlds has ostensibly been taken on grounds of the ""legal complexities"" these trades throw up. The legal ownership of items acquired within gameworlds such as Blizzard's World of Warcraft remains a gray area, as the intellectual property is arguably owned by the gameworld publisher and not the individual player. Terms of use contracts between publishers and players in many gameworlds, for example in Sqaure Enix's Final Fantasy XI, in any case explicitly prohibit RMT. eBay's move out of RMT seems designed to limit liability in the event that publishers pursue it as the facilitator of these dubious trades.
The move is short-sighted. eBay's market power stems from the defensibility of its network effect - buyers come to eBay because the sellers are all there in what for eBay is an ongoing virtuous circle. Breaking that circle for a specific category of goods or services is probably not a reversible decision - once a network effect has established itself at a new marketplace within that category the same defensibility that secures eBay's wider business is very likely to prevent eBay clawing back a share of that market segment.
The secondary market for virtual assets was estimated at a value of $900 million in 2005, with forecasts for it to reach $7 billion by 2009. As long ago as 2002 Edward Castronova, an expert in the economies of virtual worlds, posited that Norrath (the Everquest gameworld) had an economy that made it the 77th richest ""country"" on earth. eBay is turning its back, probably irreversibly, on a vast and growing market.
Dedicated RMT markets, most notably IGE, are poised to capitalize on eBay's abandonment of the RMT space. IGE has already bought out its main independent secondary market competitor, Yantis Enterprises, in 2004, which with eBay's departure leaves as its main competition game publishers' own exchanges such as Sony's (NYSE:SNE)  Station Exchange. As publisher marketplaces deal only in their own games, these sites are far more limited and eBay's move out of RMT means that IGE should be able to build its own network effect in the RMT space virtually unopposed.

25095,20454,2007-01-25T06:35:31-05:00,,"Several firms are commenting on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) after the co issued surprisingly strong results and guidance last night (see conference call transcript and earnings report): - Piper Jaffray says that while eBay produced a strong quarter with upside to their estimates, the majority of the upside came from foreign exchange. Listing growth has slowed considerably (12% y/ y); while monetization improved to $1.75 (ex forex) in Q4 from $1.65 in Q3, it failed to reach firm's target of $1.80. Unclear how much of the monetization improvement was Q4 seasonality. Revenue per active users improved to $13.05 (ex forex) from $12.01 which is a positive sign and slightly above the bar the firm set in their last note as an indication of a reversal. Investors should continue to watch this to see how much seasonality and one-time high demand products affected this metric in Q4. Usage growth continues to decelerate as active users increased only 14% y/ y in Q4, down from 17% in Q3, and at 82M was 2M below the 84M necessary to stabilize this metric. GMV growth (ex forex) flattened to 16% y/y growth, and likely benefited from higher ASPs in the quarter. Despite the stock's strong positive reaction in the after-hours market, they believe eBay failed to produce a quarter that would indicate sustainable acceleration of growth. Firm believes an assumption of a declining growth rate for core is still the more realistic scenario. However, despite deteriorating fundamentals, the company is likely to continue to produce acceptable earnings results, helped by non-core factors, in the near term and as such, the stock is likely near its floor. They are therefore increasing their rating to Market Perform to reflect this reality and increasing price target to $30 from $25. They do believe that the near term cash generation of eBay will eventually catch up with its deteriorating fundamentals and slow down, but until then, investors are likely to give EBAY a more generous multiple. - Deutsche Bank reiterates HOLD investment rating on shares of eBay despite the solid 4Q results that came in soundly ahead of expectations. While they are encouraged by the solid performance (and modest improvement in the underlying metrics), it remains a little difficult to fully extrapolate exactly where eBay's upside came from, especially with listings/transactions up 10%/11% Y/Y and GMV up 16% (FX adjusted). Despite the respectable performance in 4Q (that should be well received by investors today), theythink that eBay faces longer term structural challenges in its business (that may be on hold in the near term). Specifically, the company still has to aggressively invest in demand (via marketing) to generate transaction volumes and GMV, a concept that may be fine tuned but difficult to defend against as off-line retailers (i.e. BestBuy, Wal-Mart, Circuit City, etc.) spend online to take advantage of lower-priced online media buys. As a result, seller feedback still remains negative from the notion that sellers are seeking for growth in sales and profits (for which growth  is proving increasingly elusive these days). While the stock will be up on short covering as a result of the 4Q strength, they think investors should wait on the sidelines to see if the 4Q uptick was a seasonal event or a sustainable trend. Deutsche is raising their 2007 EPS estimate from $1.19 to $1.27, with revs now at $7.201bn from $7.007bn. $100mn in revs came from the StubHub acquisition. Tgt goes to $32 from $29. - RBC Capital notes listings growth decelerated, but EBAY rebalanced the US marketplace, increased conversions, and stabilized ASPs. PayPal shrugged off the competitive threat from Google Checkout. Currency and acquisitions also added to growth. Finally, eBay will benefit from the repurchase of another $1b of stock, and the authorization of an incremental $2bn over the next 2 years. Management raised guidance due to StubHub, which accounted for an incremental $105mm-$120mm, carryover of strong trends in 4Q06 accounting for about $60mm, offset by the exit from China of about $10mm-$15mm. Using full 2008 estimates on EBAY (vs. blended 2007/2008),the firm now arrives at a price target of $38. They believe shares will have some follow through beyond the one-day earnings related move today, giving the company the benefit of the doubt in the near term. RBC is unsure whether this is a situation driven by easy compares and currency upside, or whether to believe the trends will remain strong throughout 2007. Maintains Sector Perform rating. Notablecalls: Looks like short covering will be the name of the game today. Yet, decelerating listings and usage growth will continue to weigh on the stock after the shorts are out of the way. The stock traded as high as $34 in after hrs. It may have some more upside in it, but I suspect it won't be more than say half a point. EBAY 1-yr:"

        This is important because the 3P marketplace is one of 2 main pillars sustaining Amazon.com's profitability.
        Either that, or this deceleration shows problems for another company.","I haven't written on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) for more than one year. I was short and covered back then because my models didn't show any more fundamental deterioration. Indeed, since then Amazon.com's fundamentals (and earnings) have improved significantly. In large part, this improvement was driven by AWS (Amazon Web Services), and for now there doesn't seem much reason to believe that the AWS pillar shows any weakness.There is another pillar to Amazon.com's fundamental performance, though. That pillar is its 3P (Third-Party) marketplace. This marketplace is akin to what Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) or eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) do, in the sense that it's not Amazon.com itself selling products to its customers. Instead, the products are listed, sold and fulfilled by third parties (though up to 40% of 3P fulfillment is now done by Amazon). For these services, Amazon.com charges a commission.As it's easy to see, both Alibaba and eBay have no trouble being profitable (and indeed, having very high margins - eBay operating margins exceed 25%, Alibaba's are near 30%). The business of letting third parties use your platform to sell their wares and just collect commissions from them is clearly a very lucrative business.Recently, I've started seeing worrying signs for this particular pillar - the 3P marketplace. For the longest of times, 3P grew faster than Amazon.com as a whole. Such was very nice for Amazon.com, for as we saw the 3P marketplace is likely to have higher margins that Amazon.com as a whole as well. However, there are now signs that either this growth might be seeing deceleration, or the sample leading to that conclusion is, itself, having problems.What are those signs? I am speaking about ChannelAdvisor.com's (NYSE:ECOM) regular ""online same-store-sales"" reports. ChannelAdvisor provides services to third parties selling in many different online marketplaces, and tracks those customers' sales trends. It then anonymously aggregates those sales trends into same-store sales for those disparate online marketplaces, and reports them on a monthly basis (with more detail and periodicity during the Christmas season). As such, ChannelAdvisor's SSS report works as a possible sample of each marketplace's ongoing activity.What this ChannelAdvisor report has been showing as of late, is some significant deceleration in the same-store sales trend for Amazon.com. Indeed, as of the June 2016 report (out late yesterday) this deceleration seems to have gone all the way down to +11% year-on-year:Source: ChannelAdvisor.comIt might be possible that part of this deceleration is due to ChannelAdvisor's own customer mixture. However, given that ChannelAdvisor serves a large number of customers, it's unlikely that ChannelAdvisor's deceleration isn't also being felt to some extent at the overall Amazon.com 3P marketplace. Since this affects one of Amazon.com's most profitable segments (along with AWS), this development might thus have significance for Amazon.com as a whole.This deceleration took place during the whole of Q2 2016, so pretty soon we'll see if this translated to weakness for Amazon.com. Amazon.com should report Q2 2016 earnings on or around July 21.An Alternative ExplanationOf course, maybe Amazon.com's 3P marketplace isn't slowing down at all. ChannelAdvisor itself says that its reported SSS numbers can deviate significantly from those being experienced by retailers. Namely due to:Source: ChannelAdvisor.comHowever, if this significant deceleration isn't being felt by Amazon.com, then it's being felt by ChannelAdvisor's existing customers and represents underperformance for them.Now, ChannelAdvisor is supposed to help gain sales, not underperform the market its customers sell into by a large margin. If ChannelAdvisor's customers - and certainly Amazon.com represents most of them, because Amazon.com is the largest US 3P marketplace - are suffering this much versus the market they are in, then this might be a large negative for ChannelAdvisor itself.ConclusionThe sudden erosion on ChannelAdvisor-reported Amazon.com same-store sales is a worrying datapoint. This is so because the 3P marketplace is one of the 2 large pillars which underpin Amazon.com's newfound profitability. Were growth to slow significantly at Amazon.com's marketplace, and Amazon.com's earnings growth would likely be slower than expected as well.However, it might also happen that the problem is not Amazon.com's at all. In that case, it is ChannelAdvisor investors who have to worry about it. If Amazon.com is experiencing no unexpected 3P slowdown, then it's just ChannelAdvisor's customers experiencing it. If this isn't negative for Amazon.com, then it's very negative for ChannelAdvisor. Indeed, it might be negative for ChannelAdvisor either way, because Amazon.com's 3P marketplace is the largest in the US and thus certainly touches most of ChannelAdvisor's customer base."
3880106,56112,2016-02-10T15:38:21-05:00,"ChannelAdvisor is in growth-stock purgatory because its revenue growth in 2016 (and likely in 2017) simply isn't high enough to be of interest to most technology investors.Under the surface, the company is making meaningful changes in its go-to-market approach.The margin improvement is a major positive, and the decision to focus on larger accounts and shed empty-calorie revenue is painful, but the right call.At the current valuation, ChannelAdvisor isn't interesting, but it's worth watching over the next few years if the stock continues to languish.","If I had to pick the number one most obvious secular trend in the world today, it would be the increasing adoption of technology. eCommerce is a big part of that, and within eCommerce, ChannelAdvisor (NYSE:ECOM) has carved out an enviable niche helping a broad range of clients efficiently and seamlessly sell through various channels.ChannelAdvisor is well-regarded in the industry, to the extent that its data actually moves stocks. Its own stock, however, has languished over the past year, as take rate compression driven by a shift to larger accounts is weighing on revenue growth. The stock isn't cheap enough for me to be interested yet, but I do think some of the fundamental improvements in the business may be flying under the radar of growth/momentum investors who take one look at the 10% revenue growth guidance and thumb their noses.With that, ChannelAdvisor is one worth watching over the next few years, particularly if 2017 revenue guidance disappoints (as I expect it very well may).Margin Performance Good…While ChannelAdvisor had been run at or around break-even prior to its IPO, after coming public, management made the conscious decision to invest more heavily in the business to drive faster revenue growth. This led to pretty significant losses in terms of both adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow.The company was originally targeting a slow march to break-even over the next few years, but got there early. Thanks to operating leverage, improving gross margins, and a strategic evolution I'll discuss momentarily, ECOM posted positive adjusted EBITDA of $5.4 million in Q4 and positive $1.4 million for the full year. It sounds like they're planning to continue to invest - guidance for 2016 is for break-even to positive $3 million in adjusted EBITDA - but break-even is certainly much more palatable to the investment community (as one analyst put it) than losses in the double-digit millions.Margin, rather than revenue growth at all costs, is increasingly a focus here. ECOM's customer base has been very 80/20 over the years - a small handful of customers contribute the vast majority of revenues and GMV. As I understand it, the top 6% of customers contribute nearly half of GMV, and the top 100 (~3.5%) account for more than a quarter of revenue. On the other hand, the smallest 1000 customers (35% of total customer count) account for merely 6-7 % of revenue.Over the past few years, the company has seen these smaller customers (ex. power sellers on eBay doing $50,000 a month in volume) growing much more slowly than large customers; moreover, they exhibit higher churn. All in all, larger customers have a 3x higher ratio of lifetime value to acquisition cost than smaller customers - and in fact, at the very low end, the company found that unit economics on very small customers were actually unprofitable.Through a mixture of soft and hard tactics, ChannelAdvisor is now working on deemphasizing customers who drive less than $30,000 per year in revenue (and particularly less than $15,000). The sales team is being incentivized to pursue larger accounts, acceptance criteria have been tightened, and smaller customers are now required to prepay a higher amount - all of which will contribute to a mix shift over time.… But It'll Weigh On RevenueShedding empty-calorie profitless revenue is a good thing for the company - instead of spinning their wheels on accounts that will never yield anything to the bottom line, they will be freeing up resources to pursue accounts that will. I like that they took their medicine on this, so to speak - the only problem is, the market wants to see revenue growth out of ChannelAdvisor, and this evolution is going to weigh on revenue growth pretty significantly.For context, the e-Commerce growth rate is usually pegged at 15% by ChannelAdvisor, comScore (NASDAQ:SCOR), and others, with ChannelAdvisor historically having grown in excess of this rate. Of course, this is a broad aggregate and there are of course winners and losers within that figure. Over the past few years, the smaller sellers have been the losers, while the bigger sellers have been the winners. ChannelAdvisor has seen this in its own results, and public data from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) confirms this, with the latter seeing pretty tepid GMV growth over the past few years.While moving upmarket will help ChannelAdvisor continue to match or outpace eCommerce growth on a GMV basis, the problem is that the bigger its customers get, the less they pay. The shift in ECOM's GMV mix from smaller to larger customers (both deliberate and organic) has been compressing take rates over the past few years, as I demonstrate in the chart below. (Please note that 2016 numbers are based on management's revenue guidance and an assumption of 15% GMV growth, which I'll get to momentarily).Source: my own chart, based on data from ECOM filings and conference callsIndeed, with management guiding to 10-12% revenue growth in 2016, any reasonable of GMV growth suggests further compression in take rates.Source: my own analysisWhile ECOM management implied that they should start to lap some of the unfavorable comparisons this year and move revenue growth closer to GMV growth, I'm not so sure this is a reasonable expectation.ECOM doesn't explicitly disclose take rates by customer type, but did provide some color how it breaks down on the Q4 pre-announce call last year. COO David Spitz:Key in on that line. With the ""new logos"" clearly gravitating towards bigger names (like Johnson & Johnson or even PFSweb (NASDAQ:PFSW)), I think it's reasonable to expect continued mix shift towards larger sellers. With that, I don't know if 140 bps is really the floor for blended take rates; it could take another year of revenue growth below GMV growth for things to settle out.In the ChannelAdvisor's defense, they're relying a little less than they used to on volume discounting, and reevaluating their pricing tiers to ensure that as customers grow, the arrangement is still mutually beneficial. This may help boost some of the ultra-low take rates on very large accounts. Still, I'd be cautious expecting revenue growth to immediately jump to 20%+ and stay there starting in 2017.… When Will It Be Cheap Enough? We're Not There YetNotwithstanding the issues I've discussed, ChannelAdvisor is still a good business. While there are a number of smaller competitors, none appear to have the scale or technology to serve major clients as effectively as ECOM (although these competitors might pick up some of the small-seller business that ECOM is walking away from).I suppose there's also the risk of insourcing if channels continue to concentrate and the historical fragmentation of e-Commerce lessens, but major clients have historically worked with ad agencies anyway, and Amazon has actually brought clients to ECOM because it sees the value proposition. I don't mean to make light of this issue - it pays to watch the competition in technology - but as of right now, I think ChannelAdvisor has a pretty good competitive position.The question, of course, is how much that's worth. The return to break-even-ish EBITDA is a very big plus in my book - and while I'm a little surprised the market didn't give the company more credit for that accomplishment, I'm really not surprised (as we'll get to in a second). While I'm comfortable assuming that long-term adjusted EBITDA margins can be comfortably double-digit, it's going to be quite a while before the company can be reasonably valued on profit metrics. In the meanwhile, ECOM will continue to trade on revenues.At first glance, ECOM's ~2x forward revenue multiple doesn't look terribly expensive in the SaaS landscape - but its low double digit growth rate has to be taken into account, as the companies with multiples in the 3-5x range are typically growing 25%+.Can ECOM get there? I'm not sure. The company seems very confident in its ability to outgrow the e-Commerce market, and I think a teens growth expectation for e-Commerce is well supported. ECOM still has plenty of accounts to penetrate - they only have 34% of the top 500 internet retailers, for example - so I think slightly above-market growth is a reasonable expectation.As I said, though, I think it may be two full years before they can return to this level, given the dynamics around take rate compression. With that, while ECOM doesn't look absurdly expensive if you believe in the long-term story, neither does it look cheap.The one wildcard here is Asia. Most of ECOM's Asian business has historically been working with Chinese manufacturers selling product on American marketplaces. A couple years ago, ChannelAdvisor announced its integration with Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) Tmall. Revenues in this area are still fairly nascent, but could add some juice to the growth rate if it takes off. (This doesn't appear to be the case in 2016, as management's guidance already bakes in these revenues.)Wrapping It UpChannelAdvisor feels like a stock in purgatory - it's not growing fast enough to be interesting to most technology/growth-oriented investors, but on the other hand, it's not profitable and thus not of interest to most value-oriented investors. I don't have much interest in a company trading at >2x revenues that's neither generating cash flow nor growing in excess of 20% per year, but I do think management deserves credit for some of the quiet (but important) changes they're making to the business.All that said, I believe ChannelAdvisor will return to better revenue growth in the out years, and while today's price isn't right for me, there's certainly a price at which I'd be willing to own it.Disclaimer: Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions.

4024681,47861,2016-11-18T12:51:32-05:00,"Since its IPO, ChannelAdvisor's stock has been all over the place: soaring to sky-high valuations based on revenue growth, and then crashing down to single-digits as growth decelerated.ChannelAdvisor is currently in the midst of a transition: shifting its focus away from revenue growth and instead towards profitability.Because of this shift, ChannelAdvisor no longer has the same ""excitement"" factor as many other small-cap high-growth tech stocks, leading many investors to overlook it.This creates a solid buying opportunity for long-term investors.","ChannelAdvisor (NYSE:ECOM) is a company that's not on many investors' radar, but it should be. The company is often overlooked because it's a small tech stock that's not following the typical small-tech-stock blueprint of chasing revenue growth. ChannelAdvisor has been there, done that, and certainly has the scars to prove it. After watching its stock price plummet nearly 80% over the course of 2014-2015, ChannelAdvisor's management did something that few small tech companies do: shifted its business model to stop chasing revenue growth and instead move towards sustainable profitability.Where are we and how did we get here?The past couple years for ChannelAdvisor have been interesting, to say the least. The company IPO'd in mid-2013 at $14 and saw its stock price soar to nearly $50 over the next eight months. Then, just as quickly as it rose, the stock slid back to its IPO level in 2014 before crashing down into single-digits to start 2015. Currently, the stock is hovering in the low-teens, almost exactly where it started three years ago.ECOM data by YChartsFor the first part of this story, ChannelAdvisor fit the mold of your standard small-cap, high-growth tech company. Following its IPO, the company was posting quarterly revenue growth in the 25-30% range. There are few things that Wall Street loves more than sky-high revenue growth from a tech company, and this was a game that ChannelAdvisor played well.However, as it often happens, these growth expectations get carried away - I was guilty of this myself, at one point assuming 30% growth would continue through at least 2017. As valuations get pushed higher and higher, the soaring stock price comes to resemble a house of cards, where one minor misstep can bring the whole thing crashing down. Revenue growth creates excitement, the stock skyrockets, and everything is great… until it isn't. Often the downfall results from an oddly-contradictory Wall Street mindset, where analysts ""expect"" revenue growth to beat expectations, with dire consequences for coming up short.That's what happened to ChannelAdvisor in 2014-2015, as its new customer counts began to come up short of inflated expectations and revenue growth tapered off to a good-but-not-great level.(Source: Company Filings)Changing Course - Shifting from Growth to ProfitabilityRather than doubling down, as many companies seem to do in this situation, ChannelAdvisor's management went a different route: it re-evaluated its approach. In 2015, it replaced founder Scot Wingo as CEO with David Spitz, previously the CFO. They also made a shift to abandon their growth strategy, and instead focus more on profitability, sustainability, and ultimately scalability.Previously, ChannelAdvisor had been the epitome of a ""growth-at-any-cost"" strategy, spending a massive amount of money on sales & marketing. At its peak in the first quarter of 2014, ChannelAdvisor spent over 70% of revenue on sales & marketing expenses. While this strategy certainly generated growth, it also burned through cash at an alarming rate, leading the company to make a secondary stock offering and raising concerns that further dilution may be on the horizon.With the new focus on profitability, management has explained that not all customers are equal. ChannelAdvisor's platform is designed as a ""scaling solution,"" not a starter kit, and thus provides the most value to businesses that have already achieved at least $15k in annual e-commerce sales. Not surprisingly, these larger customers are much more profitable for ChannelAdvisor, leading management to focus more on this group while phasing out its lower-value customers.In short, ChannelAdvisor has stopped trying to add new customers for the sake of adding new customers, and is instead focused on gaining and retaining high-quality (and high-profitability) customers.ChannelAdvisor: A Cloud-Based E-commerce EnablerSo what does ChannelAdvisor actually do? As its stock ticker suggests, ChannelAdvisor provides a cloud-based e-commerce platform to businesses, allowing product retailers and manufacturers to drastically expand the reach of their e-commerce operations, while at the same time reducing the operational complexity of doing so. The e-commerce industry is far more fragmented and complex than most consumers realize, and ChannelAdvisor makes it easy for businesses to manage it all from one easy platform.(Source: Company Presentation)In short, ChannelAdvisor enables businesses to easily list their products and manage inventory and pricing across numerous e-commerce marketplaces (Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Jet (JET), various international sites, etc.), as well as manage their digital advertising efforts across numerous channels (Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Pinterest (PINIT), etc.), all from one central platform.This is an attractive business model, as consumers increasingly embrace the power of online shopping. Global e-commerce sales are currently projected to top $4 trillion by 2020, as it quickly becomes standard for major retailers and manufacturers to have a robust and widespread online presence. If e-commerce is the gold rush, ChannelAdvisor is selling the shovels.Outlook & ConclusionChannelAdvisor has shifted its focus, implemented a plan, and thus far has done a remarkable job of following through on it. The company has generated positive free cash flow for the past five quarters, and is steadily marching towards profitability. Revenue growth, despite no longer being the primary focus, has remained steady in the 10-20% range, and CEO David Spitz has stated in earnings calls that the company anticipates an inflection in the growth rate in 2017 as this transition becomes more complete.(Source: Company Filings)While a lot remains to be seen, ChannelAdvisor's stock is at the very least worth keeping an eye on. The stock may never generate the same excitement as other high-flying tech companies, but the shifting business strategy certainly presents an attractive opportunity for long-term, buy-and-hold investors."

Currently the stock is hovering around its 52-week high. The company delivered good results in the first quarter of 2020 and remained unaffected to the coronavirus pandemic. The company has a couple of strong growth drivers, which will drive its revenue higher in the coming years. Long-term investors can buy the stock around the current price.ChannelAdvisor offers its customers a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) e-commerce platform. The platform helps brands and retailers expand sales by connecting with consumers around the world through hundreds of channels, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). The company offers fulfillment solutions which help its customers connect to their supply chain. The company helps its customers send their web visitors directly to authorized resellers. To ensure that its customers operate on the same version of its software, ChannelAdvisor offers a single code base and multi-tenant software architecture.Source: PixabaySaaS PlatformChannelAdvisor's SaaS e-commerce platform for online sales is its primary growth driver. Through this platform, the company offers solutions to its customers (brands and retailers) that help them easily integrate, manage and optimize their online sales across lots of available channels. The platform provides a single web-based interface which offers a unified view enabling the company's customers to cost effectively manage product listings, inventory availability, orders and fulfillment, and data analytics. Since this platform makes online sales simple with reporting and analytics, it enjoys good demand and popularity among brands and retailers. According to a report:ChannelAdvisor's SaaS revenue will grow at a similar rate. However, the company doesn't provide its SaaS revenue separately. It reports its total revenue. Its total revenue for full-year 2019 was $130.0 million.Although amid fierce competition, registering a CAGR of 12.64% for revenue growth is difficult, it is not impossible for ChannelAdvisor. The company offers automation, analytics and optimization tools to its customers, which help them grow their businesses. As a result, ChannelAdvisor can retain its existing customers and attract new customers. Therefore, I believe the company will be able to achieve low-teens growth rate in the long term.ModulesThe company offers a number of modules, which is its another growth driver. These modules include marketplaces, digital marketing, where to buy and product intelligence. Each module is integrated with the platform's underlying inventory management system, templates and reporting system. A particular module integrates with a particular type of channel, such as third-party marketplaces, digital marketing websites or authorized reseller websites. These modules also support specific online functionalities, which allow customers to modify online storefronts, employ media, advertise products, etc.The marketplaces module helps customers connect to third-party marketplaces, while the digital marketing module connects customers to comparison shopping websites. The where to buy module helps customers provide their web visitors up-to-date information about the authorized resellers. The product intelligence module provides brands and retailers insights about online assortment, product coverage gaps and pricing trends.The company offers its software suite through the modules. Each module is priced individually. These modules strengthen the company's SaaS platform and help grow revenue. However, the company doesn't provide its revenue from modules separately. If we assume the modules are parts of the SaaS platform (since the main software is offered through them), we can say they will also grow at a CAGR of low-teens in the long term.ChannelAdvisor's competitors include Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Salesforce B2C Commerce (NYSE:CRM), Oracle NetSuite SuiteCommerce (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP Commerce Cloud (NYSE:SAP). These companies are more resourceful than ChannelAdvisor. ChannelAdvisor competes with several other smaller privately-held companies as well.The e-commerce software market is highly competitive. The market is in an early stage of development and therefore the competitive dynamics of the market is difficult to predict. In addition, the market is subject to rapid technological advancement, and therefore it is required by ChannelAdvisor to regularly upgrade its software platform.For connecting to channels, several brands and retailers develop their own in-house software platform, and several channels offer software tools to brands and retailers for free, which make competition for ChannelAdvisor fiercer. In order to handle this competitive pressure, ChannelAdvisor needs to remain innovative and purpose-driven.ChannelAdvisor's main competitive advantage is that it offers analytical support to customers. According to a report:I believe the company handles competition very well.ChannelAdvisor's first-quarter 2020 total revenues came in at $32.0 million, an increase of 1.5% from the first quarter of 2019. The company's fixed subscription fees came in at $25.8 million, an increase of 1.4% from the first quarter of 2019. Variable revenues were $6.2 million, an increase of 1.5% from the first quarter of 2019. GAAP net income came in at $2.0 million, or $0.07 per share, compared to a net loss of $2.3 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.5 million compared to $2.6 million in the year-ago period. The company generated free cash flow of $4.7 million during the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.7 million in the year-ago period.The company delivered good results amid a sea of uncertainty due to the coronavirus pandemic. It remained unaffected to the pandemic, and therefore its share price created a new 52-week high after the coronavirus sell-off. I am bullish on the stock because I expect that a surge in online sales will happen now since people will stay home most of the time. ChannelAdvisor's service will be needed more by brands and retailers, and therefore the company's revenue will increase. Apart from recent trends, global e-commerce revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.1% from 2020 to 2024, which is also favorable for ChannelAdvisor.ChannelAdvisor's most comparable peers include Shopify, Salesforce, Oracle and SAP. ChannelAdvisor's non-GAAP forward PE multiple is 21.39x compared to Shopify's 1,668.91x, Salesforce's 63.93x, Oracle's 13.62x and SAP's 25.67x. ChannelAdvisor's trailing 12-month price to sales multiple is 3.08x compared to Shopify's 60.40x, Salesforce's 8.92x, Oracle's 4.54x and SAP's 5.49x. ChannelAdvisor's trailing 12-month price to cash flow multiple is 23.46x compared to Salesforce's 40.32x, Oracle's 13.25x and SAP's 41.69x.ChannelAdvisor is attractively valued compared to its peers. The company has a strong balance sheet comprising of $56.35 million of cash and $15.14 million of debt. The company is cheaply valued despite it having a couple of strong growth drivers. Its SaaS platform is a feature-rich e-commerce software platform. Its modules perfectly complement the SaaS platform. The only problem of ChannelAdvisor is that it doesn't generate significant revenue. I believe the company's SaaS platform coupled with the modules will help grow revenue meaningfully in the coming years. Once the revenue base (source of major and regular part of total revenue) starts to expand, the share price will rise significantly. Therefore holding the stock for the long term is essential for making big profit.In the last five years, the company's revenue has increased at a CAGR of 8.89%. I expect revenue will grow at low teens in the next five years. The basis of my expectation is the report presented in the growth drivers section. Trailing 12-month revenue is $130.4 million. If revenue increases at a CAGR of 13% in the next five years, its mid-2025 revenue will be $240.3 million, or $8.47 per share. In the last five years, the company's shares have traded between the price-to-sales multiples of 1x and 3.9x. Applying a price-to-sales multiple of 3.9x on the company's mid-2025 revenue per share, I get $33 as the mid-2025 share price.Rapid technological advancements are driving the e-commerce market. For retaining existing customers and attracting new customers, ChannelAdvisor must be able to enhance and improve its existing products and introduce new products that can quickly adapt to these technological advancements. If the company fails to do so, it won't be able to retain existing customers or attract new customers. As a result, its revenue growth and operating results could be negatively impacted.For growing its revenue, the company depends on its relationships with various third parties, such as technology, content and logistics providers. Integrating their technology and content with the company's products is a time-consuming job and requires significant resources. If after doing so, the integrated product is not well-accepted in the market, the company's brand and reputation could be negatively impacted, which in turn could adversely affect revenue growth.ChannelAdvisor said in its first-quarter 2020 earnings call that it saw a broad acceleration in GMV (gross merchandise value) processed on its platform during the initial phase of the pandemic, since a huge amount of consumer spending shifted online this time. I believe online sales will continue to remain expanded in the rest of 2020, which will drive the company's revenue higher. The global e-commerce revenue will grow in the high single digits in the long term, as mentioned above, which indicates that ChannelAdvisor's revenue will continue to grow post the pandemic.

ChannelAdvisor, which has a current market capitalization of $300 million said that it ‘does not anticipate a material impact to 2017 revenue or adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) as a result of the transaction.Furthermore, ChannelAdvisor did not file an 8-K for the deal, which would have indicated a change in financial condition, so I estimate the deal was likely under $20 million.As of March 31, 2017’s 10-Q, ChannelAdvisor reported $63 million in cash and equivalents and total liabilities of $51.8 million, so it appears the company likely had ample resources with which to close the transaction and without significant negative financial statement effects.With HubLogix, ChannelAdvisor obtains a fulfillment and logistics platform designed primarily for online storefronts and marketplaces.HubLogix has ‘developed a network of more than 150 fulfillment partners to allow sellers to work efficiently with their vendors and third-party logistics partners.ChannelAdvisor launched its Fulfillment Network earlier in 2017 with the goal of helping their customers improve their logistics all the way through to the ‘last mile.’As ChannelAdvisor stated in its deal announcement,So, the deal for ChannelAdvisor is about going deeper into the supply chain now that they have created a 'Fulfillment Network.'HubLogix provides functionality which when combined with ChannelAdvisor’s network scale can create a compelling network effect for manufacturers and their vendor and online storefront ecosystems.The trick is getting the manufacturers, distributors, and retailers to adopt the system. Most of manufacturing is still low-tech and not tightly connected with distributors and retailers via digital means.ChannelAdvisor’s challenge will be to persuade manufacturers and their supply chains to join the system, which can be time-consuming and change-intensive for hide-bound manufacturers.Integration risk with HubLogix should be minimal, as the two companies already have a working relationship, so I view the deal as low risk with good potential for upside over the medium term.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

Not only do these firms pay much lower variable fees, apparently their fixed fees are low as well.So while management points to the general trend of ecommerce ""being still in place,"" the fact that they miss the point about a shift to larger players is puzzling.In some ways the shift to larger contracts is a positive. At least one lone broker (Needham) took some time to point this out. Unfortunately ChannelAdvisor gives up more revenue and margin as their clients ""move up"" to larger contracts.So the good news is that the strategy to move up is working - the bad news is that the business model gets less profitable as this occurs. Apparently smaller customers are not having great success on the platform, at least so far.Current revenue estimates will come down, probably to about the $100M range for 2015. Other also-ran internet companies like Care.com (NYSE:CRCM) and Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI) trade at about 2x and 1x forward sales respectively. That's probably about the right level for ECOM shares, at least until management can get a better handle on what their ""new model"" means for revenues and possibly even one day for earnings. That translates into a $5/share to $10/share trading range. (We chose ANGI and CRCM here because although they are consumer facing they are platforms designed to allow ecommerce via online channels to product providers - in these cases contractors and care-givers, respectively.)ChannelAdvisor is still losing money and that will be the case for at least another year, possibly two, even if they get a handle on the business. With just over $80M in cash they are not in near-term danger but their runway isn't unlimited.The best hope for any investors in the stock here may be an acquisition. Many analysts had buy recommendations on ECOM going into the miss because their positioning as a bridge between multiple ecommerce platforms seemed very promising. At this point few if any believe that this is really working the way it could (again similar to ANGI and CRCM).EBAY has shown an interest in these types of companies - remember they bought GSI Commerce back in 2011.ChannelAdvisor management will provide more details and updated guidance on their full quarterly call on February 5th but it's pretty clear that 2015 will be a ""building year."""

Both revenue and adjusted EBITDA are finally coming ahead of expectations, revenue growing around 15-20% combined with improvements to profitability and cash flows. The transition to upmarket, with a focus on larger brands and retailers, seems to be getting established, and operational improvements are starting to show positive results.Changing market environment offers helpAs a Cloud-based provider of e-commerce platform services, the business stands to benefit from not just the growth of e-commerce, but also the proliferation of venues for online retail, since the services provided, be it helping manage multiple product listings, order aggregation or inventory control, sit in the middle between the e-commerce platforms, for e.g. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the manufacturer or retailer.Image source: ECOM presentationLike Demandware, which is another enterprise Cloud commerce solution provider, the business facilitates not just an easier go-to-market strategy of manufacturers and retailers, but also provides more flexibility in terms of pricing optimization, search optimization and data analytics through an integrated platform, something that is becoming more of a necessity. More retailers outsourcing should continue to provide a favorable environment, besides the 15% type of growth expected from e-commerce in the U.S.Improved executionImage source: ChannelAdvisor presentationAt the operational level, things have changed significantly and more importantly, the change involves profitability as well. The improvement is visible on almost every metric, be it the variable subscription revenues, all-important average revenue per customer or top line growth outlook for the year. The revenue model consists of subscriptions as well as a percentage of the Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) traded on the company's platform and there is an improvement on both fronts. Some of the early signs of improvement from a focus on pricing and qualification practices are visible in the 15-25% type of growth seen in fixed and variable subscription in the latest quarter, the benefit of which should continue.Going forward, one of the most promising opportunities is the partnership announced with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) to accelerate their marketplace initiative and providing an enterprise grade integration platform for third party sellers to list their products on Walmart.com. Even with limited availability to sellers, Wal-Mart is already ChannelAdvisor's third largest marketplace by GMV and one of the fastest growing channels on a same-store sales basis. As Wal-Mart expands its seller base on the platform, the partnership should become a meaningful driver of new business and revenue over the coming quarters.Besides the Wal-Mart partnership, the company announced a new platform for customers to optimize Fulfillment By Amazon operations that should help the company gain share among Amazon sellers and launched an extension of benchmarking analytics that should help advertisers compare spend, ROI targets and conversion rates. Some of the other add-ons announced in the spring refresh are the added functionalities to support the brick and mortar stores in the 'Where to Buy' product line and new products for product intelligence solutions.Profitability is improving just as the market is warming up for consolidationImage source: ECOMWith gross profits up 20% and gross margins expanding by almost 200 basis points, the comeback of profitability seems established and the benefits of a strategic realignment initiated mid of last year seems to be coming through.But besides the improving fundamentals supporting the top line growth and profitability, the stock should start attracting an acquisition premium as well.

Currently, the share price stands at $8.76, a hefty 82.4% down from the March 6th peak.At these price levels, two things have come to interest us: First, the interesting behavior of a certain insider; and second, the ideal metrics for M&A that have taken shape.ECOM data by YChartsMarch 6th, 2014 - The Inside ManOn the 6th of March the stock opened at 9:30 am at $48.65 and closed at 4:00 pm at $48.95 with a daily high of $49.90.The next day at 4:33 pm, an SEC Form 4 was filed for ECOM's co-founder, Aris Buinevicius. He had sold 10,000 shares ($490k) at $49.03 the day before, above both the opening and closing prices.At 87 cents (1.7%) off ECOM's all-time peak, his timing simply could not have been better. The share price fell from there.February 10th, 2015 - The Inside Man ReturnsAt 6:05 pm on Tuesday, CTO Buinevicius filed his second Form 4. This time, it was an order to buy 17,856 shares - at $8.56.ECOM traded at an all-time low of $8.22/share on Monday the 9th. The price action on the 10th was uncommonly linear, low-volume and positive. Is Buinevicius going to be 34 cents off the bottom this time?After-hours trading, after a low-volume day, has the price up another 2.28%.ECOM Price data by YChartsWhat does this mean?This isn't CEO Scot Wingo and CTO Aris Buinevicius' first rodeo. Serial entrepreneurs, they have built and sold two successful businesses together already - AuctionRover.com (acquired by GoTo.com) and Stingray Software (acquired by RogueWave).This is what they do.With this mentality in mind, one might wonder if the CTO's $152,847 purchase is the result of a well-informed (as his last sale appeared to be) opinion that we've reached ECOM's potential sale territory and, subsequently, Wingo and Buinevicius's ""exit.""Let's briefly look into this possibility further.M&A potentialThere are two broad elements beyond the proven proclivities of the founders, which suggest that M&A is likely. The first is the nature of the market that ECOM operates in. The second is the nature of ECOM itself.1. The marketECOM is a software-as-a-service company - a small, savvy fish in a big pond, surrounded by the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).As Q4 showed (a big stink was made of ECOM getting bigger and bigger enterprise customers), ecommerce is a game of continuous consolidation and extreme margin competition. Improving margins is exactly what ECOM set out to do for clients, and by all accounts, it has proven very successful as a service.To drive home the consolidation point, here's the first thing that Wingo said in the Q4 call:If this is the natural progression of the market, ECOM will necessarily serve large, and growing, clients who eventually come into direct competition with each other. At some point, ECOM will have to choose sides, and it will become part of the consolidation itself.In a market this competitive, it is quite sensible that ChannelAdvisor seek to become an in-house service (through a technology ""acqui-hire"") as part of a large retailer.2. The companyFour words: Cheap, proven, debt-free, and cash-rich.In order: The market capitalization is a mere $207M. The SaaS product is a proven success at improving clients' margins. Total liabilities are $33.4M; total equity, $93.6M; and total debt, $2M. And lastly, $68.4M of that market capitalization (1/3) is in cash.Built to sell? Sounds like it.The ""So What?""We think that chances are good that ECOM is a takeover target, and insiders' history and recent transactions corroborate this possibility. With this as our thesis, buying ECOM is not an investment, but a speculation. On the whole, however, we think that the value of the company is in excess of its current market capitalization - and as such, we see this as a rather compelling speculation.Of course, investors are not all equally swayed by the significance of insiders' histories and transactions. As far as insider activity goes, however, we do find this instance fairly telling. That said, if this strategy does not suit your investment style, we don't want to convince you otherwise.For the time being, the stock remains outside of our own comfort zone - but we will certainly be watching with interest to see how this one plays out."

The stock is trading close to the highest levels since its initial public listing in May at $14.

Investors might and should strike a bargain out of this offering as the looming concerns have started to affect the numbers and may catch up with the stock going into the fourth quarter. This rising tide to concerns includeStock can lose up to 40% and might still be expensive if the current trend of rising operating cash losses and seasonally weakness persists.ChannelAdvisor - a brief introductionFounded in 2001, ChannelAdvisor is a provider of multi-channel listing services through an Internet (""cloud"") based platform. The service helps the customers with product listings, inventory management, pricing optimization, search optimization and data analytics for various e-commerce platforms like eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Newegg or for comparison shopping sites like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Bing and Nextag through an integrated platform. The revenue model is a mix of selling subscriptions, usually one year, and charging a percentage of the Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) traded on the company's platform. The company has close to 2300 customers with average revenue of close to $30,000.Multi-channel listing services: With the rise in avenues available for online retail, multi-channel listing services come in handy to offer a common platform to manage listings on various e-commerce platforms. Customers find these tools most useful forE-commerce platforms like them as they add depth, in terms of adding inventory, by having more 3rd party vendors on the platform.Retail sector weakness and seasonality to bear negatively on the stockChannelAdvisor is predominantly a retail story more than a ""cloud"" or an e-commerce growth story. As shown by the chart, almost 100% of the revenue is derived from sectors that are directly exposed to retail or consumer spending, both of which are facing a cloudy outlook.SEC filingsThe retail focus makes the company prone to the typical retail seasonality of strong fourth quarter. GMV through the company's platform also peaks in the holiday season of the fourth quarter, which along with higher subscriptions helps the margin structure as well.Looking at the numbers, there is slight room for upside on the fourth quarter numbers because of lower than average guidance but investors might be better served to learn that seasonality might also work against the stock going into 2014.Data source: S-1 filingsJohn Baule, CFO, had the following to say about seasonality on the recent conference call. ""Historically, the bulk of our new customers' addition occurred in the first three quarters of the year as retailers are generally too busy in the first quarter to focus on internal improvements.""Limited direction from the GMV traded on the platformIPO and the following strong stock performance are built upon expectations of fundamental business gaining from the rise in value of transactions on the ChannelAdvisor platform but the numbers are less supportive of that.Data source: SEC filingsAlmost 70% of the revenues are derived from subscription fee, which is fixed, and the implementation fee charged to the customers. Rest 30% of the revenue is from what the company calls - variable subscriptions. This variable subscription fee is typically based on a specified percentage of GMV, 1-2% as per few estimates, processed through the company's platform.Most of the company's customers have at least $1 million of yearly online revenue. Part of which is due to lack of suitability of the platform for small online retail businesses.Much worse than the simple absence of earnings leverageLooking at the accumulated deficits, which has increased 15% over last three quarters and 4% sequentially, for the company, it's hard to believe that this a fast growing, high margins technology business, which is 13 years old. Looking at the operating expense structure, which is growing much faster than the revenue growth rate, it sure looks like a negative leverage.Data source: SEC filings and press releasesBeing a technology company, it's even more worrisome to know that all the operating expenses, except the research & development, are growing twice the revenue growth rate.Data source: SEC filings and press releasesOperating expense structure seems like working against earnings profitability looking at operating expenses as percentage of total revenues. This lack of earnings leverage raises questions about the scalability of the platform as ChannelAdvisor usually manages the launch from creating lists schedules, posting templates and editing ad copy to optimizing performance. The sales and marketing expenses include the customer servicing expense.Multi-channel listing - a crowded market with limited technical edgeChannelAdvisor has been growing headcount like a fast growing technology startup but the poor growth in research & development relative to other division tells about the strategic weakness of the space.Data source: SEC filingsThis high a focus on sales and marketing is partly due to the rising competition in this crowded market. Multi-channel listing tools market is a crowded market even though there are limited publicly traded names, which might be due to the lack of consistently proven financial returns rather than the slow emergence of the sector.There are a number of notable private players in the market that offer services quite similar to ChannelAdvisor's. There is limited granular information from the company regarding the retention rate of customers to understand ""churns"" data intelligently.Vendio Services Inc. is active in the space after buying out Andale, auction management and research services for eBay sellers, in 2006. Like ChannelAdvisor, Vendio platform caters to the medium and high-end market and offers selling recommendation and bulk editing functions that are unique in the marketplace. Besides eBay, Amazon and comparison-shopping engines, customers can also sell at Facebook via the company's platform.eSellerPro is a UK based private company offering eCommerce ERP solutions for online retailers. Launched in 2006, the platform that automates functions like inventory management, product listing, sales processing and order dispatching, is processing more than $600 million of annual sales.Solid Commerce is a California based provider of Web based platform for managing inventory and listings for online retailing. The company offers API integration development services to better manage inventory, listing, and pricing along with order fulfillment functions for e-retailers. The company's ""Repricers"" offers ability to automatically increase prices based competing prices and send different prices to each marketplace. Solid Commerce caters to value market from pricing standpoint.Linnworks by UK based Linn Systems Limited caters to relatively smaller online retailers by offering simpler set tools at much less price than others. The platform can help consolidate sales, returns and listings on multiple channels. The platform is a fixed subscription fee with no percentage-based variable costs.Valuation or lack thereofCompany's guidance is for revenue to be between $19.6-20 million, EBITDA loss of between $3-3.9 million Non-GAAP loss per share between 27-31 cents. This guidance is lower than the average sequential growth of the last few years but even if one assumes a better than expected quarterly numbers, there is hardly any value in numbersThe company expects revenue between $67.1-67.5 million, EBITDA loss between $8.5-9.3 million and a loss per share of 89-93 cents. It's not just on the operational metrics that the company looks expensive, even the fundamental value of the franchise looks expensive as investors are paying more than $290,000 per customer.Data source: SEC FilingsConclusionThere seems a fairly large disconnect between the fundamental nature of the business, which looks like a tool to serve e-retailers using relatively simple technology in a crowded market, and investors, who are offering premium valuations that are usually reserved for high-end defensible technology companies on linear growth curves and offering industry high operating margins. Deteriorating operating margins, weak retail market and valuation concerns can easily correct the stock by 30-40%. Interested investors might be better served to wait for a bargain price or negotiate a better price for the stock on offer.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1984701,47861,2014-01-31T11:11:20-05:00,,"It's been a great eight months for ChannelAdvisor (NYSE:ECOM). Since going public back in May 2013, their stock price has rocketed upwards, more than tripling off their initial $14 offering price. As a small company pursuing an aggressive growth plan, ECOM took advantage of their surge in stock price by issuing an additional 1 million shares in November at $34. I've followed ECOM since their IPO and have written two articles covering them, both bullish in nature, which can be found here on Seeking Alpha. I took a long position in ECOM in the days following the IPO, but recently closed it out.While I am still a fan of the company and am confident they will continue to grow, I believe the current valuation has gotten far ahead of itself.ChannelAdvisor: A Software-as-a-Service provider in the growing global e-commerce marketAs explained more in-depth in my first and second articles, ECOM is a provider of e-commerce solutions to vendors such as retailers and manufacturers. Through its cloud-based software-as-a-service platform, ECOM allows vendors to better achieve economies of scale with minimal additional cost or operational complexity. A common misconception here is that ECOM offers ""shopping cart"" type services - this is incorrect. While those types of solutions benefit a retailer once a consumer has already found their site and is ready to make a purchase, ChannelAdvisor helps those retailers to be found by consumers in the first place. In short, ECOM allows online retailers to easily be seen across hundreds of different websites, through one simple interface. As such, ECOM positions itself as a ""scaling solution"" for e-commerce vendors as opposed to a ""starter package,"" and believes their products provide the most value for merchants with at least $1 million in annual sales.The Company is currently pursuing an aggressive growth strategy. While they are not yet profitable, their single largest expense (56% of revenue in Q3) goes towards ""demand generating"" sales & marketing efforts. These have proven successful thus far, as the company has grown quarterly revenue by at least 20% on a y/y basis through Q3 2013, and is on pace to grow its annual revenue by 25-30% going forward. The company is not yet cash flow positive, however this is not an immediate concern as they are sitting on a relatively large pile of cash ($90m) with a minimal debt load ($8m). The secondary offering of shares which took place in the fourth quarter of 2013 will further improve their current cash position.Reasonable Valuation RangeA quick preface on my approach to valuation: I understand that forecasting long-term growth and valuation is complex and consists of countless moving parts. Because of that I generally avoid trying to calculate a precise ""price target"", but rather a range of prices at which the stock would be ""reasonably"" valued from a long-term buy-and-hold approach. Investors, especially those with a different time horizon and risk profile than mine, should always conduct their own research and analysis prior to making an investment decision.In my first article (dated May 23, 2013), I reasoned that ECOM's ""reasonable valuation range"" was between $18 and $33. This was determined by applying a 15-20% revenue growth rate through 2016, paired with a range of P/S multiples from 4-6x. The 15-20% growth rate assumption was based on historical results, and the 4-6x P/S multiples were determined based on where other small-cap ""cloud"" e-commerce companies were trading at the time.In my second article (dated August 13, 2013), I raised my reasonable valuation range to between $22 and $38. This was after ECOM's first quarterly earnings call, where management's guidance implied an annual revenue growth rate of 24%. Accordingly, I revised the range of what I considered to be reasonable growth rates to 20-25%.ECOM is scheduled to report their full-year 2013 earnings on Thursday, February 6th. Per Yahoo Finance, analysts currently estimate ECOM's 2013 full-year revenue to be $67.45m, or approximately a 26% annual growth from 2012. Given this, I believe the current reasonable valuation range for ECOM is between approximately $23 and $40.(The above valuation table assumes 22,672,635 shares outstanding, which takes into account the additional 1 million shares from the Q4 2013 secondary offering)Note that the above range of P/S multiples remain unchanged from my original valuation range back in May. While the range of P/S multiples for similar companies has expanded (and is now much more variable), I have a hard time justifying multiples higher than the mid single-digits. Investors with different risk profiles will likely differ on this. My thoughts on the matter are best summed up in the following quote from a 2002 Businessweek interview with Sean McNealy, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems:Additionally, in the recent months there have been two buyouts worth noting. In June of 2013, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) purchased ExactTarget (NYSE:ET) for approximately $2.5 billion. Last December, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) purchased Responsys (NASDAQ:MKTG) for approximately $1.5 billion. These buyout amounts represented P/S multiples of approximately 7.9x and 7.4x, respectively. While neither ET nor MKTG were direct competitors to ECOM, their buyouts are relevant comparison points in that they were small cap, cloud-based companies providing services to the e-commerce industry. Because of this, an extra row for an 8.0x P/S multiple was included in the above valuation table for reference. ChannelAdvisor, however, currently trades at nearly 19x P/S.ConclusionAs I've written before, the above is obviously a simplified look at ECOM's valuation, and the resulting price range is large. However, given ECOM's current lofty valuation, it reinforces the notion that shares currently have more downside risk than upside potential. It is certainly possible that ECOM's increasing revenues will allow it to grow into its current valuation, however it's also entering dangerous territory where shares could plunge substantially if they miss (or even ""beat but by less than expected"") on future earnings reports.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1492702,25047,2013-06-10T19:18:50-04:00,,"ChannelAdvisor (NYSE:ECOM) has just reported its May 2013 ""same store sales"" for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). These came in at +25.8% year-on-year, as we can see below:This represents a massive deceleration from April's +30.6%, and most importantly, it bodes very badly for Amazon.com's all-important 3P (third party) sales, for which ChannelAdvisor's data is a proxy.Q2 2013With the data for May, I can update my ChannelAdvisor model, which seeks to predict the direction of Amazon.com's revenue growth and has exhibited a 100% success rate in doing so. So what is the model saying now? Let us see where we stand (green is the new data, red is the present consensus):As we can see, the average reported growth (by ChannelAdvisor) for Q2 2013 up until this point stands at +28.2% year-on-year, down from the growth reported on Q1 2013 (+33.6%). This implies that Amazon.com's revenue growth rate during Q2 2013 will fall from Q1 2013, while the present consensus calls for +22.7%, which is above the +21.9% reported on Q1 2013. As such, our model is clearly saying that Amazon.com will miss revenue estimates for Q2 2013 and show a further deceleration in revenue growth.Not only that, but the growth being reported by ChannelAdvisor is the lowest since we've been tracking it, and decelerating quickly even though these numbers work as a proxy for Amazon.com's 3P growth rate.In short, this model -- which has gotten the direction of Amazon.com's revenue growth rate right 100% of the time -- is predicting that Amazon.com will miss Q2 2013 consensus revenue estimates.ConclusionI again predict that Amazon.com will report a Q2 2013 revenue growth rate below the present consensus of +22.7%. The difference is now larger than when I last made this prediction, so this is even more certain to happen.Also, it seems likely that Amazon.com will disappoint particularly in its 3P revenues, perhaps as a result of the recent increases in commissions both in the U.S. and Europe.I also believe that this data is bound to have a negative impact starting right in the market session for June 11.Disclosure: I am short AMZN.

Its solutions enable its customers to manage merchandise sales across online channels including marketplaces like eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), as well as search engines like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and social networking sites like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). With the solutions, clients can manage inventories, optimize pricing, learn about search terms and other information across those channels.ChannelAdvisor sold 5.75 million shares for $14 a piece. The company raised $80.5 million in gross proceeds with the public offering. The offering values the equity of the company around $287 million.The offering was quite a success. Initially the firm and its bankers planned to sell the shares in a preliminary price range of $12-$14 per share. Some 28% of the total shares outstanding were offered in the public offering. At Friday's trading levels at $18.69 per share, the firm is valued around $383 million.The major banks that brought the company public were Goldman Sachs, Stifel, BMO Capital Markets and Raymond James, among others.ValuationChannelAdvisor's solutions are used by some 1,900 customers worldwide. They manage some 100 million stock-keeping units representing $3.5 billion in gross merchandise value for the year of 2012. The company derives its revenues mainly from subscription fees as well as a variable fee which is based on Gross Merchandise Value processed through the platform. Key customers of the business include Ann Taylor (ANN), J&R Electronics as well as Dell (NYSE:DELL), Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) and Sony (NYSE:SNE) in the manufacturing industry.The company helps retailers and manufacturers to reduce the complexity of highly fragmented online sales channels, where prices and innovation is rapidly changing the market place.For the year of 2012, ChannelAdvisor generated annual revenues of $53.6 million, up 23.0% on the year. Deferred revenues were actually up by 64.1% to $9.7 million. Net losses widened from $3.9 million to $4.9 million in the meantime.The company ended its full year of 2012 with $10.9 million in cash and equivalents. The company operates with $11.0 million in short and long term debt, as well as $90.5 million in convertible preferred stock which could dilute the future shareholder base. Factoring in the offering proceeds, the company will operate with a solid net cash position of around $70 million.Friday's equity valuation of $383 million, values the firm at around 7.1 times annual revenues.Investment ThesisAs noted above, the public offering of ChannelAdvisor has been quite a success. Shares were offered 7.7% above the midpoint of the preliminary offering range, and are currently exchanging hands at around $18.69 per share, trading some 43.8% above the midpoint of the guided range.A key risk to the offering is the dependency of the firm on leading sales channels including Amazon.com, eBay and advertisements on Google. Further consolidation of the e-commerce industry could reduce the necessity for ChannelAdvisor's services as a continued consolidation would diminish the complexity of margin online offerings. This could also put pressure on the company's margins. ChannelAdvisor received on average a 1.5% revenue cut based on 2012's annual Gross Merchandise Value.An obvious opportunity is China, as the company does not sell through Alibaba yet, but this might change. The opportunity is huge, giving that Alibaba is bigger than eBay and Amazon.com combined. The overall global e-commerce industry is expected to grow at an annual 15% rate through 2016, achieving a $1 trillion global size, according to a note from Forrester Research in the company's S1-Filing.ChannelAdvisor is already achieving profitability in the traditional busy fourth quarter, indicating that it could be able to report full year profits in a not too distant future, given the operating leverage of the firm's business model. Fourth quarter revenues rose by 24.9% to $16.0 million on which the company managed to report a modest $0.6 million profit.Despite the significant jump following the pricing of the public offering, shares are valued around 7 times last year's revenues, a somewhat acceptable valuation given the premium valuation for recent cloud and e-commerce public offerings.The company could be a speculative buy following the hype for recent public offerings, yet I remain on the sidelines. It is not even the valuation which concerns me the most, I think that a continued consolidation of online sales channels might make ChannelAdvisor's services obsolete in the medium to long term future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Through its platform, the company enables its customers to connect with new and existing sources of demand for their products, including e-commerce marketplaces, such as eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Newegg, search engines and comparison shopping websites, such as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Microsoft's Bing (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Nextag, and emerging channels, such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN). As of December 31, 2012, the Company had over 1,900 customers worldwide. Its customers include both traditional and online retailers, such as Ann Taylor, eBags.com, J&R Electronics and Jos. A. Bank Clothiers (NASDAQ: JOSB), as well as manufacturers of consumer goods, such as Dell (Nasdaq: DELL), Dooney and Bourke, Lenovo (NASDAQ: OTCPK:OTCPK:LNVGY), Sony (NYSE: SNE) and Under Armour (NYSE: UA).(Source: Google Finance)Current AnalysisChannelAdvisor went public in May of 2013, and it has been on a wild ride since. The stock closed its first day of trading at $18.44, then traded as low as $14.25 shortly thereafter in June, then followed that up with a strong rally to $49.90 on March 6th earlier this year... the day before the huge sell-off in tech, small cap, momentum, retail, and cloud companies started. Companies in those sectors took a big hit, and ChannelAdvisor happens to be a player in each and every one of those categories. The sell-off caused a cascade of capitulation, as the stock tanked almost 70% in just over 5 months. This type of action frightens investors, but such an extreme case of selling tends to become drastically overdone, and I think ChannelAdvisor is a good example of that, as its underlying business and addressable market is booming.While the company is still losing money, it has been able to beat the Street's estimates for each of the 5 quarters it has reported since going public. Those losses are a result of rapid expansion and investment, as it has been building its massive client base, sales force and infrastructure.Source: I E*TradeBy taking a look at the company's key statistics below, you can see the massive potential the company has.ChannelAdvisor's Key StatisticsAnalyst RatingsAnalysts have a consensus Buy rating with a $30 price target, almost a double from current levels. Of the 7 firms that cover the stock, 5 rate the stock a strong buy, 1 as a Buy, 1 as a Hold and none have an underperform or sell rating on the stock.Source: II Nasdaq.comBullish CatalystsI have been stalking ChannelAdvisor for a good entry point, and after this dramatic sell-off, I believe this may be it. Technicals are showing signs of a bottom, and there are some recent developments and catalysts I see in the very near future that could really turn this stock around.First, let's take a look at ECOM's chart from a technical perspective.Source: III TradingViewAs you can see the stock has been in a steep downtrend. That trend, however, is showing signs of exhaustion with a potential double bottom formation. The MACD also is curling up for a bullish cross just below the zero line, and On Balance Volume is in a tightening consolidation wedge. There also are bullish divergences in various other technical indicators, while the RSI broke out of its downtrend on Monday and is approaching bullish territory just below the 50 line.Addressable Market GrowthAccording to a report from Goldman Sachs, while e-commerce growth slowed in 2013 to 17.1% YOY from 18.8% in 2012 (one reason ECOM fell out of favor with investors), it is expected to bounce back to 17.9% in 2014. Global mobile commerce sales, on the other hand, reached $133 billion in 2013, and is expected to reach $626 billion in 2018. In the U.S., mobile commerce is expected to triple to $131 billion by 2018, which is just shy of the $133 billion in total global e-commerce in 2013.ECOM's PartnersSource: IV ChannelAdvisorChannelAdvisor is already aligned with most of the largest e-commerce players in the industry. Google, eBay, Amazon, Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) etc. have tremendous growth and a feverish ambition to drive sales. As those companies' market shares and sales grow, so will the need for ChannelAdvisor and its various product offerings, and thus ChannelAdvisor's revenue.Source: V CrunchBaseeBay PartnershipeBay has been a long-time partner and investor in ChannelAdvisor. eBay has participated in each round of funding from the Series A to its Series D in 2008.The partnership is apparently strengthening, according to ChannelAdvisor's new ""Autumn Release."" The full report can be viewed here, but here are some highlights:eBay Quickstart - Provides streamlined templates for fixed price listings that enables 1,000s of listings to be uploaded quickly and changed or altered quickly. This will be a boon for eBay Store Sellers, and it integrates into ChannelAdvisor's existing suite seamlessly.eBay Custom - Enables various selling styles for different products if sellers want to vary the way certain products are presented.eBay's Global Shipping Program - Previously only available in the U.S., it has now expanded to the U.K., and makes international shipping to global customers easier than ever.eBay's announcement to spin off PayPal will provide significant funding and allow eBay to focus on and greatly expand its e-commerce and auction business. With this level of integration and competitors like Alibaba (ChannelAdvisor is also partnered with Alibaba's massive T-mall), Facebook, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), etc. entering the market, we could see eBay (or others) acquire the company to create a competitive advantage and capitalize on the exponential growth of the entire e-commerce industry.Social Media Moving into e-Commerce, and e-Commerce Goes MobileTwitter and Facebook have both introduced ""buy"" buttons, while Pinterest, Instagram and others are likely to follow suit. This development will drive an even larger boost to global e-commerce, and particularly, mobile commerce sales. When this feature is rolled out in its entirety, ChannelAdvisor's services will be a necessity to these players.In fact, the company is already expecting it, as another addition to its Autumn Release is ""Social and Mobile Commerce. Enabled."" Those offerings include:Source: VI Business InsiderYahoo Gemini SupportFirst-to-Market support for mobile search and native advertising on Yahoo Gemini.Social Media Commerce SuiteMobile Bid OptimizerThe Mobile Bid Optimizer allows for campaign-level bid adjustments based on your effective revenue share (ERS) goals, making your mobile digital marketing strategies smarter and more cost-effective with minimal effort.With the projected growth in mobile commerce, and social media juggernauts getting into the game, this product roll-out could not have come at a better time for the company.Bundling""Bundles"" is a very significant feature for retailers. It enables retailers to boost sales, reduce shipping costs and increase customer satisfaction.Take ChannelAdvisor client Sony, for example:Source: VII Sony.com""Bundles"" allows Sony to take individual items it sells and create a custom bundle that a customer can buy with one click. Those bundles will sometimes include a slight discount, but will likely include something a customer would not buy individually without the bundle, i.e. a waterproof case for a camera. Bundles boost sales for the retailer and value for the customer (whether it is only perceived or they actually receive a discount). These bundles also help ensure that the customer gets everything he/she needs with one click.A bundle also prevents customers from getting frustrated if they were unaware, or failed to purchase a needed item, such as a USB cord. Had they forgotten to purchase the USB cord, they would then have to head down to the local store and buy it from someone other than Sony, just so to be able to use the camera. That frustration could make a customer hesitant with ordering from Sony again.""Bundles"" saves retailers on shipping costs as well. Getting customers to buy in a bundle allows retailers to ship multiple items in one box, at the same time and to one location. It also updates the retailers' stock levels and sales figures, reordering data automatically for each individual item included in the bundle.As the e-commerce market continues to go from desktop to mobile, bundling items to make multiple purchases easier will become increasingly important.Source: ChannelAdvisor Autumn ReleaseThe boost to sales and level of cost savings alone could cover the entire cost of ChannelAdvisor's services for some retailers. This gives incentive for customers to subscribe to other incremental services the company offers.Institutional HoldingsHere is a look at ChannelAdvisor's top institutional holders' activity in the 2nd quarter:Source: VIII NasdaqHighlights from the 6/30/14 Reporting Period include:Source: IX WhaleWatcher.comAnother point of interest is that the stock is 116% owned by institutions (over-allotment due to the 17.5% short interest as of the 9/15/14 reporting period). This means that even the shares sold short on margin have been purchased by institutional investors. This situation could result in a ""failure to deliver,"" with a high chance of a short squeeze. While a stock overly owned by institutions can be a yellow flag, institutions don't seem to mind in this case, given the large increase in share purchases despite the devastating sell-off in the stock.Favorable Amendment to Revolving Line of CreditAn SEC Filing on September 17th discloses an amendment to ChannelAdvisor's revolving line of credit that signals improving financials of the company. Under that agreement, the lender (Silicon Valley Bank) increased the borrowing capacity from $6M to $10M, with a corresponding reduction in the fee for unused capacity from 0.25% to 0.15% per year. The lender also dramatically reduced the borrow rate from the lender's prime rate plus 1% to the lender's prime rate plus 0.25%. A real-world example of this would be like you or I going from a credit card rate of 24% with a 580 credit score, down to 6% with a 720. The maturity of the loan agreement was also extended to September 17th of 2016, and ChannelAdvisor currently has no outstanding balance.Because these terms have improved so drastically, we can assume that Silicon Valley Bank liked what they saw, and were confident enough in ChannelAdvisor's business and books to extend such favorable terms. If you've applied for a big loan before, such as a house or car (post-financial meltdown, that is), you know how stringent lenders can be in looking through each and every last financial. Thus, we can take this as a positive sign to Q3 earnings on October 27th, and a decrease in related expenses through September 2016.Bullish Options ActivityOn September 11th, there was a very large buying in the December $17.50 Call options. The buyer/buyers purchased over 3,200 contracts over an open interest of 55 (which I personally wrote) in a range of $2.96 to $3.21.Source: X E*TRADEThat is almost a $1 million bet that the stock will move above $20.50 by the December 20th expiration date. There also happens to be a gap to the upside at $22, so chances are the buyer is betting on that gap to fill, and then some. Those options almost double the day the buyer stepped in, but because of the market sell-off, they are now trading below where they were before the large purchase. If you are an options player or want to make a leveraged bet to the upside, those options are worth a look, in my opinion.The unusual bullish option activity in this stock carries more weight, in my opinion, because very few options trade in the stock. Given the illiquid nature of the options, I would say the buyer plans on exercising those calls upon expiration to obtain those 320,000 shares that would otherwise be difficult to get in the open market. While this could be a hedge against a large short position, that is a hefty premium to pay, in my opinion, for just ""protection.""ConclusionECOM's trend is still down currently, so we aren't out of the woods yet, especially with the overall market conditions. The stock started October 2nd up almost 5%, only to swing down more than 5% to a new 52-week low as the market turned south. The stock recovered nicely to end just below $16. The float of the stock is very low, with a high short interest, so the volatility is not for the faint of heart.We could see a few more days of consolidation per the chart; however, given the reasons above, I believe it is only a matter of time before the stock breaks through this resistance and starts a new and likely aggressive uptrend. This uptrend should start on a definitive break of $17.00, which is where I would suggest taking a long position.I see downside risk in the low $15s to where the major holders should step in to support the price and protect their positions. The all-time low of $14.25 would be a logical stop-loss point. My short-term target is $22 by December for shares of ChannelAdvisor."
2420345,47861,2014-08-13T16:24:24-04:00,"ECOM crashed 30% last week after Q2 earnings revealed customer growth that fell short of expectations.This one metric alone does not paint a complete picture of ECOM’s growth prospects, and should not be taken in isolation.While there are certainly risks to keep an eye on going forward, ECOM remains poised for growth and is attractively priced after the sell-off.Reasonable assumptions show ECOM is worth at least $20 and possibly as much as $40, representing between 25% and 150% upside from current prices.","Shares of ChannelAdvisor (NYSE:ECOM) have taken quite the roller coaster ride since their IPO. After debuting around $18 in May 2013, shares slid to $15, shot up to nearly $50, and are now essentially right back where they started. After peaking in March of this year, ECOM fell victim to a broad market sell-off among tech and other ""momentum"" stocks which knocked it back into the $20s. Shares then took a nosedive following Q2 earnings on August 4th, dropping an additional 30%.ECOM data by YChartsIf you've been following along at home, you know this isn't the first time I've written about ChannelAdvisor. To avoid repeating myself at length regarding the Company's business model, growth prospects, and historical earnings & valuations, please see my prior coverage linked below:Additionally, ECOM's Q2 Earnings Release can be found here and the transcript from their earnings call can be found here.ChannelAdvisor certainly has its share of risks, and there are definitely legitimate reasons for concern. However, the Company remains in the early innings of a potentially massive growth story to the extent that current upside presents an attractive risk/reward tradeoff. While the initial March-July tumble presented a good buying opportunity, the additional post-earnings crash now presents a great buying opportunity.So... what happened?Through July, ECOM slid 45% as part of a broader market sell-off. During this time, many stocks trading at sky-high P/S multiples were punished severely. ECOM, which at one point traded as high as ~19x sales, was no exception.Then the Q2 earnings were released, sending the stock plummeting.Overall, ECOM actually had a pretty solid quarter. Revenue grew 30% y/y and management increased guidance for FY2014 as they continue to expand globally, recently launching support for major e-commerce platforms in Brazil and China.Despite all that, there was one number that sent investors sprinting towards the exit: net customer additions. In short, ECOM added 108 net new customers in Q2. Not bad for a growing company with over 2,600 active customers, but a significant decline from the 138 they added in Q2 2013 and far short of the 198 predicted by analysts.This appears like a red flag for a company aggressively investing in growth, and at first glance the ensuing crash certainly seems justified. However, this single metric does not necessarily paint a complete picture of ECOM's growth trajectory.On the earnings call, management pointed out that not all customers are equal. In fact, ECOM generates roughly 100 times as much revenue off their largest customers than from their smallest. David Spitz, ECOM President and COO, went on to further explain:Obviously it's disappointing that a growing company would show a downtick in new customers, and it's certainly something that investors should keep an eye on going forward, but the 30% sell-off triggered by this metric is a massive overreaction and presents a great buying opportunity.Looking past the net customer adds and focusing on the bigger picture, ECOM still appears strong from a growth perspective. While the Company is still losing a significant amount of money and burning significant cash, that remains almost entirely due to their aggressive Sales & Marketing efforts.These expenses are necessary in order to drive continued top-line growth, yet still largely discretionary in nature. On the call, ECOM CFO John Baule provided some color on this:This led Mr. Baule to address another major concern for investors: Cash Flow. ECOM has burned over $20 million in free cash flow over the past two quarters alone, a pace that would run them completely dry by Q2 of 2015. Mr. Baule provided reassuring guidance in this regard, and calmed any fears of a future capital raise:Valuing the Growth StoryA quick preface on my approach to valuation: I understand that forecasting long-term growth and valuation is complex and consists of countless moving parts, especially for a small tech company aggressively pursuing a growth plan. Because of that I generally avoid trying to calculate a precise ""price target"", but rather a range of prices at which the stock would be ""reasonably"" valued from a long-term buy-and-hold approach. Investors, especially those with a different time horizon and risk profile than mine, should always conduct their own research and analysis prior to making an investment decision.In the interest of full disclosure, provided below is a table showing my historical 'reasonable valuation ranges' for ECOM, along with the key assumptions driving those valuations. For further discussion of why I believed these were reasonable assumptions at the time, please reference my above-linked prior articles.Note that the above valuation ranges were determined by applying the given P/S multiples to ECOM's projected 2016 revenue based on the given growth rates. Going forward, projected 2017 revenue will be used instead, as over a year has passed since my initial coverage of ECOM.Revenue Growth Assumptions: For the current year, management's guidance implies an annual revenue growth rate of approximately 27%, essentially matching the growth rate for 2013. Given the booming growth of the e-commerce industry as a whole, especially internationally, I believe this growth rate is reasonably sustainable for at least the next few years. Because of that, the updated valuation below leaves revenue growth rate assumptions unchanged at 25-30%.P/S Multiple Assumptions: Back at ECOM's IPO, the above P/S multiple range of 4.0x - 6.0x was determined by looking at where similar companies were trading at the time. I left this range unchanged, even when many companies were trading at much higher multiples in late 2013/early 2014. As I pointed out in my January ECOM coverage, I find it difficult to justify a P/S multiple much higher than mid-single digits, and provided a quote from former Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy explaining how absurd it is for a company to trade at 10 times sales.Given the broader tech sell-off this year, it's necessary to re-examine how the market is valuing companies similar to ECOM. Since there aren't many public companies that are a direct apples-to-apples comparison to ECOM, the below list consists of companies that are: a) cloud-based/SaaS; b) small cap; c) currently unprofitable.It appears the market is currently valuing these types of companies at between 3- and 5-times sales, with a few outliers skewing the average somewhat higher.Given the above, it seems reasonable to believe that ECOM is worth at least $20, possibly as much as $40. This is obviously a simplified approach to valuation, and the resulting price range is large, but it illustrates how terribly the market has mispriced the stock.A note on profitability: I understand that Revenue Growth vs. P/S Multiples won't be an accurate way to value ECOM forever. Eventually, profitability has to matter (although looking at major companies like Amazon and Salesforce.com, perhaps that's a flawed assumption). This is why it's important to keep in mind that the vast majority of ECOM's expenses are in Sales & Marketing, as was discussed above.Hypothetically speaking, if ECOM cut S&M spending to just 25% of its projected 2014 revenue (as opposed to its current ~70%), it would be on pace to earn around $6.5 million in net income this year. This would represent a 60x P/E multiple based on a share price of $16. This is wildly hypothetical, and not meant to be a concrete justification, but it helps to illustrate why I'm not worried - at least not yet - about ECOM's lack of profitability.ConclusionBack in January I wrote that I believed ECOM was overvalued in the high $40s. However, the subsequent sell-off was a major overreaction, driven largely by investors narrowly focused on one single metric as opposed to the bigger picture. While there are certainly risks worth keeping an eye on (it's by no means a ""set-and-forget"" stock), ChannelAdvisor remains well positioned to capitalize on the continued boom in the global e-commerce market and the current price provides significant upside.Disclosure: The author is long ECOM.

1453491,24145,2013-05-22T11:50:12-04:00,,"Based in Morrisville, NC, ChannelAdvisor (NYSE:ECOM) scheduled a $74 million IPO with a market capitalization of $266 million at a price range mid-point of $13, for Thursday, May 23, 2013.Five other new IPOs are scheduled for IPOs for this week. The full IPO calendar is here.SUMMARYECOM is a Business-to-Business and a Business-to-Consumer software-as-a-service (SAAS) company. For the March 2013 quarter revenue was up 25% to $15 million, and losses increased to 18% of revenue ($3 million) from 7% of revenue ($1 million). 65% of revenue comes from fixed subscription fees plus implementation fees.VALUATIONECOM is priced in the same range as E2Open (NASDAQ:EOPN). EOPN IPO'd July 25, 2012 at $15. It traded recently $15.34. However, EOPN's March 2013 revenue was flat compared to March 2012.Given ECOM's better internal growth rate of 25% in top line revenue, ECOM is a better value.GlossaryECOM has an accumulated deficit of $82 million.CONCLUSIONBuy ECOM on its IPO.To put the above conclusions and observations in context, the following is reorganized , edited and summarized from the full S-1 referenced above.BUSINESSECOM is a Business-to-Business and a Business-to-Consumer software-as-a-service company. ECOM believes it is a leading provider SaaS, solutions that enable retailer and manufacturer customers to integrate, manage and optimize their merchandise sales across hundreds of online channels.ECOM believes it enables customers to connect with new and existing sources of demand for their products, including e-commerce marketplaces, such as eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Newegg, search engines and comparison shopping websites, such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing, and Nextag, and emerging channels, such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN).ECOM's suite of solutions is accessed through a standard web browser, provides customers with a single, integrated user interface to manage their product listings, inventory availability, pricing optimization, search terms, data analytics and other critical functions across these channels.ECOM's proprietary cloud-based technology platform delivers significant breadth, scalability and flexibility to its customers. In 2012, customers processed over $3.5 billion in gross merchandise value, or GMV, through ECOM's platform. As of March 31, 2013, customers managed over 100 million stock-keeping units, or SKUs, of their inventory on ECOM's platform.CUSTOMERSECOM serves customers across a wide range of industries and geographies. As of March 31, 2013, ECOM had nearly 2,000 customers worldwide, including 27% of the top 500 U.S. Internet retailers, as ranked by Internet Retailer magazine based on 2012 sales, up from 16% of the top 500 U.S. Internet retailers, based on 2007 sales, as of December 31, 2007.Customers include both traditional and online retailers, such as Ann Taylor, eBags.com, J&R Electronics and Jos. A. Bank Clothiers (NASDAQ:JOSB), as well as manufacturers of consumer goods, such as Dell (NYSE:DELL), Dooney and Bourke, Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGF), Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Under Armour (NYSE:UA).REVENUE SOURCESECOM derives revenue primarily from subscription fees paid by customers for access to cloud-based solutions. Contracts include both a fixed subscription fee and a variable subscription fee that allows ECOM to participate in a share of customers' GMV processed through ECOM's platform.MARKET GROWTHAccording to Forrester Research, Inc., an industry research firm, e-commerce consumer spending in the United States, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America is expected to increase from $534 billion in 2011 to $1.1 trillion in 2016, a compound annual growth rate of 15%.INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYSome of ECOM's technology relies upon third-party licensed intellectual property. ECOM has two patent applications pending in the United States and one patent application pending in Brazil.COMPETITIONSeveral competitors provide solutions that compete with some of the capabilities of ECOM's platform, including those who provide software or services to connect retailers and manufacturers with one or more online channels. ECOM also competes with in-house solutions used by retailers and manufacturers that elect to build and maintain their own proprietary integrations to online channels.In addition, ECOM competes with the channels themselves, which typically offer software tools, often for free, allowing retailers and manufacturers to connect to them.An IPO from last summer is in the same broadly defined market segment, E2open. EOPN IPO'd July 25, 2012 at $15. It traded recently below at $15.20. EOPN supports operational business processes of its customers and their trading partners, including supply chain management, procurement, sales and finance functions.USE OF PROCEEDSECOM expects to net $66 million from its IPO. IPO funds are allocated to working capital and general corporate purposes.Disclaimer: This ECOM IPO report is based on a reading and analysis of ECOM's S-1A filing, which can be found here, and a separate, independent analysis by IPOdesktop.com.

1631032,47861,2013-08-13T08:42:05-04:00,,"Last Wednesday, ChannelAdvisor (NYSE:ECOM) reported their first quarterly earnings results since becoming a publicly traded company. After seeing their share price slide following their IPO, the earnings call provided a much-needed catalyst to send its shares soaring higher.ChannelAdvisor is a provider of software-as-a-service (""SaaS"") solutions that allow retailers and manufacturers to optimize their sales across numerous online channels. For those unfamiliar with ECOM and their business model, please see my previous article: ChannelAdvisor IPO: A Compelling Cloud-Computing Growth Story In The Global E-Commerce MarketECOM's earnings release can be found here and the transcript from their earnings call can be found here.Opening the call, CEO and Chairman Scot Wingo took a moment to clear up any confusion surrounding the nature of their business. Mr. Wingo emphasized that ECOM does not offer a ""shopping-cart"" service to e-commerce retailers. While those types of solutions benefit the retailer once a consumer has already found their site and is ready to make a purchase, ChannelAdvisor helps those retailers to be found by consumers in the first place. Leveraging ECOM's platform, online retailers are able to be seen across hundreds of different websites through a single easy-to-use web interface, with minimal added cost or operational complexity. In other words, ECOM allows retailers with e-commerce infrastructure already in place to dramatically increase their visibility to potential shoppers. As such, ECOM positions itself as a ""scaling solution"" for e-commerce retailers as opposed to a ""starter package,"" and believes their products provide the most value for merchants with at least $1 million in annual sales.Revenue & Earnings(Source: Company Filings)ECOM beat analyst expectations on both top and bottom lines, posting revenue of $16.0 billion (vs. $14.9 billion consensus) and an adjusted EPS of ($0.25) (vs. ($0.35) consensus). Quarterly revenue grew by 7.1% compared to the previous quarter, and 28.8% on an annual basis. Note that ECOM calculates adjusted EBITDA as net loss plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation & amortization, and stock-based compensation expense.(Source: Company Filings)While the company posted a net loss for the quarter, most of their expenses came from an aggressive expansion in the ""demand-generating"" sales & marketing departments. ECOM has doubled their headcount in these areas over the past year, and credits much of their customer growth to this. Their growth strategy has been successful so far as the company added 138 new customers in Q2, including major brands like OfficeMax (NYSE:OMX), New Balance, and Karen Kane. ECOM now has 2,135 customers worldwide, up 17% from a year ago. Management estimates there are currently over 100,000 online retailers across the globe, indicating significant room for further customer additions.In terms of geography, ECOM posted strong revenue growth across both domestic and international markets. While international revenue currently accounts for 21% of ECOM's total revenue, management estimates that 50% of global industry-wide e-commerce purchases happen outside of North America, indicating there is still significant room for growth in international markets. In April, the company opened a new office in Hong Kong, with the goal of strengthening operations in China and serving a growing base of Chinese consumers. With the new opening, ECOM now has 8 offices across 6 countries.(Source: Company Filings; Note that Customer Count is for the end of the given period, while Average Revenue per Customer is for the trailing twelve month period)In addition to adding new customers, ECOM has been successful in expanding current customers into new product lines. In the second quarter, average revenue per customer grew 13% y/y to $29,600. Because customers pay based on the gross merchandise value (""GMV"") of sales done over the ECOM platform, ECOM sees its revenues grow when its customers see increased sales. Because of this, ECOM will continue to benefit greatly from the overall growth in the worldwide e-commerce industry.Customer contracts with ECOM are generally for one year in length, and consist of a fixed and variable component based on the GMV that is sold by the retailer over the ECOM platform. The fixed component is based on a certain minimum level of GMV per month, which the retailer pays regardless of their sales volume. The variable component is an incremental fee on GMV levels in excess of the minimum monthly level. The variable rate is higher than the fixed rate, encouraging customers to increase their minimum monthly commitment over time as their sales grow. This benefits ECOM, as it provides strong revenue visibility and is generally paid in advance. In the second quarter of 2013, 67% of ECOM's revenue came from fixed subscription fees, up from 62% in the second quarter of 2012.Guidance(Source: Company Earnings Release & Earnings Call)For the upcoming quarter, ECOM expects to see revenue between $15.7 million and $16.0 million, implying a growth rate of 22% from the third quarter of 2012. For the entire year, ECOM expects revenue of between $66.1 million and $66.7 million, implying an annual growth rate of 24%.In applying these expected growth rates to a basic valuation matrix presented in a previous article, we see that the spike in share price following the earnings report has brought ECOM into the ballpark of reasonable valuation. However, significant upside still remains if the company can continue to post strong revenue growth north of 20% on an annual basis. As previously noted, the market generally values companies similar to ECOM at between 5.0- and 7.0-times revenue.ConclusionAfter a lackluster couple of months following their IPO, ChannelAdvisor's strong quarterly performance finally gives investors something concrete to get excited about. While the company is currently unprofitable due to their aggressive spending on sales & marketing, these activities are ""demand-generating"" in nature, and will likely provide a substantial return on investment over the long run. As the company continues to add customers at an eye-popping rate, they will also continue to benefit from the overall growth in the global e-commerce industry. Despite the recent spike in share price lifting ECOM into a reasonable valuation range, significant upside still exists if the company can continue to grow at its current rate.Disclosure: I am long ECOM.

2817996,24663,2015-01-14T15:09:47-05:00,"ECOM's valuation was cut in half Tuesday after disappointing sales guidance.This gives ECOM a valuation under $250 million, a price that might attract many e-commerce and advertising market leaders.ECOM's services are proven to drive sales higher in multiple areas, and if acquired, the services might help drive revenue higher for multiple companies.AMZN makes the most sense, not only for its e-commerce and cloud businesses, but also its expected advertising service.","ChannelAdvisor (NYSE:ECOM) provides software-as-a-service (SAAS) solutions that help its customers drive sales higher on digital marketing and e-commerce platforms alike. ChannelAdvisor's customers selling goods on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) or selling advertisements on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) almost always outperform merchants and advertisers not using ChannelAdvisor's services. Yet, despite the benefit of its services, the company's valuation was cut in half on Tuesday after the company warned investors that Q4 revenue will fall short of expectations. Given the decline of its stock combined with the advantages of its services lead me to believe that ChannelAdvisor might very well have M&A appeal.While the chart above explains how ChannelAdvisor's platform works, the performance of its customers is quite telling. For example, ChannelAdvisor customers saw their Thanksgiving sales rise 25.9% on Amazon.com. In September and October, its customers saw their same-store sales rise 37.9% and 32.7%, respectively. That's good given the fact that Amazon.com's guidance implies revenue growth of about 20% in the fourth quarter, meaning that ChannelAdvisor's services do work to drive average sales higher. Furthermore, ChannelAdvisor's data has proven to work on multiple channels, including eBay's Marketplace, sales driven by Google Ads, and Google Shopping among others.All things considered, there is value in ChannelAdvisor's services, as it accounts for many billions of gross merchandise volume quarterly. In my opinion, investors shouldn't be surprised if one of the platforms where ChannelAdvisor operates were to acquire it. Specifically, Amazon.com is interesting.First off, Amazon.com already has a highly valuable cloud segment called Amazon Web Services, but while it has thrived in platform-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service, SaaS is an area where Amazon.com could still make investments. Therefore, Amazon.com could kill two birds with one stone, strengthening its cloud business with SaaS while gaining a tool that drives sales higher on its core platform.If in fact Amazon.com were to show interest in ChannelAdvisor, the existing revenue and operations of ECOM would be near meaningless. ChannelAdvisor is a company that has a mere $240 million valuation with 12-month revenue of just $81.5 million, mostly created via subscriptions. ChannelAdvisor's 12-month revenue would be pennies to a company like Amazon.com, as Amazon.com would likely be more interested in the technology to help its vendors drive sales higher. In essence, Amazon.com might offer ChannelAdvisor's services to all of its vendors for free, and make the platform exclusive to Amazon.com, thereby eliminating the revenue channels from Google and eBay customers. After all, if widespread ChannelAdvisor services could increase Amazon.com's revenue by even 1.5% annually, that's far more valuable than ChannelAdvisor's existing subscription business would be.That said, there is one other reason that makes a ChannelAdvisor acquisition worth noting, and that's its history of being able to successfully convert advertising to revenue for its subscribers. As most know, Amazon.com is expected to launch an advertising business to compete with Google's $50 billion advertising business. Reportedly, Amazon.com hosted $1 billion worth of ads on its site last year, but those ads were powered by Google. According to The Wall Street Journal, Amazon.com's new platform will not only host ads on its sites, but also third party sites.Historically, advertising is a high margin business, and given the traffic on Amazon.com's site, this could be a very lucrative business for the e-commerce leader long term. While Amazon.com does have great data on the buying tendencies of online consumers, it doesn't have experience in ads, and it will be competing against even larger networks like Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for advertising dollars. Therefore, ChannelAdvisor's data, software and expertise might come in handy, if and when this transition occurs. In retrospect, $250 million is pennies for a company like Amazon.com, or any other large advertising/e-commerce company, and given the advantages, I expect that ChannelAdvisor will be acquired sometime in 2015.That said, if for some reason ChannelAdvisor is not acquired, I don't see too much upside in its stock. Certainly, ChannelAdvisor will capitalize on the addition of new web giants into e-commerce, like Facebook and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), along with the continued growth of advertising. However, with revenue of just $81.5 million and negative free cash flow of almost $30 million during the last 12 months, ChannelAdvisor does not have an efficient business model. That's one reason a company like Amazon.com would be more interested in ChannelAdvisor's assets rather than its business operations.The problem is that besides a subscription model, ChannelAdvisor doesn't have a way to collect meaningful revenue, and the company has shown no indication that it can produce profits and significant revenue growth simultaneously. Therefore, the prospects of a ChannelAdvisor acquisition is not necessarily to suggest that ECOM is a good investment behind its large losses. Instead, it suggests that the acquirer would be gaining a valuable asset at a cheap price that could accelerate overall revenue growth. In other words, I am more interested in the company that eventually acquires ChannelAdvisor versus ECOM itself."
1458141,47861,2013-05-23T16:12:08-04:00,,"ChannelAdvisor Corporation (NYSE:ECOM) is scheduled for an initial public offering on Thursday, May 23, 2013. Through an IPO priced between $12 and $14 per share, ECOM is looking to raise up to $80.5m, valuing the company at as much as $285m. Due to its solid business model and beneficial macroeconomic trends, ECOM is well-positioned to grow substantially over the coming years.Company OverviewAs the ticker suggests, ECOM is a provider of e-commerce solutions to vendors such as retailers and manufacturers. Through its proprietary software-as-a-service (""SaaS"") platform, ECOM enables vendors to easily control and monitor its e-commerce operations across multiple separate channels via one easy-to-use interface. In other words, ECOM provides a 'one stop' solution for businesses to sell or advertise their products on numerous websites. Rather than logging in to each individual website and manually creating or updating a product listing, vendors can simply log in to their ChannelAdvisor account via their web browser, enter the new information once, and have the updates automatically applied across all of their online sales channels. For a vendor selling hundreds or even thousands of SKUs across dozens of websites, ECOM's services are crucial in terms of saving time and ensuring product listing consistency.Diagram made by authorECOM's platform connects vendors and their inventory data with over 200 separate online channels, including Amazon, eBay, Google, Bing, Yahoo and Facebook. In addition to these big names, ECOM also provides sellers with easy access to a wide range of niche-retail and geographically-focused channels, such as La Redoute (France), Buscape (Latin America), and TradeMe (New Zealand). Additionally, vendors' product information is connected to major price-comparison sites, including Google Shopping, Nextag, PriceGrabber and Shopping.com. This enables vendors to exponentially increase their online sales potential, with just a minimal additional time commitment and little added operational complexity.Currently, ECOM has over 2,000 vendor-customers worldwide, including 27% of the top 500 U.S. Internet retailers in terms of sales as identified by Internet Retailer magazine. While the majority of ECOM's vendors are small and mid-sized businesses, they do boast enterprise-scale vendors including Dell, Jockey, Under Armour, Skullcandy, Sony, Jos. A Bank, Eddie Bauer and Brookstone. As shown below, ECOM appeals to vendors across a wide array of product types and has a significant global presence.Source: Company filingsThe majority of ECOM's revenue is generated through subscription fees that vendors pay for access to the SaaS platform. In addition to a fixed fee, subscription contracts generally include a variable component, which entitles ECOM to a certain percentage of the total dollar value of sales done by the vendor over the SaaS platform.ECOM has posted strong revenue growth over the past two years, jumping from $36.7m in 2010, to $53.6m in 2012. Due to ECOM's cloud-based business model, it enjoys high gross margins, which have climbed significantly over each of the past two years.Source: Company filingsDespite strong growth in both revenue and gross margins, ECOM has yet to achieve profitability. However, this is largely due to the bulk of its operating expenses going toward sales and marketing, a discretionary but necessary driver behind its 46% two-year revenue growth.Source: Company filingsGiven its rapid growth, expanding margins, and the scalability of the SaaS platform, it's not hard to imagine ECOM becoming profitable within the next five or so years, even with relatively conservative assumptions.E-Commerce Industry OutlookECOM is strongly positioned to benefit from the continued growth in e-commerce, both domestically and internationally. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, total U.S. e-commerce sales in the first quarter of 2013 totaled $61.2 billion. Since 2000, U.S. e-commerce spending has grown at a compounded growth rate of 4.6% per quarter, with only a slight hiccup in 2008-2009 in response to the financial crisis. Despite this explosion in growth, the Census Bureau reports that e-commerce spending currently accounts for just 5.5% of total U.S. retail spending, indicating there is still much room for growth.Source: U.S. Census Bureau DataThe trend above bodes well for ECOM, and that's not even taking into consideration e-commerce growth outside the United States. According to eMarketer, a leading internet market research company, the Asia-Pacific region will likely overtake the U.S. in the near future to become the largest e-commerce market in the world after growing by more than 30% last year and being expected to grow by at least another 30% again this year. In a separate study, Forrester Research forecasts that total e-commerce spending in the U.S., Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America combined will see a compound annual growth rate of at least 15% through 2016.A Brief Look at ValuationWhile the above certainly presents a compelling growth story for ECOM, it's necessary to try to quantify what this means for the share price going forward. Because ECOM is a small, unprofitable, ""growth"" stock, typical earnings-based valuation metrics are unreliable. Rather than trying to predict the wide array of assumptions necessary for a discounted cash flow valuation, let's look at companies similar to ECOM and the Price-to-Sales multiple at which the market currently values them. While this doesn't give an exact price target, it does help to put ECOM's share price in context.(To generate the following list, I looked for companies that were: 1) cloud-based; 2) e-commerce oriented; 3) small cap; and 4) currently unprofitable.)Source: Google Finance; Market Cap in $millionsIt appears that the market tends to value companies like ECOM at somewhere between 4- and 7-times revenue. These multiples, when plotted against a range of revenue growth assumptions for ECOM for the next three years, gives us the following range of valuations:Given the above, it seems reasonable to say that ECOM is worth somewhere between $18 and $33 per share, barring a substantial change in its business operations or macroeconomic conditions. This is obviously a simplified look at ECOM's valuation, and obviously the resulting price range is large. However, given the previously discussed business model and macroeconomic growth drivers, it reinforces the idea that there is significant upside from the current IPO offering range of $12-$14.ConclusionECOM is well-positioned to benefit from the continued wave of online shopping growth across the globe. While not currently profitable, the scalable nature of its cloud-based platform makes this likely to change over the coming years. Given that the IPO price range is in the low-teens, shares of ECOM may very well turn out to be one of the best 'e-commerce' purchases investors can make in the near future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ECOM over the next 72 hours.

4255708,25120,2019-04-22T12:18:43-04:00,"Electronics For Imaging recently agreed to be sold to a private equity firm in a deal which looks fair.A long-term growth play in a traditionally tough industry has seen difficult times as of recent as well, as realistic earnings power is quite limited.If I was an owner, I believe the take-out valuation is fair and it is time to move on.","Electronics For Imaging (EFII) is not a stock which is familiar to all investors, as this mid-cap has only recently attracted interest which resulted in a sale of the overall business. Private equity firm Siris is willing to spend up to $1.7 billion for the business which sounds like a solid amount, even though shares are far removed from their highs. This comes as the recent performance of the underlying business is actually not too good with sales under pressure, and realistic earnings power being quite limited in relation to the valuation attached to the business currently.EFI has reached a deal with Siris Capital Group LLC to sell the business at $37 per share in cash, valuing the company at large at around $1.7 billion. If all goes well, the deal could close as soon as the third quarter of this year, so investors should expect to receive their money around that time. Siris reportedly knows what it is doing as it is a private equity firm which specifically targets mission-critical solutions and technology transition in the wider technology sphere.The price tag marks an impressive 45% premium over the 90 day weighted average up to the day of the deal announcement, but this includes the big downturn in Q4 of 2018 as well of course. That is not to say that the deal might not result in an optimal outcome for investors, as a go-shop period for 45 calendar days has been agreed to.Other than the premium, CEO Bill Muir believes that the new partner adds strategic and operational expertise that can allow the business to thrive in private hands. Siris likes the positioning at the forefront of digital transition in imaging and print. With digital inkjet penetration, automation and software being mega trends in this field, EFI could play a key role in this.The $37 offer looks impressive given the premium based on the recent average level at which the stock traded, yet investors should realize that the stock traded at $35 in October of 2018 and in fact was a $50 stock in the summer of 2017. This means that the generous premium does not look so attractive if the time horizon is lengthened.The reality is that overall, the digital print manufacturing industry has come under pressure in recent years, driven by declines in the office, consumer and copier/MFP segment, which was in part made up for by decent growth in industrial ink jet. EFI has done a pretty good job historically at maneuvering itself in the market, as sales have steadily doubled from half a billion in 2010 to more than $1 billion last year. The reason for the growth is that 60% of sales are derived from industrial ink jet and software to a smaller extent, making it a growth play in a world full of sales declines.On the final day of January, EFI reported its 2018 results with revenues up 2% to $1.02 billion. That was about the only good news as GAAP operating earnings fell from $27 to $20 million amidst restructuring costs doubling to $14 million. Amortisation costs are quite high at $45 million, depressing GAAP earnings. With 44 million shares outstanding, I arrived at an equity valuation just shy of $1.7 billion including a modest net debt position of about $42 million based on convertible debt.The $1.7 billion valuation comes down to a 1.7 time sales multiple, as the earnings picture is highly complicated. Having reported a net loss of $1 million, adjusted earnings came in at $83 million, or $1.83 per share. That adjusted earnings metric however is not that realistic as it excludes $13 million in convertible interest accruals and $18 million in stock-based compensation which both should not be excluded, although some other items can be debated.Adjusted for those items results in $50 million in adjusted earnings at best, suggesting that the deal is taking place at an elevated multiple.While the deal does not take place at an all time high, the reality is that despite the solid long-term track record, the company has seen tough times as of recent. Fourth quarter sales fell by 5% as the company guided for first quarter revenues of between $220 and $225 million. This suggests quite a fall from the $240 million reported in the first quarter of last year, implying that sales might fall between 6 and 8% on an annual basis.The business is seeing some topline struggles and while the balance sheet is resilient, earnings multiples, even based on realistic adjusted earnings, remain quite high. Based on the current situation, investors should be happy with the offer, although I recognise that higher share prices have been seen in the past."
3780326,56112,2015-12-30T08:02:01-05:00,"Few people think of inkjet as a growth market, but for industrial end-markets such as textiles and ceramics, industrial inkjet actually has a very strong value proposition.Fast fashion is quickly becoming an imperative for retail, which should drive inkjet penetration to double digits.EFI's strong margins, reasonable valuation, and clean balance sheet make it worth the due diligence for growth-oriented investors.","For someone with a diagnosable allergy to any and all printed documents, I sure seem to love following printer stocks. I couldn't resist buying HP at a single digit multiple of FCF back in the day, and I've spent more time thinking about ARC Document Solutions (NYSE:ARC) than I care to admit. The overhang on most of these stocks is the obvious elephant in the room: as people who are my age continue to replace Boomers, print volumes have nowhere to go but down.Electronics for Imaging (NASDAQ:EFII) is a different breed of printer company, though; while the company is in the inkjet business, it's actually targeting double-digit growth over time. Digital industrial inkjet technology has a strong value proposition in many industries, and while it doesn't attract the media coverage or have the general ""sexiness"" of 3D printing, it's likely a better investment proposition.Who Wins Retail? … Probably EFIWhile the company's positioning in verticals such as ceramics and display labels is strong, the most intriguing area is textiles - which they recently entered via the acquisition of Italian company Reggiani. The transaction didn't come cheap (well over $100MM including potential earn-outs), but it seems like a reasonable price to pay. Reggiani is a leader in the textile market, which has not only a much bigger TAM, but also a much faster growth rate than other segments. It's also very early on in the adoption curve - according to EFI, digital inkjet penetration in textile is well under 5% today versus nearly 50% for ceramics. In no small part due to the faster growth characteristics of this vertical, the company recently raised their long-term organic growth expectations for the whole Industrial Inkjet segment to 10% - 13%.I believe rapid adoption in textiles is well-supported. For retailers, neck-and-neck with the e-commerce/Amazon threat is the increasing penetration of fast-fashion companies like Zara, H&M, and Uniqlo. In response, ""traditional"" retailers like Gap (GAP) and J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) are experimenting with fast fashion (see here and here) and I expect this trend to accelerate rather than abate over the coming years. I believe speed-to-market and low-cost short-run production will increasingly become a ""pay to play"" C-level imperative for retailers in the same way that e-commerce/omni-channel is today.E-commerce is actually a good mental model; the rapid evolution of fast fashion from fringe to mainstream is as much a function of technological availability as anything else. While the traditional low-cost model was to set up mass production in Asia or other low-cost jurisdictions, the rapidly improving cost and quality of digital inkjet printing has enabled new business models with short-run manufacturing closer to the end consumer. As CFO Mark Olin explained at the Barclays Global Technology Conference:At EFI's recent Investor Day, the company had several customers speak about the impact that digital inkjet technology has had on their business. Beyond the issues I've already discussed, it seemed clear that EFI's unique position as an end-to-end provider of solutions is valuable; many customers (especially smaller ones) don't have the time, expertise, or interest to attempt to mix-and-match hardware, ink, software, and other components. Additionally, digital inkjet uses substantially less water than analog, which is another tailwind given increasingly stringent environmental regulation in many manufacturing jurisdictions.EFI obviously faces competition - most notably to me, Dover (NYSE:DOV) acquired MS in 2014, and spoke at length about the digital printing opportunity in textiles at their own Analyst Day last year. (For what it's worth, their industry commentary and discussion of the long-term opportunity is pretty in sync with EFI's expectations.) Given the very low market penetration, I think this competition may actually be a good thing, insofar as having another major player to ""validate"" the technology, and help move the market's understanding in the right direction, making the sales process less missionary. (It can be easier to pitch customers on ""we're better/cheaper/faster than X well-known competitor"" rather than ""hey we're doing this completely new thing that you've never heard of before."") While it's worth keeping an eye on Dover's progress with MS, in the near term, there's plenty of pie to take from traditional analog printing.Recurring Revenue Continues To Be A Focus, But Don't Get Carried AwayOver the past few years, EFI has posted good growth in recurring revenue, which includes ink, productivity management software, and its ""Fiery"" digital front end software. Fiery is essentially the industry standard, with an extremely high market share outside of HP (who EFII doesn't work with), so the company isn't expecting more than ~GDP+ growth here. Productivity software is a bigger opportunity; standard ERPs are often poorly suited for customers' specialized workflows. While EFI has strong share in the US (>50%), its share in the rest of the world is well under 20%. Over time, EFI should continue to displace smaller vendors as well as homegrown solutions. On the Q3 call, analysts made a big ado about a weak quarter in Productivity Software (down 6% y/y), but the company's explanation and corrective steps seem reasonable, and I see no reason to moderate growth expectations for this segment in the long term based on one weak quarter.Ink is obviously a big focus as well. The company has continued to drive double-digit ink volume growth and has put capital (both via R&D and acquisitions) into strengthening its foothold here. The company introduced ceramic ink late last year and is now at a $5MM/yr run rate (versus an estimate of $95MM/yr bought by current customers from other vendors). EFI should continue to gain share, but I'm personally cautious about expecting too much growth here - I don't think incumbent chemicals companies are just going to roll over without a fight and let EFI steal lots of high-margin revenue.ValuationAt 18x forward guided earnings, with a clean balance sheet to boot, EFI's valuation seems quite fair in context of its long-term expectation of high single to low double-digit organic growth plus the eventual gain of several points of operating margin. Relative to many management teams, EFI seems to have pretty good credibility; they've executed well this year despite significant forex headwinds and a weak global economy; their current 2016 expectations are actually above those set out at their 2013 Analyst Day. As I discussed extensively, I think the growth expectations for textile are well-supported.The balance sheet optionality here is significant as well; despite fairly significant M&A spend this year, cash and investments still comfortably exceed the convertible debt they issued last year. Over the next three years, management intends to spend up to $150MM on a buyback and up to $300MM on M&A. I wouldn't necessarily expect much M&A in the immediate future - the company is currently focused on integrating Reggiani (as well as Matan) onto a single platform, and they have enough pieces right now to make a big push in all the areas (ink, textiles, etc) that are currently part of the core strategic focus. In the medium to longer term, though, I believe the company will look to build out its presence in the corrugated packaging market, which is an even bigger TAM than textiles.Conclusion: EFI is One Worth Brushing Up OnEFI is one of the more interesting growth stories I follow. It can be a bit challenging to understand from the outside because there aren't a whole host of public comps. HP and Dover both have competing segments, but it's not a huge part of either of their business. There's also a big technical component - these are massive 13,000 pound machines that have to spit out picoliters of ink to precisions much smaller than a human hair at full factory line speed. Nonetheless, the secular growth is clearly there and by all indications, EFI appears to have a strong competitive position in each of its core verticals. I believe growth-oriented investors should be following EFI's progress and looking to build a position on dips."

The company's share price has fallen significantly in recent years due to fears over the company's growth prospects. With record results during the most recent quarter, as well as signs of its innovative offerings gaining traction, its share price looks to be turning around. I am buying stock in the name as its fundamental operations look to be fueling investor optimism.Its share price has fallen significantly in recent years due to fears over the company's stagnant operations. Recent innovations look to be gaining traction however, leading to stronger operational results. Investors have bid its share price higher from multi-year lows due to improving optimism.On the most recent breakout, the company cleared the $30 level, which had previously acted as strong resistance. Further operational improvements should continue to fuel upside momentum in its share price, leading to gains in coming quarters.EFII is experiencing a turnaround as the company aims to become more consistently profitable, while also tapping into the industry's need to grow its digital capabilities. The company provides industrial format display graphics, corrugated packaging and display, textile, and ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printers worldwide. Its Industrial Inkjet segment offers VUTEk format display graphics, Nozomi corrugated packaging and display, Reggiani textile, and Cretaprint ceramic tile decoration and building material industrial digital inkjet printers. Its Productivity Software segment provides software suite that enables end-to-end business and production workflows for the print and packaging industry. EFII's direct business grew 17% over the previous quarter, driven by record revenue for both Inkjet and Productivity Software. This included 34% recurring revenue, according to management. Software performed well posting 25% growth, with Inkjet revenues increasing 15%, while meeting management's objectives to ship four Nozomi units.Over the last quarter, the company passed the symbolic milestone of $1 billion revenue for the trailing four quarters. This potentially symbolizes a new era for EFII as they attempt to return to consistently positive performance. It achieved record Q1 revenue of $240 million, above its guidance range with strong growth for Industrial Inkjet and Productivity Software, as was mentioned above. From a market segment perspective, EFII is experiencing solid demand for both its Textile and Packaging portfolios, with momentum continuing into the next quarter, leading to a solid sequential and year-over-year outlook.Its textile portfolio continues to innovate as EFII recently introduced Reggiani colors which is its new top-of-the-line system and its first high-speed fabric printer offering to ourcolors, according to management. They also plan to introduce the OnePlus system for textile later in the year. Management expects to introduce a number of OnePlus high-volume industrial printers addressing EFI target markets over the coming years, further boosting revenue. The systems will be designed to leverage EFI's proprietary technology and expertise in transforming very large industries to digital-based manufacturing, according to its earnings call.Additionally, EFII succeeded transacting and shipping nine units of its Nozomi, meeting its commitment to ship four units in the March quarter. In future quarters, management anticipates shipping additional units, while EFII is increasingly confident in its ability to generate $60 million in revenues for Nozomi for the full year, according to management.Its confidence in its revenue target is linked to the increasing interest the company is seeing from corrugated suppliers around the globe. They have received positive feedback from most of the large players in corrugated packaging, with many of them indicating they plan to start testing digital production initially in one or two factories and then expanding to other locations based on the ROI and the customer's reaction to the unique digital capabilities, according to the earnings call.This will likely drive the sale of additional units within a single location, while at the same time management expects other players serving the same market will be forced to adopt digital technology to successfully compete. Management is thus ramping up its global service and support organization to provide timely, high-quality service.Its Industrial Inkjet segment generated record Q1 revenue of $142.2 million, which was up 15% year-over-year in equal to 59% of total EFI revenue. Inkjet revenue was driven by an improvement in close rates for its printers in the quarter. Ink volume was also up 8% year-over-year with double-digit growth in textile and UV display graphics offset by weakness in ceramics. Productivity Software delivered record Q1 revenue of $43.8 driven by strong growth from all of its market segments, representing 18% of total EFI revenue in the quarter, also a record percentage per software.Productivity Software showed 25% growth, driven primarily by organic growth in almost all of its product lines and geographies, while some deals closed that had been delayed from previous periods. Management believes there are signs of early returns from the increased focus on those specific product lines, enabling its targeted industries to automate and transform the business workflow.On top of innovation and increasing industry demand, management continues to focus on improving its financial metrics. Over the most recent quarter, EFII increased collections year-over-year and reduced inventory levels sequentially. The progress will take time to show up in cash generation due to the ramp up of Nozomi and other new Inkjet products slated for the second half of the year, as well as by a $5 million restructuring charge. As Nozomi manufacturing normalizes however, EFII should see progress returning to cash from operations equaling 90% non-GAAP net income later in the year, according to its earnings call.Below is a chart of the company's revenue and earnings per share. Management has been forced to innovate as revenue stagnated the last few years. Innovation however, has come at a cost, with EPS dipping into negative territory. Early demand for a number of the company's offerings however, signal that the company could be at the base of a trend higher for both its top- and bottom-line results. Investor sentiment is picking up following the most recent earnings call, and further optimism led by fundamental results should lead its share price higher in coming quarters.EFII is breaking out higher following improved earnings results.

All segments and regions are firing on all cylinders, except for the Chinese construction market.The stock has been trading in a wide sideways range so it delivered just ~10% returns this year. However, the current weakness presents a solid buying opportunity.I continue to be very bullish on EFII and its $1B sales target by the end of 2016. My target price remains at ~$48 and offers a ~17% upside.","Electronics for Imaging Inc. (NASDAQ:EFII) reported strong results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2014 (earnings call, press release). Revenue reached $197.7M, up 11% Y/Y. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.43, up 10% Y/Y despite a $0.11 negative foreign exchange headwind. GAAP EPS reached $0.10, down from $0.33 a year ago. For the nine months of 2014, revenue is up 9% Y/Y and non-GAAP EPS is up 17.5% Y/Y. GAAP EPS of $0.45 is significantly down from $0.70 a year ago.In terms of segments, industrial inkjet posted 10% revenue growth, driven by strong demand especially for the VUTEk and Jetrion product lines. VUTEk posted excellent results on product updates that expand into both high and lower end markets, led by GS5500, the world's first which was the world's first 5-meter LED printer. EFII also again sold out of H1625, the new entry-level production printer. The high-margin UV ink volume increased 26%. On the flip side, the Chinese construction market continues to be weak and companies are delaying investment in new equipment. A near-term improvement is not expected. However, the strong ink sales should offset any future weakness in the Chinese construction-driven demand for EFII's tile printers and inks. Productivity software segment delivered strong growth of 18% year-over-year and EFII performed two acquisitions in this segment using the new $300M+ convertible debt raised in September. The Fiery segment grew 9% Y/Y.The company's strategy of focusing on product innovation, execution, operating efficiency and geographic expansion, mostly through acquisitions, continues to deliver very strong sales and non-GAAP earnings growth. The company reaffirmed its guidance to grow revenues to $1B annually by the end of 2016. As I noted, first in 2013 and then earlier this year, EFII is a great, high-conviction long-term stock pick for me. However, the stock is usually richly valued. Nevertheless, thanks to the current broad-market dip, the stock fell back towards the $41 region where it offers a ~17% upside within a year with my unchanged target price of ~$48 per share."
2879686,46261,2015-02-04T15:43:51-05:00,"The recent convertible loan increased EFII's cash to $600M, or 33% of market cap, while the company still keeps throwing off positive FCF.This abundance of cash signals higher share buybacks and possible increased acquisition activity in the near future.Recent core sales slowdown signals currency headwinds from the strong dollar, which were extremely strong and could permanently lower organic sales growth rates if the dollar remains strong.The recent dip offers a solid buying opportunity with a ~30% upside within 12 months with a price target of ~$48.20 per share.Competitiveness in China is one of my long-term concerns.","Investment thesisElectronics for Imaging (NASDAQ:EFII) is a market leader in digital printing technology with growing economic moat in areas that include wide- and super-wide-format digital printing, printer controllers and productivity software for printing and packaging. EFII continues to be one of my highest-conviction picks due to my former work experience related to the digital signage industry.Since May 2014, the stock has been bid up by several factors, including primarily the fact that it's been mentioned as a top pick by Mariko Gordon, one of the investing stars of the Ira Sohn Investment Conference. Finally, after almost a year, the stock price fell back to the levels where it started before the Mariko Gordon pick. This price fall also has other reasons specific to the company and the industry, such as that growth expectations were set too high too far out based on new product launches, as I mentioned in one of my previous articles, and the sudden departure of the CEO for a competitor. However, the long-term prospects of the industry and EFII as a leading company in that industry remain very solid. There are long-term challenges such as commoditization of certain market segments and lack of marketing focus, but overall, EFII's recent price fall offers a solid opportunity to buy a market leader with strong economic moat at a reasonable price again.Almost a third of EFII's sales are now recurring as it continues to build a complete ecosystem of products and software solutions that make digital printing at a high quality, speed and efficiency. Once a company purchases the EFII printer and optimizes the printing processes for its printers and inks, it becomes a very long-term and loyal customer that is very hard to switch to competitors. It usually also continues to buy branded, high-margin, EFII inks throughout the lifetime of the machine. The in-house product innovation helps EFII maintain its competitive edge together with a strong direct sales force.Second CFO leaving in under two yearsIn a surprise move in late December, CFO David Reeder announced his departure after just a year, the second time in two years that COO Marc Olin had to assume temporary CFO responsibilities in addition to his COO job. This is an unfortunate distraction. As if this was not enough, Reeder accepted a job position with one of EFII's competitors, Lexmark (NYSE:LXK). Although Lexmark focuses on small-format printers, it could potentially venture into large format printing or gain competitive information on inks and print management software, among other things.EFII took on debt through convertible note offering, but risk of a dilution is very small and more than worth itEFII issued $345M convertible debt in September 2014, which will be used for stock repurchases, acquisitions and general company needs. The interest rate on the convertible notes is very low, only 0.75% p.a., paid semi-annually. However, the holders of the notes - Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have a right to convert their notes for EFII's common stock upon maturity on September 1, 2019, in a price of ~$52.72 per share. In effect, the holders of the notes have a free call option expiring in 2019 to acquire EFII shares at a price of $52.72 per share in exchange for the lower-than-normal interest rate that they are receiving for lending money to EFII.At the same time, EFII partially hedged the transaction (the obligation to sell its shares to noteholders at $52.72) by purchasing an options spread worth the full notional value of the stocks convertible from the notes by buying calls with a strike price of $52.72 and selling the same amount of warrants at a strike price of $68.86. In effect, EFII hedged any potential dilution from the deal if the price of EFII stock is below $68.86. This represents a ~80% upside from the current price, which is a very reasonable hedging range for a five-year period. If EFII trades above $68.86 in September 2019, there will be a roughly 10% dilution. However, the stock would have to gain 80% in five years for a dilution to take place, which itself would be a very nice 13% annualized return on investment worth the risk of a ~10% dilution. The question is, of course, how much the company will have to pay for this hedge annually as it rolls the call options every year until 2019? After these costs are taken into account, perhaps the real interest rate on the loan is not so attractive. For 2014, for example, the sale of warrants generated ~$34M but the purchase of convertible note hedges cost $63M.Interestingly, the 13% implied annualized gain also corresponds with the 13% expected annual growth rate that the company is targeting in the long run, showing the company doesn't believe it can grow (or doesn't plan to grow) faster than 13% annually. So any valuation that implies faster growth rates than 13% annually should be taken with a lot of caution. On the other hand, using 13% as a future growth estimate seems reasonable, as this is the level for which the company hedges the upside risk. In other words, the valuation should converge to a 13% annual growth rate.More buybacks and high ROI in the cards from the convertible notes debtAnother way to look at the transaction is to see it as that the company is borrowing money and selling covered options (warrants) on stocks that it has yet to issue, thus boosting its financial leverage very smartly, in my opinion, and achieving excellent ROI on this transaction because it will probably be used for share buybacks (a ~6% ROI at ~16x P/E) or acquiring future growth and profits. Yet another way of looking at this interesting transaction is to see that in effect, the company is borrowing money to make a bullish bet (bull call spread) on its own stock.Very interestingly, as part of the transaction, EFII used $10M of this newly-issued debt to purchase its own stock from the purchasers of the notes (entities that borrowed this money to EFII). In effect, these holders of EFFI stock were willing to lend EFII money at a low 0.75% interest rate plus a free option to receive EFII stock at $52.72 in five years in order to get rid of their EFII stock now at a then ~$43 per share. However, the lenders are also getting the call options to buy EFII at $52.72 for free, because their costs of borrowing are practically zero, or certainly lower than the 0.75% they are getting even for the loan (unless EFII goes bankrupt, of course), which can be hedged by buying credit default swaps or shorting the stock. So the banks could create a put option with a strike price of $52.72 with zero time decay and only a ~30% potential loss from the current price of $37 per share. If EFII stock falls by more than 30%, they've made a 100% profit on the money at risk. If EFII stock falls by more than 30%, they can make more.Certainly, the banks involved in the transactions have made and will make very nice money in fees. One has to wonder what the connection of this transaction is with the fact that the CFO has left two months after the transaction.Could an acquisition be in the cards? EFII has 33% of market cap in cashAfter the convertible debt issuance, the company now has ~$600M in cash. The management specifically mentioned acquisitions as one of the possible uses of this cash. Although my valuation is not based on an acquisition, a takeover would be a free bonus for stock buyers in the short run. If the company manages to acquire sales (and profits) at a ~2.5x P/S ratio and uses $500M of the available cash for an acquisition, this would boost sales and EPS by ~20%. The stock could enjoy a similar 20% upside. However, I will repeat that this is just theory, and there are no official acquisition talks known in the markets. However, given the company's history of ~25 acquisitions in the past and its long-term goal to grow at a ~13% annual rate, plus its commitment to get to $1B in annual sales next year, it is very likely the management will try to boost sales with an acquisition soon. Whatever the company uses the money for, it is very likely to create value for shareholders. The debt/equity of ~37% is very conservative, given the company's positive FCF year after year. The debt to capital of ~18% keeps the balance sheet very strong and even offers higher potential for safe leverage to boost growth if there are attractive takeover or investment opportunities.Short interest higherIn an interesting development, short interest spiked in August 2014 and remained above 5% of float since then although it's been gradually falling somewhat in the past two months. The short spike corresponds with the convertible note issuance and could have been a way for the lending banks to hedge some of their long EFII debt exposure by shorting the stock. However, institutional investors are still holding strong positions, including Fidelity (~11% of the stock) and BlackRock (~8.9%).Organic growth has fallen recently to just 7% partly due to strong U.S. dollar currency headwindsSales in the final quarter of 2014 increased 7% Y/Y. Non-GAAP EPS was up 14% Y/Y and operating cash flow was up 13% Y/Y. For the full-year 2014, sales rose 9% and non-GAAP EPS was up 14%. The numbers look very good although the sales growth has been slowing in the recent quarters as the acquisition boost wanes.However, if we dig deeper into the numbers, the GAAP EPS reached just $0.25 per share in Q4 compared to $1.54 a year ago, and for the full year, GAAP EPS was just $0.7 versus $2.26 in 2013. Both the top and bottom lines were impacted by negative currency headwinds (strong dollar) and continued lackluster construction markets, especially in China (Chinese construction boom slowdown).In terms of product segments, the industrial inkjet segment delivered a very strong double-digit growth in the VUTEk and Jetrion brands. UV ink volume also was up a strong 13% Y/Y, offset by the continued weakness in the ceramic printing segment, due primarily to ongoing softness in the construction markets, especially in China. As a result, the overall growth in industrial inkjet of below 3% Y/Y was a disappointment even though constant currency growth would have been ~6%. However, the company continues to be optimistic for the second half of 2015. I have my doubts until I see the numbers, as it seems that core business is slowing. The core business is often the ""door-opener"" for further cross-sales and recurring sales. Fiery OEM controller front ends were up ~16% and productivity software was up ~3% Y/Y. Recurring revenue was up 9% Y/Y and represented a solid 26% of total sales.Future growth prospectsThere are three main reasons for the strong market share gains EFII is enjoying at the moment and will enjoy in the future. The first is benefits of EFII's complete ecosystem (cross-selling), where a customer that purchases EFII printers is likely to use the company's inks, productivity software and Fiery with its new additional press. Second, the company maintains its leadership in the product innovation. The new printer engines are faster, better, more versatile and capture the continuing trend toward the digital printing. And the third reason is the scale and focus on the Fiery digital front ends, where EFII has been outspending and out-innovating the competition with new capabilities in color management, speed, resolution, maximum print size, etc.Fiery continues to be the company's stronghold and has been a great cash cow for EFII. The company still has a tremendous economic moat in most areas here. Other areas have better growth prospects but also higher competition levels and weaker competitive advantages for EFII. These include the wide- and super-wide-format VUTEk printers (here, the company is very strongly positioned as a market leader), applications management businesses, which are not really well integrated after their acquisitions but generate solid growth, and finally the ceramic tile printing business, which is becoming quite competitive, so the future is a question mark in terms of margins.In the long run, the company has to transform to embrace growth areas and continue improving in the competitive ecosystemSo in the short run, the company is doing really well, especially after a strong CAPEX cycle in 2013 and 2014, which resulted in many technological innovations that have been recently rolled out to most of EFII's important product lines. This will drive strong sales and maintain margins for several years. However, in the long run, the company will maintain the innovation lead, which is expensive and hard to maintain, and also find and secure several new growth areas to replace/supplement the cash-cow core business that is becoming commoditized in some areas. Geographical expansion and venturing into these new areas is harder, more costly and more risky. Additionally, the company doesn't have such strong competitive advantages in these new areas. The current strong internal sales force team might need to be supplemented with better marketing efforts in the future to build EFII's brand in the new growth areas. The marketing efforts will cost money and, combined with stronger competition, might pressure margins several years down the line.The situation on the Chinese market is especially concerning. For the full-year 2014, APAC sales were basically flat, dragging the company's overall growth down. Excluding Japan, APAC sales even fell 7% in 2014. This trend is certainly troubling. Fiery sales are rapidly growing in the APAC region, so clearly the demand is shifting from EFII-branded products toward the OEM printers, which use just EFII's Fiery front end (controller). This may be fine if EFII is able to cross-sell inks and software to those Fiery users. However, EFII printers certainly deliver higher cross-sell revenue and also strengthen the company's brand in the long run, so the trend toward the OEM printers is troubling in China, judging from the fact that the productivity software sales grew in line with the company's branded industrial printers (just 3%) while Fiery grew 16%. Inks seem to be somewhat more responsive to Fiery OEM sales, so there is some hope that the company remains strong in the inks sector even if its branded printer sales lag.The management is very keen on watching the costs constantlyLots of development and testing jobs have been outsourced to India. However, it seems a lot of the low-hanging fruits in terms of cost-cutting and efficiencies have been already picked. It will be hard to cut costs further and improve margins. Nevertheless, the company has a strong history of watching the margins relentlessly, and I believe it will be able to keep the market leadership while generally still being able to deliver solid margins, especially out of China.ValuationEFII trades at a P/S of ~2.3x, TTM EV/EBITDA of ~16.5x and a forward P/E of ~16x. The seasonally strongest numbers were just reported, so the stock might take some time to rest, especially after the recent post-earnings spike. Also, the market-makers, who were willing to sell call options at ~$52.72, think the stock will not trade above that level within roughly a year. On the other hand, these market-makers also think the stock might trade above ~$68.8 in five years from now, given their long warrants position they were willing to take. If the company uses the financial leverage well and perhaps even expands it, it can grow well beyond the planned 13% CAGR level.Overall, I believe a 13% annual growth is a reasonable assumption on which I base my valuation. The typical organic growth rate of the company is 7% to 9% per year, and the company's market position continues to be very solid. The core business is slowing down a bit, but the company has several strong growth areas it has been expanding, which will fuel future growth. The organic growth will need to be boosted by occasional acquisitions to the 13% annual growth level. This is realistically achievable using the positive FCF and a modest debt. The recent convertible debt issuance will certainly help to ensure these targets are met or even exceeded. Considering these factors, my intrinsic value estimate using future DCFs is ~$48.20, offering a ~30% upside within a year.Source: Author CalculationsRisksThe competition, although weaker in some of EFII's core businesses than we are used to in other industries, is going to remain, especially in the low-cost Asia. Also, the recent CFO leaving for Lexmark threatens to put Lexmark in a competing position in some new areas. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) such as Canon (NYSE:CAJ) and Xerox (NYSE:XRX) are competitors, as well, in a certain way. In the super-wide-format digital printing market, EFII's competitors include HP (NYSE:HP) and NUR Macroprinters. In the wide-format market, EFII competes with HP and Mimaki, and in the packaging market, EFII competes primarily with HP. In the inks, HP is an especially mighty competitor.EFII has had some nasty litigations going on regarding paying some workers too little, angering part of its workforce and harvesting some bad publicity. EFII had to pay a fine, as well. The outsourcing to India is likely to continue, and this might create further pressure on the remaining U.S. salaries, so further employee dissatisfaction is possible in the U.S. The outsourcing brings risk of poor communication and coordination with the U.S. offices, resulting in lower efficiency.High stock-based compensationThe total stock-based compensation costs for the full-year 2014 reached ~$35M, which is roughly the same amount as net GAAP income was, so the stock-based compensation consumed ~50% of ""pre-compensation"" GAAP net income. The stock-based compensation represented 5% of the sales for the same year, clearly too high. This is a very high share and is unsustainable, in my opinion, if the company wants to motivate new investors to buy the stock for the long haul. The stock buybacks are going to mitigate this problem, but just partially. Part of the problem might have been the CFO transition, so it will be interesting to watch if the compensation costs fall in 2015 as a percentage of sales and EPS.ConclusionEFII's January stock price dip offers a solid buying opportunity with a ~30% upside and a target price of ~$48.20 per share if the company manages to maintain its current 7% organic sales growth and boost it with an occasional acquisition. Given the company's ~$600M cash, there is a good chance shareholders will be rewarded with higher share buybacks, and perhaps even an acquisition. Strong U.S. dollar, lower branded printer sales and China weakness continue to be near-term concerns. Markets imply a relatively high future growth, so if EFII doesn't deliver, the stock has a significant downside."
1720362,23469,2013-09-30T08:15:54-04:00,,"Electronics for Imaging (NASDAQ:EFII) is a company primed for growth as the landscape for industrial and ceramic printing shifts. For years, printing was done through analog devices that used different presses for customization. That industry is changing to adopt a digital printing mechanism that does not use presses but digital customization features. The problem for years has been the detail of digital printing and its lack of performance in comparison to analog. EFII, though, is a premium product in this industry, and we believe its combination of value and growth are attractive. We see three main catalysts driving growth moving forward: the revolution of ceramic printing, the company's ability to supply a changing paradigm in advertising, as well as the company's LED cooling systems. These two initiatives are the key to the company.Image courtesy of Smithers PiraMost analysts like to focus in on the digital printing world for its ability to appeal to signage and advertisers. One interesting area that EFII is attacking is the ceramic tile industry. Last year, the company acquired a company called CretaPrint. CreatPrint was attractive because it was a digital ceramic printing company. The company's EFI CretaPrint C3 is the combination of technology and software from EFI with the ceramic printing of CreatPrint. The combination of the two has created an amazing product that can print ceramic tiles using a digital printing system. The company combines the tile printing with their Fiery software, which is the backbone of the company.What is the opportunity here?EFII has noted that only 25% of the ceramic tile business is currently printing digitally. At the same time, the tile industry is moving right now out of the Western world and into emerging markets like China, Mexico, Brazil, and Turkey. What that means is that there is first a transformation of the industry to digital while at the same time a lot of cyclical growth in new printers being purchased as this transition occurs. EFII sits right at the middle of that industry as one of the leaders in ceramic tile printing.The potential is large. EFII believes that the industry can double in the next ten years for digital printing on ceramic tiles, and the industry is moving that direction. Dr. Ray Work of Work Associates, a digital printing consulting firm, noted that a strong shift from analog to digital in the industry is happening and the ceramic tile manufacturers can see their investment in a digital printer paid back in six months. Further, once they are working with EFII, the company can get access to the newest software and updates that will continue to improve their productivity.The biggest benefit for ceramic tile, and why we believe that it will be a huge success for EFII is that with digital printing the ease of changing designs is a major benefit. Not only are the amount of design potentials infinite, but it takes a day to changeover on analog devices. The changeover from a digital printer can take minutes. The potential is huge here, and EFII is one of the only ways to gain exposure to this industry directly. Further, the barriers to entry are sizeable. The technology is unique as well as EFII bought a company with over 1700 clients already in CretaPrint.The inkjet industry as a whole is a rapidly growing industry. In 2011, it was just over $33B in size. By 2017, it is expected to be over $67B according to Smithers Pira. One of the main reasons for this is mostly signage. The key to EFII is definitely signage, but we want to focus less on that growth since it's a widely understood area. Signage is over 50% (and the majority of EFII's current business) of the inkjet industry because of the ease of digital printers ability to change what it is printing as well as the cost of doing so is cheaper. It would not make as much sense for newspapers because of the sheer size of the project as well as less need to change printing each day.What we want to focus on rather than the potential for signage and consumer-based marketing is the shift in advertising overall to showcase the potential for this industry. One of the reasons we are overly bullish on this side of the business is because the way advertisers and consumer companies can get to potential customers has changed. Electronics believes this side of the business can double in the next 3.5 years because old methods do not work as well. In the past, the easiest way to get to a consumer was through the TV. Commercials were highly effective at getting companies' brand and products to consumers. The changing shift of television with less commercial watching and less attention to commercials is a growing concern for companies.For one, people are watching less TV per week. Just look at this chart below:More people are switching to the Internet for news and entertainment as well as using digital devices more as well. 43M Americans are using on-demand services and that number has grown by 60% in the past year. Devices are constantly being made to make this easier, such as MyChoice, which will automatically flip a channel for a customer when a commercial comes onto the screen. Therefore, how can advertisers get in front of their audience more - signage. Marketers are a huge market for EFII and their inkjet revolution.The suite of products offered by Electronics is unique as well, and they have built their software as an upgrade into a lot of other inkjet printers outside of the ones that are exclusively EFII's. The company compares their business of software (Fiery) to that of upgrading a car with a new sound system:We believe that the revolution of technology in TV and internet is going to provide a great outlet for continued demand and growth in the largest component of EFII's business moving forward.Lastly, we see a significant catalyst for EFII in their LED cooling software, which is a very unique offering. Since digital printing from EFII is about productivity, automation, and developing offerings that allow industrial printers and other printing companies to grow margins, one offering differentiates the company even further - cool cure technology.The cool cure technology is a green printing solution that focuses in on power consumption and less hardware. The company has focused on developing an environmentally-friendly cooling technology as well as UV ink products that both appeal to consumers, and the company believes theses are places of growth for their business. The company's environmentally friendly ink has no volatile organic compounds, 50% natural monomers, are not considered hazardous waste, and contain organic substances that can be recycled.We believe offering products like this that are not available on other competitors' models is a big win for the company and is one way they are differentiating themselves.Moving forward, we are expecting continued growth that is very strong for the company around 10-15% per year in revenue through 2017. The company is well-positioned in the two prime areas of growth for the industry. Further, as the industry grows, the company's ink volumes will continue to expand that will drive home continued sales with a high margin. In the company's latest quarter, they saw inkjet volume up 26% year/year while their industrial inkjet revenue was only up 10%. The company is selling a lot of ink, which just goes to show you that the company's buying these products are producing at high levels and enjoying using their products.Let's put all this information into a DCF analysis format to see just how much shares should be worth.DCF AnalysisOperating income: We expect operating income to outpace revenue slightly as the company expands margins with software subscriptions on the rise as well as ink volumes. A conservative model would be to estimate CAGR of operating income around 12-14%. Those levels will actually likely push even higher into 2015-2017 as the industry is starting a strong cyclical growth with the macro global economy starting to show more green shoots. We can expect operating income, therefore, to be at the low-end around $60M by 2017.Depreciation: This number should rise as the company does expect to continue to acquire more companies over the next several years. We would anticipate a similar rate of growth to revenue. We would expect depreciation around $45M by 2017.Capital Expenditures: This number should jump up each year as we expect more acquisitions to occur over the next several years as well as the company has already shown an interest in share buybacks ($100M plan already launched and will take several more quarters to complete).We will be using a cap rate of 5%, which is also a conservative level to discount the company.When we use these figures in our DCF analysis, we come up with a price target of $41 for the next twelve months. That level is very conservative and uses a CAGR that is likely underestimating growth. Further, if the company can show consistent growth of 10-15% per year, we can expect the company to attract a more premium valuation than its current 17.3 P/E and 1.7 PEG ratio.ConclusionMoving forward from here, we are a big fan of Electronics for Imaging. We believe they are very well positioned to take advantage of a strong growth market, and that the company is set to produce very positive returns for investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

        Almost a third of revenues are recurring, and the share is likely to keep growing from continued strength in ink sales and subscription-basis and SaaS-basis software sales.","Investment thesisElectronics for Imaging (NASDAQ:EFII) is an undisputed market leader in digital printing technology with growing economic moat in areas that include wide- and super-wide-format digital printing, printer controllers and productivity software for printing and packaging markets. The company is richly valued, pricing in a 13% annual EPS growth for the next ten years. EFI is also trading roughly 50% higher than a year ago when I first recommended it. As if this was not enough, EFI was one of top picks of Mariko Gordon at the Ira Sohn Investing Conference this May. Due to these factors, the stock is very bid up and offers just a little ~6% upside in 2014 based on acceleration of organic growth from recently introduced, new products and stronger ink sales. However, EFI is a great long-term investment with excellent prospects for ~15% annual stock appreciation because it will most likely maintain or even strengthen its dominant industry position and innovation leadership.Although EFI is one of my strongest-conviction, long-term stock picks along with the likes of Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) and Fact Set (NYSE:FDS), I realize that the stock has gained 50% in a year and is priced almost for perfection. Therefore, in case of a significant global economic slowdown or a recession, EFI's stock price would get severely punished for being a cyclical stock and a small-cap stock on top of that. So the reward/risk today is not as favorable as last year, and investors who believe in a severe correction within the next two years should hedge new EFI long positions by being short on other stocks or a small-cap index.Recurring sales and long-lasting relationshipsAlmost a third of EFI's sales are now recurring as it continues to build a complete ecosystem of products and software solutions that make digital printing at a high quality, speed and efficiency. Once a company purchases the EFI printer and optimizes the printing processes for its printers and inks, it becomes a very long-term and loyal customer that is very hard to switch to competitors. It usually also continues to buy branded, high-margin, EFI inks throughout the lifetime of the machine.Strong economic moat getting strongerElectronics for Imaging is not an ordinary company. It's been the true, undisputed market share and product innovation leader in the digital printing industry for many years now with its flagship VUTEk brand. And EFI's strong moat has been even widening recently with accelerated smart investments in more product innovation that translates into an ever larger technological lead and international expansion. Some anecdotal evidence that investors seldom hear from companies these days confirms EFI's strong market leadership position and great growth prospects.For example, EFI currently sold out its inventory of its newly launched product in the entry-level LED printing range (~$100,000 per machine) as strong demand put production capacity to its limits. Another piece of evidence is that the company gets higher product exposure due to weaker players dropping out of some of the industry lines, and some other players skipping attendance of several important regional trade shows in order to cut marketing costs. The result is that EFI gets increased exposure for its products and solidifies its position of the undisputed industry leader.Another piece of evidence is that the digital printing trend, which EFI is a leader in, keeps absolutely decimating traditional commercial graphics products of such titans as 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Avery Dennison, so that the former merged this traditional division -- a rare move that resulted in a reduction of the number of divisions (organizational businesses) from six to five worldwide. Avery has been divesting large assets in order to consolidate the struggling commercial graphics business. As another example, EFI was also a contributor to the demise of Kodak.Already strong organic growth is about to accelerate on sales of several new productsAs the world leader in digital imaging and print management solutions for commercial and enterprise printing, EFI is well-positioned to meet the growing demand for high-quality digital color printing. Strong economic moat, a leading market share, a strong direct sales force and innovation leadership will help EFI accelerate organic growth even further, especially in the VUTEk inkjet printing and new Fiery products (controllers that form the ""brain"" of printers built by OEM manufacturers).The company will target 13% annual top line growth between now and the end of 2016, and it is more confident that it can meet these targets after the Q2 numbers. Strong organic growth will be supplemented by some acquisition activity to achieve these targets, especially in the fast-growing EMEA region. Given that organic growth is expected to reach ~9% for 2014 and is expected to accelerate, EFI needs just 4% annual supplemental acquisition-driven growth. With the very strong pipeline of larger acquisition targets, some of which are expected to be realized in the future, I have high confidence in the company's ambitious guidance, which is above EFI's usual growth rates from the past decade, nonetheless.On the other hand, the stock price is really valued almost for perfection, with currently pricing in a 13% annual EPS growth for a decade, followed by stagnant sales. In case of a recession or a significant economic slowdown, the target growth rate will increasingly rely on acquisitions. Nevertheless, due to the company's dominant competitive position and strong moat, I am confident it will be able to find suitable acquisition targets or gain even larger market share as weaker players keep getting weaker and eventually consider quitting certain segments.New product introductions are showing signs of very strong initial demand and will drive future growthAs robust CAPEX surge starts bearing fruits and high R&D spending continues at ~16% of sales, an array of new products launched this year demonstrate continued industry innovation leadership. The products include an entry-level (~$100,000 per machine) LED hybrid printer (H1625) with lowered total cost of ownership and LED (cool curing) capability in a hybrid printer. The total addressable market is ~$400M and the machine is truly unique, so the initial demand has been very strong. The product was sold out in Q2, and Q3 production is already nearly sold out. Real-use tests have shown significant energy savings stemming from the LED technology.The company also announced UltraDrop technology, which creates ultra-high-resolution, high-quality output without slowing down production speed. Speed is part of productivity that is a very important factor in making the purchasing decision due to the high overall cost of the printing machines. The UltraDrop offers the powerful combination of smallest drop size in its class combined with grayscale capability. The reception to this differentiated capability has been tremendous, and EFI is currently phasing in this technology across its inkjet product portfolio. For example, the newly introduced VUTEk 5500LXr, the industry's first 5-meter LED inkjet printer with UltraDrop technology as a standard configuration, showed very strong market reception.On the ceramic tile front, EFI introduced a revolutionary, special-effect capability that the company calls the XL Tile, which allows for new 3D effects using a large drop on printed tiles. At the same time, demand for Fiery Front End for Cretaprint continues to pick up, and EFI is also making progress on its Ink for Cretaprint ceramic tile line-up and is on schedule to commercialize the ink later this year. Finally the company started shipping its most advanced, digital front end platform in the Fiery FS164, which offers even faster processing, unsurpassed image quality, seamless MIS integration, enhanced feasibly and automated workflow for the digital printing environment.Overall, this very strong product lineup and product upgrades that are in the early stage of hitting the market will drive higher organic growth and further solidify the leading market position of EFI.Acquisitions will help drive sales toward the 2016 target of $1BEFI acquired roughly 25 companies in the past 20 years, documenting a successful acquisition strategy. Besides focusing on the EMEA region, including the Francophonic market, the company also recently made a couple of smaller, financially non-material but strategically important acquisitions that further broaden the completeness of EFI's solution by offering cutting edge software solutions and smartphone apps for fast and efficient control of the printing process from virtually any device.In January 2014, EFI acquired a shipping software developer SmartLinc Inc. EFI and SmartLinc have many joint customers who will benefit from further, streamlined integration between the MIS/ERP and shipping systems with automatic submission of print jobs between the software for further tracking and analysis. This will strengthen EFI's offer in the productivity software segment and recurring sales.In July 2014, EFI announced an acquisition of DirectSmile GmbH, an award-winning provider of software solutions, for cross media marketing automation in order to offer EFI's customers an easy-to-use media personalization and automation software solution through integration into EFI's Digital StoreFront that fits well within the fast-growing web-to-print segment offer.The current acquisition pipeline remains strong, with several larger candidates in talks, so the strong future outlook for the acquisition pace continues, as the geographical expansion is working well in Europe. The company plans for more deals to continue expanding geographically, especially in the EMEA region.EFI has zero net debt, giving it plenty of room to leverage its balance sheet with debt, should it need to speed up the acquisition growth beyond use of the free cash flow it generates from operations. However, it is not necessary to use debt to achieve even the ambitious 13% revenue growth targets, which is giving lots of extra room to boost the acquisition pace, should the organic growth falter for some reason, which I don't expect.Less severe competition in some segments as EFI increases its technological leadEFI is the market leader and some competitors decided to quit portions of the market because EFI is maintaining and even increasing its technological lead. For example, Kodak used to be a strong competitor in some areas. Some competitors also decide to skip some important trade fair shows to save money. This gives even more prominent exposure to EFI's products as it attempts to be present on many important regional trade shows. And this year, EFI had a great line-up of new and upgraded products, so this combination leads to a stronger-than-usual sales growth.Historically EFI used to have more third-party competitors, great competitors such as Kodak. However, competitors in its core printing controller markets potentially still include Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) such as Canon and Xerox.In the super-wide-format digital printing market, EFI's competitors include HP and NUR Macroprinters. In the wide format market, EFI competes with HP and Mimaki, and in the packaging market, EFI competes primarily with HP.Current financial situationQ2 2014 financial results were very strong overall, driven by balanced growth across all of the business segments. Revenue reached $193M, up 7% Y/Y. Total recurring revenue was $53M, up 11% Y/Y and representing 28% of total revenue. Operating profit margin expanded to 13.5% and delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.44, up 16% Y/Y.In terms of product segments, strength in the digital front end segment and Fiery solutions drove most of the growth. The industrial inkjet segment generated revenue of $93M, up 7% Y/Y and half of EFI's total revenue. Sales in this segment were driven by strong growth in both display graphic printers and UV ink. The flagship UV ink printer volume increased 15% Y/Y, the 19th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The Fiery segment continued its strong performance with revenue of $68.3M, up 7% Y/Y and contributing 35% of total revenue.The productivity software segment delivered revenue of $30.8M, up 8% Y/Y and contributing 16% of total revenue. Although the 15-quarter streak of double-digit growth in this segment has been breached, the company is confident the numbers will return to double digits next quarter as several large orders simply fell just out of the second quarter. The weakness seems to be just temporary.From a geographic prospective, the company's strategic growth in EMEA through acquisitions continued to yield excellent growth rates, with 34% growth Y/Y. North America saw a good momentum while Latin America had mixed results. China saw strong results in VUTEk and Fiery segments offset by weakness in Cretaprint sales, which are probably related to customers in China slowing down investments as they were concerned about a slowdown in construction spending. The smallest Asia Pacific region was down almost 20% Y/Y to $24.5M. As expected, the Asia Pacific experienced some delays in industrial inkjet sales due to customers waiting for new product rollouts at the early July display graphic trade show that fell just out of the quarter. The company confirmed that it saw rebounding sales after this trade show.Future financial guidanceGrowth is expected to accelerate in the second half of 2014, with EFI estimating Q3 Y/Y revenue growth between 8% and 10%, with EPS up 10% to 15% Y/Y to the range of $0.43 to $0.45 per share.The growth outlook not only remains strong but even accelerates, providing for the near-term stock price upside.Valuation is rich, offering just ~6% near-term upside, but great long-term ~15% annual returnsWhen I first analyzed EFI a year ago, it was ~50% cheaper, so the stock is fully priced at the moment and priced almost for perfection. However, despite a low ~6% near-term upside until the end of 2014, the stock has a further ~15% upside each year in the next decade on average, based on continued strong economic moat and robust digital printing industry trends that are not likely to wane any time soon. Using a DCF valuation method assuming 13% EPS growth and 10% discount rate, the fair value of EFI is ~$48, offering a ~6% upside from the current price of $45 per share.Source: author calculationsUsing financial metrics valuation, the stock currently trades at a lofty ~16x EV/EBITDA and ~20xP/E and 22x forward P/E. The P/FCF is even higher, roughly 30x.Stock buybacks continueIn the second quarter, the company continued returning cash to shareholders through buybacks, with $10.5M of purchases (representing ~0.5% of the total market cap for the quarter) as part of a total $200M stock repurchase program (10% of the current market cap).Patent litigation wins confirm the company's innovation dominanceEFI recently won two successful patent litigation cases, rendering the patent claims invalid of one last year filed by KERAjet and one this year filed by Acacia Research (NASDAQ:ACTG).RisksThe major risk to the long thesis is the high 13% EPS growth rate priced in already. If the organic growth slows down, especially in the U.S. or Europe - the company's strongest revenue generating regions - the growth rates would have to be achieved more through acquisitions. While not a tragedy, this would increase risk as acquisitions are harder to perform and bear more uncertain outcomes than pure organic growth. Also, EFI is a small-cap stock in a cyclical industry. If the overall economy slows down considerably or enters into a recession, investors are likely to send the EFI's stock price lower, even if the company continues to perform well.ConclusionElectronics for Imaging in one of my strongest-conviction, long-term picks. The stock is priced almost for perfection, with the current valuation pricing in a lofty 13% annual EPS growth for the next decade. This rate is achievable, nonetheless, with the slight help of acquisitions. Valuation is rich. But thanks to successful new product launches, the organic growth rate is likely to accelerate in 2014, offering a near-term ~6% stock upside by the end of 2014. The stock is a great long-term investment with ~15% annual stock appreciation potential for many years going forward.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

59720,20307,2008-01-10T11:23:23-05:00,,"Electronics For Imaging (NASDAQ:EFII) shares are getting clobbered Thursday morning after the company late yesterday issued disappointing earnings guidance.For the fourth quarter, the company expects non-GAAP profits of 22-24 cents a share, sharply below the Street consensus of 37 cents. EFII sees GAAP profits for the quarter of 10-12 cents. The company said there has been “weak demand” for its high margin Fiery printer controller products, resulting in pressure on gross margins. The company also had higher than expected operating expenses in the quarter.“We are very disappointed with the results of our Fiery segment, which were weak across all our OEM partners,” CEO Guy Gecht said in a statement. “We are implementing significant steps to align our spending with this lower revenue and will take a restructuring charge in Q1 to reflect our reduced cost structure. While it will take some time, we are committed to taking the necessary steps to regain our traditional levels of profitability and growth.”For Q1, the company sees revenue of $133 million to $137 million. The Street had been expecting $155.3 million.  Ben Reitzes, an analyst with UBS, pointed out in a research note this morning that the company gave no details on its restructuring plans. He thinks radical action is required. “We believe it is time EFII got serious about creating shareholder value given a decade of inconsistent results in controllers,” he wrote. “We have been disappointed with the lack of urgency and believe EFII’s options include raising the stock buyback authorization, breaking up the company, or selling itself.”EFII shares Thursday are down $5.16, or 27%, at $14.01."
1536152,46261,2013-07-05T17:03:58-04:00,,"When picking a company to invest in, one of the key rules cited by many value and long-term investing legends, such as Seth Klarman and Warren Buffett, is ""know what you are buying."" Know the company's business, its products, business model and the industry they are operating in. There is nothing closer to this than having direct experience from working in the industry or outright working for the company itself. Investors are not always so lucky to have access to this information.Fortunately, from the B2B part of my marketing career when I used to work in the Display and Graphics Division of the 3M company (NYSE:MMM), which produces virtually every imaginable product including a full range of printable vinyl films, wraps and foils for the commercial digital printing industry, I know some of the flagship VUTEk printer products of Electronics for Imaging, Inc. (NASDAQ:EFII), the company I am about to review and recommend today.From firsthand, real-life experience gained by visiting and talking to many of EFI's customers, such as graphics studios, print shops, sign shops and car-wrapping companies, after actually seeing the entire printing process and its outcome, I can really say that EFI's VUTEk printers, controllers, inks and printing productivity software are industry-leading and often setting the standards.Probably the only area where a company might beat EFI is in printer inks, where HP has recently launched some superb products that have comparable quality but better economics thanks to having much longer real-life durability than the figure officially guaranteed by the company, if the printing process is managed well using high-quality print management software.Below are some of the examples of 3D optical illusion art printed on vinyl films, just to spark your imagination and to show some real-life examples of the products EFI helps to print:Photo courtesy of MoillusionsAbout Electronics for ImagingAs the world leader in digital imaging and print management solutions for commercial and enterprise printing, EFI is well positioned to meet the growing demand for high-quality digital color printing through its three product categories: server and embedded printer controllers, industrial inkjet printer systems and professional printing productivity software solutions.Photo courtesy of Wallpapers5My personal experience with EFI's VUTEk printersFrom the personal experience of visiting many print shops and graphic studios, actually seeing the entire printing process and comparing the printed outcomes of many different printers, I can honestly say that the VUTEk line of printers are top-notch quality as well as leading in technology and the overall important parameters described above.Specifics of the digital printing industryAmong the paramount requirements in the printing business are the economics and productivity of the entire process and the quality of the final printed outcome required by the end-user clients. Time is money, and double so in this industry, because the commercial printers are very costly and constitute a high one-time CAPEX expenditure, especially for smaller companies - and companies in this industry are very fragmented, with literally thousands of them. The printing process also represents a large portion of these companies' operating costs, so the cost economics of the entire process is extremely important, having real power to make a difference between a profitable company and a cash-bleeding one.Qualities such as maximum printing speed while maintaining the required quality, good compatibility with the brands and types of materials used for printing, the setup and variability of the machine's printing parameters in order to optimize the printing profiles, drying time, overall ease of use, efficient management of printed space by automatic software and minimizing downtime through 24/7 use of the machine are all paramount.What is important to realize is that the printing machines are such a large one-time investment, and the entire printing process needs to be so highly optimized for full performance, that once the company purchases the EFI printer and optimizes the printing processes, it becomes a very long-term and loyal customer. It cannot change the printer every year. It usually buys branded EFI VUTEk inks to maximize the performance of the expensive printer, and doesn't want to risk damaging the machine by saving a few dollars on a cheap no-name ink.End customersEFI products are sold to and installed in leading corporations, advertising agencies, graphic design studios and print-for-pay and commercial print businesses around the world. Some of EFI's end-user customers include Bank of America, Chevron, Cisco Systems, Coca-Cola, IBM, Microsoft, Nike, Pixar, Procter & Gamble and many others.CompetitorsThe commercial and industrial graphics printing markets are very competitive for players in all parts of the business supply chain toward the final customer. EFI's competitors in its core printing controller markets include Kodak (Print On Demand Solutions Group) and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) such as Canon and Xerox. The professional printing market is fragmented, with many smaller companies competing with EFI's solutions. In the superwide format digital printing market, EFI's competitors include HP and NUR Macroprinters. In the wide format market, EFI competes with HP and Mimaki, and in the packaging market, EFI competes with HP.StrategyThe company's strategy involves targeting high growth segments where digital print technology brings significant value, and enabling its customers to increase their productivity and efficiency, combined with a superb sales team and operating efficiency. This strategy proves its effectiveness by delivering the 13th consecutive quarter of revenue and EPS growth in Q1 2013.Unlike in the past, the majority of EFI's business today is driven directly by the company's strong direct sales force, as opposed to sales via OEM partners. And the company wants to continue to maintain and keep developing its strong sales force, which is one of the best in the industry. This is a very smart strategy because in this business-to-business industry, long-term sales relationships with the customers are paramount. If the company manages to continue to innovate and offer its sales force new and more products, the company can keep growing its organic sales going forward.Sources of future growthThe company is the leader in terms of market share, in-house sales force and innovation in its field, and it plans to continue to maintain this lead by keeping investing 20% of its revenues toward research and development of the next generation of products, software and services to keep growing organically.Moreover, by leveraging its current cash position, EFI can repurchase stock and implement its acquisition strategy to enhance its traditional imaging technology and expand into both adjacent and new markets. The company currently has an excellent balance sheet with zero debt. Therefore, it has ample room for accelerating growth by acquisition-led expansion should the market conditions be advantageous and should the company decide to use some financial leverage.The company doesn't pay a dividend, as it is still a growth stock. However, EFI uses stock buybacks to optimize its free cash flow when not used for acquisitions, as well as maximize shareholder value and stock price by increasing the ROE.a) Areas of strong organic growthEFI has developed a clearly defined strategy to cultivate growth opportunities in the controller, software and wide and superwide format digital printing and packaging markets. Growth in these markets is driven by various factors, including the growing adoption of color and the continued migration from analog to digital printing, in addition to the growing demand for high-impact applications, such as out-of-home advertising (e.g., billboards, building wraps, other unusual and eyeball-grabbing advertising formats and architectural designs as well as point-of-purchase advertising) and display graphics (e.g., banners, large signage, trade show graphics, and art exhibits). The packaging industry is driven by the growing influence of mass market retailers.Furthermore, as commercial printers and corporate reproduction departments of large businesses migrate from analog to digital printing technology, EFI is capitalizing on this need by providing its expertise in variable data printing, color management and workflow software, as well as helping companies run their businesses more cost-effectively and efficiently with its printing management software (ERP/Print MIS offerings).b) AcquisitionsEFI's acquisition strategy focuses on expanding and enhancing its focus on the commercial printing market. EFI will continue to investigate opportunities that align with its acquisition strategy and drive profitability and growth. EFI has acquired 21 companies (or assets) since 1997, including four companies in 2012. As recently as on June 3, 2013, the company announced it had acquired GamSys Software, a major provider of printing productivity and efficiency software for the French-speaking parts of Europe and Africa. As is usual, the financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but the acquisition is not expected to materially affect EFI's Q2 or FY 2013 results.c) International expansionThe company also aims to leverage its expertise and brand by expanding to even more international markets, although it already has a strong global presence. The most recent initiative in this area is the June 2013 takeover of GamSys Software mentioned above, which will provide expansion of the company's productivity printing software to the strong francophone markets of Europe and Africa.d) Capitalizing on other major industry trendsSome of the notable trends which will shape the industry and drive future growth include the ""green"" printing trend, where the company launched a new line of products with LED-curing (drying and ""baking in"" the freshly printed ink) instead of UV-curing, which is itself a relatively new and growing segment of digital printing, documenting the fast pace of innovation in this area.Another strong trend is the printing on non-traditional materials, such as ceramics, glass, wood and transparent and translucent films, instead of printing just on the traditional paper and vinyl. Again, the company has an excellent line of printers that enable companies to capitalize on this trend.The trend toward increasing efficiency and productivity is an ongoing, underlying movement that will not go away in the future. And EFI is ready again, constantly improving its printing software, controllers and printers to provide the best available return on investment for their customers.The main challengesAs has been mentioned, EFI operates in a very competitive business. Staying ahead of the crowd is not easy and definitely not cheap. EFI's 20% of revenues invested into R&D speaks to the effort that EFI needs to make to maintain its pole position. On the other hand, the company has a very strong balance sheet, as well as the P&L and cash flow statement to finance future R&D and growth.One specific threat in the core area of printer controllers is posed by some OEM manufacturers who choose to develop and sell their own controllers for some of their printers and copiers and to outsource the development of controllers and other imaging technology to EFI.Q1 2013 financial resultsThe most recent earnings call revealed that in Q1 2013, the company achieved growth in all three segments. Total revenue grew 7% year-over-year, and operating profit increased 24%. This solid growth is expected to continue.Q2 financial outlookFor Q2 2013, the company expects revenue of $174M to $176M, which at the midpoint would be an all-time record for EFI with EPS growth of 15% to 20%, yielding about $0.34 per share to $0.36 per share.ValuationThe company has strong ROA of 8.9%, a 12.9% profit margin and zero debt. The current 16.21x trailing P/E multiple and the forward P/E of 17.89% is reasonable, given the company's strong performance and excellent growth outlook, which analysts estimate at 13% per year for the next five years. I completely agree with the analysts on this one. Based on these growth rates and the current stock price of $29.01, the company is almost fully priced. My estimate of its fair value is $30.19, which is 3.5% above the current stock price of $29.01.ConclusionElectronics for Imaging is a leader in the commercial graphics printing business, and has excellent past performance, as well as strong future growth prospects, documented by many specific areas of growth. Coupled with zero debt, strong ROA and high profit margin, the company is a very strong buy candidate. The stock currently trades roughly 3.5% below its intrinsic value and part of the total position can be bought immediately, with further purchases on the dips.Disclosure: I am long MMM.

There's some interesting rationale here, especially in terms of what benefits shareholders versus option holders.In a 13d/A filing, Blum uses what I'd call ""firm but fair"" language to request that the company pay a one-time $2 dividend per share, as a way of returning some of the company's excess cash. They note that even after dispersing this $100 million to shareholders, the company will still have a huge cash balance. Even after using $15.5 million of cash from operations for the first six months of2009 during arguably the worst economic environment the company has ever faced, EFII still has approximately $279 million of cash and short-term investments and no debt. We believe the company will begin to generate cash from operations in the very near term as the economy stabilizes, and thus returning $100 million to shareholders via a special dividend would still leave the company with an ample balance of $179 million that would continue to grow in the future. I often feel there is little value to be added by recapitalizations, share buybacks, special dividends, etc. -->> at least not nearly as much value as is added by competent management that allocates capital wisely on high ROI investments. Blum Capital may feel that they can re-allocate the $2 per share currently tied up with EFII to an investment with more upside.A before and after look at a potential one-time dividend:Why might management prefer to continue with stock buybacks rather than special dividends? Because, as Blum Capital points, out, dividends only help shareholders. They do not help holders of stock OPTIONS, including the roughly 5.5 million stock options owned by employees and officers of EFII:Disclosure: no position"

3354955,46261,2015-07-25T11:22:07-04:00,"The strengthening dollar masks robust underlying growth, and Asia still offers vast future growth potential from a relatively low sales volume basis.
        29% of sales are now recurring, and the number will continue to grow.
        EFII’s acquisition of Reggiani will boost revenue growth and open a vast new total addressable market in textile printing.
        Thanks to plenty of free cash still available from the recent cheap financing, EFII will probably engage in further acquisitions in several quarters, after integrating recently acquired companies.
        Growth prospects remain robust, and I am raising my target price to $51 per share, providing a ~11% stock price upside within a year.","Since my last analysis of Electronics for Imaging (NASDAQ:EFII), several catalysts played out very much as I expected, including increased acquisition activity due to an abundance of cash from the new convertible note, as well as the concerns about the China construction market remaining weak (though stabilizing), the U.S. dollar currency headwinds, and a solid stock price upside. Virtually all these factors played out as expected, and as a result of the acquisitions and recent quarterly results, the stock logged a very nice ~25% gain in about six months. The stock is currently testing its all-time highs from April and July 2014.However, due to a lack of near-term catalysts, the stock is likely to hover below $50 for several months, especially given the seasonal market weakness ahead in September and October. So taking some trading profits after the post-earnings spike is prudent. However, long-term investors should not think about selling at all, and EFII is still a high-conviction long-term buy with a ~11% upside within a year, and further upside in the future years.So where do we go from here?Based on the latest quarterly results, the outlook, and the two recent acquisitions, I am able to raise my $48 target price to $51 and believe EFII's stock will continue to outperform. Why? Despite the seeming lack of near-term catalysts, the company's strategy is strongly centered on a mission to achieve $1B annual sales by the end of 2016. This is more politics (trying to accomplish a strategic plan that has been laid out) than underlying economics. The underlying organic growth would not have been able to achieve the $1B target on time. If the recent two acquisitions fail to deliver a sales trajectory towards the $1B mark in 2016, I believe further acquisitions will be needed, and will be made.And EFII still has plenty of free cash and short-term investments, of which roughly $350M can be immediately deployed in a potential acquisition. Therefore, I believe after several quarters of digestion, EFII will once again embark on a mission to acquire more growth to meet or exceed its $1B sales target on time, and then continue expanding well beyond the $1B target. As the management puts it, ""We are clearly not done with M&A, but obviously, our immediate focus is on integrating those two deals.""But the corporate politics may not be the only reason why EFII will need to delve into further acquisitions soon. Thanks to the continuing China and currency headwinds (which may get worse before they improve, judging by the current situation in the strength of the dollar and weakness coming from China), EFII may be forced into acquisitions in order to maintain the overall Y/Y sales growth (with currency effects included). Therefore, I believe that as soon as the company senses its sales are at risk of falling Y/Y, it will push the ""acquire sales"" button. Lastly, the company smartly focuses on expanding its presence into adjacent growth areas, such as the textiles segment, and there are still solid areas for expansion available, so further acquisitions are likely.Ultra cheap source of acquisition financingThe convertible notes carry an ultra-low 0.75% annual interest cost, and the costs to partly hedge the conversion are very low as well thanks to the low options volatility in the markets. So overall, the effective cost of borrowed capital is extremely low even for the current low-rate environment. In fact, at the moment, the management puts the total pre-tax cost of debt at 2.58% and after tax cost at 1.5%. This is very attractive. Moreover, unlike other low-interest deals, which are usually centered around floating rates like LIBOR and carry a huge risk if short-term interest rates spike, EFII's interest cost is fixed and will remain stable until 2019. The costs of hedging the conversion risk could even fall if the economic climate deteriorates and pushes EFII's stock lower.A contrarian hedge against a potential dollar weakening and Chinese construction market reboundEFII is also a solid bet on a stabilization of the situation in the Chinese construction market and a hedge against a weakening of the U.S. dollar after the recent surge. If the U.S. dollar stops appreciating, or even better for EFII, starts weakening again, EFII's sales growth rates will be even higher and margins will improve.Sales continue to grow despite strong currency headwindsIf we look at the latest quarterly numbers released on July 20, revenue rose only 5% Y/Y for the quarter and 4% Y/Y for the six months ending on June 30, 2015. But excluding the forex effects, sales were up a robust 10% Y/Y for the latest quarter. The two recent acquisitions are not included in the numbers. Non-GAAP net income was up 9% Y/Y, but GAAP income fell 23% Y/Y. The operating profit margin expanded to a robust 14.4%, up 90 basis points Y/Y on 12% Y/Y operating income growth. Cash flow from operating activities reached $25M for the quarter and $81M for the year. That's a ~10% FCF operating margin.In terms of segments, the productivity software business returned to double-digit growth, up 10% Y/Y, and the Fiery OEM controller business also delivered another strong quarter, growing 7% Y/Y. The industrial inkjet business grew 2% Y/Y, so the OEM business still continues to outpace the company-branded printer sales by a wide margin (branded printer sales are better for brand building and the support of the company's integrated ecosystem of cross-selled products and solutions). UV ink volume was up 19% Y/Y for the quarter, driving recurring sales and strengthening the long-term customer relationships and brand loyalty.The company also starts to log meaningful revenue from the very smart, strategic idea of complex project deals that increase the overall margin but require some revenues to be deferred until the project is completed. These revenues will start to positively affect quarterly sales from now on, although they may introduce a certain level of volatility as project completion dates are sometimes unpredictable and some share of the revenue may be shifted between quarters.The strong dollar effect continues to be, well, a strong headwindTo illustrate how strong the appreciating dollar effects were, at the constant currency rate, the overall revenue would have grown 10% vs. 5% Y/Y, and productivity software would have grown 18% vs. 10%, to 17% of the total revenue. Industrial inkjet would have grown 9% vs. 2%. The strengthening U.S. dollar continues to mask very robust underlying growth.Recurring revenue growth continues to outpace the overall growth rateWhere other companies continue to talk about the cloud-based SaaS services and recurring revenue, EFII doesn't use these hype words but actually delivers on the underlying concept of recurring revenue, integrated solution, and modern cloud-based smart applications. In a continued positive development for the company, the recurring revenue keeps growing strongly, 11% Y/Y and 15% Y/Y if currency headwinds are excluded. This robust growth resulted in 29% of all sales now being recurring.The company's integrated solutions strategy, which includes inks and productivity software, is clearly working very well. And I expect the share of recurring sales will continue to increase, giving more and more stability and predictability to EFII's sales. On the other hand, the ""door-opener"" sales of the branded printers will be paramount to the future generation of the recurring streams. These branded printers sales have lagged the OEM business, although they still grew 9% Y/Y, excluding the currency effects. The currency headwinds don't really matter in terms of recurring sales because the sales still generate the follow-up ink and other sales.Cretaprint ceramic business finally seems to be rebounding after six quarters of falling salesLed by rebounding sales in China and Asia, the ceramic printing segment witnessed a second consecutive Q/Q growth. If forex headwinds are excluded, Cretaprint sales also grew Y/Y for the first time in six quarters. This shows that the situation in the Chinese construction market may at least be stabilizing. What is even more positive is that the ceramic inks continued to grow in the early stages of its rollout, supporting the long-term recurring revenue and customer loyalty.Asia is the clear growth leader while EMEA lagsIn terms of regions, the Americas revenue grew 7% Y/Y while the EMEA region sales fell 3%. However, ignoring the currency impact, sales would have actually grown 8% Y/Y, so the currency impact was a massive 11 percentage point drag (mainly the weaker Euro impact). The APAC is the true growth driver, with a 20% Y/Y growth, or 25% excluding the currency headwinds. Although EFII still generates a relatively low share of revenues from APAC, this is clearly a robust future growth driver in terms of percentages as well as total volume once this segment grows in size. The China market revenue also grew for the first time in several quarters, showing signs of stabilization there.Evaluating recent acquisitionsOn July 1, 2015, EFII announced 2 strategic inkjet acquisitions, Reggiani and Matan. These two acquisitions strengthen EFII's product offerings and capabilities, but most importantly represent EFIIs strategic expansion of the total addressable market as the company enters the large digital textile market, which is the largest and fastest-growing adjacent market. To put the market opportunity into perspective, this new market is ~4x bigger in material printed than the ceramics market, and Reggiani is the market leader in this segment. The expansion also brings synergies in terms of the overall market trends towards ecological products (Reggiani is established in water-based printing solutions, for instance).Source: EFII's presentationEFII paid $53.3M in cash for the Italian company Reggiani Macchine, $30.8M in its stock, and there will be further $56.2M in earnouts over the next 2 to 3 years provided that performance targets are met. This deal looks well structured to me, with almost half of the immediate costs being in a fully valued EFII stock, and almost half of the cash paid in future earnouts, subject to future performance. Moreover, the entire deal is structured in the cheap Euros. The deal should be slightly accretive to 2015 non-GAAP EPS.The smaller second acquisition involves a company called Matan. This deal ""solidifies EFIIs offering"" in one of the company's core segments of display graphics. The simple translation of this phrase is that this acquisition is a defensive move to prevent competition because Matan was the only other company to have developed a production of a high-speed LED-based curing system and the company also had 5-meter printers in its portfolio, so this will prevent competition from harming EFIIs sales and margins and will solidify its technologic superiority and innovation leadership position. The additional sales don't hurt either. Margins in this segment should benefit in the long run; however, Matan was focused on a cost-sensitive portion of the market, so there will be some addressable market expansion, and EFII will have a lower-cost solution to offer where necessary. However, I don't expect such great synergies as from the Reggiani acquisition, which opens up a vast new segment to EFII.Source: EFII's presentation, author's market informationEFII paid $29M cash and $14M in escrow and assumed $5M in Matan debt.EFII still has plenty of free cash to use for acquisitions or buybacksSo to sum up the acquisitions financially, EFII paid ~$100M in cash and assumed debt and will have to pay ~$50M in future earnouts. Even if we ignore future positive FCF and reserve ~$100M cash (more than 10% of sales, based on historical minimum cash % level) for day-to-day operating needs and increased working capital, this still leaves EFII with a ~$350M cash warchest that bears ultra-low interest and can be immediately used for further acquisitions, other investments, or stock buybacks to accelerate future EPS growth. Provided that EFII can acquire sales around 1.5x sales, which seemed to be the case in the recent two acquisitions, the cash could provide a one-time boost of more than 20% to sales and profits.Outlook remains very strong, boosted by acquisitions. Currency headwinds could be weakerFor Q3, EFII expects a total revenue of $225M to $232M. This represents revenue growth of 14% to 17% Y/Y, including the acquisitions, and 6% to 7% organic growth, excluding the acquisitions. These numbers imply a roughly 4% negative currency impact Y/Y. Excluding the currency impact, the total Y/Y sales growth is expected to reach a robust 18% to 21%. In terms of segments, I expect robust growth in industrial inkjet to deliver a ~25% to 30% Y/Y growth, boosted by the acquisitions. Fiery should deliver mid-single digit growth, and productivity software businesses growth should be below 10% but close to it, including the currency impact.Regarding the acquisition effects, both acquisitions are expected to have a neutral gross margin impact in Q3 and be slightly accretive for the full year of 2015. Some revenue from the acquisitions will need to be deferred due to the nature of the contracts, so we can expect some residual boost to sales from these acquisitions in several upcoming quarters. Therefore, I estimate that the full acquisition-driven annual sales will be roughly $100M to $150M, adding well over 10% to EFII's pre-acquisition sales volume.However, it is clear that the acquired businesses are relatively low-margin businesses (similar to EFII's own core printer sales), and the main immediate financial benefit is the one-time boost to sales and some continued sales growth. However, the true long-term benefit driving the positive ROI is the opportunity to integrate the acquired products to EFII's complete solution, which will deliver increased future revenues and profits from cross-selling and recurring revenue, primarily from high-margin software and inks.Gross margins are likely to take a hit and sit in the low 50% range as the integration of Reggiani and Matan begins. Margin will probably also be hit by a product mix as low-margin industrial inkjet sales growth is likely to vastly outpace growth in other segments, thanks in part to the acquisitions. Gross margins from the acquired businesses should improve over time as the company realizes synergies from the integrated offers.Checking back on the stock-based compensationIn my last article on EFII, I complained about the high share-based compensation that eclipsed 5% of sales (in pre-tax expenses) in 2014, perhaps influenced by the CFO change. However, the pre-tax stock-based compensation expenses increased by roughly 15% Y/Y, so if they were related to the CFO change, then it was not about the outgoing CFO package. The current total pre-tax compensation expense run rate seems to be close to $40M for the full year of 2015. This is again roughly 5% of sales and a large portion of net income and free cash flow. To comment on this, the management does a great job for the company and its shareholders, but it is fully paid for their efforts, perhaps overpaid and ripe for an activist investor. However, I want to stress again that I think the management does a superb job, period. The total share count only decreased by ~0.5% Y/Y, so the bulk of the stock buybacks largely only covered the employee stock-based compensation, and there will be some minor ~1.5% dilution from the acquisition of Reggiani, but it could be covered by stock buybacks. The question is whether EFII will decide to do this. It has enough cash to do so.ValuationIn light of the recent acquisitions and the resulting higher sales growth, I am glad I can update my valuation model with higher sales and higher near-term sales growth, which results in a 6% higher intrinsic value of ~$51 per share. The average expected FCF growth rate increased from 13% to ~13.5% for the next ten years, followed by flat FCF. This currently gives EFII a ~11% upside.Source: author calculationsOver the past five years, EFII has invested on average ~$5M less per quarter than the depreciation was. The company supplements this deficit with irregular acquisitions. Therefore, I am using depreciation and amortization instead of capex for the calculation of FCF, as this gives us a more smooth, normalized FCF number. The cumulative deficit of capex over depreciation for the past five years is ~$100M, and incidentally, this is almost precisely the sum that EFII is currently paying to acquire additional assets in the two most recent acquisitions. So, in the very long run, the company's depreciation roughly equals its capex.Using several common financial metrics for comparison, EFII is fully priced as it trades at a ~19x forward P/E, 2.7x P/S and ~16.2x EV/EBITDA. While this is certainly not cheap, the long-term growth that should continue is the reason for the valuation.CompetitionIn terms of competitors, EFII just got rid of one in the LED curing printers by purchasing Matan. By expanding to the textiles printing segment through the Reggiani purchase, EFII is entering a new competitive arena, although Reggiani was the market leader.The competition also remains in EFII's existing segments, especially in low-cost Asia. HP, NUR Macroprinters, and Mimaki remain tough competitors, among others. Lexmark, strengthened by EFIIs former CFO, remains in play as well. Lexmark's stock price seems to like the new CFO addition from a competitor. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), such as Canon and Xerox, remain as indirect competitors, as well.RisksCompared to my previous EFII report, potential acquisition integration or acquisition performance risk emerges, if the new business areas don't perform well. With the acquisition of Reggiani, EFII is entering a brand new adjacent segment of textile printing, so there will surely be some extra costs and uncertainty as the company adjusts and finds the best approach to expand this vast market opportunity.ConclusionElectronics for imaging continues to be the market leader in digital printing, and its strong moat has recently been cemented with two strategic acquisitions, which expand the addressable market, solidify the technological innovation leadership, and protect the company in the lower-cost tier of the market. EFII remains my high-conviction long-term investment opportunity that should continue delivering above-average returns as the robust growth is likely to continue. China sales are still tiny compared to the true long-term potential, and the growth rates in Asia should help deliver stellar overall top line growth. Everything comes at a price, and EFII is almost fully valued but still offers a ~11% upside within a year, given my updated target price of $51 per share. And there is further upside down the road in the long run.The recent two acquisitions provide not only new opportunities but also bear new risks that the acquisition integration will not work well to deliver synergies, cross-selling, and recurring sales boost.Tactically, EFII stock may remain range-bound for several weeks or months, given its post-earnings spike and taking into consideration the seasonally weak stock market of September and October. However, long-term investors should keep adding to positions."

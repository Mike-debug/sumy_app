The company has revenue of $70 million and a market cap of approximately $180 million.(Source: eGain)eGain has nearly completed its transition to a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company with 87% of revenue from SaaS and professional services. But the conversion is cannibalizing its legacy business, resulting in low annual revenue growth of just 7%.eGain does have some positive developments going on, including a very successful partnership with Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) and a promising OEM partnership with Avaya Holdings Corp. (OTC:AVYA) as well as a potential partnership with Amazon.com (AMZN). The agreement with Avaya is not expected to show much top-line revenue this year but good things are expected next year. The Amazon relationship is still in the formative stage with no product announcements at present.While eGain appears to be a solid company, it doesn't have the revenue growth that I look for. I expect that the company's free cash flow margin, a solid 15%, will be impacted by planned ramping of S&M this year and possibly by an imminent recession. This company also has a small number of customers and could be impacted by loss or downsizing of customers. For these reasons, I am giving eGain a neutral rating.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/Private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, eGain is sitting well below the best-fit trend line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is significantly lower than its peers given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that eGain is undervalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the software company ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation, a concept that I recently developed that compares forward sales multiple versus estimated sales growth.eGain's annual sales growth rate is an anemic 7% but better than the 3-year and 5-year average growth which are both negative.(Source: Portfolio123)There are two issues to note when considering the growth rate. First, eGain is transforming into a SaaS-only company. The action of converting to recurring revenue results in deferred revenue, causing revenue to be depressed in the short term, making the growth rate appear lower than it actually is.Second, the year-to-date SaaS revenue growth is 16% to 18% YoY. But this growth is occurring at the expense of the legacy business, making it difficult to identify the organic growth.eGain's free cash flow margin TTM is 15%. The free cash flow has been positive since the beginning of 2017.(Source: Portfolio123)One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40 - some analysts use EBITDA and others use free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin TTM.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the software company has growth and cash flow in balance and is considered financially healthy. In eGain's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 7% + 15% = 22%The calculation comes out substantially lower than 40%, indicating that eGain has a lot of work to do to achieve a healthy balance between growth and profits. Even if I use the SaaS-only revenue growth of 16% to 18%, eGain still comes up short on the Rule of 40.I monitor a company's cash burn by examining the SG&A expense relative to sales.Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)eGain is spending 60% of its total revenue on SG&A expenses (and R&D). While this level of cash burn is reasonable for a high-growth company, I don't really put eGain in the high-growth category. I expect that SG&A expenses could rise substantially as the company ramps S&M spending as stated in the most recent earnings call:eGain is a small company that provides a customer engagement platform. Revenue growth has been anemic, but this could change when S&M is ramped up this year. eGain has some promising partnerships that could boost revenue, but I don't expect too much from the Avaya and Amazon partnerships this year. This company fails the Rule of 40 due to the low revenue growth. I would like to see a more aggressive approach to sales, higher S&M spend, and demonstrated boost to revenue growth before giving eGain anything more than a neutral rating."
4205523,21815,2018-09-11T10:07:06-04:00,"The shares crashed violently after a mild revenue disappointment.While we think the shares had grown ahead of themselves a little, we also think the crash is exaggerated, so we see a good entry point emerging.While revenue growth disappointed a bit, the company is now very reasonably valued, has a strong balance sheet, and generates positive cash flow.","Not so long ago we discussed an epic rally in eGain Corporation (EGAN), the shares of which had more than 10 folded in a year or so. But we also argued that the stock was now fully valued. Indeed...There has been a much more swift and almost equally epic decline after the Q4 results came in, which tempered the optimism. Basically what happened is that the SaaS and recurring revenue theme is what got investors fired up.However, much of the increases in SaaS revenue, which grew 37% both in Q4 as well in fiscal 2018 as a whole, originates from converting original license customers into SaaS customers.And since there are not all that many original license customers left, it turns out that the business doesn't grow quite as fast as perhaps many investors hoped or expected it would.EGAN Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsHowever, there is clearly still a lot of improvement, and the Q4 results were still pretty good, we would argue:What is notable is the large amount of non-GAAP deferred revenue ($51.4M) which is basically contracts that have been signed but not billed yet. This was due to a number of substantial signings late in the quarter.There is still $4M of recurring on-premise revenues that management wants to convert to SaaS, but this doesn't alter the bottom line all that much as these were still recurring revenues. They do affect stuff like professional services a bit, we guess.Speaking about professional services, management argued the decline brings it more in line with ""the industry standard for SaaS businesses,"" but didn't elaborate on the reasons for the decline.Given the negative gross margin (-7%) in the quarter, it's a bit of a drag on results; although, for the year as a whole, gross margins were still positive and even increased 100 basis points from the previous year (to 11%).The company does have a number of growth initiatives:With respect to the investments, they're targeting three areas in particular:Guidance for positive cash flow gives management considerable freedom with how much to increase investments. What they argued during the Q4CC was that the investments will be front loaded so cash can recover in H2.There is something of a 'land and expand' strategy operative with new apps like Virtual Assistant 3.0, messaging hub, and AI applications, but we do not know the dollar retention rate to be able to quantify this. Management did argue that they (Q4CC):Their partner program (with companies like Cisco (CSCO) and Avaya) to which they have 'outsourced' much of their landing of new labels has delivered quite a few of these in Q4, like a diversified financial organization, a mutual financial institution with over 15M members.There is also room for third-party applications to hook into the platform through APIs, especially with the AI and digital capabilities. The platform also integrates with Apple Business Chat and Amazon Connect.EGAN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsGross margin actually declined a point to 63% due to the decline in professional services as well as high margin legacy revenues. Recurring revenue margins are 74% and unchanged y/y.What struck perhaps in Q4 was the negative margins in professional services caused by the decline in the revenue of the services. They also argued that the professional services were brought more in line with SaaS businesses, suggesting they're not unhappy with the decline.Adding $800K to payroll due to annual compensation adjustments and the hosting of the European Digital Day as well as audit expenses are responsible for a mild upward tick in operating cost from $9M to $9.8M in Q4 (y/y). Adjusted operating margin is down nearly two points and just above zero.EGAN Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsWe couldn't detect Q4 cash flow figures (apart from the Q4CC arguing they were 22% higher than last year) as the 10-Q hasn't been filed yet, but they look to be in the same ballpark as those of Q3. The positive cash flow is pretty encouraging.Stock-based compensation isn't large and the company doesn't have a history of dilution:EGAN Stock-Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsTotal debt was $9.2M at the end of Q4, down 41% from $15.8M a year ago, cash was $11.5M. Net cash improved $7.4M during the year, so that's a healthy development.Here is the 2019 guidance provided by management for fiscal 2019 (Q4CC):EGAN EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsWith the share price crash, the company's valuation has become much friendlier. The company produced a non-GAAP EPS of $0.06, which analyst expect to rise to $0.09 in fiscal 2019 (which started in July).Converting itself into a SaaS business has clearly been beneficial from a financial point of view. However, now that the conversion is nearly done, it becomes clear that the company isn't actually growing as fast as investors had priced in.Recurring revenues, which are now mostly SaaS, grew 15.5% in fiscal 2018 and are guided to continue this growth path, perhaps even a little less. SaaS revenues are growing considerably faster, but this is due to the conversion when that's done, all recurring revenues are SaaS.We, therefore, think that recurring revenue growth is the most reliable metric as old legacy licenses are not significant anymore and we can't imagine another lurch downward in professional service income (and even if that would occur, it would be a one-off).This could be conservative as bookings growth is higher, and deferred revenue growth higher still, so perhaps the company manages to exceed guidance as they did (substantially) last fiscal year.Given the substantial cash generation, very sound balance sheet, and now really quite reasonable valuation, we think the share crash is a little exaggerated, although we don't this go back to the previous heights in due course."
4239777,21815,2019-02-11T01:43:58-05:00,"This is a stock that is used to big and sudden jumps on earnings, but underlining growth is healthy.It's masked by a shift in business model towards a cloud based SaaS platform, its declining legacy business reduced headline growth.But business development is sound and the optical effect of the change in business model will wear off and the benefits will remain.","After a truly epic rally half a year ago, we wrote that the shares of eGain (EGAN) were fully valued, and then they crashed. A few months later, we argued the crash was overdone, and now the shares are coming back, even if we had to wait for that quite some time.eGain offers a cloud based customer engagement solution that stitches together all customers' touch points in a single solution and adds AI smarts and analytics to gain insights.It started off as an on-premise solution, but the stock started to seriously take-off when the company moved towards a cloud based SaaS model. That's not surprising for anyone who is a regular reader of our articles here. We're great fans of these Swiss army knife-type business models.We're hardly alone in that, witness the premium valuations companies based on these business models command in the markets, and eGain isn't an exception.Here is a longer-term view:Data by YChartsYou see a decline in revenues that has only started to reverse last year, but this is simply optical and the result of a shift in business model. The company used to sell on-premise license, but it has moved to cloud SaaS subscriptions.In fact, so tiny are the license revenues (less than 1% of revenues) that the company is now reporting two revenue categories: subscription (89% of revenues, up 25% y/y) and professional services (11% of revenues, down 32% y/y).The latter is due to the decline of its legacy business as legacy support is declining. Management expects this to continue during the year and professional services will constitute high single digits part of revenue in the second half of the year.The most important metrics however are SaaS revenue (growing at 53% y/y in Q2) and subscription revenue (+25% y/y). Management argues that their remaining on-premise customers will have moved to the cloud by the end of 2020.The cloud based SaaS models allows all the trappings of that business model which we have discussed in multiple articles here (see for instance here), like recurring revenues, adding features and partners and scaling.The company has important partners in Cisco (CSCO), Avaya (OTC:AVYA) and Amazon (AMZN) Connect with the first especially important (Q2CC):The Swiss army knife-like characteristics of SaaS platforms allow these to expand in many directions, adding new products and services, and the company's platform is no exception with new services like:With the VI and AI generating the most interest, their clients are overwhelmingly large - that is 90% or so is on the enterprise level with mid-market still under 10% of bookings but management also sees opportunities for growth in the latter segment.In terms of sectors, the company is especially strong in financial services and healthcare.Nicely summed up in the earnings PR:This was of course a significant beat. Revenues were higher than expected by $1.42M or nearly 9%, but it has to be pointed out that there was a $900K seasonality in there that isn't going to repeat in Q3.The bigger beat by far was that of non-GAAP EPS, which came in at $0.08 while a loss of $0.03 was expected.Data by YChartsThe shift in business model has done wonders for margins with gross margin rising to 69% (up from 65% a year ago). It's no mystery (Q2CC):Subscription revenue margins of 77% (up from 75% a year ago) are a multiple of gross margins on professional services (5%, compared to 19% a year ago).The improvement in operating margin (non-GAAP it was 14%, up from 5% a year ago) is even considerably more pronounced.Data by YChartsThere isn't much CapEx to speak off so operational and free cash flow are virtually identical and have improved with the change in business model.Cash flow from operations was $863K in Q2 and the company used this to pay off debt by roughly $1M. As a result, its net cash position is now $6.2M, up from $3.5M at the end of 2017.Data by YChartsValuation really spiked in the peak earlier this year which seemed a bit overdone to us, but we think the company is in a better place right now. Analysts are still not wildly optimistic about coming profitability, from SA:EPS is expected to be $0.06 this year falling to $0.04 in 2020, although we have a feeling these figures are not up to date.The variable to look for is SaaS revenue, which is projected to grow 30-35% this year. Overall revenue growth (15%) will be lower as the company's legacy support revenues are still declining because of the shift in the business model, but that effect will gradually wear off as legacy support becomes an ever smaller part of revenues.So the real growth rate is somewhat lower than the SaaS rate as this is boosted by the conversions from legacy, but these should be few already, so the company is really growing at 25%+.The stock is sensitive to exaggerated moves and Friday's nearly 50% jump is no exaggeration. While results were considerably stronger than expected, they were flattered by a one-off seasonal effect.Still, with the company producing nice growth, positive cash flow and earnings and debt reduction, we see some further upside ahead, although it's likely the stock has to digest the big jump a bit before moving higher."
3241916,48411,2015-06-08T05:23:11-04:00,"EGAN has a considerable, and growing larger, international presence which is something that I think a buyer would find a valuable asset.
        GAN has all the tools that other commoditized players have but it also has IP and it has two solutions I find particularly interesting.
        EGAN is the rare case of a company in an unattractive space that has differentiation and unique, IP protected products.
        Consider EGAN within a broader technology allocation.","I really like eGain Communications Corp. (NASDAQ:EGAN) to be acquired in the mid-term but even if I'm wrong about that EGAN is worth looking into. While EGAN participates in a niche of the broader SMB/enterprise solution space that I generally hate, EGAN leans into assisting with call center optimization, it's one of the few names that I actually think has differentiation. It also has a considerable, and growing larger, international presence which is something that I think a buyer would find a valuable asset considering the competitive environment domestically.I would think that a player like Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) or LivePerson (NASDAQ:LPSN) would be interested in adding EGAN's growth and overall scope - again scope encompassing its geographical and tech scope. We've already mentioned that EGAN does a considerable portion of its revenues internationally. I believe the smaller, non-Cisco/Avaya/Genysys/Oracle names have a much better chance at competing in these less developed (inclusive of Europe) call and contact center environments. In general, I've noticed a major recent shift in the SMB/enterprise solution space towards international and I think it's for this exact reason - lower hanging fruit via less competition.That said, as of the filing of its 10-K EGAN had field offices in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, India, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. A recent acquisition of Exony will only add to EGAN's international presence as Exony had operations in 34 countries including areas in North America, EMEA, and APAC. Exony also brings EGAN a UK HQ (if EGAN decides to keep the overhead and not close it).But that's not all a potential buyer would get from EGAN and that's not all EGAN has to offer as a stand-alone long position. EGAN has all the tools that other commoditized players have (read: LPSN and potentially FIVN, etc.) but it also has IP and it has two solutions I find particularly interesting.EGAN offers an algo that smartly mimics a live chat agent (eGain Virtual Assistant), often times to completion - which EGAN advertises on its website as ""cloning"" an agent; and it has a URL tracking system that allows ""phone and chat reps to show customers around the website, help locate information, and ""hand-hold"" them during complex, anxiety-ridden tasks such as completing forms or checking out shopping carts; it offers true collaborative browsing without any customer download requirement (SOURCE: EGAN 10-K - eGain Cobrowse).First, I find the fact that EGAN has actual IP to be a major differentiator and to give it something nearly impossible to find in the niche, defensiveness. Second, I think that it was able to develop a serviceable automated agent via its chat algo is indicative of the innovation capacity at the company and something that with greater R&D spend could be a marquee value-add not currently being priced into the current market cap. This greater R&D spend could be facilitated in the mid-term by EGAN or by a better funded buyer immediately. Oh, this is also a bigtime differentiator. Third, I think that the Cobrowse product is unique in the space (I haven't come across it in any 10-K or 10-Q filings I've read) and something that I can see immediately driving customer satisfaction. I would think that with Cobrowse and Virtual Assistant that EGAN would even be attractive to a name like Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN), which doesn't have a focus on call centers but this would seem a natural focus extension and it could acquire these technologies for more broad deployment.EGAN is the rare case of a company in an unattractive space, for the smaller solutions providers, that has differentiation and unique, IP protected products. With the valuations that the general SMB/enterprise space is getting and with money cheap but about to get more expensive (allegedly) I could see some bids coming EGAN's way. Even if that doesn't happen this is a name that should be able to play its impressive customer base (inclusive of Allstate, Costco, Discover, etc.) into a much larger market cap in time.I recommend readers take a serious look into EGAN and how it could fit into the technology sleeve of a broader portfolio.Good luck everybody."
3875216,56112,2016-02-09T12:51:11-05:00,"eGain's growth has slowed, and the competitive landscape is fierce.With other contact-center vendors posting much better results, I'm not sure if eGain's platform is as valuable as the company makes it out to be.Given the lack of growth and profitability, I don't think eGain is a buy here.","A few years ago, eGain (NASDAQ:EGAN) was growing rapidly, with the attendant valuation. Now it's not, and the stock has taken a dive. It seems to be underfollowed relative to peers, and there are aspects about eGain that I appreciate - for example, founder-CEO Ashutosh Roy remains a major shareholder and works for a nominal cash salary and fairly low stock based comp.That said, shareholders dine on results rather than intentions. Based on eGain's results in context of peers, I'm frankly not sure if the company has the horsepower to keep up in what appears to be a highly competitive landscape. With a competitor trading at a lower valuation despite a seemingly stronger foothold in the customer engagement landscape, I don't see a reason to buy eGain today.Competitive Landscape Not Evolving The Way They ThoughtAs best I can tell, the thesis of eGain 5 years ago (based on old transcripts from the earlier part of this decade) was that they had a lot of greenfield opportunity as multi-channel customer service became increasingly important. The company's position was that traditional contact-center software vendors like Avaya or Genesys were not providing robust multi-channel capabilities, as those vendors' primary focus was on PBX ""plumbing."" To wit, founder-CEO Ashutosh Roy put it this way back in Q2 2012:So the opportunity seemed clear; the question was market reach, as eGain was, at the time, a sub-$50MM revenue company with limited resources. The solution was supposed to be eGain's channel partnership with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), who would take eGain's software to Cisco Unified CCX customers. It sounded like a win-win.And to some degree, I suppose it was; to be fair to eGain, revenue did increase from that level. However, the market also clearly evolved. Indeed, eGain ended up acquiring one of those ""existing vendors"" in the contact center space that it was previously somewhat dismissive of, paying $16 million for U.K.-based Exony in 2014. The rationale? According to CEO Roy in September 2014:Did Their Technology Advantage Get Erased?While eGain was moving laterally from the web into the call center, call center vendors were doing just the opposite. While some of the legacy on-prem contact center software vendors are indeed still living in the dial-up era, Interactive Intelligence (NASDAQ:ININ) is no slouch and has built out what seems to be a robust set of capabilities spanning not only traditional voice-based interaction, but also multichannel capabilities that overlap with eGain's core offerings. At the same time, Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) and inContact (NASDAQ:SAAS) have seen strong growth and offer multichannel platforms as well.At the same time, eGain needed to do some of its own modernization. On the contact center side, Exony wasn't ""cloud-ready"" when they bought it, per Roy in September 2015:While everyone in the industry claims to be a leader, at least they can all agree that clients clearly want omni-channel capabilities rather than just voice or just web. It doesn't make sense to integrate two point solutions rather than just the one. Call centers are still very important, though - so having a fully-featured, modern contact-center solution in addition to the web-based tools is important. eGain has been a Gartner leader on the web side, but with the evolution of the industry, that may not matter as much as it used to. Oddly, the company doesn't seem to view these companies as competitors - but I definitely do. If I'm a customer and I purchase PureCloud Engage, then there's no reason for me to purchase eGain's offerings as well.I realize that this write-up has been entirely qualitative so far, so let's get to some numbers. First, from a pure resources perspective, eGain is going up against people who A) are flush with much larger cash balances, and B) have way more absolute revenue dollars to plow into R&D.Notice the growth rate as well. Competitors' growth has actually accelerated (or stayed the same) as eGain's has slowed. I don't want to make too much of a year or two, but as the refrain grows, in technology, if you're not growing, you're dying. (Note as well that eGain benefited from the acquired Exony revenues - i.e. their growth over the past couple of years is even worse than it looks!)Here's an interesting stat for your consideration: eGain's annualized cloud revenue at the end of this quarter was $22.8 million, up 4% y/y and 6% in constant currency. If you give them credit for one customer reduction, they would've been at $23.5 million, up 7% (and a little more constant currency). This is with, as I referenced above, incentives to get customers to transition from prem to cloud - not to mention a ""Try+Buy"" program where the company will set the product up for prospective customers and use it for a month for free.Here's the context: legacy on-prem vendor Interactive did $29 million of cloud-based revenues in the quarter alone, up 53% y/y. This was before they started seriously incentivizing their sales force to sell cloud over on-prem, and before they started making a huge push with their multi-tenant PureCloud Engage platform. Five9 and inContact have both been posting very strong growth as well:Simply put, with no fewer than three contact-center vendors all posting this kind of growth (in a flattish TAM), including one (Interactive) going through the hard-on-revenues transition from prem to cloud, it's really hard to believe that eGain's product suite is better than (or even comparable to) these vendors.Here's the other problem: eGain isn't significantly profitable. No, neither are the others but at least they're growing gangbusters. I'm not averse to software companies reinvesting all their cash flow into sales and marketing, yet on a per-employee basis, eGain doesn't appear to be doing a very good job on the sales/marketing efficiency front:This, I should note, is despite the highly-touted partnership with Cisco, which I would imagine would be helpful in reducing the burden on the company's direct sales team.ValuationI'll keep this section pretty short. Simply put, it's hard to value a software company too highly when it's neither A) growing fast or B) throwing off any cash. Indeed, on an EV/revenue basis, eGain is actually more expensive than either Interactive Intelligence or LivePerson (NASDAQ:LPSN), and really not that far below inContact.I've previously discussed why I think Interactive Intelligence is pretty interesting at or near the current valuation - and with the opportunity to buy that company, which seems to have a pretty strong foothold, at a better valuation, then what's the argument for buying eGain?I do think eGain could have value to an acquirer, but I wouldn't hold my breath for a high multiple. eGain acquired Exony for just over ~1x revenues, and given the lack of significant growth or margin traction since the acquisition, it's hard to argue that the company has really added value. That puts the valuation of ""legacy"" eGain at an even higher multiple - and I have a hard time seeing anyone paying >2x revenue in the current environment given that competitors seem to have developed pretty good omni-channel capabilities organically. Avaya is hardly looking to make acquisitions with its debt load, and it doesn't seem like Cisco would be a likely acquirer here.Wrapping It UpeGain seems to have been forgotten by the market, and if for no other reason than that, I'm following it (since I follow the subsector anyway). That said, at the current valuation, absent a material improvement in revenue trends, I have to assume that the company is more of an also-ran than a serious player in the contact center market. I admit to secretly rooting for the company, because I like founder-CEOs and Roy's compensation structure is very shareholder friendly - but objectively, that positive is outweighed by the seemingly significant competitive issues.Disclaimer: Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions.

As we enter the 2H FY2018/CY2018, we expect valuation levels to expand as SaaS revenue accelerates to represent a more meaningful portion of total reported revenue.GAAP Financials Significantly Understate Financial PerformanceeGain's recent GAAP financials have masked the success of the business model transformation on an on a YoY, apples-apples basis (and to a lesser extent, profitability). Growth has appeared depressed for three reasons: the unusual churn of a large customer, currency fluctuations, and the on-premise-cloud transition noted above. The customer churn occurred in the quarter ending 12/31/16 (FQ2), with the associated reduction in revenue in the quarter ending 3/31/17 (FQ3). This was a large customer ($5MM ACV) who had made the decision to migrate back to an on-premise solution. This unusual situation is unlikely to occur in the future (partly mitigated by a newly introduced Client Management Support team) as the vast majority of organizations are migrating to cloud solutions from license products. The impact of Brexit and related volatility in foreign exchange rates further depressed performance in FY2017 by over 8% (~50% of total revenues are reported to be generated in EMEA). As the euro/British pound strengthen relative to the USD, the skew between growth on a CC and GAAP basis is favorably impacting growth on a reported basis.Putting it Together - Financial Model at an Inflection PointWith the transition to SaaS complete, foreign exchange rates stabilizing and anniversary of the customer churn, EGAN will almost certainly return to growth on a YoY basis in the quarter ending 3-31-2018 (FQ3). Even assuming zero sequential growth compared to the 12-31-2017 quarter, growth YoY would be in excess of 50%.Other key points:Additional consideration - not a bad acquisition targeteGain's scale and below-market valuation do not make the Company a bad acquisition target for a strategic or financial buyer. An acquisition would require shareholder approval, and given high insider ownership by the CEO (~32%), both the price and buyer would have to fit with the CEO's vision of the business on an ongoing basis. We view it unlikely that Ash would commit to a sale by a financial buyer, but it is not unreasonable for the Company to explore a sale with a strategic partner who can accelerate growth.Large strategics would be able to extract significant synergies - sell eGain as an add-on to existing products, leverage a larger base of installed customers, enhance R&D and drastically reduce overhead costs (public company operating costs alone total $2-4 million for a Company of eGain's scale). Based on current share prices adjusted for control premiums, eGain would trade for <5.0x forward revenue in a take-out scenario. Assuming an opex reduction of ~55-60% (conservative figure based on conversations with tech corporate development leaders), the Company would trade for 10-11x forward EBITDA, a bargain for a 100% SaaS business with highly recurring revenues. In an uber-aggressive scenario where eGain is acquired based on its 10-year high, the Company would still trade at a relatively cheap multiple of ~16x forward EBITDA.Of all the technology buyers, it is notable to discuss Cisco. Starting in October 2017, eGain is being embedded in all Cisco Contact Center product sales (prior to 2017, sold as add-on, which resulted in 13% total revenue contribution). Given Cisco's push toward higher margin, recurring revenue solutions, we see it as the most likely buyer.Following the 2/8/2018 earnings call where eGain reported 14% sequential SaaS revenue growth and 24% YoY SaaS revenue growth (total recurring growth of 8% QoQ and 14% YoY) for the quarter ending 12/31/2017 (FQ2), forward revenue multiples increased substantially to 3.0x+. We expect multiples to continue to expand closer to publicly-traded software peers (small/micro-cap) who trade closer to 4.5x - 5.0x. We apply a 4.5x multiple to CY2018 revenues (bear, base and bull cases) which results in implied share prices of $10.01 - $11.50, an increase of 34-53% compared to the closing share price as of 2/16/2018.CatalystsMyth - it's not that good a productWe have seen some comments/reviews by users on investing forums that eGain's product is just not that ""good."" We believe there is nothing further from the truth.Myth - Incompetent Management TeamIt is not hard to see why many investors conclude that the management team has not proven its ability to grow the business in line with the broader market - eGain's total revenue increased at a CAGR of just 9% from CY2007-CY2017, while Salesforce grew at a rate of 30% in the same period. While it is true eGain was late to the game with regards to introducing a leading SaaS product, we give management team credit for weathering the model transition. eGain was able to successfully weather the transformation from a hybrid license-cloud provider to a 100% cloud business - all the while successfully executing a meaningful cost-reduction strategy and completely delevering the business. We agree the management team has not demonstrated flawless execution - but we don't believe it should be discredited as aggressively as the market has suggested.Risk - CRM? What about Salesforce?There is fierce competition in the CRM software industry, and it is no secret that Salesforce is the clear leader. Sales teams at organizations that utilize Salesforce log customer interactions - it is a robust records system where sales professional and business leaders can store and retrieve information. eGain differentiates itself in that it is a customer engagement solution - agents are able to directly connect with the customer. In December 2017, eGain announced integration capabilities with Salesforce, and while this does not suggest that Salesforce will not introduce similar capabilities, it reduces the competitive risk.Risk - Further Dilution Associated with $40 million shelf registration filed Jan 2018eGain filed a shelf registration for a potential $40 million issuance in additional equity, which would dilute existing equity holders. Given the improved financial model, we don't foresee the need to raise additional capital to operate the business status-quo (unless the Company is considering a transformative acquisition, which we also don't see as a likely scenario).Normalized a customer-churn is not a valid add-backWe agree, we are not using it to drive valuation, simply to point out that headline metrics have been masked by a largely non-recurring event. We are not directly adjusting the metrics driving our valuation based on the customer churnStock-based compensation is a real expenseWe get it, ownership is being diluted.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."

Shares are still flat over the last month. 4Q revenues were up slightly, 5% y/y. For fiscal 2015, the company did guide revenues to between $90 million and $95 million -- compared to current consensus of $82.5 million.The company also touched on its recent Exony acquisition, which combines voice and digital platforms. The stock is down 52% since we first covered the stock in October of last year, noting that competition would eat eGain's lunch. Shares are now right at our price target. As we noted,It now trades at incalculable P/E ratios on a trailing and forward basis. But on a P/S basis, it now trades at 2.3x, which is below the near 6x from last year. We're still not a fan of the stock, but note that based on valuation it's no longer a compelling short."
2584035,64043,2014-10-23T12:30:32-04:00,"Well positioned to re-accelerate growth. Highly attractive risk/reward profile with potential 100% upside and very limited downside at the current valuation of 1.1x 2015 EV/Sales.
        Company has a best in class product and could flourish in the hands of a strategic player with much greater resources and scale.
        Strong relationship with Cisco that is only getting stronger.","To be clear, I believe that eGain (NASDAQ:EGAN) has a great product that a large strategic would be able to extract significant value from. However, given what occurred in the past year, I believe that the current management team isn't able to successfully execute their plan to get EGAN back to the top of the omnichannel customer service industry. At the current valuation, the rest of the market and the sell-side doesn't seem to think so as well. I believe that a new management team can take the existing product and successfully reaccelerate sales and earnings. This stock could easily be worth $10 to an acquirer given the strong strategic assets and cost savings that could be realized.According to the last 10-Q, the company spent 46% of sales to grow bookings 9%. While this may seem very concerning to people who quickly look at the numbers, it's not as bleak as it seems. The company's bookings number is its best ever, and although it only grew 9% y/y, this is because last year had a very difficult comparison with large client signings. If we compare it to FY Q3 (ending March), EGAN grew bookings 100%, and was north of 80% when compared to any other quarter in FY 2014.Bookings were weak Q1 through Q3 because the company moved toward a hybrid selling model - not only selling through their direct sales force, but also through their newly implemented Cisco partnership. Combined with the lack of a head of sales, the sales force was mismanaged and misdirected. The sales team wasn't sure whether to sell cloud (with revenues recognized ratably over the life of the contract), focus on Cisco, or land large on-premise deals (which have longer sales cycles). As a result, they continued to spend on sales and marketing, but did not get anywhere near the return on sales they expected. As one can see, the product continues to sell, it's just that the management team hasn't been able to direct the company properly.The company clearly has proven it can't generate anywhere close to meaningful ROI on its own sales force. If I back into sales force productivity, I get to around 350k a year per rep in sales. This is incredibly low - other software reps typically break $500,000 -$1m a year. Instead of continuing to spend shareholders' money going it alone and investing in a direct sales force that can't compete on a standalone basis, the company should cut spending and position itself for a sale to a large enterprise player such as Cisco, SAP or IBM. Oracle acquired Rightnow, Microsoft acquired Parature, and Verint acquired Kana. Salesforce.com has acquired GoInstant in the past, and Oracle recently acquired LiveLOOK as well, so I see zero reason for EGAN to remain a standalone company. The obvious choice is Cisco, but I wouldn't rule out one of the other players as well.On a positive note, the company has incredibly easy comps the next three quarters and recently hired a new worldwide head of sales after a year of searching. This new head should give the sales force better direction with whom to sell to and which products to focus on. In addition, EGAN recently acquired Exony, which adds a digital voice component to round out their platform. Exony already has a close relationship with Cisco - in fact, Exony is sold 100% through Cisco. Cisco may have wanted to acquire Exony for themselves, but may have not moved quickly enough or have not thought Exony as significant enough of an acquisition at $15m. As Exony joins EGAN, the first order of business will be to transition Exony onto EGAN's cloud, and later on, cross sell solutions to both customer bases. EGAN will initially keep Exony's sales force intact for the time being, but will consolidate after Exony's year end (end of Sept). Combined with Exony, this makes EGAN a stronger and more established player across the omnichannel spectrum.Cisco's sales force is also now able to sell EGAN's cloud solution, which just launched a few months ago. There hasn't been any contribution here, but I think SaaS cloud bookings should ramp the rest of the year against these easy comps. The sell-side has thrown in the towel on EGAN and investors have been dumping the stock as investor fatigue has set in and tax loss harvesting is upon us. Organically, the market is expecting EGAN to grow less than 10% on the top line. As I mentioned before, sales force productivity was embarrassingly pathetic last year. Given the new sales leadership and the maturation of the sales force, I would expect 20% bookings growth compared to last year. The sales force is now against the wall and will need to perform to expectations, and I believe that they will be able to exceed market expectations.If the company can demonstrate a re-acceleration in SaaS bookings and cut sales and marketing expenses back to a more normalized 35%, I think they might be able to sell the company for $11-12 or closer to 3x sales. This would be a far cry from the multiples of a year ago or the 5.5x Oracle paid for Rightnow, but it would be still be nearly a double from today's closing price.From an acquisition perspective, EGAN has best-in-class strong technology and is being underutilized as a standalone public company. Cisco or another large enterprise company has far more ability to leverage the technology platform across its large installed base of customers and massive sales force. A company like Cisco could cut out most of the corporate overhead, and also most of the existing sales and marketing expense as well (Cisco could just sell it as an add-on solution to their existing clients). If I assume 80% reduction in sales and marketing, the EGAN business could reach 50m in EBITDA within a year. At that contribution, 3x sales would be a steal for Cisco. This would value the company at 6x EV/EBITDA. Even though EGAN has struggled, this is still a high margin software business growing in the high teens. Furthermore, it would be a very easy integration as well.The company itself isn't distressed at all, besides on the stock price. EGAN is expected to breakeven on cash, and has a net cash position on the balance sheet. I don't expect EGAN to do a capital raise anytime soon.For 2015, I believe that EGAN can exceed expectations and get to 100m in sales. As the company shows reaccelerating bookings and revenue growth, the multiple should expand back to 3x EV/Sales. The stock is a double from today's price of 4.45 within 12 months using a conservative 2x sales multiple. Longer term, I believe that EGAN will be sold to a strategic partner that has far broader distribution and that can successfully sell and value EGAN's best-of-breed omnichannel technology platform."

We noted,The company noted that it is gaining traction with partner-led engagements. Recall that its over-exaggerated ""partnership"" with Cisco last year was one of the reasons we went bearish.The company isn't making any money and trades at 1.5x sales -- the lowest P/S ratio we've seen in three years. That still doesn't change the fact that revenue growth is plateauing and the company is forecast to post negative EPS for fiscal 2015 (ending June) and 2016. We still think the easy money has already been made shorting EGAN and are on pause with the stock."
4185743,21815,2018-07-06T11:09:01-04:00,The shares have increased almost ten-fold in the past 12 months.The main driver is the company's transformation into a SaaS business platform.We think the shares are now fully valued.,"It has certainly been a terrific rally in the shares of eGain (EGAN) on the back of a completed transformation into a SaaS business.The shares are now up almost 10x in the last 12 months. That's quite something. At first sight, company developments don't seem to warrant such a massive stock rally:EGAN Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsRevenue growth is only just returning, after quite a few years of declines, although operational improvements have been occurring despite shrinking revenues.And kudos to SA contributor Robo Investors who did foresee much this rise back in March. The main driver of the rally has been the company's transformation from a license-based business model to a SaaS platform one producing recurring revenues.Management expects that transformation to be complete in three years, with all of the legacy license clients either having made the switch to the cloud (or disappearing as a customer, but the latter doesn't seem to be a significant problem).In essence, the transformation is already well on its way and near completion. Revenues from on-premise licenses have declined into insignificance ($151K in Q3, down from $1.2M a year ago):As you can see, recurring revenues are already responsible for most (84%, up from 73% a year ago) of the revenues, indicating the SaaS transformation well on its way.The company offers free migration from on-premise application to the cloud, but they have an incentive as the cloud runs a newer version which, for instance, runs a GDPR compliance module so customers won't fall afoul with the latest EU data privacy regulations.The company is increasingly relying on its partner channel in order to broaden its customer base (that is, gain new logos instead of just migrating the existing ones to the cloud).One reason for that is that management argues that direct engagement just takes up too much time. The partner network is especially useful for bringing in bigger customers, like a large US telco and a European branded manufacturing business in Q3.This isn't actually so surprising if you realize that they have really big partners, like Cisco (CSCO) and Avaya (AVYA). In order to capture bigger (enterprise) clients, the company has also started a program (EcoNet) which (Q3CC):With respect to that mentioned eGain platform, the company actually blurs the line between partnerships and an ecosystem.The latter allows third-party developers to hook into the company's applications and build something on top, and the company is actively encouraging that through their open API eGain platform.This is one of the flywheels of SaaS business platform models, so we are very interested to see how this develops. In principle, it's a win-win-win, for the company, for partners, and for customers.This is because third-party apps expand the functionality of the platform, making it more valuable for customers and sticky as well, increasing switching cost and reducing churn.The increased value of the platform is likely to attract more partners building more third-party apps, producing a bit of a network effect.Apart from opening up the platform to third-party app developers, the company is also increasing functionality through its own R&D process. Not only compliance with EU GDPR but also for instance, AI + Knowledge capabilities developed with Avaya (Q3CC):The latter is especially interesting because it shows the Swiss army knife properties of these SaaS business platforms. In this case, it looks like it is taking the company beyond its core markets in customer service, which is good news.And the company will add analytics in due course to this mix so they're not done yet, indeed (Q3CC):EGAN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsMargins have improved lately, gross margins reached 66% in Q3, up from 60% in Q3 2017. The shift to SaaS increases margins, their recurring revenue gross margin increased from 70% (Q3 2017) to 76% (Q3 2018).But professional service margin also increased (from 4% in Q3 2017 to 13% in Q3 2018) even when service demand itself is actually down a bit.Operating cost (non-GAAP) actually declined 3% (and even 8% for the first nine months of the year) on a dollar basis, so it's no wonder operating margin is up. The new business model comes with considerable leverage.We're not entirely sure that the future will show similar improvement though, at least not the immediate future as management indicated increased spending:Management now expects to exceed their previous 2018 guidance (Q3CC):But one has to take on-board that there was a $400K in volume billings which came from one big customer exceeding their annual volume commitments in the first year of a three-year contract.The good news is that these contracts are specified for a specific maximum volume, and exceeding that brings additional revenues. But this could be a one-off, so perhaps the Q3 figures were a little inflated.EGAN Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsThere has been a steady improvement in the generation of cash flows, although starting from considerably negative territory at the end of 2014.There was a slight hiccup in this progress, but nothing to worry about (Q3CC):Deferred revenue was $71.1M, up from $53.5M a year ago. The company has $10.9M in cash and cash equivalents. Total debt as of March 31, 2018, was $7.2M, down 63% from a year ago.EGAN Stock-Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsShare-based compensation isn't large, and there is dilution but in rather modest proportions.EGAN EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsHere is where we start to have some problems. When SA contributor Robo Investor wrote back in March, the shares were still modestly valued, but 7x sales aren't all that modest anymore even if this isn't exuberant for a Saas business platform.The company is in the final stages of transforming into a SaaS business platform, with all the bells and whistles that go with that business model. The shares have been on an epic tear as a consequence and alas, we missed that rally.But we think the shares are now fully valued and they are also considerably overbought. It's always possible for the shares to stretch out some more gains, but that would surprise us we have to say.While the company produces good free cash flow, operating margin is still quite modest and might not improve all that much in the immediate future, given some cost increases."
16798,20304,2006-09-13T06:42:33-04:00,,"As Dell (Nasdaq: DELL) has learned the hard way, customer service is a competitive advantage. However, it can be costly to staff-up this side of the business. So perhaps software can help? That’s what eGain (NASDAQ:EGAN) believes. And, yes, the company is a developer of customer service and contact software. However, at least on a quarterly basis, eGain’s business can be erratic. For example, this week the company announced its second quarter results – which showed an 11% decline in revenues to $5.2 million. Then again, since the company focuses on large customers, the sales cycle can be difficult. In the quarter, there were a couple anticipated seven figure deals that got pushed out. But if you look at revenues for the past 12 months, there was a 10% increase to $22.6 million. While there was a net loss of $1.1 million, the company was able to post positive cash flows of $3 million. Essentially, eGain's product offering allows companies to deal with high volumes of customer interactions, including email, web traffic, phone calls and more. The software should help lead to sales. For example, with a live chat on a web site, a customer may have some questions – which, when answered, result in a purchase decision. Other features include: intelligent routing and auto-suggest/auto-response capabilities, tracking, workload and reporting features, and knowledge-guided services. Actually, eGain is one of the pioneers of hosted enterprise applications. That is, the company can deliver software via a Web browser hooked to its servers, much like what Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) does. If a customer wants to have an on-premise installation, eGain also provides that option. True, eGain is a very small stock, with a market cap of only $24.5 million. Then again, management provided guidance for the next 12 months with revenues ranging from $27 million to $30 million. In other words, the company’s revenues are likely to exceed its market cap. No doubt, eGain is likely to get a boost from its recent OEM agreement with Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO). What's more, given the recent M&A activity in the software sector, as well as the going-private transactions -- e.g., the recent $234 million Embarcadero Technologies (NASDAQ: EMBT) deal -- there is ample opportunity for catalysts to get eGain's stock moving north over the next year or so.

2144923,64043,2014-04-17T13:27:13-04:00,Best-in-breed product in a rapidly consolidating market.Significant partnership with Cisco that continues to accelerate.Incredibly inexpensive for both strategic or financial acquirers.,"The market has been brutal to high technology companies the past few weeks, with SaaS and biotech stocks falling over 20% as lofty valuations come crashing down. Unfortunately, some of the gems in the space have been unfairly dragged down as well, which means that if you do the work, you can find some really underappreciated and undervalued companies. I've discovered a company that fits into this description and believe that a strategic acquirer likely recognizes this as well.eGain Communications (NASDAQ:EGAN) is a best-of-breed customer engagement software company. EGAN provides knowledge and collaboration solutions to B2C companies. To provide a clearer picture of what these solutions are:Knowledge solutions include things such as FAQs (SelfService, see picture below) and automated answer bots on a company's website, Virtual Assistant, as well as software for call center representatives to supply them with relevant information on customer service calls (KnowledgeAgent).(source: eGain website)Collaboration solutions help manage large volumes of support e-mail, facilitate online chat (and online video chat) with customer representatives, co-browse capabilities (you share the screen with the rep), and promotional offers. This video provides a good summary of these capabilities.This customer engagement software isn't just targeted for retail shoppers. It extends into other verticals such as financial services (dealing with a credit card issues), healthcare (navigating through your healthcare plans), airlines (finding the right flight), cable companies (solving network issues), and so on. As you can see, customer engagement is relevant in almost every industry, and given how important it is these days to retain customers and keep them happy, customer service software is a more integral piece of a successful company. This is what EGAN achieves - it helps customers solve the issue of customer service and churn, thereby increasing the value of each of their customer's customers.What's impressive about EGAN is that although it is still a small company (roughly 70m in revenues expected in FY 2014), the company has produced a best-in-breed product. Look at the latest CRM Web Customer Service Applications' Magic Quadrant from Gartner:Typically, when you look at these comparisons, there are a few companies that are bunched closely together near the top. EGAN, however, in just a few years, has been able to distance themselves significantly from the pack. The market itself is booming, with 9 out of 10 CEOs stating that they were planning to strengthen customer and client engagement platforms.What's also interesting about this chart is where the larger players stand and how the industry has changed in the last few years. Big names such as Oracle (pre RightNow acquisition), SAP, and Avaya, have fallen behind in this space and are now looking to catch up. Oracle acquired RightNow in 2011, and yet after two years, is still trailing EGAN. Kana was acquired by Verint a few months ago, the same day that Microsoft acquired Parature. These big players, the Oracles, Ciscos, SAPs, Microsofts, and IBMs of the world recognize that customer engagement is a vital component of their organizations, and are now in the marketplace trying to leapfrog each other into this space. Even if I only use this chart, I think it's pretty obvious that EGAN is the logical choice to be scooped up.You might be asking who and when EGAN will be acquired. There's actually an obvious choice here too, and it's Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). Cisco, along with companies such as Microsoft, IBM, SAP, Infosys, and Accenture, have been long-time partners of EGAN. What's different about Cisco is that a few years back, EGAN and Cisco agreed to a tighter symbiotic relationship. Cisco recently began to package and sell EGAN solutions alongside its SolutionsPlus contact center product, investing the time and effort into retraining its sales reps to pitch both products. This helps EGAN get into larger accounts that the company may not have reached by itself, and also gives Cisco a leading edge solution to its customers. The partnership has really accelerated towards the end of last year and this year. EGAN has been able to go from nothing to pilot programs and now to fully scaled implementations within a matter of months. This partnership will continue to strengthen as Cisco transitions from selling only on premise EGAN solutions to selling EGAN cloud solutions (this may have already started). Although EGAN works with other partners, this is by far their most substantial relationship, which makes Cisco an obvious suitor to acquire EGAN. After all, why would Cisco continue to help EGAN if EGAN could turn around and provide the same solutions to SAP, IBM, or Microsoft? If Cisco doesn't pick them up, any of these other companies will.Given EGAN's size and current valuation, EGAN is also incredibly cheap. This is a 70m revenue company growing at 20-25% and valued at 2x sales. Even more incredible is that EGAN is growing its SaaS business in the 35-40% range. The company has generated FCF in the past, and I expect it to return to FCF generation and profitability in the next two quarters as their newly ramped salesforce matures. If we look at current SaaS valuations, companies with similar profiles trade at 5-8x sales. More accurately, we can also look at the acquisitions in this space. Oracle acquired RightNow Technologies in 2011 at 6.5x sales. Verint acquired Kana in 2014 for 3.5x sales. Microsoft acquired Parature for an estimated 5x sales. These are all competitors in the customer engagement software space. Yet EGAN, the best in the business, is currently trading at less than 2x NTM sales! This company has been severely oversold in the recent downturn, and is an amazing deal for a larger player. Even at a 4x sales multiple, EGAN would cost an acquirer $300m, a steal compared to what someone like Oracle paid for an inferior product. Six months ago, EGAN was at nearly 400m in market cap itself with no significant customer wins through the Cisco partnership. Now, the company is valued by the market at less than half that amount, with significant Cisco customers both implementing and in the pipeline. On the last call, the CEO, Ashutosh Roy, stated that""Our pipeline continues to be healthy, that's growing nicely. We are seeing larger opportunities than before. For example, the number of seven-figure opportunities in our pipeline has nearly tripled year-over-year. Also we are seeing more partner leverage, especially due to the developing Cisco SolutionsPlus program which now accounts for nearly 30% of our pipeline. This pipeline growth is quite encouraging.""I believe that this pipeline will lead to acceleration in second half bookings, which could be a catalyst and push the stock higher. Cisco should have some visibility into how well EGAN is doing, and I would assume they would prefer to take stake in EGAN before the public understands the story.Lastly, EGAN could also be a target of a financial acquirer. The company has shown in the past that it can generate profitability and free cash flow, which makes it tempting for a private equity firm to come in and steal EGAN at 3x sales from its frustrated shareholders. Vocus was just recently acquired by a private equity firm, GTCR, for 2.5x sales, yet company had no revenue growth and minimal cash flow generation. I believe that EGAN is much more superior with 20%+ growth and the ability to generate significant cash very quickly. All the private equity firm has to do is to bring in a more disciplined and efficient management team to cut costs and optimize sales/marketing expenses. Furthermore, since the company is in a net cash position, EGAN would have access to cheap debt and could quickly return cash back as a dividend its private equity investors. This is a typical private equity firm's dream investment with attractive IRRs, and in this market, I believe there are a lot of firms such as KKR and TPG that are looking to invest cheaply in public companies.Either through a strategic or financial acquirer, EGAN is worth much more than the current stock price. Momentum investors who rode the stock up are now dumping it without reason. I believe that EGAN is worth a minimum of $9/share to a financial acquirer, but is more likely worth $12/share or higher to Cisco or another strategic acquirer.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Analysts are taking note, and Ladenburg Thalman is the first to issue a downgrade as the company's shares have reached ""overvalued"" territory. This, coupled with strong insider selling, is signalling that eGain has hit a top and will be heading lower in the near-term.OvervieweGain bills itself as a leading provider of cloud-based and on-site customer engagement solutions. In other words, it offers solutions to companies that allow them to interact with their customers through the different multichannel points. The picture looks like this:How the bulls are justifying the valuationOutlined below are some of the bright spots that the bulls are pointing to in an effort to justify paying 1,300 times earnings for the stock.1. eGain has a partnership with Cisco and has jointly launched the eGain for Cisco S Plus solution. This is a solution being sold by Cisco and its partners with eGain sales support. This gives eGain exposure to Cisco's installed base and their target markets.2. According to Gartner, the eGain Knowledge Solution is the best among all providers evaluated. eGain has been named the leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Web Customer Service Application for five years in a row.3. According to a 2013 PwC survey of U.S. CEOs, 9 out of 10 U.S. CEOs say that they are strengthening their customer engagement program this year.Why the bulls are wrong1. On the surface, the potential with Cisco looks promising. However, it did not change management's forecast for next year in terms of sales growth. We take that as a sign that the benefits from Cisco will be minimal and not have a direct impact on earnings in the interim.In terms of the Gartner survey used in the company's last presentation, here are the results.Source: Company Presentation2. Overall, we were not impressed and not sure what ""most visionary"" means in the grand scheme of things. What's most interesting though to us is that RightNow is listed just above eGain. And who owns RightNow? Oracle.Back in 2011, Oracle spent $1.5 billion to boost its SaaS-based call center automation, sales force automation (SFA) and customer relationship management services. As Oracle has integrated RightNow with its cloud capabilities, it has changed the dynamics of the industry and made eGain less important. What it has further done is changed the bull's case for eGain. In management's presentation on eGain, they cite their competitive advantage over Oracle and Salesforce.Oracle has now fully integrated RightNow with its corporate offerings and the functionality is now there. With the acquisition of RightNow, Oracle added RightNow's Customer Service Cloud to the Oracle Public Cloud. The Oracle Public Cloud includes Sales Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Human Capital Cloud, Social Network Cloud, Database Cloud, Java Cloud, Data Cloud and Security Cloud. All of these services are provided both B2B and B2C.In a more recent Gartner survey (courtesy of eGain's IR department), it shows that eGain is now positioned above Oracle-Rightnow.Gartner also pointed out what we see at two key weaknesses for eGain.While the no contract is great for its customers, we don't see it as great for eGain. Customers are free to switch and are able to pick and choose what services they want. Again, great for the customer, not so much for eGain. The fact that there is no Microsoft .Net solution is a real negative in our opinion, nor does the company have any plans to develop one.3. We agree with the premise that CEOs are looking to better engage their customers. How this will exactly translate into new business for eGain, remains unseen. As it's clear that eGain isn't the top offering in the CRM market, and while we admit that a rising tide will lift all boats, it won't be enough to help eGain grow into it's steep valuation.The ""devils"" are in the detailsAll in all, we see the stock has having a number of headwinds and a lack of catalysts. The headwinds go beyond the fact that the Cisco partnership isn't that meaningful and the fact that Oracle should continue eating eGain's market share, to company-specific issues.The first headwind is that eGain is exposed to the whims of its largest customers. Last year, there was one customer that accounted for 18% of total revenues. Two different customers accounted for 10% and 22% of total revenues in 2012 and 2011, respectively. As investors found out with one of eGain's competitors and another one of our short recommendations, LivePerson, the loss of a large customer can wreck havoc on a company's earnings results. eGain, in its latest 10-K, forecast this trend to continue.Two, the space that eGain operates in is getting increasingly crowded. In addition to LivePerson, eGain competes with Avaya, Genesys Telecommunications, Kana Software, and Moxie Software. The biggest threat to eGain, though, comes from the bigger players Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and Salesforce. These companies have already added customer engagement software for their installed customer base. As mentioned, Oracle already owns the top operator in the CRM space.Most notable to us in the 10-K is the fact that there are no barriers to entry. The company states:To understand how commoditized eGain's business is, consider the fact that 49% of its employee headcount is based in India. Most high-value software companies do not have high a percentage of their employee headcount in a market known for its call centers. While eGain is based in Silicon Valley, its customer relationship business is primarily done from India. We see this as another reason of why eGain's ""moat"" is not that strong.Three, insiders own approximately 41% of the company. Last month, insider selling really picked up with the Bass family starting to unload their stake in the company. What's notable to us is that this is the first sales made by the Bass family in eGain and all took place above today's prices.Source: Yahoo! FinanceWe reached out to their IR department and they had this to say in regard to insider selling:While that might be true, there's still the issue of the Bass family sales.A look at the numbersIn looking at eGain's numbers, according to Finviz, there isn't all that much to get excited about. From a multiples standpoint, the company is trading at a current P/E of 1300 and a forward P/E of 1857! Digging further, the Price/Book is 54, Price/Cash is 20, Price/Free Cash Flow is 44, and EV/EBITDA is 128. Cash/share amounts to only $0.65. All in all, the company is quite expensive.In terms of margins, the gross margin is 69%, but that pales in comparison to Oracle's 81%, Salesforce's 77%, and even LivePerson's 76%. eGain's operating margin is only 2% and the profit margin is even lower at 1%. So, as you can see, margins are nothing to write home about.Well, what about earnings? We have to give the company credit here, in that they have beaten expectations and delivered actual profits.Source: Yahoo! FinanceBut, going forward the company's growth is expected to slow. For FY'13, total revenues increased 36% over FY'12. In FY'14, the company expects revenues to grow only 20% to 25%. In terms of earnings, analysts aren't too optimistic.EPS is forecast to come in at plus or minus breakeven. This supports why the company's multiples don't look to improve anytime soon. In looking at its competitors, we see:Source: Yahoo! FinanceAt 5.58x sales, that's well above its 1.6x 5-year average. With the company expected to generate some $86.14 million in sales for fiscal 2015, and using a justified 2x p/s multiple, the downside for the stock could be 50%.Bottom lineThe days of paying sky-high multiples for tech companies is no longer realistic, especially for a company like eGain that has been around since 1997 and posted only $58 million in revenues last year. At a current P/E of 1300 and a forward P/E of 1857, the multiples being assigned to eGain are completely unwarranted. Revenues are expected to only grow 20% to 25% next year, and even with analysts estimates of $87 million in sales for fiscal '15, the stock is still trading well above its historical multiples. And with no catalysts for the stock, we see multiples contraction bringing the stock down by 50% over the next eighteen months.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1855191,56772,2013-11-21T12:46:35-05:00,,"eGain (NASDAQ:EGAN) is a leading provider of software as a service (""SaaS"") and on premise customer engagement solutions. Their products help B2C companies connect with their respective customers online, providing higher-touch solutions to their issues and increasing their sales conversion.For clarity purposes, we will be referring to EGAN's customers as ""clients,"" and these clients' customers as ""customers.""EGAN's current product suite (version 11) consists of ten separate solutions that deliver improved customer engagement. While these all fulfill different needs and provide value, we want to highlight the following products that really establish EGAN's competitive position:· Chat - Software that connects a service rep with the customer through a live, online chat portal. The service rep helps the consumer with shopping questions, website issues, or any other service. This product is used across industry verticals, such as retail, healthcare, insurance, telecom, and financial services.· Video chat - Exactly what it sounds like - an expansion of the chat platform into video. Available both through desktop and mobile devices.· Knowledge/Self-service - Supports the service rep and customer through a database framework. The application provides advanced search and suggestion capabilities and provides the user with fast and accurate answers to problems· Mail - Management and processing of high volume service related e-mails· Cobrowse - The product that EGAN's clients have been most interested in acquiring. This product allows the service reps to simultaneously browse websites alongside customers, assisting with website navigation, form filling, and other issues the customer may have. What's different about this technology, compared to current screen sharing and cloud technology, is that the consumer does not have to download any plugins or setup any software. One click, either by the service rep or the customer, opens a session where the parties navigate the website. Furthermore, Cobrowse tracks activity on the back end, providing clients with data analytics.Other products include Virtual Assistant (automated customer service), ClickToCall (quick service), and mail (e-mail management).While these are all great offerings, what's more exciting is that all of EGAN's products are also bundled together under one platform, called SuperChat. SuperChat allows users to be able to transition seamlessly from text to video to cobrowse; from automated to live service, and from desktop to mobile devices. In the past, if a customer used online chat and then attempted to call over the phone, they would reach a different representative. Now, the person you connect with is the same throughout the entire process. Not only does this allow the customer to choose their preferred method of communication, but significantly increases the quality of customer service.The better way to understand SuperChat is through a video linked here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DkKi5AEhAs1. Strong growth momentum with a large, multi-billion dollar opportunity still aheadDue to EGAN's innovative product suite and multi-channel model (discussed below), EGAN has been showing considerable organic growth. With a $13 billion addressable market growing north of 8%, EGAN has significant room to expand. We've spoke to multiple sales staff and came away excited about future prospects. For example, 2012 had one ""mega"" client (as described by management). Recent channel checks have told us that there may be 5 to 8 of these ""mega"" clients going forward, which will thrust 2014 bookings significantly above sell-side consensus.Furthermore, distribution and pricing will increase as well. EGAN has a significant relationship with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), spanning over seven years (discussed below). EGAN has also recently joined with Microsoft, which adds to its impressive list of partners such as IBM, EMC, and SAP.EGAN has significant cross sell opportunity with its products as well. We were present at eGain World - their customer conference in Las Vegas. We spoke to numerous current customers, all whom expressed interest and excitement in expanding their current relationship with EGAN. We also noticed some large accounts that were interested in EGAN, such as Wells Fargo, USAA, and TD Ameritrade. Furthermore, EGAN provides post-implementation consulting services. Many of their customers have difficulty transitioning their legacy business/personnel/culture, so EGAN steps in and helps optimize the process (while charging an additional fee).Healthcare is a particular vertical we are focused on. With upcoming Obamacare/ACA changes, insurance providers are seeing heavy customer service activity. EGAN has seen direct bookings as a result of insurance providers falling behind and needing to quickly ramp up their customer service offerings.The sales force is also increasing quickly and ramping up well. The company has over 40 sales reps now and is on pace to double in 18 months. A majority of these reps are seasoned as well, with several years of experience selling the product.Lastly, EGAN is expanding into new industry verticals. While the big verticals are still financial services, healthcare, and insurance, the company has been in discussions with various airline and car manufacturers.2. Shift to the cloud and a subscription model will allow for better revenue visibility and increased marginsEGAN's business has historically been offered on premise but is now converting more and more customers towards the cloud. The benefits are obvious - cloud customers are able to ramp up quicker and save money at the end of the day. This conversion has even reached industry verticals that are typically hesitant toward cloud solutions due to security concerns, such as financial services and healthcare. However, EGAN understands this issue and is actively working alongside financial and healthcare firms to alleviate their concerns. EGAN's internal controls already exceed auditor requirements for financial services, and the company is currently seeking outside accreditation for the healthcare sector. Currently, 60% of new bookings are cloud-based, providing EGAN with increased visibility into future growth. The cloud model is also supported by very high yearly renewal rates of 90% plus and growing, ahead of industry standards.3. EGAN is a thought leader with innovative products that clients needEGAN has developed a best-in-class product suite through 15 years of innovation and execution. Starting with Mail and Knowledge, EGAN has continued to add cutting edge functionality and features. EGAN has been recognized by Gartner as the web customer service leader four years in a row:Cobrowse and video chat are in the early stages of adoption, but are the next steps in the evolution of CRM. EGAN is currently working on five different new technologies, one being eGain Mobile released earlier this year, but we'd like to highlight another one here:EGAN has taken its enterprise Cobrowse solution and transformed it into a free-to-use consumer product. Imagine surfing a website, hitting the cobrowse button (browser plug in) and inviting friends to view, markup, and browse the site with you. This is an amazing technology that is easy to use. The invited friends do not need to install the plug or create an account; it's simply click and go. We believe that this is a transformative product that will change online shopping and communication. Imagine shopping with friends or creating travel plans - this can now be done completely remotely. The best way is to see for yourself here. https://beta.cobrowse.com/The purpose of this product is get increased public awareness of cobrowse - as the public discovers its uses and benefits, the expectation is that cobrowse should be offered as a core CRM solution for all companies.At the end of the day, EGAN is able to show tangible results to its clients. Chat has shown that it is able to drive up to 25% more purchases and Knowledge has reduced call times by 35%.4. Multi-channel strategy that differentiates EGAN from competitors such as Liveperson (NASDAQ:LPSN) and Oracle/RightNowEGAN approaches potential clients not with a product, but with a solution. Clients might only RFP for a chat product, but EGAN will pitch the client on a modular platform that will fit present needs and future wants as well. As a result, many chat-only clients have chosen EGAN over LPSN not solely due to pricing or product strength, but because EGAN provides this optionality as well as next generation features in the CRM hierarchy.EGAN also wins against the larger CRM vendors, such as Oracle/RightNow and Salesforce.com. EGAN is a pure-play solution with a much more focused product and sales force.Additionally, EGAN not only offers customer solutions, but sales generation as well. This is most prominently seen in the retail industry with companies such as Lands' End.5. Partnership with CSCO is bearing fruit and will drive long term growthWhile CSCO has been a partner for seven years, the partnership recently expanded to bundle EGAN products with Cisco's Solutions Plus Program. This partnership has expanded EGAN's potential clients to a much larger universe with a lot more large enterprise clients. As a result of this partnership, many large companies have begun pilot programs through EGAN. Although the near term impact is small, due to the longer sales cycle, we believe that this CSCO relationship will drive growth in the mid to longer term. This is also a program in its infancy - CSCO recently refocused their sales team to sell more EGAN bundles once they discovered that bundled contracts tend to be 2.5x larger. CSCO is currently rolling out phase 2 of the partnership, which includes more emphasis on cloud solutions. Current attach rates are in the 20% range, but CSCO expects this to reach 50% in the next three years.6. Strong management team that has stuck since the beginning and has 50% ownership in the companyWe attribute much of EGAN's success to the vision that the management team created. All three members of the executive team have been with since the late 1990s. Furthermore, insiders own 50% of the company. The CEO, who owns 33%, has not sold a single share.ValuationThe stock price has been recently punished due to the inherent lumpiness of bookings, and we believe that this is a great time to invest. The miss in bookings number for the recent Q1 14 quarter was due to the government shutdown that shifted one large contract. The contract is still expected to settle this quarter, and management is still executing on their goals and have many large contracts lined up. Additionally, the stock has been up significantly this year, and we believe that some investors were just taking profits at the end of the year.We have confidence EGAN can continue to grow cloud revenues well ahead of expectations and reach over 100 million in total revenues in by 2015, or $4/share. As cloud becomes an increasingly substantial segment for EGAN, margins should expand as well. EGAN already generates FCF, and as the transition concludes, we believe that EGAN should be able to generate significant cash flow as well. We value EGAN with a 6x multiple in 2015, resulting in a $24 price target, or over 100%. This multiple is in line with other SaaS companies given the growth rates and margins.There is also a high likelihood that EGAN is potentially acquired by CSCO sometime in the future. The current relationship is very robust and symbiotic, and the sales reps already know how to sell both systems. CSCO has mentioned to us that they would never develop EGAN solutions in house due to the strong lead that EGAN has in the space, but could acquire EGAN given the current market cap and price level. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) acquired RightNow at 6x sales in 2011, and given the market conditions and higher level of growth, we believe that EGAN would sell for much more.Disclosure: I am long EGAN.

299890,24582,2011-10-17T04:08:46-04:00,,"It's not every day that you find a good company in one of the hottest (if not the hottest) industries around that has no analyst coverage, no institutional buying, a solid balance sheet, and an owner who owns 8.5 million shares (out of a total float of approximately 24 million). When you do happen to come across one of these, it's worth it to at least do a little research and see if you've really found a hidden gem.On October 12, eGain Communications (NASDAQ:EGAN) was uplisted to the NASDAQ exchange. While listings to major exchanges are always important milestones for companies, they don't usually result in the rapid price appreciation that eGain shareholders enjoyed on Wednesday as the stock popped more than 16% on more than six times normal volume.The price action was likely due to a combination of factors, most important of which were significantly improved liquidity (long-time shareholders are aware of the ridiculous swings of 10% on a $.05 trade on the OTC BB), and the long-awaited press of being on a massive trading exchange. eGain has been completely shunned by Wall Street analysts as it has enjoyed fantastically improved top-lines, margins, and bottom-line earnings. Even better, eGain's OTC BB listing of the past, in combination with a price below $5, delayed institutional buying.The Business and IndustryeGain operates in what is termed ""the cloud,"" and more specifically, the Business Software and Services industry. Its revenues are derived from three main segments:On a year-on-year basis (YoY), eGain saw approximately 47% growth in revenues, and enviable growth of 65% in gross profits. eGain's tiny market cap and small share count should allow for several years of rapid, unmatched growth relative to its peers.eGain's CEO, Mr. Ashutosh Roy, owns nearly one-third of the outstanding shares and has been a long-term owner. There is arguably no better security than when the CEO of your investment has the exact same interests you have.While eGain has exceptional products, and has seen rapid, healthy growth, they are a smaller player (for now) within a competitive industry. Their major, most direct competitors are:It should be known that eGain also indirectly competes with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), Saleforce (NYSE:CRM), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), all software behemouths who have overlapping operations with eGain and its direct competitors.FinancialsFor small companies, financial soundness is crucial. Smaller companies don't have the access to capital that nationally recognizable names have, in bank debt accessability, long-term structured debt obligations (bonds), or even equity (issuing more shares); even a relatively small amount in dollars for a secondary offering would have a large impact on earnings per share. Fortunately, eGain is in excellent financial shape.A quick look at cash and cash equivalents shows more than a two-fold increase from last year: eGain has $12.46 million to its name. With only $5 million in combined short-term and long-term debt, liquidity won't be an issue for the foreseeable future.eGain's cash flows are superb. 2011 provided about $6 million in free cash flows. The nature of eGain's business allows for very few capital expenditures, which lets eGain keep more of what it takes in. In terms of income available to common shareholders, eGain earned $8.51 million last year.ValuationAs mentioned before, eGain's main competitors, RNOW and LPSN trade at 50 times earnings. I subscribe to the Peter Lynch theory that P/E ratios should always be exceeded by earnings growth rates.eGain, with 60% growth in profits from 2010, and more than 300% EPS growth since 2009 ($.11 per share vs. $.35 per share in 2011), more than fufills this requirement. Trading at only 19.7 last year's earnings, eGain is trading at a 60% premium to its highly followed competitors.This premium gap is likely to close in the coming months. There is no doubt that the business fundamentals appear to be strong and improving still, while the institutional buying restrictions (lack of liquidity, price below $5, OTC BB listing) have been lifted. Additionally, lack of analyst coverage has been a huge hinder on the price, but the company has had a string of big exposure, most notably all of the press from the NASDAQ listing.Fair Value for the stock, given the discount to competitors, business fundamentals, and share statistics (i.e. 35% insider ownership, small float, no institutional buying yet), appears to be around the $12-15 mark, which would give it a P/E in the 30-40 range.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. A close family member owns EGAN shares."

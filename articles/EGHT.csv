4373019,35181,2020-09-08T10:03:23-04:00,"Strong Q1 2021 YoY ARR growth of 30% during the pandemic for this SaaS communications solutions provider.
        Counterbalancing the strong revenue growth was the equally weak free cash flow margin of -32% resulting in a fail of the software metric, the Rule of 40.
        The stock is one of the most undervalued on a relative basis, but the deteriorating margins make investing in this company a difficult proposition.","8x8, Inc. (EGHT) provides SaaS-based solutions that enable businesses of all sizes to digitally transform their communications strategies. The company provides applications for chat, voice, video, and contact centers. The company’s business is further described in the quarterly report:Investors in 8x8 are undoubtedly very frustrated as the stock has under-performed it peers such as RingCentral, Inc. (RNG), Five9, Inc. (FIVN), and Twilio Inc. (TWLO) by a wide margin over the past several years.(Source: Portfolio123)Communications is a key component of the digital transformation movement, and the lack of performance on 8x8's part leave a bad aftertaste. The primary reason for this stock’s lackluster performance, isn’t its revenue growth rate which has consistently been greater than 20% annually, but the company’s increasingly poor operating margins.The factor of that is most telling for me is the free cash flow margin, which tells me whether the company is burning cash. For 8x8, the free cash flow margin tells a disturbing story.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)The deteriorating company fundamentals may explain the arrival of the new CFO, rarely a good sign in this industry.8x8 has, in a sense, been undergoing a transformation of its own, transitioning from its legacy platform to its new 8x8 X Series Platform.The problem is that both legacy and new platforms must be maintained until the transformation is complete, still a long way from happening.Another telling sign is the rapidly deteriorating gross profit margin which has plummeted from 81% down to 63% in little more than a year. Some of the decline can be explained away by the acquisition of Wavecell Pte. Ltd., which gives 8x8 an Asian-based Communications Platform-as-a-Service (CPaaS) capability. CPaaS comes at a cost however, and that is lower margins.(Source: Portfolio123)Despite the deteriorating margins, there are some positive aspects to the 8x8 business that share holders should consider, described in this excellent article. They include:In addition to the above initiatives, the Asian CPaaS business has suffered due to the COVID-related slowdown and this is starting to pick up.Stock ValuationThe plot below illustrates how 8x8 stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward EV/Sales versus forward revenue growth. Note: Please refer to a recent article for more information on the scatter plot-relative valuation technique.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)8x8 is situated well below the best fit line on the scatter plot, suggesting that the stock is extremely undervalued on a relative basis relative to its peers based on expected future revenue growth and its forward sales multiple.The Rule Of 40The industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to one of my previous articles.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)In 8x8's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 29% - 32% = -3%8x8 fails miserably on the Rule of 40, suggesting that it does not have a healthy balance between growth and profitability. Note that this metric is calculated on a trailing-twelve-month basis. The extremely negative free cash flow margin of -32% makes investing in this company a non-starter for me.This level of negative free cash flow ultimately requires the company to refuel on a regular basis, either via share dilution or increased debts. In 8x8’s case, it has increasing its debt level over the years.(Source: Portfolio123)While the company debt load is increasing rapidly, the rate of cash burn is equally alarming, as shown below.(Source: Portfolio123)The negative free cash flow phenomenon has persisted for many years and has to be built into the company management mindset. The management promises to be in a position of positive cash flow by the end of the fiscal year 2021. My position is that there is a difference between talk and action, and so far I'm not seeing enough action. This company really needs to phase out its legacy products fast(er) and slow down on new product initiatives to a level that it can afford.Summary and Conclusions8x8 provides digital solutions for companies of all sizes to transform their communications systems, with SaaS-based chat, voice, video conferencing, and contact systems. In addition, 8x8 now has a CPaaS in Asia that will soon be expanded globally.8x8 has a lot of things going for it, including good revenue growth in a difficult economic environment, and several new initiatives that include voice for Microsoft Team, Video Meetings Pro, and the entry into the Oracle partner network. Despite these positive attributes, the company has one glaring issue, and that is its extremely negative free cash flow margin of -32%. This causes it to fail the Rule of 40 software metric by a wide margin and has translated into a rapidly increasing debt load over time.The company management has stated that the company will be cash flow positive by the end of fiscal 2021. However, I am not seeing any signs of an improvement so far and I believe that it is prudent to wait for some positive results before getting on board with this investment. Therefore, I am providing a neutral rating for this company. I look forward to the day when 8x8 starts to see some improvement in its free cash flow."
4349771,102293,2020-05-24T04:52:25-04:00,"UCaaS and CPaaS are becoming big opportunities in the stay-at-home economy.The company has developed a broad strategy to expand topline, reduce costs and improve profitability in future quarters.Investors should consider risks such as high costs, high debt and a high small business churn rate.","Business communications player, 8x8 (EGHT) can emerge as a major beneficiary in the golden age of communication, thanks to the advent of the stay-at-home economy. In a matter of few months, 8x8 has managed to position itself as a prominent SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) provider of voice, video, chat, contact center, and enterprise-class API solutions based on a global cloud communications platform. The company‘s Jitsi and 8x8 video meetings are now seen as credible and secure alternatives to video-over-IP solutions of prominent player, Zoom (ZM).8x8 was not spared in the overall market downturn of March 2020. While the stock has recovered some of its losses, it still remains down 17.32% on YTD (year-to-date) basis. However, I believe that there remains significant upside potential in this stock on a risk-adjusted basis.UCaaS and CPaaS have emerged as huge opportunities in the stay-at-home economy.According to MarketsandMarkets estimates, the global UCaaS (Unified Communications as a Service) market will grow from $15.8 billion in 2019 to $24.8 billion in 2024, a CAGR (compounded average growth rate) of 9.5%. According to industry analyst IDC, the worldwide CPaaS (communications platform-as-a-service) market is forecast to grow from $3.3 billion in 2018 to $17.2 billion in 2023. The UCaaS market has never been better positioned, considering that the pandemic has created a huge need for rapidly scaling remote contact centers and virtual offices. The workforce in this stay-at-home economy will increasingly depend on the ability to move seamlessly from chat to voice to video.Customers are now increasingly opting for single-platform based communications solutions. 8x8 has been successfully leveraging this increased demand for single technology UCaaS and CCaaS solutions as a replacement for legacy on-premise systems and single-point solutions. In the fourth quarter, the company saw 71% of new bookings with ARR (annual recurring revenue) greater than 12k from customers for UCaaS and CPaaS solutions, up from 52% a year ago. I believe that this trend will continue in the next few quarters, with demand mainly coming from mid-market and enterprise customers.8x8 saw explosive growth in monthly active users for open-source video meetings service Jitsi and 8x8 free video meeting solutions from a few hundred thousand customers to 20 million customers in just a few weeks. There has also been a steep rise in 8x8 X series platform scalability and usage, a number of app downloads, messages exchanged, bundled video conferencing usage, and a total number of app-based phone calls in this period. In the absence of the pandemic, the company expected a similar ramp-up in its active users to take place over a period of 18 months – 24 months.8x8 plans to leverage this expanded customer base for cross-selling opportunities and for expanding its paid business customer base while controlling costs. The company aims to build on brand recognition for increased scale. The company expects this huge customer base to prove to be a marketing asset, and allow the company to add new customers at lower costs. This, in turn, is expected to improve CAC (customer acquisition cost) and LTV (Lifetime Value) metrics.There are a few other strategies that are being used to control costs. 8x8 is actively migrating legacy customers to the X series platform. The company is targeting migration of 80% of the installed base by the end of the calendar year 2020, which can help reduce support costs, increase customer LTV, improve churn rate, and increase net dollar retention.8x8 is also working to improve its customer mix from small businesses, traditionally known for high risk of churn as well as high CAC. To that extent, the company has made available attractive self-service support offerings for workgroup and micro businesses.Although all these initiatives may take some time to reflect on the company’s bottomline, they are definitely a move in the right direction.8x8 has joined the Oracle partner network and made its video meeting solutions available in the Oracle Cloud Marketplace. This can further help the company generate new customers from Oracle’s long list of existing customers. The company will also launch an 8x8 voice for Microsoft Team in June 2020, a cloud-based integration that provides enterprise-grade telephony and global PSTN (public switched telephone network) connectivity to customers that want to retain Microsoft teams as the collaboration interface.8x8 is now exploring direct opportunities in the B2C market. In April 2020, the company launched 8x8 Video meetings Pro, first standalone paid meeting product at $9.99 per month. The product is now available through e-commerce.8x8 has also been increasingly focusing on international markets such as Canada and the United Kingdom. The company has launched 8x8 X Series and 8x8 Contact Center in Canada and 8x8 Express in the United Kingdom. The company’s strategic partnership with Virgin Media Business is also aimed at increasing the adoption of its services in the United Kingdom.8x8 will be launching its CpaaS offerings globally in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The company has already closed initial deals in the United Kingdom and Europe and is exploring cross-selling opportunities within our UCaaS and CCaaS customer base in the U.S. and United Kingdom.All these initiatives will increase the company’s customer base significantly in the coming quarters.8x8’s products involve three robust components. The first component is the infrastructure, which has to be scalable and secure. The company has selected Oracle Cloud as the core infrastructure for running Jitsi open source video conferencing technology and 8x8 Video Meetings. Oracle has been chosen for its security and price performance. The second component is the X Series platform. Finally, there are applications run on this secure platform.Jitsi communication technology has been developed by 2,000 developer communities in a manner that ensures strong encryption, ease of use, and privacy. 8x8 expects to differentiate its video communication tools which are based on Jitsi on the merits of secure video meetings and strong encryption. These qualities are of exceeding importance in today’s environment when businesses are increasingly opting for work-from-home options.In the fourth quarter, 8x8 posted revenue and service revenue numbers that surpassed the company’s previous guidance. Revenues also surpassed the consensus by $2.15 million.The company has been especially successful with mid-market and enterprise customers and channel partners. The company’s non-GAAP EPS of -$0.49 fell short of the consensus by $0.12.8x8 also managed to surpass fiscal 2020 revenue and pre-tax loss guidance. Annual service revenue from mid-market and enterprise customers represented 43% of total annual service revenue and grew 51% over the prior year. The company saw solid contributions from both new and existing customers from UCaaS and CCaaS subscription models and from usage-based CPaaS offerings.In the fourth quarter, 8x8 added 42 new enterprise clients with deal sizes above $100,000, which represented 34% of new bookings for the quarter. The company also added 5,500 new paying customers, almost 100% up YoY and 35% more sequentially. A notable point is that five of 8x8's 10 largest wins were replacements of existing Avaya solutions with the X series platform. The company has also managed to increase penetration of the X series platform from 37% at the end of fiscal 2019 to 43% at the end of fiscal 2020.Contact Center bookings rose YoY by 76% and accounted for 30% new bookings in the fourth quarter. Channel bookings rose 63% YoY and made up for 54% of new bookings. The company has prominent channel partners such as Virgin Media, ScanSource, and Comstar Technologies. The company has 1,035 active channel partners and 24 master agents. Channel partners accounted for eight of the ten largest deals in the fourth quarter.The company’s cost structure and margins remained a challenge even in the fourth quarter. The company saw a huge jump in the free user base, which will also pose some challenges for its near-term margins.The company has guided for fiscal 2021 service revenues to be up YoY by 17% to 18%. Despite the ongoing challenges, the company also expects to exit this fiscal year at breakeven non-GAAP profitability. This will be definitely an impressive feat for a cost-pressured company like 8x8, especially in today’s recessionary environment.The impending global recession is a major risk for the company. The company’s customer churn in the small and medium business segment and especially in legacy small business VoIP customers is already high and can go even higher in the coming months. The company’s total net dollar retention, which compares monthly service revenue from the same set of clients across comparable periods, was just under 100% in the fourth quarter.At the end of the fourth quarter, small business customers with revenues less than $50 million accounted for 54% of 8x8’s ARR. In the fourth quarter, good gains and expansion of mid-market and enterprise customers were offset by churn in small businesses. The company’s net dollar retention rate for mid-market and enterprise NDR was marginally higher at just under 110% in the fourth quarter. Although the company expects this problem to resolve as it expands its mid-market and enterprise base and migrates customers to the X series platform, this risk will definitely weigh down on the stock for the next few quarters.8x8 is in a hypercompetitive space and faces pressures from other cloud communication providers of voice, chat, collaboration, contact center and communication APIs such as RingCentral (RNG), Vonage Holdings (VG), Zoom Video Communications, Fuze, Five9 (FIVN), NICE inContact, Slack (WORK), Twilio (TWLO)., and LogMeIn (LOGM). The company also competes with large communications and cloud vendors such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), Google (GOOGL), Amazon Web Services (AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT). Finally, 8x8 is also in competition with wireline business voice service players such as AT&T (T), CenturyLink (CTL), Comcast Corporation (CMCSA), and Verizon Communications (VZ) who are now launching their own cloud communication services.Then again, 8x8 has not been profitable since fiscal 2016. This reflects badly on 8x8’s management, especially when the company has been on public markets since 1997. The company’s higher operating expenses and debt-to-equity ratio as compared to peers in the technology sector also remain major risks for the company.According to finviz, the 12-month consensus target price of 8x8 is $22.60, implying an upside potential of 42.68% from its last close. The company is trading at PS (price-to-sales) multiple of 3.39x, which is definitely not cheap. However, considering the exploding demand for UCaaS services during these pandemic times, I believe that the consensus target price is a fair estimate of the growth potential of the stock in the next 12 months. Paul Singer’s Elliot Management has also added new positions in 8x8 in the first quarter.As of March 31, 2020, 8x8 had $170.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $291.5 million of long-term debt. While concerning, the debt does not seem to be so high as to impede the functioning of the company as a going concern atleast in the near or medium-term future. Further, explosive demand for its services will soon reflect in the company’s profits and cash flows, thereby improving its risk profile.Analysts have mixed opinions about the stock. On May 13, Northland analyst Michael Latimore lowered the target price to $23 from $29 but kept an Outperform rating on the shares. On May 13, B. Riley FBR analyst Josh Nichols lowered the target price to $12 from $13 and reiterated a Sell rating. On May 13, Baird analyst Josh Nichols lowered the target price to $23 from $29 but reiterated Outperform rating. On May 13, BTIG analyst Matthew VanVliet raised target price to $23 from $20 and reiterated Buy rating.Although near-term remains challenging, I believe that the company’s long-term prospects are pretty promising. In this backdrop, I believe that retail investors with above-average risk appetite and investment horizon of atleast one-two years should consider this investment in May 2020."
4348765,104952,2020-05-19T14:21:54-04:00,"Despite the shares being down ~26% due to competition concerns, we continue to see an upside potential on 8x8. The stock is a bargain at ~3.5x P/S.The shift to focus on cloud-based offerings and low touch go-to-market has been promising, though it will delay profitability. Upon the shift, 8x8 spent over 50% of revenue on marketing.Upon the major shift in 2019, the business grew 26% YoY in FY 2020, up 700 bps from the prior year.","There is an attractive long-term upside in 8x8 (EGHT), the cloud-based unified communication and contact center provider. Having launched a more flexible and unified offering, the X-series, in 2019, the company will continue focusing on a more scalable and higher-velocity go-to-market approach. With that in mind, the rest of 2020 will be the major test of this strategy.As the shift seems to prioritize SMB-driven growth, it also appears that the test will happen at an unfortunate time, considering the uncertainties due to the COVID-19 situation. The shares are down over 26% due to the concerns around the competition and widening losses as well, though we remain bullish on the long-term opportunity and instead see this as an attractive entry point.In particular, we like the fact that 8x8 will leverage a lower touch and higher-velocity sales model going forward. The sales model has been the growth and efficiency drivers for many SaaS companies, where most of the customer onboarding happens online with little to no help at all from the inside sales representatives. With that in mind, 8x8 will be well-positioned to drive more growth from the SMBs with its $12 - $45 per user/month offerings. In Q4, we even saw strong early tractions across all segments upon the major refocus.(source: 8x8.com/live)The initiatives to support the lower touch sales model have been relevant. The company acquired Jitsi, an open-source video conferencing tool, from Atlassian (TEAM) in late 2018. Atlassian is very well-known for its successful low touch sales strategy, and as such, 8x8 would benefit from the knowledge transfer from Jitsi's team. As the company integrated Jitsi to the core 8x8 offering to launch 8x8 Express Jitsi Meet and 8x8 meetings, MAU (Monthly Active Users) reached 20 million in Q4 2020. Revenue growth also accelerated to 26%. At the same time last year, the business grew only by 19%.Despite the recent move that seems to favor onboarding more SMBs, we will expect the enterprise and mid-market customers to still drive much of the growth. Both segments grew between 55% and 79% as of Q4. There is a solid upside opportunity here, considering that many of these companies are moving away from the legacy offerings like those of Avaya (OTC:AVYA). In Q4, we have seen how sales and migration into 8x8's cloud-based X Series offering were driving the overall growth. The X Series represented 43% of the enterprise customer base as of Q4, up from 37% last quarter.Many investors may also be uncomfortable with the aggressive investments 8x8 has done to accommodate the new go-to-market strategy, which will delay profitability for some time.(source: company's 10-K)The amount it spent on sales and marketing, for instance, has steadily increased by over 30% YoY in the last two years. In 2019 alone, it spent half as much revenue in sales and marketing, which was concerning to some extent. Despite the competition from RingCentral (RNG) and also Five9 (FIVN), this level of spending is a little bit on the high side. Furthermore, having spent 2017 and 2018 with positive OCF (Operating Cash Flows), the company also burned over -$15 million in OCF in 2019. As the company already strengthened its cash position by raising over $279 million of convertible notes in 2019, there is an expectation of more aggressive investments going forward. At the moment, the current cash level is already 7x - 8x higher than it was pre-2019.At the current ~3.5x P/S, 8x8 remains a bargain given the similarity of its cloud offering to that of RingCentral and Five9. Despite being twice as large as 8x8, RingCentral is even the fastest-growing stock in the peer group. It also has the best level of sales efficiency as its ~74% gross margin is far ahead of its peers. Furthermore, Five9 has a similar size, sales efficiency, and growth to 8x8 despite trading at a much higher premium at ~18x P/S.(source: stockrow)Five9, however, also has a solid cloud contact center offering with many well-known customers onboard. The giant Avaya, on the other hand, continues to get disrupted by these offerings as it trades at less than 1x P/S and offers little to no growth prospect. In 8x8, we see a long-term upside opportunity driven by the future success of the go-to-market transformation and adoptions of X Series. As subscription revenue builds up, the business will look more like Five9 or RingCentral. Under that scenario, there is a potential for 8x8 to trade even higher than its all-time-high ~7.5x P/S."
4295708,104099,2019-10-09T09:45:30-04:00,"Since I last looked in on 8x8, the shares are down a gratifying 11%. I think there's more pain in store for investors here.The company continues to show a strongly negative correlation between revenue and net income. Additionally, the cash burn is unsustainable in my view.For those who insist on remaining bullish here, I offer what I think is a much safer alternative to outright share ownership.","Since writing my bearish piece on 8X8 Inc. (EGHT), the shares are down about 11%, against a gain of ~3% for the S&P 500. While this is gratifying on some level, at some point, even the most troubled business can be a good investment, so I thought I'd check in on the name. For those who want me to just jump to the point, I will. I think the problems that I talked about last time persist, and I think investors would be wise to sell the shares. Just like last time, though, I'll offer an alternative for people who remain bullish here.Incorporated in California in 1987 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1996, 8x8 is a leading provider of enterprise ""Software as a Services"" (SaaS) communications solutions. The company offers a proprietary cloud technology platform that allows their customers to communicate internally and to their own customers using a host of technologies (voice, video, chat, contact centers, etc.). The company sells into 150 countries, and their customers range in size from small businesses to enterprises of 10,000 employees or more. The company is focusing its marketing efforts on mid-market and enterprise customers, and in 2019, the majority of new subscriptions came from these sectors.The company is obviously far more interested in growing the technology and market share and less interested in profitability. From page 38 of their latest 10-K:I take from this that investors shouldn't expect profitability any time soon, in spite of the huge size and potential for this market. What is interesting to me is the fact that this communications ""inflection"" that started two years ago will persist for several years. One of the reasons I like copy produced by technology companies is that they never disappoint in their use of business buzz terms like ""inflection point""... that takes years, apparently. Anyway, the continued ""de-emphasis"" on profitability continues to be seen in the financial results here.The issues that I raised in my first article on this company persist. Specifically, revenue and net income remain unmoored. It seems that the more the company sells, the more it loses. In fact, I ran a regression on revenue and net income and found a strong negative correlation between revenue and net income (r=-.84). This prompts some obvious question: if growing sales don't lead to profitability, what does? What will it take to make this company profitable? Management has seen massive growth from this oddly extended ""inflection point"", but losses are greater than ever. What will happen to reverse this trend?Zeroing in on the most recent quarter offers no hope in my view, as the situation persists. In spite of a 16% growth in revenue from the same period in 2018, net loss exploded 123% relative to the same period a year ago.Source: Company filingsThe item of greatest concern to me is the cash burn on display here. By way of background, on February 19, 2019, the company sold $287.5 million in convertible notes due in 2024. Of course, these are potentially dilutive (each $1,000 face value converts to 38.9484 shares for a price of $25.68 per share), but that's not the point I'm concerned about at the moment. What's concerning is what the company's cash position would look like in the absence of this sale. Ceteris paribus and absent this injection of $287.5 million eight months ago, the company would have ~$9 million in cash and short-term investments. This is troubling in light of the fact that cash declined by ~$50 million over the past three months. Obviously, the company may find buyers for more of its securities. In my view, though, a company that relies on external financing has a greater level of risk than average and investors should be compensated for that risk with a low multiple on the shares.I've droned on often enough about the need to look at stocks as things distinct from the underlying business that my regular readers must be growing tired of hearing it. My apologies, but the point must be made. The stocks that trade in the public markets are moved up and down by a host of factors that have nothing to do with the health of the underlying business. For that reason, I need to spend some time looking at the stock as a thing distinct from the business. In particular, I want to see how risky the shares are, based on the ratio of price to earnings or cash flow or some other measure of economic value. I think the risk embedded in the shares can be summarized in two charts, the history of free cash flow per share here and the price paid for each unit of free cash.Source: GurufocusThe above graph shows the history of free cash flow at this firm. In spite of generating free cash flow for years, the quarter showed negative cash flow not seen since the tech meltdown 19 years ago.Source: GurufocusIt seems that even when the company was generating positive free cash flow, the market bid shares up to levels higher than those during the dot com mania. In my view, this is the definition of a risky stock. That would be troublesome for a company that generates consistent profits. In my view, it's unacceptable for a company with this financial profile.There'll be tech speculators who are comfortable owning these shares because of the hope they represent. They'll assume that I'm closed-minded or that I'm less optimistic about the 8x8 X Series than I should be. My view is that investing is about minimizing risk, which involves using as little capital as possible to achieve the same result. I think the soundness of this strategy was borne out subsequent to my previous article. In my previous article on the company, I recommended people switch out their shares at the price they were trading at the time (~$22.25) and replace them with the November 2018 call with a strike of $25. These were trading at the time for ~$1.15. My contention at the time was that paying $115 for the upside that may happen post-earnings was by definition less risky than exposing $2,225 of capital. The market was disappointed, and the shares eventually dropped by ~25% to $16.60. The calls obviously expired worthless, but losing this $115 while keeping $2,100 safe would have been preferable in my view to simply shaving $565 off the value of the stock.In fairness, it could be said that a holder of the shares would simply have to wait for them to recover in price, but, in my view, this is somewhat of an abuse of history. We know now that the shares recovered, but it wasn't obvious at the time. They may well have fallen further. Also, if someone had faith in a recovery once the shares hit the $16 mark, they could have bought calls with a lower strike price while keeping most of their capital safe. In another life, I was an investment adviser. In my time in that job, I came across dozens of clients who had many ""long-term"" investments that were, in truth, short-term investments that had gone bad. 8x8 may well have been one of these.For those interested in reducing risk again, my suggestion is to switch out of the shares and into the May 2020 8x8 call with a strike of $22.5. These are currently bid-asked at $1.20 to $1.90. If an investor simply takes the ask here, they will get most of the upside over the next 7 months for about 10% of the risk. In my view, this is the best risk-reward available to investors here, given that there's no foregone dividend here.I think 8x8 Inc. is the future of profitable investing in SaaS communications, and it always will be. The company is burning cash at an alarming rate, and the negative relationship between sales and net income persists. Additionally, the last time the company generated free cash, the shares traded at all-time highs on a price to free cash basis. Given that the shares are currently trading at the same levels we saw during the dot com mania, it's safe to call these shares overvalued in my view. I think investors who remain interested here would be wise to switch to the much less risky alternative of call options."

I recommend avoiding, but if you insist on being long, calls are the way to go.","In the 260 or so days since I wrote a bearish piece on 8x8 Inc. (EGHT), the shares are down about 21% against a gain of ~2% for the S&P 500. While that’s gratifying on some level, I should look into this company again to see if now’s the time to buy. After all, a company trading at $15.50 is a much less risky investment than that same company when it was trading at $19.50. I’ll examine whether the financial problems I pointed out previously have been solved and will also look at the valuation. For those who can stand neither the suspense nor my writing, I’ll jump right to the point. The problems I cited in my earlier article linger, and for that reason I think investors would be wise to avoid this name. At the same time, there have been times when I’ve been wrong (I was as shocked as you when I discovered it, dear reader), and this may be one of them. For people who insist on staying long, I think call options make a great alternative to outright share ownership, in spite of their risks.I sometimes try to not sound like a broken record, because my chief purpose in life is to be as entertaining to you as possible, dear reader. This company leaves me little opportunity to get creative, though, as the song remains very much the same. Notably, the strong negative relationship between sales and net income lingers. Specifically, for the years 2014-2020, there is an incredibly strong negative relationship (r=-.92) between revenue and net income. This prompts the obvious question, “if growing sales at a CAGR of 19% doesn’t lead to profitability, what will?” For those readers who eschew accrual accounting on the naive belief that “cash is king”, I’d point out that the disconnect between revenue and cash from operations is even stronger (2017-2020 r=-.97).While on the subject of cash from operations, I should point out that CFO has been progressively worse for the past two years. This, in spite of the fact that the firm can “add back” real economic costs like amortization of software to the tune of $19 million. So, even in a (fictional) world where software doesn’t depreciate, the company fails to generate positive cash from operations.I’d be happy to concede that sales growth here has been impressive, having grown at a CAGR of about 19% for years. That’s an impressive feat, and I think it’s one of the primary reasons why investors buy this name. One thing that’s grown even faster than sales, though, is stock-based compensation. Total stock-based compensation has grown at a CAGR of about 37.5% since 2014 and stock-based compensation per employee has grown at a CAGR of about 15% over the same time period.I think the significantly unprofitable growth this company has experienced over the past several years raises questions about the viability of the business. For that reason, I want to spend some time writing about the size and timing of various cash outflows against current resources. In the following table, I’ve compiled a list of the size and timing of future cash flows here, dear reader. You’re welcome. The point of this exercise is not to be particularly precise. The point here is to understand which of the next few years will be the most onerous from a financial point of view. Please note that the figure for PP&E additions is just an average of the past three years. There’s no reason to assume that this is a precise figure. Lease expenses and the details of the senior notes are much more precise, though.Source: Latest 10-KAgainst these obligations, the company has about $137,400 in cash. This suggests to me that the firm has sufficient resources to cover significant business expenses over the next three years. For that reason, I don’t think there’s risk of a solvency crisis here before the company needs to return to the well. That said, I think the company will need to raise more debt of capital from creditors or shareholders to keep the lights on. The good news is that the company is a few years away from needing to do that.Source: Company filingsIt seems to me that this is a company that has generated very compelling revenue growth and not much else for the shareholder. The company has a relatively large cash hoard at the moment, and I think that’s the saving grace here. The company has sufficient resources in order to meet upcoming obligations. Thus, I think there are significant problems here, but there is very little risk of the firm shuttering in my view. I think a troubled business like this one can be a great investment at the right price, and so I’m going to next explore whether or not the stock is compelling.In my opinion, a great company can be a terrible investment if the investor overpays, and a troubled company like this one can be a great investment if the shares are cheap enough. In my previous article on 8x8, I “went on about” the fact that price to free cash flow had been bid up to very manic dotcom levels. Unfortunately, free cash flow is a distant memory for this company and I must rely on another measure of value. With the stock trading at about 3.5 times sales, I would admit that the shares are trading on the low end of that range, per the following:Data by YChartsSimilar results happen when we look at the company through the (very forgiving) lens of enterprise value to revenue. The problem, of course, is that revenue does not lead to profits here as we’ve seen.My regular readers know that I like to compare the ratio of price to some measure of economic value like earnings, free cash flow and the like. The lower the ratio, the greater the profit potential, and the lower the risk. The problem in this case is that there’s no measure of economic value (apart from sales) to compare to price. This leaves us revenue, and that’s a poor measure of value in my estimation.I need to present two conclusions at this point in the article. First, I would not buy this stock at current prices because I think the company is fundamentally broken (i.e., the more it sells, the more it loses), and the stock is ridiculously expensive. That said, I’ve been wrong about such companies in the past, and it’s possible that these shares will rise in price in spite of the very compelling arguments I make. I must therefore hold out the possibility that these shares will rise in price, and I’m sure there are some bulls out there who are optimistic about the future here. Second, I think investing well involves minimizing risk as much as possible, and a component of risk minimization involves using as little capital as possible to achieve the same results.Given the above, I think investors who insist on staying long here should consider call options in lieu of shares. If the shares rally, the owner of call options will benefit just like shareholders. If, as I suspect, the shares continue to fall, the call holder will be out, but may be out far less than the stockholder.At the moment, my preferred surrogate for shares would be the February 2021 call with a strike of $15. These are currently bid-asked at $3-$4.20. If an investor simply takes the bid on these calls, they will continue to own this stock and will benefit from most upside, but will have only ~28% of the capital committed. I think call options as replacement for stocks presents investors with a potential win-win trade. If the shares rally, the investor participates in most upside. If, on the other hand, the shares drop, the call option will drop, but may drop far less than the stock itself.There are no free lunches, though, and call options are no exception. There are certainly risks associated with buying calls that the stockholder doesn’t face. Specifically, calls have finite lives and stocks are (theoretically) permanent. It’s possible for the stock to remain just below the strike price for the next nine months, and the stockholder would be indifferent, and the call buyer would lose 100% of their (admittedly smaller) investment. This is the primary risk here in my estimation. I think the trade still makes sense because it gives bulls access to the upside that they see, at a fraction of the cost. I think the shares are overpriced and will continue to falter. Investors who think the opposite, though, should strongly consider calls in lieu of shares. They give most of the upside for only 27% of the cost.If anything, the problems I cited in my earlier article linger and have actually gotten worse in my view. The more the company sells, the worse it seems to do. It’s now the case that the company is also generating negative cash from operations in spite of impressive sales growth. The good news is that the company has sufficient resources to fund itself for a while, but investors will at some point demand profitability from this business. At the same time, the stock is trading at reasonable valuations on a price to revenue basis, but as we’ve seen revenue seems to have very little impact on earnings, the source of all investor returns. For these reasons, I recommend that investors avoid this name. For those people who insist on staying long, I think the call options cited above are a great way to “play” the investment. These offer much of the taste at a fraction of the calories. So, I think people should continue to avoid this name. For those who disagree with me, I think switching to calls makes sense given that they can drastically reduce risk."

Free cash flow has gone negative.I assign 8x8 a neutral rating.","8x8, Inc. (EGHT) is an industry leader in Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS), unified communications and is entering new markets with two recent acquisitions. It now has a foothold in the video collaboration industry with the acquisition of Jitsi and Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS) with the recent acquisition of Wavecell.(Source: 8x8)The acquisition of Wavecell will add to 8x8's revenues by increasing the number of existing customers, providing a new product category and greater global coverage in terms of offices.(Source: 8x8)While the 8x8 product lineup looks good and the recent acquisitions make sense, I feel that 8x8’s expenses are out of control. The company is spending money as if the company was growing by leaps and bounds. But with 19% YoY growth, 8x8 isn’t growing nearly as fast as many SaaS companies, such as ServiceNow (NOW) or even its competitor in the field of cloud-based contact centers Five9 (FIVN).Simply put, 8x8 is counting its chickens before they have hatched. The company may very well achieve accelerated revenue growth in the future, but it has not done so yet. I believe that the current level of spending is high risk, given that 8x8 is nowhere close to meeting the Rule of 40 and has negative and declining free cash flow margin.For these reasons, I have to assign a neutral rating to 8x8. I will be interested to see whether 8x8 can generate enough revenue growth in the future to make this an interesting investment.When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation. Relative valuation is a concept that I recently developed that compares forward sales multiple versus estimated sales growth.It seems logical to me that high-growth companies should be valued more highly than slow-growth companies. To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value (EV)/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 78 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate"" also provided by Portfolio123.The reason for using analysts' estimates is because SaaS stocks tend to make a lot of acquisitions which can muddy the results of the scatter plot. The analyst estimates account for these acquisitions, and the estimates are updated frequently. This makes for a cleaner chart. The sales estimates, unlike EPS estimates, are usually quite accurate for most SaaS companies, except that they tend to be a little on the conservative side.I use an exponential best-fit trend line as it appears to be more appropriate than a linear trend line for this application. As sales growth goes up, the valuation goes up exponentially. The trend line was calculated using MS Excel. I consider the stocks sitting above the trend line to be overvalued, while stocks lying under the trend line are undervalued.As can be seen from this scatter plot, 8x8 is positioned well below the trend line, suggesting that its EV/forward sales are lower than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that 8x8 is undervalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.A rule of thumb often applied to software companies is the Rule of 40. This metric helps SaaS companies balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA, and others use the free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor perspective.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's revenue growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has balanced growth and cash flow and implies financial health.8x8 had YoY sales growth of approximately 19%, down from a high of 34% in 2013. Part of the decline is due to execution issues relating to the introduction of X Series to the U.S. midmarket amidst a rapidly expanding channel team.(Source: Portfolio123)8x8's free cash flow margin TTM has been steadily decreasing since 2013. Once nearly 25%, free cash flow margin is now deep in the red, sitting at -14%.(Source: Portfolio123)I expect that the free cash flow will continue to be depressed as 8x8 continues ramping up sales and marketing and also continues acquiring companies.8x8's YoY revenue growth was 19%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing twelve months was -14%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 19%-14% = 5%Since the calculation comes out much lower than 40%, I conclude that 8x8 is not in good shape financially and as an investment should be considered with caution.As an investor, you want to make sure that, if a company doesn't score well on the Rule of 40, it is at least not burning cash. Unfortunately, 8x8 is doing just that. You can tell by examining the SG&A expense relative to sales. In the case of 8x8, the SG&A expense is 84% of the total revenues. This figure is quite high for a company growing revenues of less than 20% per year.Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)Note that the SG&A expense would be somewhat higher, in fact, 94% of sales if not for an accounting maneuver, moving some sales and marketing expenses into the cost of goods sold.It appears that expenses are out of control at 8x8. In 2018, headcount increased by 25% and the company continues to ramp up sales and marketing, attracting sales specialists from companies such as inContack, Five9, and Talkdesk. The increased headcount needs to be housed, leading to a new corporate headquarters with move-in date in the first quarter of 2020.In the true spirit of SaaS, attracting new staff and retaining old involve significant stock compensation, a total of $44.5 million in fiscal 2019 alone, up significantly from fiscal 2018.(Source: 8x8)Don’t expect stock compensation to level off. It will only accelerate with the acquisition of Wavecell.8x8 is a leader in CCaaS, unified communications and now video collaboration and CPaaS due to recent acquisitions. While the products appear to be well-positioned for the various industries, 8x8 fails on the Rule of 40, and this is made worse by very high SG&A expenses plus fast declining free cash flow margin. For these reasons, I have to give 8x8 a neutral rating. It is worthwhile checking back at the end of 2019 to see if the product lineup and recent acquisitions are generating excess revenue growth.Keep an eye out for my soon-to-be-launched Digital Transformation marketplace service!"
4189480,104099,2018-07-24T11:45:28-04:00,"There is some interesting insider buying activity over the past twelve months.Unfortunately, that's the only positive I could find. There's a negative correlation between growing revenue and profitability. If growth in sales can't generate a profit, what can?I offer investors who insist on remaining long a much safer alternative.","Over the past twelve months, the shares of 8x8 Inc. (NYSE:EGHT) are up about 60%. Now, three days before the next earnings announcement, I think investors would be wise to use this opportunity to get out before an inevitable correction in the shares. At the very least it would make sense to add put options to the shares in order to ensure against what I consider to be an inevitable correction from these levels. I'll go through my reasoning below by focusing on the financial history here and by looking at the stock itself. In my view, price and value can remain unmoored for some time, often for an extended period of time, but sooner or later price and value will meet. I think investors would be wise to make preparations before that happens.Incorporated in California in 1987, and reincorporated in Delaware in 1996, 8x8 is a leading provider of enterprise cloud communication solutions. These solutions include unified communications, team collaboration, and contact center. The 8x8 Communications Cloud offers businesses a secure and reliable approach to migrating their legacy communication systems to the cloud. This allows customers to rely on a single provider for their global communications as well as customer support. 8x8 services customers in over 100 countries, ranging from small businesses to large enterprises. Prior to 2004, the vast majority of revenue derived from VOIP solutions. Today, substantially all of the revenue comes from the sale of communication services and related hardware.As has been well argued in other articles, the potential size of the company's market is enormous. The potential size of the market is enormous, obviously, but it prompts the question: if the company hasn't managed to generate profit consistently in this enormous market yet, what will it take? It's not like ""Cloud"" is a new concept.A quick review of the financial history here indicates that this is a growth company in one way and one way only. Revenue has grown at a CAGR of about 18% over the past five years. At the same time, though, loss from operations and net income have done very badly. In particular, the company has gone from generating a modest profit five years ago to a significant loss in FY 2018. In fact, it seems that revenue and net income are unmoored and that the more the company sells, the worse it does. I ran a correlation on revenue and net income and found a fairly strong (r=-.76) relationship between the two. This prompts the question if rising revenues won't lead to rising operating profits or net income, what on Earth will it take?It should also be said that the company has been diluting the shareholder base pretty dramatically over the past five years. The number of shares outstanding has grown at a CAGR of about 2.5% over the past five years.Source: Company filingsIt's all well and good for me to go on about how sluggish a company is, but a sluggish company may be an excellent investment if the price of the stock is right. For that reason, I must spill some virtual ink trying to answer the question whether this stock is reasonably valued or not. For those who can't stand the suspense, it is not.Two of the tools I use to make this determination are the price to free cash flow and a review of the assumptions embedded in stock price. In order to accomplish the latter, I turn to the excellent work produced by Professor Stephen Penman in his book ""Accounting for Value."" In this book, Penman describes how an investor can use a fairly standard finance formula, and high school algebra, to isolate the ""g"" variable that describes what the market assumes as a growth rate. Using this methodology, it seems that the market is assuming a perpetual growth rate of about 11% for these shares, which I consider to be excessively optimistic, especially given the history of ongoing losses.The following is the price to free cash flow chart for 8x8 up until this past April. I have excluded the period April to present because over the past three months, the price to free cash flow has exploded to ~5,500. Showing this graphically would blow out the y-axis, so I've excluded it. The fact that the shares have grown from ~16.25 times (on July 4, 2012) to over 5,500 today should be enough indication that they are quite expensive relative to the overall market and to their own history.Source: GuruFocusMy regular readers know that I pay a great deal of attention to what insiders are doing, the idea being that they know more than the rest of us about the future of the company. With that in mind, I should point out that two insiders (Vikram Verma and Marry Ellen Genovese) have since August 2017 bought 31,025 shares for a total of ~$438,500 (weighted average share price of ~$14.20). The shares have rallied very nicely for these insiders since then, but I can assume that they are still on the long side of the trade and that they know something I don't. I must, therefore, offer people who like this company for its future prospects with an alternative to outright share ownership. Thankfully, there's a way to do that.Central to my investing philosophy is the notion that price and value can deviate for long stretches. In my view, 8x8 is sufficient proof of this given the performance over the past year. Investors (speculators?) have bid the shares up based on revenue growth and not much else. I don't think it's wise to assume that the market will suddenly become sane, so there's a very good chance that the shares will continue to rally no matter how bad the results in a few days.I think options provide shareholders with an alternative to risking their capital with the shares. In particular, I recommend the November calls with a strike price of $25. The bid-ask on these is currently $1.05-1.15.The economics of this trade are as follows. If an investor sells their shares and takes the bid on these calls, they move their risk from $22.27 to $1.15. If the shares rally between now and November, the investor will participate in most of that upside. If they languish, the call will likely expire worthlessly. In my view, calls expiring worthless is not great but is certainly better than having the entirety of the capital exposed.To paraphrase a politician whom I find personally loathsome ""let me be clear"", I'm not suggesting that people run out and buy these calls. I'm suggesting that calls are a better alternative for people who insist on owning the shares. The best solution, in my view, would be to eschew this company entirely until price reaches a reasonable level.There is much to dislike about 8x8's investment prospects as the company prepares to announce. The company has a history of losses, yet the stock is more expensive than it's ever been because the crowd has bid the shares up on hope of a future. The one bright spot is the fact that insiders have bought over the past year. While I think much of the ""juice"" of this trade is behind us, I need to be forthright about the insider buying. In my view, it makes sense to avoid the shares at these levels. For those who insist on remaining long here, though, there is a much less risky way to accomplish that position. For 5% of the risk, such people get access to most of the upside. For everyone else, I strongly recommend avoiding this stock until price comes down to match value."

Click here to find out more »8x8’s (EGHT) stock price has fallen over 16% since the company reported its Q4 2018 earnings on May 24th, 2018. I believe that investors with a long time horizon should use this as an opportunity to buy 8x8. The company has a rapidly growing software business that is currently unprofitable due to the company’s prioritization of growth over earnings. In the long run, 8x8 should be a significantly larger and more valuable businesses than it is today. The recent pull back marks an attractive entry point for investors.Before jumping into the business description, let's quickly review 8x8's most recent earnings report. 8x8 beat on sales estimates, reporting $79m vs $77m forecast by the street, but missed on earnings, reporting EBITDA of $0.9m vs $3.2m expected (Source: Capital IQ). Finally, the market perceived the company’s guidance for FY 2019 as being light. The disappointing earnings prompted Bank of America’s research analyst to downgrade the stock from “buy” to “hold”, further exacerbating the selling pressure.8x8 is an enterprise cloud-based subscription software business which helps businesses manage communications with their customers. 8x8 integrates all business-to-customer (B2C) communications facilitated by phone call, email, and chat into an easy to use software which enables a business’s salesforce and customer support team to communicate with a unified voice. All client communications are recorded, any customer notes are stored (similar to a CRM), and analytics are provided to help businesses target and improve their customer relationships over time. You can think of 8x8 as a CRM, a help desk, a business management system, team collaboration tool, and a communications platform all rolled up into one product, potentially replacing several software subscriptions with one.Taking a step back, this is a huge market. Most mid and large-sized companies have an army of sales people and customer support reps, often siloed in different departments and different offices. The ability for these businesses to seamlessly connect all the client-facing employees with one customer tool creates a great deal of value for 8x8’s customers through more efficient management and better customer satisfaction/retention. Furthermore, to the extent that 8x8’s customers heavily integrate their sales and marketing into the platform, 8x8’s customers become very sticky because they would incur significant switching costs in the form of re-training employees and potentially losing valuable customer data in a transition. This is probably why 8x8’s monthly customer churn rate is 0.3% as of Q4 2018.According to IDC, the size of the global Unified Communication and Collaboration (NYSEARCA:UCC) software market will be $40 billion in 2018. This includes legacy telecommunications systems as well as software and cloud-based services. The big opportunity for 8x8 is to win market share from companies using legacy PBX telecommunications systems and on premise licensed UCC software as they transition to cloud-based systems. Currently, cloud has 10% penetration in the UCC market. This is the key trend driving 8x8’s historical revenue growth in excess of 20% per year since 2013.8x8 is on the leading edge of innovation in the UCC software industry. In addition to having strong cloud-based capabilities, the company has been making strategic investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop new capabilities for customers including the recent acquisition of MarianaIQ. Gartner has ranked 8x8 in its UCC “leaders” quadrant for 6 consecutive years.8x8 is currently rolling out its X Series product which began shipping in June 2018. The X Series marks the first product generation with machine learning algorithms incorporated to dynamically provide new customer insights. I believe the X Series could re-accelerate growth at the company. The company is adding significant headcount to sales and marketing teams which should result in added fuel to the growth fire. Below is a slide from the company’s Q4 2018 investor presentation highlighting some of the benefits of the X Series product.Source: Q4 investor presentation.Note: the company's fiscal year ends on March 31st. Therefore 2018 refers to the 12 month period ending on March 31, 2018.Over the past 5 years, revenue has nearly tripled, growing at a compound annual growth rate (OTC:CAGR) of 23.4%. Revenue growth has been driven by the growth of the UCC industry and the shift from using PBX and licensed software to using cloud-based software services. Revenue growth has decelerated over the past 2 years; however, the company and sell-side estimates expect revenue growth to accelerate over the next 3 years. The re-acceleration of growth will be driven by a few factors: 1) the roll-out of 8x8’s new X Series product and the significant expansion of the company’s salesforce to support it. 2) Increased adoption of cloud-based software. 3) A shift from 8x8 selling to small and mid-sized businesses towards selling to larger enterprises which overall generate greater revenue per contract (see the average revenue per business customer chart below).All the factors above point to the idea that revenue growth should continue to be strong over the next several years. The below table contains the consensus sell-side analysts forecasts for revenue growth which supports this notion. Analysts expect revenue to grow at a 24% CAGR over the next 3 years, which is a similar rate observed over the past 5 years. This may seem like a stretch to some skeptical investors but keep in mind that cloud penetration in UCC software today is only 10%, if it were to grow to 20% over the next 5 years, that would roughly translate to a 20% compound annual growth rate.Below is the average revenue per customer for all customers vs. larger customers. There is now a strategic focus in selling to larger enterprise customers.Source: Q4 investor presentation.Over the past 5 years, gross profit margins have expanded. This is being driven by a mix-shift from 8x8’s legacy VOIP equipment sales which command lower gross margin to the cloud-based software which are higher gross margin. Also helping lift margins is the average increase in revenue per customer. In 2014 the average revenue per client was $287 vs. $469 in the most recent quarter. The very high gross margin indicates that when 8x8 reaches a mature level of scale, the business will likely have very high operating margins (once SG&A and other expenses have been fully leveraged).In FY 2018, EBIT margins were negative 10.9%. This is because the company has been ramping up SG&A in order to stoke future revenue growth. In 2018, the company grew its headcount from 1,019 to 1,225 or 12% growth. In 2019, the company has guided for headcount to grow 30%. The growth in headcount is an upfront hit to earnings because the company must pay for recruiting expenses, additional leased office space, and expense any stock-based compensation used to incent new hires. The company has also been ramping up R&D which grew from $27.5m in 2017 to $34.8m in 2018.During the recent Q4 2018 call, CEO Vikram Verma discussed the rationale to accelerate hiring at the expense of current profitability:Despite the negative GAAP earnings, free cash flow has been positive. The company expensed significant stock based comp and has very low capex and working capital requirements. Because the business sells subscription software which doesn’t require physical COGS and often receives payment in advance, net working capital is a significant source of cash. This further demonstrates that 8x8 has a solid financial model that will only improve once the business achieves greater scale.Finally, the company’s balance sheet has net cash of $152m (9% of the market cap), and the company has been a net repurchaser of its outstanding stock.8x8 does not generate positive earnings and therefore cannot be valued today using a traditional multiple of earnings approach. The company currently trades for a forward revenue multiple of 4.4x. Comparing the revenue multiple to peers in the below table shows that the company is very cheap to direct peers RngCentral (RNG) and Five9 (FIVN), but relatively expense to some other peers.Revenue multiples are difficult to compare across companies because they are tied to future growth and profitability. In thinking about 8x8’s valuation more constructively, we should focus on 8x8’s future revenue and potential earnings. In 2019E, consensus analyst estimates expect 8x8’s revenue to grow to $350m. A mature software business can have EBIT margins anywhere between 20% and 60%. Given 8x8’s very high gross margins, it would not be crazy for the business at mature scale to have an EBIT margin of 40%. The S&P 500’s EV / Forward EBIT multiple is currently 15x. Putting these different elements together, we get the below illustrative valuation of 8x8 on next year’s expected revenue.However, 8x8 is clearly playing a long term game and as investors we should also be more focused on the long run. One way to think about 8x8’s longer-term earnings is to walk through its total addressable market opportunity. If the market for UCC cloud services as a percentage of the total UCC software market increases from the current 10% penetration to 20% within the next 5 years and 8x8 merely maintains its market share, then logically 8x8’s revenue will double. This rate of growth is actually supported by the company’s current growth trajectory of roughly 20% (20% compound growth over a 5 year period is roughly double). Applying the same logic for margins and valuation used in the prior example, the below illustration demonstrates that over a longer time horizon, 8x8 will most likely be worth significantly more than it is worth today.This valuation exercise isn’t precise, but I would rather be directionally accurate than precisely wrong.1) 8x8 could face greater competition in the futureAt the moment, 8x8 is a strong player in the market for unified communication and collaboration cloud software. There are a number of legacy players losing market share to 8x8 because they are not as strong in the cloud; however, over time, many of these competitors will likely develop strong products more competitive to 8x8. A mitigant to this risk is that 8x8 has been accelerating its R&D spending and has been making strategic investments in areas such as artificial intelligence. 8x8 was an early entrant into the market and in my opinion has been working very hard to maintain its technological advantages. For these reasons, 8x8 may also be an interesting acquisition target for legacy UCC software providers that want 8x8's capabilities but do not want to spend the significant R&D or directly compete with 8x8.2) 8x8 fails to execute on its growth planI am underwriting continued strong growth at 8x8 as central to my valuation estimates. I believe strong growth will continue at the company because the market is growing and 8x8 is aggressively investing in its salesforce and product development. However, if the dynamics of the market for the company's software change (for example, an increase in competition or decline in demand), growth could fall below my estimates in the future. The mitigant to this risk is that I am underwriting management's trackrecord of execution. As noted earlier, the company has achieved strong historical financial performance using a similar playbook and from what I can tell the market dynamics have not significantly changed. Therefore, I am comfortable betting on continued strong revenue growth at the company.3) 8x8 fails to achieve profitabilityIn my valuation estimates, I noted that I believe at scale the company could achieve operating margins as high as 20% or 40% at some point in the future. However, the company is currently unprofitable and may never reach the margin targets I laid out. If investors lose confidence that the company will ever be significantly profitable, then the stock's valuation will likely decline. The reason I became comfortable making the assertions that the company could become highly profitable is that it has very high and expanding gross margins and has significant growth ahead of it which will allow the company to better leverage its fixed costs.In conclusion, I believe investors should use the recent decline in 8x8’s share price after the disappointing earnings report to buy the stock. 8x8 has an attractive software business in a vertical experiences very strong secular tailwinds. The recent earnings and current valuation may scare short-term investors, but long term investors will be rewarded so long as the company continues to execute on its plan."
4001536,24157,2016-08-23T11:47:19-04:00,"8x8’s economic earnings have declined from $1 million in 2011 to -$16 million in 2016 and to -$18 million TTM.8x8’s return on invested capital (ROIC) has fallen from 12% in 2011 to a bottom quintile -3% TTM.Meanwhile, EGHT is up 20% YTD without a subsequent increase in the fundamentals of EGHT’s business, which makes shares greatly overvalued.","As non-GAAP earnings grow ever more prevalent in the market, despite the SEC stepping up scrutiny, investors are left in a mess of non-comparable metrics that provide little insight into the economics of a business. The non-GAAP problem is amplified when executives fully embrace the reporting practice, are paid on non-GAAP, and measure the success of the firm based on non-GAAP. This week's Danger Zone is a company that claims consistent profitability and continued success, despite years of shareholder value destruction. Misleading non-GAAP results, large losses, and an overvalued stock price land 8x8 (NYSE:EGHT) in the Danger Zone.Revenue Growth Masks Profit Decline8x8's economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business, have declined from $1 million in 2011 to -$16 million in 2016 and to -$18 million over the last twelve months (TTM). This decline comes despite revenue growing from $70 million in 2011 to $209 million in 2016, or 24% compounded annually. Figure 1 highlights the disconnect between revenue and economic earnings. See the reconciliation of 8x8's GAAP net income to economic earnings here.Figure 1: Economic Earnings Fall While Revenue RisesSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsFundamental problems can be seen across multiple facets of the business. 8x8's return on invested capital (ROIC) has fallen from 12% in 2011 to a bottom quintile -3% TTM. The company's after-tax profit (NOPAT) margins have declined from 9% in 2011 to -2% TTM. Lastly, 8x8 has burned through cumulative $73 million in free cash flow since 2011.The clear deterioration of operations is caused by 8x8's aggressive spending. Since 2011, while revenue has grown 24% compounded annually, R&D, Sales & Marketing, and General & Administrative costs have grown 38%, 28%, and 40% compounded annually respectively. Cost of revenues has grown 20% compounded annually over the same time. Revenues are growing quickly, but slower than expenses.Executive Compensation Leads to Shareholder Value DestructionExecutives at 8x8, apart from base salaries, receive annual cash bonuses and long-term equity awards. The annual cash bonuses are paid out based upon the achievement of target non-GAAP pre-tax net income and organic recurring service revenue goals. Non-GAAP pre-tax net income has a long list of items that are removed to calculate the metric, including acquisition costs and stock based compensation. Executives are incentivized by metrics that lead to shareholder value destruction. Further shifting executive interests away from those of shareholders, 8x8's long-term equity awards vest upon the achievement of total shareholder return relative to the Russell 2000. Incentivizing executives with stock price can be ill-fated, as business decisions can be made only to drive stock short-term stock price appreciation with little regard to the long-term economic success of the business.The best way to create shareholder value, and align executives with the best interest of shareholders, is to tie performance bonuses to ROIC because there is a clear correlation between ROIC and shareholder value.Non-GAAP Income Rises While Economic Earnings FallThe dangers of non-GAAP metrics can sneak up on investors who trust management's non-GAAP metrics. In fact, in the company's 1Q17 earnings conference call, 8x8's CEO states, ""For the 25th consecutive quarter, 8x8 remains profitable on a non-GAAP basis."" Later in the call, the company's CFO states ""We're good stewards of the shareholders' money. We have been profitable now for 25 consecutive quarters."" While true on their face, those statements do not reflect shareholders' best interests. Here are some of the expenses EGHT has removed to calculate its non-GAAP net income:It's not hard to be ""profitable"" when removing so many standard costs of running a business. These costs have a material impact on 8x8's financials, particularly stock-based compensation. In 2016, EGHT removed $16 million in stock-based compensation to calculate its non-GAAP net income. Similarly in 2015, the company removed $9 million in stock-based compensation, which was nearly five times greater than GAAP net income. By removing this large expense, along with others, 8x8 reports non-GAAP metrics that are much better than economic earnings. Non-GAAP net income grew from $7 million in 2011 to $15 million in 2016, or 16% compounded annually. Meanwhile economic earnings declined from $1 million in 2011 to -$16 million in 2016, per Figure 2.Figure 2: EGHT's Misleading Non-GAAP IncomeSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsLacking Profitability In A Fragmented MarketThe cloud service industry is highly fragmented. Within the cloud industry, the unified communications industry hosts numerous firms all offering similar products, but with vastly different financial profiles. 8x8 faces competition from cloud based communication providers such as RingCentral (NYSE:RNG), InContact, (NASDAQ:SAAS), and Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN). Other communication providers that also offer collaboration software include Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Lastly, 8x8 faces competition from incumbent telecommunication and/or hardware providers such as AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and Mitel (NASDAQ:MITL).8x8 is at a significant competitive disadvantage due to its low profitability. Per Figure 3, 8x8 has a higher NOPAT margin and ROIC than only one competitor, InContact. Such low, and negative, profitability leaves EGHT with little to no pricing power while spending unsustainable amounts of money to win business, as noted earlier. Companies can sacrifice margins in the short-term to boost revenue growth, but long-term, a firm with relatively limited pricing power is at the mercy of competitors who are so much more profitable.Figure 3: 8x8's Profitability Falls Below Almost All CompetitorsSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsBull Hopes Imply First Mover Advantage Holds TrueAs with most new cloud companies, the case for investing in EGHT revolves around its ability to reach critical mass, supplant the incumbents, grow into the large communications market, become profitable, or any combination of the above. 8x8 is not an upstart hoping to break through. The company has been accumulating losses for over two decades.When 8x8 fully began fully integrating its current product lineup of unified communication products, contact center, and cloud offerings, one could argue the firm had a strong first mover advantage. Cisco was still focusing largely on its equipment based enterprise communications, and cloud offerings were still a ""new"" feature. Since then, Cisco has moved to rapidly adopt cloud integration, Microsoft has moved numerous services into the cloud and ramped up its communications business, and many competitors have created or improved cloud services. While 8x8 may have had a multi-year head start, that first mover advantage has rapidly eroded (see profitability above) as competition has entered the market.Further casting doubt on EGHT's ability to meet the expectations baked into its stock price, the firms aggressive spending doesn't appear to be slowing down. Year-over-year R&D and sales & marketing expense has outpaced YoY revenue growth for the past three years, while YoY general & administrative expense outpaced YoY revenue growth in two of the past three years. In order to grow the top line at rates that meet market expectations, EGHT is sacrificing the bottom line and masking that sacrifice behind non-GAAP numbers.Most alarming, the current share price already implies that EGHT is and will be wildly profitable for many years into the future. Given the litany of competition, EGHT's current negative profitability, and the spending required to now fight large incumbents, it's clear EGHT faces an uphill battle.The largest risk to the bear case is what we call ""stupid money risk"", which is higher in today's low growth (organic) environment. Another firm could step in and acquire EGHT at a value that is much higher than the current market price. As we'll show below, only in the event a firm is willing to destroy shareholder value is EGHT worth more than its current share price.Would A Competitor Acquire EGHT?The biggest risk to our thesis is that an outside firm acquires EGHT at a value at or above today's price. If the deterioration of operations above wasn't enough, we'll show below that EGHT is not an attractive acquisition target unless a buyer is willing to destroy significant shareholder value.To begin, EGHT has liabilities of which investors may not be aware that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest.After adjusting for this liability we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, EGHT is worth less than the current share price.Figures 4 and 5 show what we think Cisco should pay for EGHT to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. Cisco, along with many other tech giants, is rapidly expanding its cloud offerings and acquiring EGHT could allow the combined firms additional cross selling opportunities and a greater sales footprint. However, there are limits on how much CSCO would pay for EGHT to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT or free cash flows being acquired.Each implied price is based on a 'goal ROIC' assuming different levels of revenue growth. In each scenario, the estimated revenue growth rate in year one equals the consensus estimate for 2017 (21%). For the subsequent years, we use 21% in scenario one because it represents a continuation of 2017 expectations. We use 25% in scenario two because it assumes a merger with Cisco could create additional revenue opportunities.We conservatively assume that Cisco can grow EGHT's revenue and NOPAT without spending on working capital or fixed assets. We also assume EGHT achieves a 10% NOPAT margin, which is the average of Cisco and 8x8's current NOPAT margins. For reference, EGHT's TTM NOPAT margin is -2%, so this assumption implies drastic and immediate improvement, but allows the creation of a truly best case scenario.Figure 4: Implied Acquisition Prices For CSCO To Achieve 7% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Figure 4 shows the 'goal ROIC' for CSCO as its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) or 7%. Even if 8x8 can grow revenue by 24% compounded annually with a 10% NOPAT margin for the next five years, the firm is not worth more than its current price of $14/share. Assuming the 24% scenario is a best-case view, Cisco would destroy nearly $175 million by purchasing EGHT at its current valuation. It's also worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 7% ROIC would be only value neutral and not accretive, as the return on the deal would equal CSCO's WACC.Figure 5: Implied Acquisition Prices For CSCO To Achieve 17% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Figure 5 shows the next 'goal ROIC' of 17%, which is CSCO's current ROIC. Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to CSCO shareholders. Even in the best-case growth scenario, the most Cisco should pay for EGHT is $5/share (62% downside). Assuming this best-case scenario, Cisco would destroy nearly $680 million by purchasing EGHT at its current valuation. Any scenario below 24% CAGR would result in further capital destruction. Furthermore, any deal above $5/share would lower CSCO's ROIC, thereby destroying shareholder value.As A Standalone Firm, Shares Are OvervaluedEGHT is up 20% year-to-date and 75% over the past two years, which easily surpasses the S&P's gains over the same time frames. This price appreciation without a subsequent increase in the fundamentals of EGHT's business has left shares significantly overvalued. To justify the current price of $14/share, EGHT must achieve 5% pretax margins (average since 2011, compared to -3% TTM) and grow revenue by 25% compounded annually for the next 15 years. In this scenario, EGHT would be generating nearly $6 billion in revenue 15 years from now, which is greater than highly profitable companies like Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) last fiscal year revenue.Even if we assume EGHT can achieve 5% pretax margins and grow revenue by 16% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is only worth $4/share today - a 71% downside.Each of these scenarios also assumes the company is able to grow revenue and NOPAT without spending on working capital or fixed assets, an assumption that is unlikely, but allows us to create a very optimistic scenario. For reference, EGHT's invested capital has grown on average $19 million yearly (9% of 2016 revenue) over the past five yearsCatalyst: EGHT's Revenue Growth Façade DisappearsThe market has proven time and time again that it's willing to overlook losses as long as revenue growth soars. Management teams recognize and exploit this trend to distract investors from poor economics/cash flow. Nevertheless, the market is not willing to overlook losses forever and when momentum tech/cloud type stocks like EGHT run out of steam, the resulting damage can be drastic.As shown above, even in the most optimistic scenarios, the profit growth already baked into EGHT remains overly optimistic. Any slip up in top line growth or cracks in the growth story will lead investors to re-evaluate and could result in EGHT's valuation sinking to more rational levels.Another, albeit smaller, concern is the overall health of the global economy. Firms may be less willing to undergo shifts in their communication structure while economic growth remains low.Instability across Europe could provide headwinds to EGHT's business operations, as the company has expanded operations to the region in recent years (2% of sales in 2014 compared to 12% of sales in 2016). Any prolonged issues related to the ""Brexit"" or other financial woes could further impact margins, which are already negative.Insider Action and Short Interest Is LowOver the past 12 months 57 thousand insider shares have been purchased and 132 thousand have been sold for a net effect of 75 thousand insider shares sold. These sales represent <1% of shares outstanding. Additionally, there are 2.5 million shares sold short, or just over 3% of shares outstanding.Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic AccountingIn order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and a real shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to 8x8's 2016 10-K:Income Statement: we made $4 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing $2 million in non-operating expenses (1% of revenue). We removed $3 million related to non-operating expenses and $1 million related to non-operating income. See all adjustments made to EGHT's income statement here.Balance Sheet: we made $273 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $140 million. The most notable adjustment was $50 million (18% of net assets) related to asset write-downs. See all adjustments to EGHT's balance sheet here.Valuation: we made $200 million of adjustments with a net effect of increasing shareholder value by $112 million. The largest adjustment was the addition of $156 million (13% of market cap) due to excess cash. Despite increasing shareholder value, EGHT remains overvalued.Dangerous Funds That Hold EGHTThe following funds receive our Dangerous-or-worse rating and allocate significantly to 8x8.This article originally published here on August 15, 2016.Disclosure: David Trainer and Kyle Guske II receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme."
4251692,21815,2019-03-29T00:33:53-04:00,"The company is shifting its customers to its new X Series platform, which has good potential.However, it had to invest a lot in the platform and botched the mid-market introduction, which is causing delays and bad headline numbers.The potential is there, but it will only materialize gradually. This stock is for investors with a longer time horizon.","8x8 Inc. (EGHT) offers a state-of-the-art integrated unified customer communications platform that has a bright future given the shift to the cloud. But enormous investments in sales and research and a partly botched introduction is holding the shares back, and we expect this cloud to lift only gradually.8x8, Inc. provides enterprise cloud communications and customer engagement solutions. It offers unified communications, team collaboration, conferencing, contact center, analytics, and other services to various business customers on a SAAS model. The company provides:The company integrates its services with third-party applications and platforms, including enterprise resource planning, customer relations management, human capital management, and other proprietary application suites. It markets its services to end-users through direct sales organization, website, and channel partners.Here is our usual longer-term (five year) perspective which sees impressive revenue growth but operations turning south the last year, at least in GAAP (which includes acquisition cost from Jitsi), and this is a little concerning.Data by YChartsThe market is converging on integrated cloud platform offerings, hence the company has integrated its solutions described above into one new platform, the X Series. From the Q3CC:This chimes with the evolution in the market towards these kinds of integrated platforms, for instance, CCaaS (contact center as a service) or UCaaS (unified communications as a service), according to Gartner. From the earnings deck:Management also argued that the introduction of the X Series increased the company's win rate against major competitors from one out of three to two out of three. Why is this, one might wonder? Well (from the Q3CC):Some of the capabilities of the new platform (from the earnings deck):The advantage of cloud platforms is that they are easy to expand and tend to become veritable Swiss army knives. We think the X Series is no exception, with the company embarking on AI features enabling customers to gain actionable insights from customer data, and also adding new capabilities through acquisitions.The company acquired Jitsi, an open source video communications technology from Atlassian (TEAM). Jitsi adds to the company’s video collaboration capabilities on its X Series platform.The company underwhelmed on its service revenue growth, which is well below the promised 25% basically as a result of two issues:With respect to the first, management had this to say (from the Q3CC):With respect to the second, management argued (from the Q3CC):Or, more precisely (from the Q3CC):The big growth push is supposed to come from this new integrated platform X Series which is out since July, but the company botched some parts of the introduction, perhaps introducing it a bit too hastily. How serious are these problems? (from the Q3CC):According to management, it takes 4-6 months to fix. The problem was exclusive for the mid-market segment; for enterprise and small companies there were no problems, and that compensated for some of the downdraft from mid-market. What did the company do to fix the mid-market problem (from the Q3CC):On a more positive note, the company did acquire many new channel partners for the mid-market segment, so when these tooting problems get ironed out completely we see perhaps the pent-up demand materialize.Ultimately (when the snags are ironed out), the X Series should be a boon to booking, as it actually eases implementation and offers more value.The X Series was designed to make migration for existing customers easily. This hasn't really started, but it will happen over the next 4-6 quarters. This is also a non-trivial up-sell opportunity, as it adds more features for customers.On the other hand, management also argued that the migration ""gives customers additional features for comparable prices,"" which seems to limit the opportunity for up-selling.International sales are just over 10% of revenues, but with the move to the X Series, management argues that they are double that in new bookings, so this seems to help their international expansion.From the earnings deck:And from the earnings PR:The guidance including DXI and taking out the constant currency is 18-19%, which disappointed investors, as it is well short of the 25% target the company set itself.In principle, the shift towards X Series should boost gross margin and service margin, but this isn't yet visible in the figures. Perhaps it will come with greater adoption. What is rising nicely is ARPU:If you go back to the first figure in this article, with the five-year overview you saw a considerable operational deterioration in the five quarters, indeed:Data by YChartsBasically, the company has been pulling out all the stops in terms of spending on R&D and sales on the X Series. Since we have no 2020 guidance yet, we'll have to make do with the Q4 2019 guidance, which seems to announce a slight improvement with non-GAAP S&M rising at a slightly lower rate (19%) than revenue.R&D seems to still move up, and there is a little leverage from G&A, which was only up 4% y/y in Q3, but that's small, as it's only 9% of revenue. So, the best we can see is stabilization for Q4.We surmise some improvement is in the cards when the mid-market problems have been sorted out and revenue growth accelerates towards its intermediate 25% target, but the extent of this remains very much to be seen.8X8 Inc. doesn't really have any debt, so it's not likely to run out of cash anytime soon, which made it somewhat surprising that the company recently embarked on issuing $250 million of senior notes. From the PR:Share-based compensation has grown considerably, but has not yet had much effect on the share count:Data by YChartsThe company has a $25 million buyback program, and the CEO himself bought on the open market last year.Data by YChartsAnalysts don't expect profits anytime soon, seeing EPS of -$0.21 this year and -$0.15 the next. With the shares trading at over 5x sales, we are inclined to argue that there isn't much upside from a valuation multiple perspective.The stock has largely moved sideways for a while:We're fairly sure that 8X8 Inc. has a market-leading product in the form of its X Series platform. However, it botched part of the introduction, which threw the company back two quarters in terms of where it wants to be with bookings and growth.Then, there are the really sizable investments it made in research and sales to get the X Series off the ground.We're fairly sure there is a considerable payback on these investments, but it will take time to get the operational leverage going again. The company didn't actually produce much guidance on this, so we're a little in the dark here.Assuming the company gets its mid-market problems sorted and growth indeed accelerates a little, there will be upside for the shares, but it very much depends on how quick and how strongly operational leverage will kick in.So, we'll expect a gradual improvement of the share price, but nothing dramatic."
3981678,101615,2016-06-13T12:01:01-04:00,"8x8 will report Q1 earnings on July 22nd.The stock increased by over 12% in May, putting more pressure on the company to meet earnings expectations.After years of consistent revenue growth, 8x8 still cannot grow earnings. If this trend continues and they maintain a conservative balance sheet, they could be in for some trouble.","IntroductionFor those who are not familiar with 8x8 Inc. (Nasdaq:EGHT), the company was founded in 1987. Their main competitors in the industry are Cogent Communications (Nasdaq:CCOI), Consolidated Comms Hldgs (Nasdaq:CNSL), Frontier Communications (Nasdaq:FTR), and most of all, Vontage Holdings (NYSE:VG).Th company has about 810 employees and is in the communication services sector of the telecom services industry. They provide cloud communication solutions internationally. 8x8 was originally branded as a residential VIOP company, but after getting beaten badly by Vontage in the space, they transitioned into networked communications.Despite lackluster value metrics, 8x8 has outperformed its peers consistently over the past five years. The company will be reporting earnings in a week, and after a stellar May in which the stock gained 12.6%, they will have to produce good numbers to justify the current valuation.EGHT data by YChartsFinancials8x8 Inc. reported revenue of 209.34M for the past 12 months, which came out to be 0.6554 per share. Their Q4 revenue was 31% higher than the same quarter the previous year. Hence the spike in price after their Q4 announcement. This quarter, the company logged a net income of -5.12M. Looking forward, the consensus EPS long-term growth rate is 17.89%. CFO May Ellen Genovese projects TTM revenue growth of 20% while maintaining current net margins.As of right now, 8x8 Inc.'s P/E ratio is negative, compared with the industry average of 16.82, but we may see a significant change in share price depending on the results of the earnings announcement. The shares posted a 52-week high in June this year. Over the past 12 months, 8x8 Inc. has an ROE of -1.88%, an ROA of -1.69%, and an operating margin of -3.38%. Compare this to industry averages of 14.17%, 4.12%, and 14.64%, respectively. This quarter, 8x8's R&D expenditure increased by 59%, a positive sign for the young company.EGHT data by YChartsMuch of the market is dominated by Vontage, whose 227 million in revenue and ~3.5% net margin last quarter continued their trend of consistent growth. Vontage has been growing at about 3-4% annually. 8x8, on the other hand, has experienced tremendous growth over the past five years. The price has tripled in that time frame, reflecting their perceived growth potential. The industry as a whole has a great deal of potential for growth.EGHT data by YChartsThe main problem I have with 8x8 is that despite growing revenue quarter after quarter, the company still cannot manage to turn a profit. Much of this is due to the company's reluctance to leverage their excellent balance sheet and take on more risk. I just think the company is being too conservative and won't be able to profit on an international level unless they take advantage of economies of scale.EGHT data by YChartsEarnings Announcement8x8 Inc. is scheduled to report earnings after market close on 7/22/2016. Consensus estimates have the company on the hook for 0.03 per share on revenues of 57.92M. This will be an increase of 148% over this past quarter's -0.0623 per share if the estimates are correct.This company does not seem to be trading cheap going into earnings. With an earnings yield of -0.45%, continuing ops earning yield of -0.42%, adjusted cash earnings yield of 0.32%, no dividends, and a market cap to sales ratio of 5.883, 8x8 ranks in the bottom 10th percentile in value metric across the board. The only brighter spot is the book to market ratio of 0.2235.However, the company does have very strong fundamentals. 8x8 has positive revenue growth, a five-year ROE of 22.81% (coupled with long term debt < 5x average net income), average cash flow of 11.27 over the past 10 years, a current ratio of 5.352, and a D/E ratio of 0.1386.Out of 10 analysts covering the stock, eight rate this stock a buy and two a hold. I am more comfortable in the $10-12 range. What I do like about this company is that they have recently shifted into more long-term contracts, providing shareholders a bit more predictability.What I don't like is that they have not proven that they will scale to the point where their business will be profitable. Revenue growth without EPS growth is not attractive, especially at the current price."
4321118,35181,2020-02-04T04:24:50-05:00,"After recent acquisitions, 8x8 now has a video collaboration solution and CPaaS for the Asian market.8x8 has strong new bookings but is somewhat higher than forward guidance.8x8 fails on the Rule of 40 and has a significant cash burn that appears to be getting worse with time. Free cash flow has gone very negative.","In my last article on 8x8, Inc. (EGHT), I gave the company a neutral rating based on the high level of cash burn and negative free cash flow that seems to keep dropping with time. On the bright side, 8x8 is apparently experiencing strong ARR growth of 34%.The mid-market and enterprise market have combined growth of 63% YoY growth in ARR.Despite the strong growth, forward guidance is for 26% to 27% revenue growth. Fair enough, SaaS companies tend to be conservative in their estimates and ARR growth does lead to revenue growth.The bigger worry that I have is the cost of achieving growth. 8x8 is offering incentives and this will drive down margins even further than they are at present.The gross margin has already taken a big hit with the recent acquisitions, tumbling from 81% down to 68%, albeit with increased revenues.(Source: Portfolio123)The company's SG&A expense margin which is almost 90% is very concerning. NOTE: The SG&A expense margin includes R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)The SG&A expense margin has been steadily rising since 2012. The company is now spending 90% of revenue on SG&A and R&D expenses. This invariably leads to share dilution or cash-raising exercises such as the recent $75 million convertible note issue.Given the above issues, including a high level of cash burn and a very negative free cash flow margin, I am going to retain my neutral rating for 8x8.When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the software company ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation, a concept that I recently developed that compares forward sales multiple versus estimated sales growth.8x8's annual revenue growth is 20%, fairly consistent with its 5-year growth rate of 22%.(Source: Portfolio123)For the purpose of calculating the Rule of 40, I am going to use 26.5%, the mid-point of guidance for the coming year.8x8's free cash flow margin TTM has plummeted in 2019, going from positive 10% down to almost negative 25%.(Source: Portfolio123)This is something I don't like to see in any potential investment.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40 - some analysts use EBITDA and others use free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin TTM.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows - If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the software company has growth and cash flow in balance and is considered financially healthy. In 8x8's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 26.5% -25% = 1.5%The calculation comes out well below 40%, indicating that 8x8 has a lot of work ahead of it in order to balance growth and profits.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated Y-o-Y sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated Y-o-Y sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, 8x8 is positioned well below the best-fit line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is extremely undervalued relative to its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate.The Sales/EV multiple tells me that the stock is quite undervalued, but my value assessment changes when I substitute next year's earnings estimates for forward sales.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The results shown on this second scatter plot suggest that 8x8 is actually overvalued based on next year's earnings estimates.8x8 is aggressively expanding its product portfolio and reach with recent acquisitions. It also appears that new bookings are strong, particularly in the mid-size and enterprise markets. This is a consistent phenomenon that I am seeing throughout the industry. Large enterprises are starting to adopt cloud-based communications. I noted this in my recent article on RingCentral, Inc. (RNG). Of the two companies, my vote goes to RingCentral over 8x8, based on fundamentals and stock price action.Given the high rate of cash burn and very weak free cash flow margin, I am sticking with my neutral rating for 8x8."
3910646,54942,2016-02-20T08:41:57-05:00,8x8 continues to move up-market with nearly half of their revenue coming from much more profitable and sticky enterprise customers.The company signed three large enterprise deals which will supply it with a long pipeline of growth and should help revenue accelerate.The new outbound sales strategy should help drive incremental revenue growth similar to what has occurred at their competition.,"Our thesis on 8x8 (NASDAQ:EGHT), a virtual office outsourcing system for businesses looking to add better technology at a value price, was predicated on the growth of their sales force and acquisition of Voicenet. We researched many of these systems as the space is competitive with many new entrants. We believe that the industry is growing rapidly due to the value proposition versus legacy business communications systems. Since the call, the shares are up over 50% to nearly $11 per share.We believe they have further to run, given the move up-market and their Gartner Magic Quadrant leadership for the last three years. These cloud-based communications systems are supplanting PBX legacy systems at a very fast-rate. But 8x8 has introduced VO/VCC integration and analytics into their offering, providing a much more robust product.Enterprise Deal Momentum Should ContinueThe company was launched with a SMB focus but in the last quarter they reported 48% of their service revenue from mid-market and enterprise customers. The company is seeing a strong transition where larger and larger organizations are adopting cloud telephony, cloud contact centers, and cloud communication solution systems and scrapping PBX systems altogether.We believe this will continue to be the case due to more recent trends, including increased functionality and usability. But most importantly, we think it is the shift of global corporations with offices all over the planet, not wanting to have PBX systems in each location, subject to the costs and limitations of the local telecom company. Management discussed a case study in which a global 8K employee company was spending approximately $4 million per year just on global voice. They adopted 8x8 and that bill went to $2.5 million, before you factor in any of the increase in productivity and functionality that the technology offers.In addition, the system offers over-the-top disaster recovery, essentially as an application. The cross-device technology is unique in the telecom space, giving the employee the option to use one phone number for all their devices: iPad, iPhone, desktop, etc. It also allows video conferencing technology without the need for Cisco products and services or a third-party provider, as well as content sharing.We also think this is a natural evolution of the industry itself. The SMB customer is always going to adopt first since they likely do not have anything but a simple voice line from the local telecom, and have thus not become accustomed to any sort of higher-grade capability. But as the company scales and the technology becomes more efficient, higher-quality, and easily deployable larger customers are going the cloud route providing a sustained tailwind to 8x8.Overall, due to this enterprise adoption growth, we expect organic growth to accelerate from the 18%-20% they have been achieving over the prior six quarters and into the mid-to-high 20% range. This will be driven by the three large deals announced last quarter which should ramp up, including the signing of Regus, a provider of mobile office spaces globally, which initially will see 140 locations with on average 30 tenants each and three lines per tenant, but will eventually encompass all 2,500 global locations. They also announced NetSuite, with 2,400 seats which could end up being double potentially, and another 7,000 seat deal starting to roll out.Sales Organization Hitting Their StrideWe discussed the ramping of their sales team in our prior write-up which was set to help sales accelerate. Clearly that materialized as they continue to grow revenue at an increasing dollar rate. On the latest conference call, management discussed a new initiative for an outbound sales team focus. Over the next few months, the company will be rolling out this new team of six to twelve people in order to get more aggressive with their sales growth.Most of the direct sales in the US are currently of the inbound variety, either through a web-inquiry, call to their sales line, or text which ends up with their direct sales team. But given the scale they are reaching and the revenue generation, management feels they are ready to start doing more of outbound demand generation. Given the level of traction, and the compelling case studies, they now have the reputation and the credibility to go out and get customers on their own. RingCentral, one of their prime competitors and another UCC business we like, has seen tremendous success by implementing outbound sales efforts. We think 8x8 will see the same rate of success given the low-levels of penetration and huge market opportunity.Coupled with this, the company is growing and expanding key partnerships with third-party suppliers like Intelisys, CDW, Arrow, and Insight. These are organizations that can really help grow the middle market for 8x8 but cross-selling their products with other key office environment suppliers. 8x8 is one of the few that has in-house unified communications, contact center, and analytics capabilities, providing an integrated solution which makes it much easier for third parties to sell.Five-Pronged StrategyAs the company continues to move up-market, expand globally, and integrate seamlessly with other business applications (for example Salesforce), it will need to continue to offer better upgrades to their technology. In February of last year, the company launched Analytics 1.0 which had real-time workgroup productivity features, captured missed/abandoned calls, tracked customers throughout their on-boarding or buying expedition, and monitored call quality. These enhancements allowed them to move to capture more of end-markets while improving their sales offering.But in the third quarter of last year, they re-launched with Analytics 2.0 which had a much more robust dashboard and delved far-deeper into operating metrics than the initial technology. The new analytics tech has almost a salesforce-like feel giving smaller and mid-sized customers that do not have a CRM the ability to document and analyze outbound and inbound calls into their business. We believe this could be a game-changer for 8x8 as it is a massive differentiator between them and nearly all of their competition.With this new offering on their traditional technology, we are seeing the convergence of many areas of an organization. In addition, 8x8 has invested heavily into security and compliance in order to ensure the enterprise customer of the reliance on the system. Enterprise customers have much-higher expectations in terms of level of service. If the phone system goes down, the consequence to a firm like 8x8 can be severe. Uptime is now achieving 99.997% rates. While not perfect, the level is converging to that of the local telecom provider which eliminates a key overhang for enterprises in adopting cloud-based solutions.(Source: Investor Presentation)ValuationDespite the climb, the shares are trading at 3.7x EV/Revenue, which we think is a deal at current and accelerating growth trends. The multiple is below their peer group which as a whole has a lower projected growth rate. These multiples typically can be difficult to assess given the assumptions that must be made about slowing growth. But in 8x8's case, we believe revenue growth is set to expand due to the expanding pipeline from these recently signed deals (NetSuite, Regus, third company unannounced).We compared them to RingCentral, their chief competitor, which trades at 4.2x revenue. While we like RingCentral as a long opportunity as well, we think 8x8 should be trading at a premium multiple due to the amount of quarterly beat and raises, better traction in the enterprise segment, and the better visibility into their pipeline. The enterprise size compared to RingCentral is notable given the spread in the lifetime value of a customer compared to a SMB client, which is nearly 40 times greater.We think the company can earn close to $300 million in total revenue ($270 in recurring service revenue) in fiscal 2017 (ending March 2018). At 4.0x that level of sales, still a discount to RingCentral, the shares are worth $15.20, for upside of 40%. In our model, we used a climbing share count adding an additional 3.5 million shares to account for stock compensation expenses. However, the company is currently ramping their share repurchase program which is likely to, at least, offset these expenses going forward.Conclusion8x8 is a fast-growing and most integrated unified communications and contact center-as-a-service (UCaaS) solutions business in the market. They are now global with patented first deployment capabilities and integrated technology offerings including analytics. The new analytics variations recently launched, we believe, are allowing it to win more enterprise business with the strong recurring revenue that comes from such clients. While most SaaS businesses tend to see growth slow from high-rates over time, we think 8x8 will see a near-term acceleration due to their recent deal wins which will ramp over the next year. We believe the shares are a steal at ~$10.50 and could be a take-out target at current prices."

This is an all too familiar pattern. Will EGHT ever make a meaningful profit? Let's take a look at a few of the Company's metrics. All information is gathered from the Company's 2014 annual 10k report, June 25, 2014 14A Proxy report and May 20, 2015 8k press release for quarter ended March 31, 2015 earnings.About 8x8EGHT is a company that primarily derives revenues form their cloud based business. After being a residential VOIP company and failing terribly against Vonage (NASDAQ:VG), EGHT reinvented itself as a cloud company and began an acquisition binge thanks to their large cash balances. Per the latest earnings report: ""8x8, Inc. is the trusted provider of secure and reliable cloud-based unified communications and virtual contact center solutions to more than 40,000 businesses operating in over 40 countries across six continents. 8x8's out-of-the-box cloud solutions replace traditional on-premise PBX hardware and software-based systems with a flexible and scalable Software as a Service (NASDAQ:SAAS) alternative, encompassing cloud business phone service, contact center solutions, and web conferencing.""RevenuesIncreasing revenues have not been a problem for 8x8 for years thanks to their acquisitions.Quarterly revenues were up 18% on a year over year basis.Twelve month revenues were up 22% on a year over year basis.Net Income (Loss)The company reported a profit of $183,000 vs. a loss for the same quarter last year.Historical Revenue/Net Profit (Loss) comparisonGoing back five years, revenues have increased from $65 million to $162 million yet profits have decreased from $6.494 million to $1.926 million. Management's execution translating into profit growth has not occurred.Research & DevelopmentFor the most recent quarter. EGHT saw a 25% increase on research & development spending. Given the mature of EGHT's business, one would expect there to be a significant R&D outlay and there was, so that is a healthy sign.Gross marginsGross margins continued to strengthen and have increased from 70% to 73% in just the past year. Going back to FY 2011 they have increased from 67% to 73%. For some reason however, this is not translating into higher net profits.Cash, Cash equivalents & short term investmentsCash, cash equivalents & short term investments increased, and has been the case for years, they are a highlight.$177,094 $106,340Executive compensationSalaries paid in 2014 to the top six executives totaled $1,650,000Total compensation paid in 2014 to the top executives totaled $8,940,000 and represents over 5% of total revenues. For a company with over $100 million in sales & a lack of strong or consistent profits, I view the compensation as being hefty and out of line.Compensation of non-employee DirectorsNon employee directors did almost as well as the Company's executive management team. They walked away with total compensation packages of over $3,570,000. Once again, this seems excessive. Non employee compensation was greater than the total net income for four of the past five years. What is left for the shareholders?Conclusion8x8 is in a terrific growth industry. They have been able to capitalize on their strong balance sheet to grow revenues consistently and substantially. Despite margins increasing from 67% to 73% over the past five years, profits have not kept pace, and are in reality decreasing. The Company's own guidance in the latest quarterly report was ""We are issuing our guidance for annual revenue of $193 million - $197 million in fiscal 2016, and we expect non-GAAP net income as a percentage of revenue in the 6% - 9% range as we continue to invest in our mid-market and enterprise growth,"". This represents 20% revenue growth which seems very achievable, and net income of $15 million which would translate into earnings of 16 cents a share. Given this scenario, 8x8 would have a PE ratio of over 50. For a company that has seen no growth in profits for the past five years I do not envision EGHT as being able to outperform the major equity indices, and there is a real possibility of underperformance."
2394585,69125,2014-08-07T10:08:05-04:00,8x8 sees strong growth opportunities in the mid-market and channel sales segment due to growing adoption of cloud-based SaaS solutions.8x8 has been accepted as a major supplier on the Crown Commercial Services G-Cloud 5 framework in the United Kingdom.8x8 expands geographical footprints to tap on a growing base of small- and medium-sized businesses.,"Internet-based telephony specialist 8x8 (NYSE:EGHT) recently reported record second-quarter revenues of $37.9 million, which translated to adjusted earnings of $3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. The company witnessed solid growth in new mid-market and channel sales, fueled by an increasing adoption of cloud-based SaaS, or software-as-a-service, unified communications solutions among distributed enterprise customers. 8x8 has increasingly profited from a monthly subscription-based revenue model, which accounted for about 44% of its mid-market and channel sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.8x8 appears well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing number of subscribed services per commercial customer. More importantly, the company continues to benefit from its strong pricing power in cloud-based SaaS markets, which should fuel sustainable monthly service revenue growth in the near future. According to the Infonetics Research VoIP leadership scorecard 2014 results, 8x8 has clearly established itself as a dominant market leader in North America.Quite recently, 8x8 clinched a number of contracts for supplying cloud-based solutions and services to distributed enterprise customers in the United States. In addition to this, the company has been aggressively expanding its geographical presence in the international markets, especially emerging countries, which could enable it to target the growing base of small- and medium-sized businesses handling large call center operations. However, 8x8 might face fierce competition from fellow voice-over-Internet, or VOIP specialist magicJack VocalTec (NASDAQ:CALL), which has made robust moves into the VoIP space over the past few years.Here's why 8x8 is poised to outperform 8x8's stock has declined more than 18.9% year-to-date, but the company still foresees a potential opportunity to overturn its sagging fortunes on the back of rising demand for cloud-based products and services across the world. The company is aggressively pushing its cloud communications suites and contact center services into the mid-market and channel segment, which should fare quite well in the North American markets. Meanwhile, the company has made significant investments in sales and promotional programs to expand its domestic subscriber base. High switching costs also favour 8x8 to leverage its strong relationships with commercial customers.The company has recently inked new channel partnerships with MicroCorp and Telecom Brokerage to deliver cloud communications services to enterprise customers through their combined network of more than 3500+ agents and VARs worldwide. In addition, 8x8 has bagged lucrative contracts for its industry leading cloud contact center services from KnoahSoft, Teleopti, and Zendesk, who plan to integrate their existing products and services with virtual contact center technology. 8x8's recent Virtual Office service enhancements, Branch Office and Switchboard Pro, will also provide increased scalability to distributed enterprise customers managing high-volume call center operations.With the acquisition of U.K.-based VoIP communications specialist Voicenet Solutions, 8x8 seeks to expand its cloud-based SaaS offerings into the enterprise sector in Europe and the United Kingdom. Most recently, the U.K. government appointed 8x8 to supply cloud computing support and services on Crown Commercial Services, or CCS G-Cloud 5 CloudStore, which aspires to encourage the adoption of cloud-based services across the public sector. 8x8 has also opened a new sales office in the City of London to meet the growing demand for cloud-based communications throughout the U.K.8x8 has also announced the launch of its cloud-based communications services platform at a new Hong Kong data center facility, which will allow it to engage more mid-market, multinational customers in the Asia-Pacific region. Meanwhile, the company appears well-positioned to benefit from the acceptance of the Virtual Office SuiteApp and Virtual Contact Center SuiteApp for the Built for NetSuite program. magicJack has also announced to offer its VoiP telephony device, magicJack, at more than 10,000 new retail locations in 2014, which could give solid headwinds to 8x8 in cloud-based communications solutions markets in North America.The bottom lineAs cloud-based companies are growing at 30% every year, 8x8 also demonstrates a potential upside opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the increasing demand for cloud-based communications solutions around the world. 8x8 has stayed profitable for five straight years, and it expects revenue to grow by ""at least 25%"" during the fiscal year 2015. Going forward, the company could benefit from its recent channel partnerships with Telecom Brokerage and MicroCorp and continued geographical expansions in the international markets.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Vikram Verma, CEO; Darren Hakeman, SVP Product & Strategy; Mary Ellen Genovese, CFO; and Bryan R. Martin, CTO all bought shares of 8X8 Inc. (NYSE:EGHT). The CEO bought even a $1 million worth of shares. To be fair, their respective annual salaries are a multiple of these buy orders, but you don't spend $1 million to ""prop up"" your stock price, and it is still a sizeable increase of Verma's holdings.EGHT data by YChartsThe recent run-up in the share price is a very slight positive. Other positives are the fact a number of officers are buying, the CFO is buying and one of the execs is female (also the CFO in this case). Women have proven to be not only better investors (Odean and Barber), but also more skillful insider buyers. The issue is a little bit complicated, with studies reaching different conclusions, and it isn't exactly clear why this is the case. I've decided to treat it as a slight positive, to be considered along with other factors. For discussion of various studies on the subject, I like The Vital Few vs. the Trivial Many and the Research Handbook on Insider Trading.Examining data collected by TipRanks, I learned that none of the execs appears to have a knack for timing. Their performance track records trading the stock of their own company aren't impressive compared to a universe of execs.You shouldn't rely too much on that data, though, because most of them have only bought shares on a few occasions. They didn't engage in insider buying at other companies, and with the exception of Bryan R. Martin (the insider with the worst track record), they never sold shares. The buying data from an insider who spreads his bets across companies and does both buying and selling is generally more meaningful.The company is pretty much off the radar, with very few articles on Seeking Alpha covering it, although Alpha Gen Capital has a few PRO articles on the name.Knowledge of patent value appears useful to make sense of what this struggling company is worth. Its fundamentals don't speak for themselves, with an EV/EBITDA of 188x, P/B of 3.5x and $16 million of cash flow on a $900 million market cap. Its cash position of $150 million with no debt is attractive, and super investors Jim Simons (Portfolio) and Ken Fisher (Portfolio) like the company and have positions in it.Make sure to check out previous Insider Buying Reports for more valuable signals:"
1595572,51432,2013-08-01T15:22:59-04:00,,"The technological convergence that began in the late 1990s continues to show positive side effects in the product and service offerings of today's telecommunication providers. Up until just a few years ago, companies - and small business alike - needed to seek out different vendors to aggregate parts to form a communications solution.Those times have come and gone, and as single companies now offer a cost-cutting, one-stop solution for product and service provision, it behooves us to look into one of the companies that make this possible. 8x8 (NYSE:EGHT) is an Alternative Carrier that is on the forefront of this new market, and its stock is ready to climb.The host with the most8x8 is a complete, and scalable, office communication solutions provider. Its main product and service offerings are hosted Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, telephony, virtual office communications, web-based conferencing, and cloud-based computing services.The market for small and mid-sized business communications solutions has been burgeoning here in the U.S. Nearly 80% of businesses are expected to be using VoIP by the end of 2013, with 49% already doing so. This makes a lot of sense as businesses have much to gain by switching to VoIP, primarily due to its low cost as compared to traditional phone services.8x8 is the sixth largest Alternative Carrier, according to market capitalization. It has a growing customer base, which has recently topped 35,000 businesses. In March of 2012, Frost and Sullivan issued analysis, which listed 8x8 as the top provider of installed IP telephony lines in North America.The competitionThe company's competitors include Level 3 Communications (NASDAQ:LVLT) and Vonage (VG). Level 3 is one of the more recognizable brands in the communications world. It has annual revenue of over $6 billion, but has also lost $1.66 in EPS as of last quarter. Its product and service offerings insofar as VoIP telephony are similar to 8x8's, but its main crutch is physical networking and fiber optic connections.The signs showing that Level 3 will move into profitability have not emerged as of yet. According to analysts consensus estimates, it will still be in the red for another three quarters. Because of this, I would stay away from this stock and look towards a company already showing profitability and growth.Vonage is another recognizable brand in the VoIP arena. It's a growing force more with home subscribers, but also has been pushing more into the small and mid-sized business market. Vonage currently runs over 2.4 million subscriber lines, which translates into $842 million in revenue as of last quarter.Following a disastrous IPO in 2006, analysts bet against this company. That is, until Vonage was proven right with its investment into the telephony market. Its foothold with the U.S. consumer is large, and growing. Under new management and a new marketing push, Vonage may be a winner in 2013-2014. My advice is to watch the stock carefully, and buy on pullbacks.8x8's financial outlookThe last fiscal year, ending March 31, 8x8 had $0.20 in EPS on $107.6 million in revenue. 8x8 has been able to deliver steady revenue growth over the past five years, growing the top-line from $61.6 million in 2008, to where it stands today. Gross profit margins have held steady at around 67.5% over the past few years. With continued marketing and sales initiatives, analysts have been able to ascertain over 17% revenue growth for 2014 and an EPS consensus estimate of $0.27.A cash generating machineThe company generated over $31 million in cash from operations. Subtracting $5.7 million in capital expenditures and other miscellaneous items, the net change in cash for fiscal 2013 was $27.9 million. This increase is cash from operations is 60% higher than 2012. Compared with Level 3, which had negative cash flow of $138 million, 8x8 shows to be smaller and nimbler when it comes to generating positive free cash flow.Valuation8x8 currently trades 32 times forward P/E, which is comparatively cheaper than Level 3's forward P/E multiple of 126. Vonage, on the other hand has been able to be competitive when it comes to valuation attractiveness, but going forward, the outlook for greater velocity in year-over-year earnings goes to 8x8.Looking back at how 8x8 has traded, the stock hasn't kept pace with the growth it has been experiencing. Additionally, what hasn't been priced into the stock is the expectations for the industry to balloon over the remaining part of this year into next. Historically, the shares have traded right around 27 times EPS, which isn't too far off where it is today, so a market premium hasn't been attached to the price of the shares as of yet.ConclusionThere is no doubt that the VoIP solutions market is the place to be if you're looking to invest in the communications industry. As it stands, VoIP products and services are a $111 billion business, and 8x8 is rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with.Coupled with aggressive growth, attractive valuations, and a recognizable brand, I believe 8x8 will be a great stock to own going into the second half of this year and into next. Also, be on the lookout for 8x8 to be an acquisition target as this company has started to step on the toes of other, traditional phone companies, such as Verizon and AT&T.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Jim Simons seems to like it, too.Yet rising sales-related expenses + declining earnings + razor-thin margins + industry underperformance at a premium price + an earnings growth forecast of ~950% = bad news for investors.EGHT investors may be in a tight bind, where, unless everything unfolds perfectly, they may lose money on the deal as the stock stays flat or drops. Avoid EGHT.","8x8, Inc (NYSE:EGHT) is a communications technology company that provides VoIP telephony services, with an impressive customer list that includes McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) franchisees.We were initially excited, but suffice to say that we were disappointed when we took a look under its figurative financial hood.But first, the good stuff. We like some things about EGHT: its large amount of cash on the books (177M in 2015), its lack of debt, and its healthy free cash flow (14.18M TTM) and operating cash flow (21.25M TTM). Jim Simons certainly seems to be a fan, owning about 944,334 shares at an average price of about $8.63/share over the last several years.Unfortunately, there's also a lot we don't like.For one, EGHT is having more trouble converting its growing revenue into growing profit for shareholders.One of the reasons for those elusive earnings might be because its sales and marketing expenses, over the last several years, have risen faster than revenues -- leaving earnings in the proverbial dust. At the same time, EGHT's ROA (0.48% TTM) and ROE (0.52% TTM) are razor thin, suggesting that management is having trouble utilizing its assets to generate returns. At the same time, its capital expenditure budget has spiked to a high of 7.068M TTM.It also underperforms the industry on almost every metric imaginable--while being priced at a P/E, P/B, and P/S premium.Source: MorningstarThat leaves us worried: it seems that EGHT investors have bid up the price of EGHT's earnings rather optimistically -- and we know that optimism leads to more risky investment decisions. And, with a P/E of 530.9 and forward P/E of 40.5, shareholders have optimistically priced into EGHT a one-year earnings growth of ~950%.Unfortunately, an earnings forecast greater of 900% is too optimistic. It puts investors in a tight bind, where, unless everything unfolds perfectly, they'll probably lose money on the deal as the stock stays flat or drops. It's simple: holding everything else equal, if the market's optimistic forecast is achieved, perhaps nothing will happen, because the market's already assuming an optimistic future.On the other hand, if EGHT disappoints on earnings, investors may change their minds rapidly and switch out, causing shares to drop. It doesn't help that EGHT has no dividend, or that EGHT has a checkered history of earnings disappointments.Source: Zacks.comInvestors, the share price of EGHT presets you with little upside and far too much downside. If you're confident that EGHT will meet and exceed that 900+% one-year earnings growth, then by all means, snatch this baby up. But if you realize that avoiding situations where the downside exceeds the possible upside - and that a large percentage of stocks lose the majority of value from their peak - then avoid this company. This situations isn't helped by EGHT's low ROA and ROE + high growth in capital expenditures as well as sales-related expenses + declining profits despite rising revenue -- all while being priced at a P/E, P/B, and P/S premium. Taken alone, these facts are not by themselves endemic. But taken together, these factors represent a high level of risk to shareholders. Avoid EGHT."

In this, what we believe is an expensive market with the high-beta, high-growth names trading at pricey valuations, you have to find names that have sold off for what turns out to be transitory and unreasonable grounds. 8x8 (NYSE:EGHT) is poised for a breakout in the next couple of years after significant investments within their sales and marketing business look to aggressively expand their customer subscription base.At the end of April, this stock was north of $11 per share but fell below $7 recently on no significant news. Valuations in many of the high-fliers among the Russell 2000 index suddenly became a concern for investors who sold off many of the top performers of the last few years. Analysts can now pick up a 25+% grower for less than 17x forward earnings.A confluence of factors are coming together in near perfect timing to present an upside opportunity. For one, as I noted above, the shares have gone on sale compared to the valuation just a few weeks ago. Meanwhile, they are on the cusp of launching a full blown international operation to expand their reach and market opportunity and got a win from Infonetics Research as the number one hosted North America business VoIP service. Lastly, they are investing more heavily in their sales force in order to capitalize on this growing, and fast moving trend.Investors and analysts are forecasting a moderation in their growth rate and the number of new business additions. However, my investment thesis rests on the fact that they are likely to increase their growth rate over the next couple of years due the above variables.Business Overview8x8 is a provider of unified communications and collaboration (UCC) services in the cloud for small and medium businesses. The company offers a suite of products including virtual office, virtual contact center, and virtual meeting solutions. The software as a service suite resides in the cloud with mobile capabilities. The products include VoIP phones (Cisco and Polycom manufactured), hosted PBX (virtual office), hosted call center (virtual call center), web conferencing (virtual meeting), and virtual desktop management solutions (virtual or remote desktop).As of the end of fiscal 2014 (the company's fiscal year-end is March 31) the company had 37,933 total business customers with over 500,000 subscriptions. Additionally, the average number of subscribed services per business customer has increased from 11.6 to 13.5 over the last year.(Source: Company 2014 10-K)The software transcends complex networking, redundancy, security, and interconnection requirements to provide a seamless and easy-to-use solution for their customers. The software also integrates with many of the leading enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, human capital management, and other third-party application suites such as NetSuite and Salesforce.com to provide a fully functional business communications and collaboration experience.Business ModelThe company has a subscription-based business model which accounts for nearly all of its revenue. The rest comes from secondary product sales, mainly IP telephones. The subscription price relies on a number of factors including the number of subscribers, features added (toll free numbers, fax, contact center lines, phone extensions, etc.) and number of add-on applications like virtual desktop, video conferencing, contact center, etc.Their sales model began with a focus on small and medium businesses (<50 seats) but lately they have shifted towards the mid-market (50-200 seats) and enterprise (>200 seats). They used to concentrate on residential VoIP sales but have since abandoned that strategy. The shift has shown up in their ARPU (average revenue per unit) which has risen to $287 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 versus $256 at the end of 2013.New small and medium-sized customers typically sign a one-year deal with one-year automatic renewals. Mid-market and enterprise deals are typically three- to- five years in duration with payments on both monthly. The sales case to the office manager, IT head, or business owner is fairly straightforward with a focus on productivity and quick payback period. Their case studies show 50% cost reductions in some cases with increased productivity versus antiquated phone systems.Their direct sales force uses customer referrals, direct web advertising, and also traditional sources like print and tradeshow marketing. A significant portion of their new sales come from existing customers (positive churn: more new seats from existing customers versus canceled subscribers) and accounts for one-third of new business.Return on investment is compelling and the primary sales tool with a payback period of approximately 6 months. The appeal of the service is apparent in the average tenure of their customer base which reached 75 months and continues to grow.(Source: May 2014 Investor Presentation)Other business model points include frequent new product releases every 3-6 months and enhancements every 1-2 months. The firm runs an asset-light model with light capex requirements of less 2.2% of revenue. 8x8 details that the SaaS industry average is closer to 7.6%.Industry and Market OpportunityAs unified communication becomes more mainstream, mostly due to cost deflation and improved technology, end user revenues will continue to grow at exceptional rates while the developers jockey for the leadership position. UCC is a service offering that intends to ""pay for itself"" as the monthly cost is typically exceeded by the benefit fairly quickly leading to a ""no-brainer"" choice. The question becomes: which provider amongst the peer group?The growth of the mobile workforce in recent years has increased productivity substantially but also increased the need for workers communications capabilities. Workers need to be able to communicate with their colleagues regardless of location or device with new tools such as social software and video.The total services and elements that are being offered continue to increase with UCC tools such as email, voice, text, video, presence, IM, click-to-communicate, mobility and unified client as well as collaboration technologies such as shared workspaces, meetings and conferencing, social tools such as communities, user profiles, microblogging and activity feeds. Using integrated UCC solutions, workers can access all their tools that they would have in an office space, including whatever application they're in on their computers, without having to switch out from one to another. Tying it in with a company's business processes allows for optimized business functionality.(Source: Gartner UCC Industry Report)The market opportunity continues to expand with a new report from market research and consulting firm COMMFusion forecasts the worldwide market for UCC services to hit $20.8 billion by 2016. In 2011, the UCC-capable market for premise-based UCC was $12.2 billion. The component with the highest growth is conferencing/collaboration with a 17% CAGR. The true UCC market is estimated at $2.7 billion in 2011, up 20% from 2010, and expected to grow to $8.5 billion by 2016. The conferencing and collaboration market remains the highest CAGR at +50% while the UCC server/IM/Presence represents the largest portion of revenue each year, going from 70% in 2011 to 73% in 2016.(Source: Parallels SMB Cloud Insights 2014 Report)Another market research organization- Parallels SMB Cloud Insights Report- shows continued adoption of cloud services by SMBs. Their report shows a $6.5 billion market as of the end of last year, carrying a 37% CAGR. Just a fraction of the ""mature"" market has been penetrated with that geographic footprint seeing 24% growth in the last year. Meanwhile, the maturing and developing markets continues to see growth rates that are two and three times as fast with a total market of $2.5 billion compared to the $4.1 billion mature market.8x8 detailed some market figures in one of the latest investor presentations. The chart shows data from Frost & Sullivan, Gartner, and TechNavio, three of the most respected and reliable market research firms. It breaks down the source of the opportunity between Virtual Meeting, Virtual Call Center, and Virtual Office from 2012 to 2016 and beyond.(Source: May 2014 Investor Presentation)IDC believes the mobile UCC market is poised to take off over the next few years as people migrate from the widely used basic functions of UCC (IP telephony, messaging [email, text, unified messaging], presence, and audio-conferencing. Customers continue to upgrade to the newest features available, or phase 2 applications, specifically around mobility, video, and collaboration.With phase 2 largely completed, phase 3 has begun over the last couple of years with momentum towards social business solutions, integrating with UCC in a complementary fashion. By incorporating social functionality with enterprise applications and business processes, they can provide a full suite of access to new technologies that have become essential to certain industries (eventually all).Over time, it appears the innovation surrounding hybrid clouds which provides organizations the ability to manage some resources in-house and has others provided externally. The hybrid approach allows a business to take advantage of the scalability and cost-effectiveness that a public cloud computing environment offers without exposing sensitive, company information to third-parties.8x8's target market which originally favored small and medium sized businesses, continues to migrate up market towards larger mid-market and distributed enterprises. This is a shift in prior strategies from five years ago when the company had a significant residential customer base. Back then, they had over 100,000 residential customers and was the second largest US VoIP provider behind Vonage. Since then, they have ceded that market to Vonage (and other firms like MagicJack) focusing primarily on business solutions. Today, residential customers account for approximately 2% of total revenues.Their market is minimally penetrated with less than 2% market share of the total market opportunity within just the US. If we assume 75 million seats in the US paying $22.50 per seat, and potential 10% penetration five to ten years from now, then we see a potential for their market opportunity at $2 billion. Globally, they are just beginning to penetrate business lines and the global marketplace is several years behind the US in adopting hosted technologies. Still, we estimate the opportunity is probably a 5x multiple to the US but with a lag of three to five years.As the industry evolves, we expect to see some current trends that are just starting out, for example, the dominance of the hybrid cloud model, a fallout of hosted services in favor of managed services, the growth of mobile functionality for their out-of-office workforce, integration of UCC with social media, embedded presence, vendor specialization and an evolving channel vertical.Indirect Sales Team Build-OutThe customer acquisition model uses a direct sales strategy through a low-touch, high velocity sales technique. A significant portion of their sales come from their ""land-and-expand"" sales system that banks on new seats from existing customers. It is based on the premise that it is easier to get a minor commitment first and then work your way towards a major commitment once the customer experiences the benefits and advantages of the product.(Source: 2014 Investor Presentation)Software-as-a-service (SAAS) is typically assessed via the cost of acquisition, which incorporates the costs of advertising, marketing, any promotions offered, sales commissions to associates, and subsidies for initial equipment. This is then compared to the number of subscribers that were added along with the number of new services added onto existing subscriptions.The payback period is highly compelling. The ROI is driven by the cost of acquisition per customer which was the lowest it has been in a number of years. At the March 31, 2014 fiscal year end, the business subscriber acquisition cost fell to $84 per service. This was due to a combination of factors including less discounting, less advertising and marketing per new subscriber as scale is reached, and lower equipment subsidies. On the conference call, when asked about what drove the lower acquisition costs, CFO Daniel Weirich stated:Their sales and marketing budget continues to be too low for their growth prospects. However, that has been changing. Sales and marketing rose to $18 million in the latest quarter, up from $12.9 million the year ago period, an increase of 39.5%. In fiscal 2014, the company increased their marketing budget by 31.8% compared to a 21.8% increase the year before. Quarterly data shows the same kind of ramp up in sales and marketing spend as the company realizes the potential opportunity in the market that exists and attempts to take advantage of that by ramping up operations.In the fourth quarter, the company earned an ARPU of $287. The cost per customer is approximately $1040 with a contribution margin of approximately 70%. At those levels, the payback period has actually been falling over the last several quarters (mostly due to higher ARPUs and lower business subscriber acquisition cost per service). The current payback period is less than six months but will likely meander around the five to seven month range.The fact that their customer acquisition costs are not rising, in fact they are falling, but also their price points have stayed strong rising to $287 per month per service per customer, means that they are starting to build a competitive advantage. Most software providers, especially ones offering products within a hyper-competitive market, have little barriers to entry. A key metric to watch within these firms is the price they have to pay to acquire new subscribers and the price they are charging customers.Infonetics Research 'Win'On May 6, 2014, Infonetics Research released its North American Business VoIP Service Scorecard in which it ranked 8x8 number one. The summary from Infonetics notes that 8x8 is the leader due to its ""solid financial position and the continued strong growth of its installed base.""From the scorecard:While the business has few true barriers to entry, it is largely driven by scale and size. The first movers and the larger players tend to dominate as they have the infrastructure to host enterprise and larger scale organizations. Even though the barriers may be low, companies tend to invest their resources in players they know will be around a year from now. Hence, they rely on firms with significant financial stability tending to migrate towards the established players. The fact that 8x8 has been able to *win* such a distinction will likely mean increased inquiries into their services from businesses who are in the market for UCC.International InitiativeThe company has started to lay the groundwork to expand internationally. Most of their prime competition continues to focus solely on the domestic market so a first-mover advantage into Europe, Asia and Latin America could be a gamechanger for the firm.The acquisition of UK-based Voicenet Solutions in December of 2013 for $18.4 million in cash was a surprise and has led to speculation that the firm will begin a massive push internationally soon. In January they installed their services infrastructure in a new Hong Kong data center. Last September, they completed the build-out of their London datacenter and are on track to open their South American datacenter soon.Management has stated that they plan to extend their services to existing customers and also pursue new customers leveraging this global platform. The integration with Voicenet was stated to be ""proceeding on plan"" with the company going live selling the full range of their unified communication and collaboration services in the country in February. Management has stated that they have established a complete operational footprint in Europe with the acquisition, which has been completely rebranded as 8x8 Solutions.We've detailed the size of the opportunity that exists within the global market. The firm recently was awarded the Belfast City Airport, brought on by their UK channel partner. This will likely lead to further selling in the country lending the firm both credibility and a marketing opportunity. Given the size of the firm, the company only needs a small global footprint to grow significantly in its size.ValuationWhile we typically use a discounted cash flow model to apply an approximate intrinsic value on the stock, other metrics may be better in applying a value. For one, we will walk through a potential market opportunity-based valuation methodology. Their current market share is approximately 0.7% based on 550,000 total seats compared to a current addressable market opportunity worldwide of 75 million seats.Let's walk through the valuation process below. The company currently has approximately 550K seats and has grown that number at a 16% CAGR over the last several years. While many analysts and investors are pegging this growth rate to moderate over the next few years, I've laid out my case for that growth rate to continue or even increase in the next couple of years.8x8's market share is approximately 0.7% currently using a population universe of seats at 75 million. The 75 million figure we used is a fairly low estimate but one that estimates a current ""addressable"" market potential. This is a global scale - recall we used 75 million for the market opportunity for just the US above - and one that underestimates globally by nearly 3x to 4x. If 8x8 increases its market share by just 30 bps to 1%, they will hold 750K seats by 2016. Using a static revenue per seat per month, though the figure has been increasing, equates to a $182 million revenue potential.We used two different valuation techniques above to assess the intrinsic value in the shares. For one, we calculated a net margin of 9%, the average for the last couple of years, obtained an EPS figure, and attached a multiple to it. The tool shows an intrinsic value of $7.42 using a contracted 40x multiple- down from the current 51x- or a 9% premium. Using a static P/E, the intrinsic value is approximately $9.70 or 40% above the current price. You can clearly see the discrepancy in the calculated value of the shares based on the multiple the investor chooses to apply to some future EPS metric.The better metric is the lower portion of the above image which uses a multiple of revenues to value the shares. This is a technique often used when you are valuing hyper-growth, low profitability, mainly technology firms. I compiled a fairly comprehensive list of their publicly traded competition to assess where the industry is trading. 8x8 is trading at a 3x multiple of revenue while the average (not including 8x8) is above 4.7x. Applying a 4.7x multiple to the expected revenue once they achieve a 1% market share, 2%, 3%, and so on, gets an enterprise value of $854 million, a 37% premium to the current market capitalization (67% above the current enterprise value that backs out the cash).(Source: Author's Calculation)In summation, valuation is cheap considering the growth prospects. Rarely do I call a stock that trades at 112x its trailing twelve month P/E ratio, cheap (using GAAP EPS). Non-GAAP is more ""down to Earth"" at 17x forward, 37x ttm.CatalystsThere are several potential catalysts that are likely to benefit the firm over both the near and long-term:RisksConclusions8x8 is the best way to play the burgeoning virtual office secular growth story. They have been able to grow their business base by 16% per year over the last several years thanks to a strong return on investment proposition. However, the shares have come under steep pressure in the last few weeks losing a third of its value under what we like to call a ""no news environment."" Essentially, the stock was caught up with the other high beta and high flying names that sold off in the last three months. The sale price now offers investors a chance to get in at just the right time as the firm launches their international operations, builds out their sales force, and won a prestigious marketing research scorecard. Investors and analysts now believe seat additions will start to moderate but we believe that will not be the case for some time thanks to the above factors. Upside can be substantial with just small market share growth over the next few years.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1272711,27651,2013-03-14T05:48:10-04:00,,"8x8, Inc. (NYSE:EGHT) is the leading provider of cloud communications and computing solutions for small-to-medium businesses, enterprise, and government agencies. The company's products are a suite of SaaS and IaaS solutions which include hosted telecommunications cloud software, contact center, unified communications, video conferencing, cloud hosting, and virtual private servers. The company has been awarded a total of 85 patents with the USPTO and more patents pending.Since our first article about 8x8 written on March 19, 2012, 8x8 has gone from a market capitalization of nearly $270 million to $480 million as of close of trading on March 13, 2013. Further, since we brought 8x8 to the attention of readers, the company reached a market capitalization of $575 million in early 2013, an increase of over 100% since our first article on the company. We still believe 8x8 remains the most compelling small-cap communications company ripe for acquisition at a very significant premium.Fundamental UpdateThe company now has an annual revenue run rate in excess of $100 million. In the December 2012 quarter, 8x8 reported $27.3 million in revenues (growing 22% organic, YoY). Mind you, this is not product sales, but this is almost entirely service revenues which is recurring revenue. The company increased its cash on hand over the past year from $21.9 million to a total of $46 million as of December 31, 2012. The company continues to carry zero debt.In July, 2012, Frost & Sullivan issued a report entitled ""North American Hosted IP Telephony and UC Services Market Report"" which listed 8x8 as the top unified communications provider in North America. Please note, companies such as Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), RingCentral, and West IP Communications all were behind 8x8 in terms of installed lines provided to companies in North America.More recently, Gartner Group recognized 8x8 as a ""Leader"" in the Magic Quadrant, again, alongside some of the largest communications companies in the world.Further, in terms of on-premise providers (hardware providers NOT cloud or unified communications providers), 8x8 would have been right behind communications vendor giants such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Avaya (OTC:AVYA), NEC, Mitel (NASDAQ:MITL), and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF).The subscriber growth at the company continues to be very consistent and has moved significantly up the food-chain in terms of customer size. Since Fiscal Quarter 2, 2012 ARPU (average service revenue per customer per month) has gone from roughly $210 per customer, to $260 per customer. Clearly, the size of the customer is growing at a significant pace.We find it interesting that such notable consulting firms take notice of 8x8 while the company is still ""unrecognized"" by most of Wall Street. Over the past year since our first article, the company has, however, done a good job at attracting more top-tier research firms, most of which have a buy rating on the company. We find this good news because it renders some of the previous hack analysts that continue to follow the company, worthless.Fact of the matter is this: the company is on the radar of the largest industry consultants as an innovator and leader in the rapidly expanding communications space. The company is continuously mentioned with industry heavyweights such as Comcast, Verizon (VZ), AT&T (T), Cisco, Avaya, and Microsoft (MSFT) which brings me to my next point.Compelling Takeover TargetAcme Packet (NASDAQ:APKT) was recently bought out for a price of $2.1 billion by Oracle Corp. (ORCL) on February 4, 2013 (excluding cash, the value was $1.7 billion). Acme Packet was bought by Oracle to ""bolster its communications product offerings"" and ""is best-known for selling hardware that telecommunications companies and big corporations buy to manage the transmission of phone calls using the same technology as Internet communications"" according to Reuters. Acme Packet guided to 2012 revenues in the range of $270-275 million. While Acme Packet was not a direct competitor to 8x8, it shows the value that companies within this cloud and communications industry are fetching. The acquisition price Oracle paid was roughly 6X 2012 revenues. 8x8 should report annual revenues close to $125 million over the next 12 months. At a price of 6X annual revenues, this would value 8x8 at approximately $750,000,000, or $10.41 per share (including cash, valued at $800,000,000, or $11.11 per share). In 2014-2015, 8x8 should be at a run rate of at least $150 million, or at 6X revenues, $900,000,000 (excluding cash). This would value the company at approximately $12.50 per share. Further, 8x8 has a significant unrecognized asset on its balance sheets: several families of digital communications patents which, themselves, could be worth in excess of $50-$100 million.The days of the copper wire, and installation of hardware are gone. Game over. Software providers and large cloud vendors such as Oracle understand that this type of communications is the future and will bolster their vision for the next 50 years. In this rapidly evolving communications landscape, throw in a growing, innovative company such as 8x8 that owns their entire product line due to its vast intellectual property portfolio, and the only thing we ask ourselves is this: it is not a matter of ""if"" 8x8 is acquired, but ""when.""Disclosure: I am long EGHT. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: Please do your own due diligence as this is our personal thesis and reason for taking our long positing in EGHT.

1099171,32241,2013-01-07T17:45:01-05:00,,"I last analyzed 8x8, Inc. (NYSE:EGHT) in August, with a bullish perspective on the stock and an ultimate price target of $9-$10 in the coming year. Since the article, the company has released a quarterly earnings report, realized significant stock price appreciation, and been identified as a go-to business following Hurricane Sandy. A reevaluation considering these positive events in the context of the price appreciation is in order ahead of the next quarterly earnings results, to be reported on Jan. 24.Q2 2013 (reported Oct. 24) -- The Top Line: Charging MoreOn the top line, 8x8's revenues grew 33% quarter over quarter, from $19.8 million to $26.4 million. Importantly, 8x8's business customer revenues grew 41% in total, or 25% when accounting for comparison bias due to the acquisition of Contactual. On top of this, monthly revenues per business partner increased to $256, up from $250 in Q1 2013 and from $207 in Q2 2012. The company's management notes that this is related to an expansion in its service lines: new customers are adopting 14.7 service lines (products) from 8x8, compared to 12.4 a year earlier. Thus, the company was able to charge more per month.A breakdown of revenues indicates that management has been improving the business significantly since 2009:Note: Years are based on actual years, not fiscal year results (8x8's fiscal year ends March 31).The Top Line: Retaining CustomersFor a company to grow its market share, it must retain customers and acquire new customers. A company acquiring hundreds of new customers is not growing if it is losing thousands. Thus, churn is important because it focuses on the ""retaining customers"" portion. For the quarter, churn increased to 2.4% due to a one-time loss of 400, $20 per month, customers. If this onetime loss is removed, then churn was flat compared to Q1 2013. Revenues of $8,000 per month were lost, but management noted in the call that revenue churn, a more important measurement of actual revenues, is at an all-time low of 1.0%. Management expects churn to continue to improve, however, be wary of more or continued ""one-time"" losses. The current main driver of churn for 8x8 is business closures, rather than clients switching service providers.The Top Line: Adding CustomersFor adding customers, management notes three priorities:Thus, the company is targeting small businesses, its base segment, as well as opening up to larger businesses and the federal government. Management insisted in the call that its internal sales team can grow quicker than it has grown in the past, which is why that remains the highest priority. These are the three initiatives through which growth can exceed what analysts are currently predicting and cause the stock price to continue its upward trajectory.The Bottom Line: Service MarginsThe company improved its bottom line 119% to $3.7 million from the same quarter last year. Management's focus is on a service margin goal of 80%; the margin is currently at 76%. To reach this goal, 8x8 has entered into new agreements with new network vendors and is continually improving its network operations activities. 8x8 has also migrated its contractual customer database to proprietary billing systems, which should result in increased efficiency and enhanced customer experiences.Given that 8x8 has had some special items income and tax events in the past few years, operating earnings before tax is the best metric of business viability:Estimate is based on the past three actual quarterly results plus a (very) conservative prediction based on the final quarter of 2011.Here, operating earnings have improved significantly since 2008, showing large gains in 2009 and 2010, withs trong absolute gains moving forward. Meanwhile, capital expenditures have been high at $4.7 million year to date, but the company expects to return to a historical capital expenditure amount of 2% of revenues in the near future. The high capital expenditures are due to moving to a new office building.Despite the capital expenditures, however, the company has grown its cash and short-term investments base significantly:An important note here is the combination of earnings, capital expenditures, and the fact that 8x8 has no debt. The company has been improving its earnings and had a significant amount of capital expenditures this year, but still grew its cash and short-term investments balance significantly. While an increasing and significant cash balance can sometimes indicate that management is simply not investing enough or should return some of that capital to investors (stock buybacks or dividends), the fact that capital expenditures were high and that many companies are keeping larger-than-historically-normal cash balances diminishes that worry. It is nice to have a cushion and a solid balance sheet, and at this time I am satisfied with 8x8's cash balance and capital reinvestment policy.Stock ChartClick to enlarge image.It is apparent that in the past six months the stock has had quite a run-up from near $4.20 to $7.49, for a gain of nearly 78%. In the short term, the stock has moved sideways over the past 13 or so trading periods, which has led to the 20-day moving average resting right below the current stock price. In a positive move, the 20-day moving average bounced off the 50-day moving average in mid december. The MACD has converged, but this is not necessarily bearish; it is reflecting the sideways trend that the stock is currently in and showing that there is not current significant upward momentum. Based on the stock chart, I believe that the stock will continue to move sideways prior to its earnings report.Financial RatiosFrom the P/E and PEG metrics, as well as the stock chart showing significant stock price appreciation, it is apparent that growth has been priced into the stock. Investors must question if more growth than currently expected can be achieved.ConclusionThe company delivered a solid earnings report and news since then indicates that it is continuing the momentum. The market has recognized this as well, and is now pricing in more growth with the stock currently trading in the low $7.00s ($7.22 at the time of the financial calculations).Investors must remember that a claim on equity is a claim on future cash flows; you pay the stock price now in return for this claim. Currently, the price reflects growth estimates of about 18%-20% growth; investors must realize that 8x8's stock price will appreciate if these growth estimates are beat. 8x8's stock price, and the growth potential that it reflects, will be based upon the four things italicized in the quarterly conference call review: ability to charge more, ability to retain customers, ability to acquire new customers, and reaching its target of an 80% service margin. The better and faster management is able to act upon these items, the quicker 8x8's shares will appreciate. If going long, any investor must believe in management's ability to act quickly on these initiatives and to grow quicker than current expectations. Personally, barring drastic changes to the business, I believe that a price target of $9-$10 is achievable within the year.Look for the Following in the Next Quarterly Report:(taken from Bloomberg)Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1285131,44981,2013-03-19T06:03:32-04:00,,"Small cap stocks can prove to be great investments, if chosen wisely. We have seen some small companies grow and become giants. While looking at such success stories, one always wishes to have bought the shares when they were cheap. However, for every success story there are probably ten failures. So, we should be extremely careful when investing in small cap growth stocks.While going through small cap stocks, I came across an interesting company, which I believe will grow substantially over the next five years. I decided to perform a detailed analysis encompassing its products, competition, market, growth potential and financial strength. The company I am going talk about is 8x8, Inc (NYSE:EGHT), first of all, I will start with a brief introduction of the company.What the Company Does and History8x8 develops and markets cloud-based business communications services encompassing internally developed Voice over Internet Protocol (""VoIP"") technologies. These services enable telephony and video applications as well as web-based conferencing and unified communications capabilities. The company also provides managed hosting and cloud-based computing services. As of December 31, 2012, 8x8 had approximately 31,500 business customers. Since 2004, substantially all of the revenue has been generated from the sale, license and provision of VoIP products, services and technology.The company was established in 1987 as Integrated Information Technology, Inc (IIT). 8x8's early products were programmable semiconductors and related software for the videophone and videoconferencing sectors. So, the focus of the company was on videophone and videoconferencing from the start. In 1996, the company changed its name to 8x8, Inc. The company explained that focus on videoconferencing and MPEG markets was an important factor for changing the name.According to the management, the new name better aligns with the products and services offered by the company. An 8x8 block of pixels is the basis for many video algorithms and enables the system to support video conferencing. So, the company changed its name to 8x8, Inc from Integrated Information Technology, Inc. In 1998, the company started its IP telephony efforts by introducing Audacity Internet Telephony Processor. Later, IP telephony became the focus of the company.However, there were still twists and turns in the story and the next two years were no less than a circus. The company shifted its strategy to voice and data services over the IP, and stopped offering consumer videophone services. Furthermore, the company changed its name to ""Netergy Networks"", combining the words ""Network"" and ""Synergy"". The rationale behind the name was that the new strategy focuses on creating synergies out of voice and data services on the IP networks.Over the next two years, the company tried to expand and made some acquisitions; however, most of these acquisitions failed and the company face substantial losses. In 2001, the company decided to change its name back to 8x8, Inc, and the company introduced VoIP services to high-speed internet customers in the shape of Packet8.Since 2001, the company had mixed success and raised funds through stock issues. Furthermore, the company has been able to introduce innovative products. As a result, the company has been able to increase its customer base and product portfolio. At the moment, there are about 31,500 business customers availing services of the company. Strong portfolio of customers and products is propelling the company towards success.Products & Services and CustomersThe company has five different product offerings, tailored for different business sizes and needs. 8x8 provides products and service by business size, need or product type. By business size, the company provides services to home offices, small, medium and large businesses as well as government. Business needs can be any need from a number of options. A business may choose to avail services with a view to decrease telephone costs, international calling, and video conferencing or to upgrade business phone system etc. There are five product offerings by the company, namely, Virtual Office, Virtual Office Pro, Virtual Contact Center, Virtual room and Virtual meeting. 8x8 offers all of the vital calling features, including call waiting and caller ID. Each line is also equipped with conference calling and voicemail abilities that allow users to include up to three callers on single call. All of these products focus on cost reduction for businesses along with other features. Detailed information about these products and packages can be found here.Customers of the company are mainly small and medium businesses. Major chunk of its revenue comes from services directly provided to small and medium businesses. Furthermore, the company also caters to large businesses as well as government. One thing I like about the revenue mix of the company is that none of the customers for 8x8 contribute more than 10% of its total revenue. It shows that the company has a diversified customers mix. As a result, bargaining power of the customers is low, and the company is not dependent on any single customer. While there is substantial diversification for 8x8 in the customers mix, geographic diversification is minimal. At the moment, the company generates almost all of its revenues from the U.S. market, and the revenue from other markets is negligible. However, I believe the current strategy of focusing on the domestic market is solid as there is a lot of room to grow in this market.Competition and the Market8x8 operates in an extremely attractive market. The market is growing at an exceptional rate, and it is still at the early stages of its growth, therefore, there is a massive opportunity for the company to grow. While there are a lot of operators offering VoIP services; the biggest competitors for 8X8 are Vonage (NASDAQ:VG), Voip.com, RingCentral and Nextiva. Most of these businesses are operating as private operators.Vonage caters to both residential and business customers. The company has a good set of plans according to the needs of residential as well as business customers. Vonage allows you to keep your original number if you are moving from landline and all in-network calls are free. Monthly fees are low for Vonage; however, its plans require an annual contract, a setup fee and a cancellation fee in case of termination.Voip.com also caters to business and residential customers. Voip.com's plans allow you to choose between monthly payment and one or two year contract. Voip.coms features are mainly basic that can be found with other operators in the market.RingCentral mainly offers services to businesses. The company offers 30 day risk-free trial package, and telephone and fax services. Like other operators, RingCentral also offers free installation.And finally, Nextiva is another important player in the business VoIP services market. Nextiva offers most of the basic services offered by other operators in the industry, along with some extension options.Monthly rates in the market do not fall much apart for good service providers such as 8X8 and Vonage. 8X8 charges one dollar less than Vonage for its monthly subscriptions. However, cancellation fees can be an important factor while comparing these two companies. 8X8 charges almost double ($59.99) than the industry average, which can be a negative for the company.Competitive AdvantageThere is an emphasis on being the low-cost services provider in this market. So, in order to provide low-cost services, the companies have to maintain their costs at a lower level. It will not wise to compete on price in a market where the focus is on low-cost services. Instead, the company should have a differentiation strategy. Only by being the best services provider the company can attract customers. Business will be happy to pay small premium for good services, and this small premium will still keep their overall cost below the traditional landline services.I believe 8X8's competitive advantage is its strong patent portfolio. The company has almost 70 patents in its portfolio, which make it one of the biggest patent holders in the market. The company has been innovating in the field of VoIP and cloud based services; as a result, 8X8 currently has a unique competitive advantage over its competitors. The company has deep knowledge of the technology, which it is using to its advantage. Furthermore, the Company offers a fully integrated suite of cloud-based services to any device, at any location, across all networks. The company has a versatile cloud services portfolio, which gives it an advantage over the competition.Conclusion8x8 has shown exceptional growth over the past three years. Revenue figures have been growing at an impressive pace. The company has been able to grow revenue at an average of over 12% per year during the past three years. Furthermore, net income and cash flows have also improved substantially. At the moment, the market is experiencing solid growth, and strong position of the company should allow it to grow well into the future. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is aggressively buying into the cloud computing segment. 8x8 can also be an attractive acquisition target. However, even if the company carries on its own; it will be an extremely attractive investment for the next five years. At the moment, the stock is trading at P/E ratio of 6.3.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1455941,49511,2013-05-23T04:57:50-04:00,,"8x8, Inc. (NYSE:EGHT) is a promising technology stock that is currently priced under $10. 8x8 is a California-based small-cap technology company and it has approximately 30,000 business clients as of 2012. The company develops and distributes telecommunications services for Internet protocol, telephony and video applications. As such, it offers Web-based conferencing, unified communication services, and cloud-based computing services. The 8x8 Virtual Office hosts private branch communication services for small and medium enterprises; the 8x8 Virtual Contact Center is a small call center solution that works with broadband Internet connection; and lastly, the Virtual Office Pro is a business communications solution that functions on an integrated Web-based portal through PC, laptop, tablet, or smartphone.On May 1, 2013, Virtual Office Desktop 8x8 was recognized by TMC, a global media company, as the winner of the 2013 Unified Communications TMC Labs Innovation Award. Recently, on April 16, 2013, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued United States Patent number 8,422,986 to 8x8 entitled ""Systems, Methods, Devices and Arrangements for Emergency Call Services Using Non-traditional Endpoint Devices."" The company was awarded 87 patents in the United States in communications, signaling, processing, and storage technologies up to date.8x8 was founded in 1987 and it is currently in the process of transitioning into a Web-based and modern technologies to position itself as one of the key companies in cloud computing and Internet communications. According to Gartner Research, the cloud computing market will boost by 18.5% to $131 billion in 2013 from about $111 billion last year. In the global market, North America covers 59% of cloud computing spending until 2016. That said, 8x8 is emerging as one of the key players in this exciting growth in the sector. Northland Capital recently upgraded 8x8 to Outperform at $8.Balance SheetLast year, 8x8 shares climbed by 137% after they bottomed out in the second quarter of 2012. While the forward P/E of 8x8 is 27.29, this is an attractive ratio given the steady revenue growth and the exceptional profitability margins and operating ratios. The balance sheet is in very good condition with current ratio and quick ratio of 3.97 and 3.92 respectively.Concurrently, the debt-to-equity ratio is zero. This means that the company is operating on no debt and liquid assets can cover expenses that may arise during operations and pay off future debt. Cash has been increasing from $14.57 million in 2007 to $40.12 million in the previous quarter. The cash held by the company increased by 64.63% in five years.Sales & EarningsThe diluted EPS of 8x8 in the past 12 months is 1.03. The EPS increased by a remarkable 901.09% compared to EPS of 25.67% in the past five years. EPS is expected to increase by an additional 40% next year. The increase in EPS might be associated with the increasing number of business customers and valuable patents awarded to the company. 8x8 is scheduled to report its fiscal Q4 and full year earnings on May 22, 2013.The company reports ROA, ROE and ROI of 70.65%, 81.07%, and 80.09% in the trailing twelve months, respectively. These are impressive returns given the price of the stock. Additionally, the gross margin is 67.79%, operating margin is 21.39%, and profit margin is 73.81%. This means that the company operates on controlled but efficient levels of production and operating expenses in order to arrive at a decent level of profit.Moreover, the sales quarter over quarter is 17.45% compared to sales of 10.06% in the past five years. The company currently has $533.85 million in capitalization. The company reported $103.16 million revenues and $76.14 million in income in the past 12 months. The company's income is composed mostly of repeat service to clients followed by product sales. This ability to retain customers will be a huge catalyst for growth in the next few years.CompetitionCompetitors for 8X8 include public companies such as Vonage (NASDAQ:VG) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and private companies such as Voip.com, RingCentral and Nextiva. 8x8 is focused on sales to small and medium businesses but it is eying federal and corporate clients in the future. Monthly rates in the market do not vary as much. 8X8 charges one dollar less than Vonage for its monthly subscriptions which is an edge since Vonage is one of its toughest competitors. However, cancellation fees can be an important factor while comparing these two companies. 8X8 charges almost double than the industry average, which can be unattractive to customers. However, clients are retained better at 8x8 than other companies in the sector.Bottom LineThe company delivered a solid earnings report in the past quarter and if the momentum will continue in the coming earnings report, the stock can beat $8 per share expectations. The stock is currently trading at less than $10 and this can quickly appreciate if the growth estimates are exceeded.If 8X8 continues to acquire and retain new customers, the shares will continue to appreciate. The company also has room to charge more for services going forward as long as management acts quickly and acquires the ability to serve the market with advanced technologies. With 87 patents under its belt and counting, 8x8 is poised for bigger and better services ahead.Revenue and net income are increasing at an impressive pace, while cash and capital expenditures are in solid position. The company is operating with no debt, which is astounding. It might be a target for possible acquisitions in the future but if the company continues its growth, 8x8 is a great stock to hold for the next couple of years.Disclosure: I am long EGHT.

791131,32241,2012-08-08T15:40:39-04:00,,"Technology in the cloud has been a hot topic in recent years, and it is obvious that as the demand for storage and off-site, remote access to documents continues to increase, businesses with a cloud platform could be poised to flourish. 8x8, Inc (NYSE:EGHT) is one such stock. The company has been recognized as a leading provider of telecommunications and data solutions. An overview and analysis of the company is warranted given these details.Understanding the Business:8x8, Inc ""is a leading provider of cloud communications and cloud computing solutions"". Established in 1987, 8x8 has been awarded 81 US patents and works with businesses of all sizes (though primarily small and medium sized businesses) in different areas such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone service, contact centers, hosting solutions, video conferencing, and unified communications. 8x8 aims to be a one-stop shop for everything cloud, and has been delivering cloud services since 2002. Its CEO, Bryan Martin, has been with 8x8 for over two decades and is quite familiar with the business; he was also named one of the ""Top 100 Voices of IP Communications"" by Internet Telephony magazine.What is VoIP? VoIP is the primary method in which 8x8 delivers its services, so understanding how it functions is vital when considering the business as an investment opportunity. VoIP technology enables communications over the Internet through the compression of voice, video, and/or other media into data packets that can be efficiently transmitted over data networks and then converted back into the original media at its final destination. VoIP differs from traditional telephone networks in that it allows the packets to 'change'; traditional methods tend to use a fixed electrical path to carry voice signals through a series of switches. VoIP has experienced growth, as demand for lower cost telephone service has grown and VoIP calls have become more reliable and offer more services than traditional calls. With VoIP, bandwidth, the primary 'resource consumed' when transferring data, is only consumed as needed. Generally, significantly more traffic can be transmitted over VoIP networks compared to traditional networks. The growth of VoIP is part of a broader movement by businesses towards the cloud. Previously, on-site IT systems were prevalent; now, with a globalized economy and with firms having offices across the world, the 'cloud' has experienced increased demand as firms need to access data from differing, remote areas of the world. VoIP is described in full on the company's annual report, found through its investor's website (linked above).8x8 services begin with the business telephone service: launched in 2004, targeting small and medium-sized businesses. This service allows users to have any telephone number regardless of geographic location due to 8x8 running software that runs on computing platforms located in its data centers. Users with access to a high-speed Internet connection can partake in the platform from anywhere in the world. Next, the Virtual Contact Center, which requires no specialized hardware or software, allows companies to operate multi-channel contact centers. The company also offers 'virtual office pro', which allows users to control advanced business communications online, and IP Telephones, which are plug and play telephones. In May 2010, the company introduced managed hosting and cloud computing solutions.While the company has made a name for itself for reliability and successful operations, it does have many competitors of many different sizes and specialties such as Cisco Systems, Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), Avaya Holdings Corp., Mitel Networks Corporation (NASDAQ:MITL), Shoretel, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHOR), and Toshiba.Q1 2012 Results:8x8 reported $25.3 million in revenue in June, a 36% increase in revenue year over year and beating analyst expectations of $24.9 million. Meanwhile, its EPS was up to $.05 compared to an estimated $.03, growing nearly 100% from last year's $.03. Reasons for the revenue growth: average business customers paying $250 in average recurring monthly revenue, up from $200 a year ago, and business churn reduced to 1.7% from 2.1%. Thus, the company is keeping more customers while, on average, getting more sales from them. Furthermore, the company announced some key customer wins, fueling the top line. Frost & Sullivan, an industry research firm, has identified 8x8 as the company with the largest installed customer base with a market share of 7.9%, the ""clear leader"".In a breakdown of revenues, service revenue from the cloud PBX business represented 70% of total revenue, an increase of 23% year over year. The company sees revenue growth accelerating, and noted in the Q1 call that only 8% of the US business market has adopted the improving cloud technologies, leaving a lot of room for future growth.The takeaway: the headline here is churn, and 8x8 sees the number remaining where it was this quarter for the future (it mentions in Q&A that it's hired an individual, Eric Goffney, who's implemented a number of customer retaining initiatives). The Frost & Sullivan report points to a growing market with a number of competitors, but 8x8 has positioned itself well.Financial Ratios:8x8 currently trades at a P/E of 35, and is priced at a forward P/E of 26.25 for FY2013 and 19.44 for FY2014, if it meets analyst expectations. Management mentioned in the Q1 call that growth of 23% revenues in its core business is a fair number to look at moving forward, so investors are awarding the stock a higher P/E based on growth projections. In a different look at growth, the PEG ratio stands at 1.05 based on annual EPS growth of 33.3% ($.20 projected for the upcoming year compared to $.15) and the company is fairly valued based on this metric. Meanwhile, the company is very liquid at a current ratio of 3.43 based on the most recent quarterly balance sheet.Perhaps a fair competitor to compare 8x8 to is Mitel, which boasts a similar market cap (236.5 million compared to 8x8's 387.4 million). Mitel currently earns revenues of 612 million compared to 8x8's 85.8 million and is poised for growth as well, trading at a PEG of .36 and a P/E of 4.93, both much lower than 8x8's although they occupy the same sector. Mitel's EPS growth, however, is significantly lower than 8x8's, and that is perhaps where the disparity comes into play. Mitel is expected to grow EPS by 13.5% this year, while 8x8 is expected to grow EPS 33.3%. 8x8 also has a stronger balance sheet and short-term liquidity with a current ratio of 3.43 compared to Mitel's 2.13.DCF:Free Cash Flow Section:Sales growth is based on analyst estimates for FY 2012; I believe growth at 16% in FY 2013 is too low but will take it as a conservative estimate (management says it is too far out to predict based on sales cycle, there is no reason to think that growth should slow significantly given the strong position 8x8 holds in terms of market share, competitive edge). EBITDA % margin increases marginally to mid 12% by FY 2016, the company should be able to bump its margin up by a few points each year (and this is evidenced in the past few years EBITDA growth). Perpetuity growth rate is estimated at 6%, which is more than GDP growth but more than half of the forecast period's assumed growth rate.Taxes are estimated at 40%, based on Q1 conference call. To handle the one-time gain on the patent sale, I add 12 million to EBIT. Then, I subtract the 12 million out of the tax estimate to get taxes on EBIT without the gain on sale, and subtract $450,000, as that is what management expects to pay in taxes for the gain on sale. It looks like this: (EBIT+12 million) = EBIT on DCF; Taxes = (EBIT on DCF-(Tax Rate * (EBIT on DCF - 12 million)) - $450,000.Capital Expenditures are estimated at 2.4% of sales as per the conference call, an additional $400,000 is added to FY 2012 due to one-time tenant improvements for a facility in San Jose. Change in net working capital is based on recent large increases in current assets relative to total current liabilities and I foresee that continuing moving forward.WACC Calculation:The company currently carries no debt (taken from most recent balance sheet); equity to total capitalization is therefore 100%. Levered beta, in turn, is the same as the regular beta (1.65). WACC comes out to 13.7%, the same as the calculated cost of equity. This is below Bloomberg terminals' WACC of 14.6% for 8x8, but above Bloomberg terminal's WACC of 9.3% for competitor Mitel.Implied Share Price: $9.69, representing nearly a doubling in value relative to 8x8's $5.25. This would put the stock at an extraordinarily high P/E of 64.6 and would double the PEG to around 2.The Chart:The stock has experienced a dramatic appreciation following beating earnings in July, rising nearly 40% in less than a month. Following this, both the 20 day and 50 day moving averages moved from testing the 200 day moving average to accelerating above it. The MACD reflects the rise, with the MACD creating some distance from its signal line. The stock has been trading in a general uptrend, and is trading near its top bollinger band, but in a market correction will most likely test $4.8, a dual support of the 20 day moving average and the low following the significant earnings beat related buying.Conclusion:After looking over the sector, 8x8's most recent results, and comparing it to a competitor in terms of valuation, 8x8 appears fairly valued when looking at the short term. Although 8x8 has a strong balance sheet and strong growth potential (solid results in a growing sector), the company trades at a very high P/E and a more or less average PEG, indicating that the expected growth of 24% is already priced into the stock. Further growth gains will propel the stock higher, but the sector is competitive and most near-term growth is priced in. One thing to keep in mind is that the company is currently tied to small and medium sized businesses, which have struggled in the floundering economy. Another note: analysts expect growth to decline to 16% two years out, while 8x8 did not offer projections because its sales cycle is too short to deliver any kind of forecast.In sum, if 8x8 is able to produce growth at the current pace this year and next (which is not unreasonable considering that demand for cloud storage should increase and it has the largest market share according to an independent researcher) it will surpass analysts' current expectations, specifically in the long-term, and shine. However, in a 1-year time frame, much of its growth is baked into the stock and the stock is fairly valued (unless one believes a PEG of higher than 1 is warranted).In the long-term, however, I believe that the DCF holds weight and a price target of $9.69 in as little as a year and a half (allowing this year's baked in growth to play out, and prove that growth for the coming years will remain strong) is feasible. Investors in the stock should be prepared to hold the stock for more than one year and should view the trade as a growth play. Waiting for a lower entry point is entirely reasonable, especially given the beta of 1.65 - if the market faces a correction for any reason and the stock tests $4.80, I will most likely initiate a position.Note: After this analysis, I also believe a closer look at Mitel is warranted, and will do so in the near future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
688471,31971,2012-06-27T16:55:05-04:00,,"Cloud communications and computing solutions provider 8x8, Inc. (NYSE:EGHT) sold part of part of its patent portfolio to an undisclosed bidder. In a press release issued by the company, Chairman and CEO Bryan Martin stated, ""We are pleased to report a significant success in monetizing a subset of the Company's portfolio of patents."" EGHT's regulatory filing discloses that the company ""sold a family of patents to a third party for $12.0 million plus a future payment of up to a maximum of $3.0 million based on future license agreements entered into by the third party purchaser.""EGHT's press release was published Wednesday, June 27th, before trading opened, and by the end of the trading day, the company's shares were only up $0.02 per share, or 0.48%, closing at $4.16. Trading volume was more than 15% below EGHT's average. The market currently values EGHT at slightly under $300 M, but the sale may value the patent portfolio at more than double that amount.Information disclosed indicates EGHT ""has assigned a family of its United States legacy patents,"" and that it holds more than 80 U.S. patents. Of course, holding 80 U.S. patents is not equivalent to having 80 patent families. International patent databases indicate fewer than 50 worldwide patent families for EGHT, suggesting that today's announcement transfers about 2% of the company's patent holdings.If the announced sale is representative, then EGHT's sale of 2% of its IP for $12 M (plus potential for additional future revenue) values the total portfolio at more than $600 M, indicating that, on patent value alone, the company is currently significantly undervalued in the market.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
872801,33161,2012-09-18T06:20:25-04:00,,"8X8 Inc (NYSE:EGHT) has experienced a year of aggressive growth with the stock price increasing nearly 86% this year. This movement in price has added over $200 million in shareholder value to the firm, and through this analysis, I present my belief that further upside is entirely likely.Returns are KeyWhen a firm grows very rapidly in terms of share price, investors should attempt to isolate the cause or driver of price change. Frequently, shares are driven by speculation or investor euphoria; however, on occasion, tangible, fundamental performance lies behind a run-up in price.EGHT has demonstrated, through its return on assets and return on equity, that it is experiencing fundamental growth. Return on assets is a ratio that divides the profit of the firm by the assets utilized to generate profits and it tells an investor how effectively a firm is using its tangibles to produce value.Return on equity is a ratio that is calculated as net income divided by directly invested shareholder equity and the figure tells researchers how well management uses investments to generate profit.Click to enlargeThe chart above shows nine years of return on asset and return on equity data for EGHT. The first thing that investors should notice is that for the past nine years, 8x8 has consistently performed better in each of these metrics.Until 2008, return on assets and return on equity were negative. This means that between 2003 and 2008, the firm consistently lost money; however, it is important to note that as time progressed, EGHT was able to slow its losses. The firm began earning a profit in 2009 and ever since, it has consistently grown its asset utilization effectiveness and shareholder investment returns.A firm that demonstrates a steady, and growing, history of returns is one that may warrant an investment. We should not blindly invest in any firm that has a history of returns, however. In order to better position ourselves in a security, we should examine if it has a growing profit margin.Profit margin is a ratio that basically tells the researcher the percentage of every dollar of revenue that is transcribed into profit. As profit margin increases, it means that a firm is becoming better at defending its competitive edge and is able to translate this edge into bottom-line performance.The above chart shows five years of profit margin for EGHT. As previously mentioned, the firm was not consistently profitable until early 2009. Since then, however, the firm has been able to maintain its profitable edge and in the most recent quarter, profit margin increased by 20%. This increase in margin indicates that the trend of profitability established in 2009 is not only likely to remain, but also strengthen as time progresses.A firm that demonstrates excellent returns that are growing and a strengthening profit margin represent a fundamentally sound organization. From both a return and margin standpoint, it is evident that EGHT is demonstrating the competitive edge necessary to not only rival competition, but also to thrive in this difficult business environment.Many individuals get caught up in the news of an organization or current product development, but I believe that the past is a good guide to the future and by studying the historic strengths and weaknesses of an organization from a balance-sheet perspective, we can best position ourselves to make intelligent investment decisions. For this reason, I view EGHT has a fundamentally sound stock.Even if a firm has an excellent history of returns and successfully defends its lead against competitors, we should not blindly purchase the stock. In order to best time our investments, we should utilize simple technical reasoning as to when to enter a position. EGHT has had a powerful year and if we were to blindly purchase the security today, we could potentially be exposed to a downdraft in prices, as the market consolidates or early investors bank some profits.The technical definition of an uptrend is higher highs and higher lows as time progresses. If we believe that prices are going higher, then we should only purchase when the stock has made a new high, because by definition, the trend will have resumed. This said, I believe the best time to enter the stock is if the price is able to overcome $6.50 per share. By waiting for this price level, we position ourselves to enter into the beginning of a resumption of the stock trend that has propelled prices for the past three years.EGHT has a violent history of pullbacks in share price and by waiting for a new stage of uptrend to form, we can better protect ourselves from price uncertainty. Not only do we need an entry point into a security, but we also need to establish clear thresholds that will invalidate the timing of our research or tell us when to exit the security.Due to historic areas of consolidation, I believe that if the price falls below $4.70 per share, then investors should exit all shares of EGHT and I will consider this analysis to be ill-timed. Additionally, for any investors who delay purchase until the price overcomes $6.50 per share, I believe that a stop-loss on this trade should be around $5.50. If the price falls below $5.50, the price will have technically ended its uptrend and will be in a period of sideways consolidation.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

(NYSE:EGHT) represents a unique opportunity for investors to participate in a potentially valuable takeover play in the cloud communications and cloud services space. While the company has been in business since 1987, in the most recent years investors have been able to publicly invest in what amounts to a unique ""venture-type"" start-up situation.Unlike most venture start-ups, however, 8x8 is highly profitable and has a revenue run-rate which should be well above $120 million in the upcoming fiscal year (FY'13). We believe the current cloud space environment, intellectual property litigation, market dynamics, and competitive advantages of the company make it a high-value takeover target. We believe a near-term valuation of $8.50-$9.38 is likely in a potential bid (based only on FY'13 expectations). If you extrapolate out to FY'14 models, a value of $10.40-$11.38 is reasonable.On January 18, 2012, 8x8 reported their Third Quarter Fiscal 2012 results of $23.3 million and net income of $2.6 million (a net income increase of 73%), or .04 per share. This represented a 31% increase compared to the same period last year and a 17% sequential increase compared to revenue of $19.8 million in the prior quarter. Total revenue from business customers grew 42% year over year. Churn rate (accounts canceled due to hardship or other reasons) decreased to 2.0%, their lowest on record. Cash on balance sheet increased to $21.9 million. These are incredible growth numbers and very consistent from the company over the past several quarters.BackgroundIn 1987, under the name Integrated Information Technology, 8x8 originally developed semiconductors for use in programmable multimedia silicon solutions. From 1987 to 2002, 8x8 was a supplier to telecom companies (many of whom have since gone out of business) in the videoconferencing and VoIP chip markets. It was not until 2002, that 8x8 transformed their business from an OEM, to a consumer focused company, selling directly to the end user.In 2005, the company transitioned its entire business plan to focus specifically on the hosted (cloud) communications market for businesses. Shareholders should concentrate directly on the years 2005 through present to gain an appreciation of 8x8's growth trajectory.Current Service Offerings8x8 truly is unique in that investors are able to participate in a company with a solid balance sheet and current annualized revenues of nearly $100 million - but also invest in a company with potential rapid growth rates seen mostly in entities that are private and venture-stage. Their offerings extend well into the cloud sector, under a single umbrella. This enables 8x8 to ""cross-sell"" their products to existing and prospective clients, and have multiple entry points for new sales under one single source.8x8's current ""cloud"" business services can be divided into three segments:1. Unified Communications:8x8's ""gold standard"" offering, in which they essentially own the SMB (small-to-medium business) market. This product represents the ""cloud communications"" segment of their portfolio of offerings. These are advanced business telephony services supplied to SMB, enterprise business market, and government and municipalities - all extremely user-friendly.We strongly highlight that, according to 8x8's Investor Presentations, their current customer set has extremely well known, large enterprise customers as well as large government agencies. Again, we suggest, as an investor, you pay attention to their ability to focus and rapidly penetrate the enterprise and government sectors. According to the company, their current enterprise customers (both communications and data) include: McKesson (NYSE:MCK), New York Life, McLarens Young International, HomeAway (NYSEARCA:AWAY), RE/MAX, Aflac (NYSE:AFL), Unisys (NYSE:UIS), Allstate (NYSE:ALL), Nationwide, Keller Williams, Adecco (AHEXY.PK), H&R Block, AOL (NYSE:AOL), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Ameriprise (NYSE:AMP), Prometheus, State Farm Insurance, Farmers Insurance, among others.Their partnership with Level3 (NASDAQ:LVLT) has allowed 8x8 to be a contractor on Networx and WITS 3 Contracts for the Federal Government and State and Local Government. Again, we strongly advise investors pay attention to 8x8's ability to expand rapidly into this potentially huge area of growth. Current list of contracts include: Federal Maritime Commission, U.S. China Commission, Administrative Conference of the U.S., Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. State and Local Government includes: City of Garden Grove, CA., and Indiana Public Retirement Systems.The ability of 8x8 to move ""upscale"" into the large enterprise and government services market is a testament to future growth potential. 8x8 currently dominates the SMB market (serving the 2- to 20-person company), however, in recent quarters, they have been able to quickly expand their service to the aforementioned entities, with seats of 100 to 1,400 persons. We expect 8x8 will further penetrate this enterprise and government market and continue to win bids against major market players such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Avaya.We expect, going forward, 8x8 to become one of the dominant players in this segment - competing on the same level of a Cisco Systems. Further, at the end of last quarter, 8x8 announced they have signed 54 distribution partners, including 3 strategic telecommunications providers now distributing call center services - many of these have yet to even start selling 8x8 services.In an example of the market penetration 8x8 continues to have with large-enterprise and government sales efforts, the Indiana Public Retirement Systems, according to a recent 8x8 presentation, signed a contract with 8x8 for 360 phone lines, 40 call center seats, as well as cloud storage. All three services were ordered at ""point of sale."" We can estimate a phone line at $25/month, and a call-center seat at approx. $125/seat - or approximately $14,000/month, or $42,000/per quarter revenues from this one, single contract (model excludes cloud-storage).Competition in this area would be Shortel, CBeyond, Vocalocity, Cisco, Avaya, among others. We believe 8x8 has a competitive advantage in pricing, the broad ""one stop shopping"" scope of their offerings, and the fact that 8x8 completely owns all of their patent and intellectual property (a strong part of our thesis of 8x8's attractiveness as a takeover from a multinational player in the industry).Another potentially huge untapped area of growth for 8x8 is in the global markets. A development which 8x8 has yet to announce is their ""Global Reach Initiative.""On February 1, 2012, Voxbone announced that is ""providing geographical and toll-free numbers to help cloud communications provider 8x8 Inc. expand its international calling capabilities to serve larger business customers on a global scale. The new relationship with Voxbone enables 8x8 to provide geographical and toll-free numbers for business customers with offices outside of the United States.""Mehdi Salour, 8x8 Vice President of Network Operations, was quoted in Voxbone's PR as saying, ""Along with the adoption of our communications services by larger-sized businesses, we are seeing an increased demand to provide 8x8 services and phone numbers outside of North America, particularly where the customer requires a follow-the-sun contact center support strategy. The addition of the Voxbone portfolio of numbers in conjunction with our expansion into data centers in Europe and Asia will greatly enhance our ability to satisfy these customers.""We eagerly anticipate hearing more about 8x8's ""Global Reach Initiative"" shortly, as this would provide a tremendous source of new and yet-to-be-forecast future revenue growth.2. Hosting SolutionsThrough the acquisitions of small private entities such as Zerigo and Central Host (which cost the company well under $5 million USD), 8x8 was able to expand their offerings into yet another strong area of growth: the Cloud Data Services Market. Rackspace (NYSE:RAX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), LiquidWeb, and Giganet are primary competitors in this segment of the market. 8x8 also acquired the VBlock Infrastructure for enterprise-grade and government contracts.A recent study from IDC predicts cloud related service revenues will grow 28% annually through 2014. IDC also predicts that revenues generated from cloud servers will reach $9.4b annually by 2015, with demand for cloud servers growing 21-22% annually over the next five years.This is the segment of the company we feel is in the ""venture,"" exponential growth rate stage. As previously mentioned, in 2005, 8x8's ""Revenue from Business Customers"" was ~$2.0 million/year. By March 31, 2011, 8x8's ""Revenue from Business Customers"" exceeded $60 million. This is an increase of nearly $60 million in 6 years. Assuming 8x8 can grow the ""Hosted Solutions"" in the same manner (at a minimum), in 5 years the company could also be reporting revenue of at least $60-$80 million in this segment of the company.Bryan Martin, 8x8's CEO, was quoted as saying, ""Over time it wouldn't surprise me to see a 50-50 split (between VOIP communications and Hosting Solutions) because hosting is growing so quickly and is so applicable to our customers."" If we follow the CEO's comments, our estimates could be much too conservative.Recent large customer wins from 8x8 include The City of Garden Grove, CA (which uses the service as a cloud-based disaster recovery service), as well as EBMUD (a California public utilities company also using the service as a cloud-based disaster recovery solution for premise-based call center operation).3. Contact Center/Virtual Call Center SolutionsIn 2012, 8x8 acquired Contactual in a stock deal worth ~$27 million. At the time of acquisition, Contactual had annual revenues of ~$10 million and growing at an annual rate of ~20%. Virtual Call Center growth is expanding exponentially, and is replacing, once again, expensive on-premise based equipment. According to Contactual, ""Dozens of Fortune 500 companies that could afford to spend millions on a call center solution selected Contactual over the traditional on-premise providers.In addition, small businesses can finally experience the benefits of a fully-featured call center application that, until now, was financially beyond their means. Contactual's OnDemand Contact Center is the most innovative and flexible offering among call center providers and allows any organization to quickly and easily reinvent their customer interaction experience for all of their customer contact methods or for a single method such as email response management.""Enterprise customers which 8x8 acquired as of a result of the acquisition include AmericanExpress (NYSE:AXP), Sony, Hitachi, General Electric (NYSE:GE), Agilent (NYSE:A), Schneider Electric, Walgreens (WAG), CORT, Olympus, Hewitt, Boston Market, and Savi, among others. In the mid-market, customers include NetSuite, Elance, SkinMedica, Dentisoft, Lumens, bytescribe, TradeCard, and Yale University, among others. We believe this acquisition will be a massive opportunity for cross-selling existing telephony and hosting services to these large enterprise and mid-market customers.Again, this solution is the future of call centers: hosted, on-demand, virtual call centers - no more expensive legacy equipment. It is a high growth area and we expect 8x8 to have remarkable success growing the business, cross-selling the product with existing services, and further expansion into the large enterprise customer market. We believe 8x8 can grow this segment at much more than pre-acquisition rates of 20%, and view 20% as extremely conservative going forward.Intellectual Property - A Potential Multimillion-Dollar Asset8x8 currently has 79 patents with the USPTO. While we believe all of the patents have value, it is the intellectual property patents granted during the last several years that hold most of the potential. ""Virtual Telephone Extension,"" ""Communications Controller,"" ""Arrangement and Method of Internet telephony,"" ""Videoconferencing Arrangement Having Multi-Purpose Digital Still Camera,"" ""Speech Processing,"" ""Network Communications Having Endpoint Device with Automatic Connection to IPBX,"" ""Voice Over Internet Processor,"" ""Sensor-Controlled Telephone System,"" and several other notables including multiple patents related to videoconferencing are a large hidden asset at 8x8.We believe 8x8 patents could hold value of up to $50 million for their entire patent portfolio. We also believe, after listening to company conference calls, that 8x8 consistently receives bids for some of their patent families. Should 8x8 decide to license or sell some or all of these assets, we believe it could add between $15-50 million as a hard asset on their balance sheet. It is our supposition that this is quite possible as evidenced by recent litigation in the technology space between several large multi-national corporations (Yahoo v. Facebook, Apple v. Motorola, ZTE v. Ericsson, HW Tech vs. Google et al, etc., and bidding wars over Nortel Network's patent family).We believe the current share price of 8x8 does not even remotely represent the true value of the company due to very simple factors. First, current sell-side analyst coverage is minimal and the only coverage is from little known, third and fourth-tier firms. Some of the analysts covering the company, in our opinion, have very few followers and we highly question their industry respect. Their coverage was likely initiated after clients of their firm specifically requested coverage of the company because they had a vested position in the company.Essentially, what shareholders are currently left with are reports from some of these firms, upgrading and downgrading the company after the stock moves in increments of $1.00 - $1.50. Further, the problem with having coverage from low-tier firms is that in many instances, upgrades and downgrades are done to ""drum up"" trading revenues in low volatility markets. Low-tier firms are struggling in today's environment and tend to ""churn"" ideas simply in an effort to boost trading revenues - all of the aforementioned, extremely unprofessional in our opinion.8x8 has done a fair job at promoting the future of the company at first and second-tier investment banking firms at technology conferences. The sad reality about the lack of ethics on Wall Street is that most investment banking firms will not initiate coverage on a company, no matter how good, if the company is not paying banking fees to the firm, through either corporate financing or some other structured deal. So, unfortunately, 8x8 is left with a lackluster following of third and fourth-tier firms that add minimal to absolutely no client value.Secondly, we would prefer 8x8 management to be a more dynamic team. Their current management team is good, but not outstanding or visionary. We would prefer a visionary as CEO, or, at the very least, to fill a vacant Director spot with a true technology visionary - a current or former star in the industry. 8x8 has done a decent job recently with replacing two Board members with Vikram Verma (currently President of Strategic Venture at Lockheed Martin), and Mansour Salame (former Founder of Contactual).Also, 8x8 hired Kim Niederman, who now serves as President of 8x8 (formerly Sr. V.P. of Worldwide Sales at Polycom and other senior positions at Cisco Systems). We, however, still prefer a more dynamic visionary, at the very least, serving on the board. We feel this would greatly enhance shareholder value in the company.Valuation8x8 at a current market-cap of ~$270 million is not being valued properly in the market. It is undervalued in our opinion - plain and simple.EGHT is currently trading well under 3x FY'13 revenues. The current enterprise value is ~$250 million. FY'12 Q4 income will be reported in the next couple of months and we fully expect, at a minimum, $25 million topline revenues. Our conservative model would suggest FY'13 (which begins in April, 2012) to have topline revenues of at least $125 million. FY'14 would suggest revenues of around $160 million.When recently asked about operating margins, CFO Dan Weirich stated that they intend to aggressively ""grow the topline well in excess of over 20%"". We believe this is conservative, and highly attainable. Again, our projections of FY'13 and FY'14 are based on a conservative model. Further, we think it is a mistake for current analysts to rely too much on EPS forecasts as operating margins will likely bump around as they continue to aggressively grow the company.It makes no sense whatsoever for a high growth company like 8x8 to focus too much on solely ramping up EPS, while not pursuing aggressive growth of the topline. For instance, if 8x8 simply decided to maintain status quo and pursue moderate growth, they could very easily achieve .05/EPS per quarter going forward. Even with increasing SG&A due to growth expansion, we still think it is quite possible EPS will increase exponentially.Our thesis on our long position remains that the company is a high potential acquisition candidate based on its current revenues and growth trajectory in cloud computing/services, potential global outreach, developing partnerships and channels, and largely in part due to its wholly-owned intellectual property patent portfolio. Patent wars are heating up, and are not going to go away. Nor is the cloud-services space and hosted computing.The sector is growing exponentially and the legacy telecom and cable providers, as well as premise-based telecom equipment makers will see further erosion to their markets as well as earnings. In 2010, Google purchased VoIP provider Global IP Solutions for $68.5 million or 6x revenues. In 2011, Microsoft paid 32x Skype's adjusted earnings in their acquisition of the company. Shortel (NASDAQ:SHOR) recently acquired M5 for, we estimate, 4x revenues.There has also been a flurry of private and public managed cloud services buyouts in the past year. In 2011, Verizon bought Terremark, a cloud services company, for $1.4 billion. Small private companies have also fetched high multiples in acquisitions. 4-6x revenues would not be out of the question, whatsoever, for 8x8.Potential acquirers would be cable companies such as Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), large telcos such as AT&T (NYSE:T) or Verizon (NYSE:VZ), equipment makers such as Cisco or Avaya, large technology corporations such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), and even social media corporations looking to broadly expand their business services, such as LinkedIn (LNKD) and Facebook.Assuming a conservative 4.5x FY'13 revenue model, we could see 8x8 being acquired for $612 million (4.5x revs + $50 million for Intellectual Property), or approx. $8.50/share. At a higher multiple of 5x revenues, we derive $675 million (w/IP), or $9.38/share. Assuming a conservative FY'14 revenue model, 4.5x w/ IP equates to $770 million, or $10.40/share. At 5x revenues, $850 million, or $11.48/share. The point is, it will not get cheaper for a potential acquirer as time passes.Even if our thesis that 8x8 is acquired does not come to pass, the company still should be trading inline with other SaaS providers out there. 8x8 should, at the very least, be trading between 3.5-4.0x FY'13 revenues, or $6.25-$7.14/share, conservatively. We maintain that 8x8 is extremely undervalued.Disclosure: I am long EGHT.Disclaimer: This is our thesis.

277140,24593,2011-06-29T08:06:04-04:00,,"Shares of 8x8, Inc. (NYSE:EGHT) are up more than 50% within the past three months, and since August of 2010 shares are up more than 210%. I've owned it at various times in the past year and I still check EGHT share prices every day on the hour. And yet, I've hesitantly stayed on the sidelines during the most recent run up.First some basics. 8x8, Inc. offers integrated voice, video and mobile communication solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. In 2002 8x8 entered the VoIP market catering to small and medium-sized business with their cloud based operating system. The company has a market capitalization of $278 million; the 52 week high is $4.61, and the 52 week low is $1.25.  Recent Events8x8 has had a lot of positive information coming out of the news recently. The company joined the Russell 3000 index on June 28th and the company should gain exposure from institutional investors who use the index as a benchmark for investing.   The company has also remained active in acquiring smaller businesses to broaden their portfolio. In May of 2010, 8x8 purchased Central Host, Inc. and they also just recently purchased Zerigo. Zerigo provided virtual servers and monitoring tools for cloud based operating tools. The Zerigo acquisition looks to be a great investment as 8x8 will now have greatly enhanced cloud hosting services.It is probably no surprise that there is speculation that the company remains an attractive takeover target. On June 7th, shares jumped nearly 20% minutes before the market closed on rumors that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would partake in a partnership or takeover of the company. The rumors were false, but the price run up has still not faded.What seemed to quietly slip through the news was that 8x8 surpassed 25,000 business customers. The company also continues to grow internally and through acquisition. CEO Bryan Martin recently was interviewed on Bloomberg and stated the company is ""profitable and growing aggressively.""   ValuationEven after the recent run up in share price, 8x8 still looks like an interesting play. We can take a look at some of the highlights of their Q4 earnings report below:What may be the most attractive part of the balance sheet is that the company has no long term debt on the books and $18.4 million in cash and investments, $9 million of which is FCF. 8x8 has a PEG ratio of .8 which would indicate it is not highly overvalued.ConclusionDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in EGHT over the next 72 hours."
244783,23816,2011-01-04T14:05:39-05:00,,"8x8 Inc. (NYSE:EGHT) offers a variety of telecommunications services for IP, telephony and video applications. This includes web based conferencing, unified communications services and thanks to a recent acquisition, managed hosting and cloud based computing.The company has been shifting to an enterprise focus from a residential one where it has found a more solid growth opportunity. Recently, losses from the residential side have masked the very substantial gains on the business and enterprise side, but the residential revenues have bottomed, and overall growth is starting to become more apparent.8x8 owns several patents, has original software and generates the majority of their revenue from subscription services, about $16 million last quarter. They also sell IP telephones accounting for a small percentage of their total revenues, $1.3 million last quarter, taking a loss that helps them secure and facilitate their subscriptions.Since the product and service cannot exist without each other, it's probably a good idea to look at their operating margins as a whole, since some of the service cost of revenue may be hiding in the product cost of revenue. The overall gross margin is 68% with the IP telephones dragging down the service margin by 10%. Overall gross margin has remained at 68% for the last four quarters, up from an average of 65% during the previous four quarters.Vonage (NASDAQ:VG), although a much bigger company in the VOIP space, currently has a 65% gross operating margin focusing on residential customers. It seems that the three percent margin improvement from business customers has brought 8x8 into profitability, something that Vonage has yet to achieve.The company currently gets a little over $200 per business subscriber per month, and it is costing them about $825 to acquire one subscriber. This is a four month payback as opposed to a ten month payback for residential acquisitions over at Vonage. 8X8 has a total of 22,167 business customers, up from 21,362 the previous quarter, and up from 18,199 the previous year.EGHT bettered VG's churn rate last quarter as well, posting 2.2% compared to 2.7% a year ago, and 3.1 % two years ago. Churn rate is a measure of how many subscribers they lose per month based on the average number of total subscribers during the three month period.Better margins and a better churn rate have started to bring in earnings over the last year or two. The company earned close to $4 million or $0.06 per shares during the year ending March 31, 2010, and has already earned $0.05 per share during the first two quarters of this fiscal year.The two analysts covering this company, who were beat by a penny in each of the last two quarters, predict 3 cents this quarter, 4 the next and 17 cents for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012. A trailing P/E of 29, a forward P/E of 14 and a price to book ratio of 10 do not make this look like the cheapest stock around, but a couple of factors may help its valuation in the near future.Beating estimates again would help, as well as a share buyback program that has been ongoing for quite a while now. Shares outstanding more than doubled to 61.1 million from 2001 to 2006. Since then, total shares out have only climbed a couple of million to where they are now at 63.2 million. The company has had about $18 million in cash for the last three quarters.The buyback program was announced in July of 2009, with authorization to repurchase up to $2 million worth of common stock. In July of 2010, they extended the plan, and upped it to three million. As of September 30, 2010, the company had actually repurchased all $3 million that was authorized, and in October, they decided to authorize another $10 million.Although not a giant force to be reckoned with just yet, 8x8 has found the path to profitability in VOIP that Vonage and others have not.Disclosure: No positions"
599341,27651,2012-05-17T23:00:01-04:00,,"8x8, Inc. (NYSE:EGHT) is the leading provider of cloud communications and computing solutions for small-to-medium businesses, enterprise, and government agencies. The company's products are a suite of SaaS and IaaS solutions which include hosted telecommunications cloud software, contact center, unified communications, video conferencing, cloud hosting, and virtual private servers. The company has a portfolio of 79 patents with the USPTO and more patents pending. We believe, due to the current environment in which legacy equipment providers are seeing their business deteriorate rapidly and lose their market share to the cloud, this tectonic shift will likely force a large competitor to purchase 8x8 in the next 6-12 months for a premium of at least 2X current market-cap. We estimate 8x8 could be acquired for at least 8.00-12.00/per share next 6-12 months.Recent Financial ResultsThe company recently reported financial results for Fiscal Q4 2012. Revenue from business customers increased 44%. Total revenue for the quarter increased 33% YoY to $24.2 million. Average monthly revenue per business customer was $244, compared with $204 in the same period last year. Business churn remains at record lows. Gross margins came in at 68.4%, and service margins at 76.1%. Cash on balance sheet increased by $2.4 million to end the quarter with $24.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments.These numbers, by any means, are the foundation for a company that is growing rapidly and is experiencing the largest growth rate in the company's history. The company continued to announce that in the coming months, they intend to expand globally through new and existing partners.Rapid Market PenetrationThe space in which 8x8 currently plays is growing tremendously. According to a recent presentation by Frost and Sullivan, Hosted IP Telephony Lines should increase from 2.1 million in 2012, to 9.7 million in 2015.In March of 2012, Frost and Sullivan came out with an analysis which listed 8x8 as the top provider of installed IP telephony lines in North America (2011). When you look at the list of large telephony service providers on this list, and realize that 8x8 is listed ahead of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), RingCentral, Smoothstone, and AT&T (NYSE:T), it simply backs our thesis that it is not a matter of if, but when, 8x8 gets acquired by a large service provider.8x8 is stealing market share from large hardware providers such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Avaya, NEC, Mitel, and Toshiba. All of the aforementioned companies continue to see their market share erode from companies such as 8x8 who play in the future of the business: the cloud. We feel, it would make sense for a Cisco or Avaya to buy 8x8 as hardware companies will continue to see their legacy business erode and lose market share. On-Premise providers such as Cisco provide hardware which carries capital equipment costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars up-front to enterprise customers, and, further, monthly expenses. On a hosted model such as 8x8, there is minimal upfront costs and a much smaller monthly cost to the customer.As you can see below, 8x8 rivals the largest equipment providers in the world in terms of customer deployments.As 8x8 moves into the more lucrative enterprise and government markets, it also begins to take large amounts of revenues away from legacy telecom and equipment providers such as AT&T, and Cisco, respectively. As you will notice, 8x8 has a client list of top multinational companies who continue to save hundreds of thousands of dollars per year using their services. Again, this supports our thesis as to why 8x8 is a likely takeover target in the near term - larger competitors continue to lose market share to the cloud and 8x8.8x8 continues to take market share from the competition in the government space. The Federal ""Cloud First"" Initiative is based on government agencies, state, local, and Federal, moving their expensive infrastructure to the modern cloud infrastructure. Please notice, 8x8 is having a high degree of success in this area and continues to add large customers listed below.(The growth at 8x8 is consistent and will only accelerate in our opinion. The company continues to add larger and more lucrative contracts to its base, such as the ones in the aforementioned slides. The company continues to expand its large channel sales initiative and we would expect sales to continue to accelerate as the channel becomes a larger portion of sales.Valuation8x8 is currently valued at approximately $270 million. We believe it is highly undervalued from a current fundamental standpoint. We believe the company can continue to rapidly grow at a rate of at least 20% YoY, and could potentially see current FY 2013 revenues approaching $115-$120 million. The market is currently appropriating no value, we feel, to the company's 79 USPTO patent portfolio. We estimate the intellectual property value could be anywhere between $50 to $100 million as they hold key patents for hosted PBX, web conferencing, and IP telephony data signaling. All of these patents are directly correlated to the cloud, and the future of telephony for the next 100 years.Based on a recent acquisition by Shoretel (NASDAQ:SHOR) in which they acquired privately-held M5 Networks for approximately 6X trailing service revenues, this metric would value 8x8 at approximately $7.00/share. We feel that due to 8x8's patent portfolio, they would deserve a much richer valuation. Based on our current revenue estimates for FY2013 in neighborhood of $115-$120 million, we would estimate that, including the company's intellectual property portfolio, 8x8 could be acquired for $750,000,000 or $10.71/share. Based upon acquisition metrics in the past 12 months in the cloud space, we feel these are very reasonable assumptions.As we highlighted, 8x8 is taking market share away from the largest legacy players in the telecom area. We feel that it would only make sense for one of these players to make a rich bid for 8x8 to enhance their current offerings, and established themselves in the cloud. Accordingly, we believe their is a high degree of confidence in our thesis that one of more companies will bid for 8x8 in the next 6-12 months.This is our thesis for our position in 8x8, please do you own due diligence as we make no recommendations.Disclosure: I am long EGHT.Additional disclosure: This is not an offer to buy or sell, and not a recommendation.  This is our own thesis as to why we have a long position in the company.  Please do your own due diligence and come to your own conclusions."

(NYSE:EGHT) is a company I have been following for a few quarters and I think now is an opportune time to buy some shares.8×8 Inc. is a VoIP company that enables broadband internet users to add digital voice and video communications to their high speed internet connections. The company also offers a hosted communications solution, Packet8 Virtual Office, which delivers digital voice services coupled with powerful features for small and medium sized businesses and call centers.The amount of companies subscribing to Packet8 Virtual Office has been quickly growing over the past year. On January 8 of 2007, 8×8 Inc. reported over 6,000 companies subscribed to Packet8 Virtual Office and earlier this year 8×8 Inc. reported over 10,000 companies were using Packet8 Virtual Office.8×8 Inc. also got an influx of residential customers last year when a couple of other VoIP companies (SunRocket and an unnamed company) went out of business and referred their customers to 8×8 Inc.8×8 Inc. has reported sequential increases in revenue for the last several quarters and reported a profit of $0.01 a couple of quarters ago. They posted a loss of $0.04 last quarter but this was related to the acquisition of nearly 25,000 former SunRocket subscribers during that quarter. The company provided free equipment and shipping and no activation fees to these new customers.The CEO of 8×8 Inc. said in the Q2 earnings release “while the former SunRocket customers had a one-time negative impact on our bottom line to get them signed up on our network, we expect these new Packet8 customers will add greatly to revenues and net income in future quarters.”According to Yahoo Finance, the average analyst estimate is for a loss of $0.02 in the upcoming quarter but I don’t think 8×8 Inc. is too far away from being consistently profitable.8×8 Inc. has received a couple of analyst upgrades already this year so the potential of 8×8 Inc. hasn’t gone unnoticed.I am going to give a buy recommendation at Friday’s closing price. I don’t own any shares of 8×8 Inc. but if I had some spare money I would definitely be buying shares of 8×8 Inc. for myself."

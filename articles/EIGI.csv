This is due to the following facts:With these in mind, it's not surprising that it's seen as a potential short selling candidate by many investors. There are presently ~10.3 million EIGI shares sold short, which constitute 7.5% of its underlying shares.So Why Am I Saying This Might Be A Dangerous Short Right Now?There are several reasons for me saying this. Let me enumerate them:The Negative GAAP Earnings Are DeceivingEIGI did a large number of acquisitions; these led to a large intangibles account in its balance sheet, and these intangibles are being amortized quickly. Thus, for instance, the last nine months included a full $67.2 million in amortization of intangible assets. Adjusting for this single item would already bring that ($0.13) negative EPS all the way up to a $0.38 positive EPS.The company itself then makes many other corrections to arrive at its own version of an adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA. Other corrections are more or less spread out throughout the industry so not really contentious.Valuation Not ScaryTaking the company's adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year; $267.5 million; its market capitalization, $1.9 billion @ $13.81; and its net debt of ~$1.1 billion, we come to EIGI trading at 11.1x estimated 2015 EV/EBITDA. That's not outrageous for a company growing in the double digits and showing FCF.A Possible Positive CatalystEIGI grew both through acquisitions and by having its brands use some very aggressive marketing tactics.For a long while, it sold ""unlimited"" hosting at less than $5 per month. This hosting included unlimited disk space (though a limited number of files), unlimited bandwidth, unlimited MySQL databases (though with some size restrictions) and other such incredible specs which attracted millions of customers. The only thing keeping webmasters from hosting complex visitor-heavy websites for a pittance was CPU throttling.This, however, has been changing. And that's why in the short term this constitutes a risky short. Consider for instance EIGI's own Q3 FY2015 earnings presentation:This chart means that as customers stay longer, their websites grow more popular and more complex. They end up paying EIGI further, to have higher CPU thresholds, to have more anti-spam for their e-mails, to have dedicated IPs or even to migrate to VPSs/dedicated servers instead of using shared servers.This increase in complexity also drives an increase in loyalty. As a website becomes larger and more complex, migrating it to another ""commodity"" hosting provider becomes more costly and technically challenging. And that's where the catalyst comes in.You see, EIGI captured many customers by offering a lot for very low entry prices. However, as of today, EIGI's HostMonster subsidiary (and likely others) are redefining the tiers they offer, in this manner:As you can see, the new terms are much more restrictive regarding their specs. And what will really make a difference is that existing accounts will roll over into these new pricing structures as they expire.This will require existing accounts moving towards higher-end packages to retain the same functionality. This, in turn, will drive an aggressive ASP/ARPU ramp which should take place over the entire next year. For instance, I have a website with ~3,000-4,000 unique visitors/day hosted at hostmonster.com, and I estimate that renewing the hosting contract now will cost:Now, both of these were renewed late in 2014, so these are significant year-on-year increases. But while the price increases seem aggressive, at the same time, they're hardly a reason for a complex website to change registrar and hosting companies.Thus, while this might drive some attrition and lower growth in new users, it's also bound to greatly increase profitability over the coming year. And therein lies the danger - this catalyst is going to favor EIGI's EPS over the entire coming year.Indeed, at just 11.1x EV/EBITDA, one could argue that this catalyst not only makes EIGI a dangerous short, but it might also make it a possible long opportunity. This would be clearer if the waters weren't muddled by two effects:The AcquisitionEIGI announced it was acquiring Constant Contact (NASDAQ:CTCT) for $1.1 billion in cash.The company makes its case for the acquisition in a large presentation. I am, however, not entirely convinced of the fit. But this might come as a consequence of my better understanding of the hosting business, than of the online marketing services business, even if EIGI says there's a good fit between the two companies.This skepticism of mine, puts something of a damper on my will to buy EIGI's stock. It somehow tells me the acquisition falls outside my circle of competence. That said, if we take EIGI's guidance at face value, then the acquisition will bring the merged companies to a $350 million adjusted EBITDA level, possibly then evolving to $400 million on account of synergies.Adding $1 billion to net debt, this means the combination will initially trade at 11.7x EV/EBITDA, then possibly evolving to 10.3x EV/EBITDA. Those continue to be acceptable levels. If growth is kept alive, and the price increase catalyst makes that likely, then the resulting stock would still be attractive after the acquisition.The acquisition is thus not an obstacle for those just looking at the combined entity through valuation lenses. I myself feel somewhat deterred just by the fact that I don't see the immediate fit - but that can easily be down to my circle of competency not reaching that deep into online marketing.ConclusionEIGI is not as ugly as its GAAP earnings would make it seem. Its nature as a cloud construct to be sold in the market might look scary, but there's a measure of lock-in for long-standing clients.Taking into account these two things, the valuation EIGI trades at isn't high, and a recent catalyst in the form of price increases/restructuring of product specs will provide further earnings power starting in Q4 2015 and going forward throughout 2016. This makes it seem EIGI is a risky short and might even be a decent long.On the other hand, a large pending acquisition introduces uncertainty. In my view, the impact on valuation isn't even that large, but the uncertainty of the acquisition being a good fit is, at least for me, large.Putting it all together, EIGI still seems a dangerous short, but to see it as a long requires a deeper understanding of how the new business fits in."
1951831,54762,2014-01-17T10:00:00-05:00,,"SPECIAL SITUATIONS: New IssueCompanyEndurance International Group (NASDAQ:EIGI) is a leading provider of cloud-based solutions for small and medium sized businesses to establish, manage and grow their businesses by harnessing their web and mobile presence. Endurance was founded in 1997 and has over 3.4 mm subscribers through a family of brands including BlueHost, Hostgator, Domain.com, Fatcow, A Small Orange, iPower and iPage. The company's strategy is quite simple, but highly effective. In their own words, ""Our company's strategy is based on two simple principles: adding more high quality subscribers to our platform and then selling our subscribers more value added solutions.""Investment ThesisIt's not often that individual investors get to play the same type of ball as some of the most well-known and successful private equity and venture capital investors - the likes of KKR, Warburg Pincus, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Accel Partners. That changed a couple of months ago with the quiet Initial Public Offering of a relatively unknown firm called Endurance International Group - a company that survived the technology bust in the 1990's and grew under these investors as a private company. A couple months ago the company offered its shares to the public. The stock seems to have been abandoned as it wasn't growthy enough for the growth investors and wasn't cheap enough for value investors. While not a busted IPO by any means, Endurance offers a rare opportunity for the individual investor to play a similar game as some of the most successful private equity investors in history. Notably, KKR still owns one of its larger competitors in GoDaddy, and Warburg Pincus/Goldman Sachs are still majority holders of EIGI. The stock still trades in the $14-$16 range that the banks had initially valued the company; however it has moved up slightly from its offer price of $12 since reporting a strong Q3. We still think that the market is offering investors a rare opportunity to pick up this publicly traded LBO at a substantial discount to its intrinsic value.It is not surprising that EIGI has been owned by private equity/growth investors for the past decade as it checks off all the dream characteristics of a great private equity investment.Key RisksThe key risks to the investment are that this is a competitive industry with a constant need to innovate to drive customer growth and some of this growth will come through acquisitions, which carries the risk of integration and customer turnover. In regards to the stock, we think that the company has yet to find a stable shareholder base given its recent IPO and we expect the private equity players to monetize their investment in a secondary. This will create volatility in the stock in the coming months.Why MispricedSo why is Mr. Market offering up this stock at such a discount to its intrinsic value? We think there are 2 main reasons. First, the company just became public two months ago so like many lower profile companies, investors want to see a couple quarters of good execution. While the company did not give formal guidance for 2014 in the past quarter, they did have strong 3rd quarter and we think they will come out with strong guidance for the fiscal year 2014 when they report Q4 and 2013 results. They should easily beat their guidance for 2013 given their performance through 9/30. Second, we don't think this new issue found a stable ownership group when it became public. It does not screen well on earnings given its high debt levels, a bit pricey for traditional value guys, and growth investors were on the sidelines as the strong growth trends in the business were masked by the 2 large acquisitions that they had just made. These 2 acquisitions should fuel a strong growth trajectory for the company in 2014 and beyond.ValuationIt is important to note that the bankers initially valued EIGI and expected to price the public offering at $14-$16, but subsequently had to cut the price to $12 due to demand. That said, investors now have an additional quarter of positive results and these results exceeded all the analysts' expectations so it is not surprising to see that the company is now trading in the initial IPO range. In fact, we are surprised that it hasn't surpassed this range. Given the high debt levels we think that using a DCF based and multiple of EBITDA approach are the best ways to value EIGI. For simplicity, we will lay out the EBITDA approach here (but note that the valuation is supported by our DCF approach) and keep the math as simple as possible - as our main point is to illustrate that the company should easily be able to grow north of 20% EBITDA in 2014 - not surprising since they laid out a high teens long term growth plan for EBITDA in their q3 presentation. (See income statement below). Based on our modeling, EIGI should be able to hit 20%+ growth in Adjusted EBITDA. The two key drivers to this number are the same drivers management points to as the keys to the business: 1. Subscriber growth 2. ARPU growth. Our 2014 estimate is driven by 10% growth in organic subscriptions (keep in mind they just already posted a 10% growth without any significant sales and marketing to the new customers that came on board this year) and an average ARPU growth of 5%, well below the 9% organic growth achieved in the last quarter). Hence, we think our numbers are very conservative.With 20%+ growth in 2014 EBITDA to $250MM (from management's 2013 estimate of $205MM) and a business model that supports high teens long-term growth, the market would easily put a mid to high teens multiple on the stock. With the median comp set trading at 16x growing at a lower growth rate, we will give EIGI a slightly higher multiple of 17x EBITDA. This equates to a $24 target price on the stock, or 65% upside from current levels. In the low probability scenario that the company doesn't execute the playbook they've been executing on for over 15 years, the stock would probably trade down to near its IPO price. We like the asymmetric risk reward here which is why the company's 2 large private equity buyers haven't sold a single share. By the way, while as value investors we like to be contrarian, this one already has the support of the leading tech analysts at MS, Goldman and Credit Suisse, with the latter putting a $23 price target on the stock. That said, we do think analysts' estimates for 2014 are too conservative.Disclosure: I am long EIGI. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

2723635,52382,2014-12-03T06:00:00-05:00,"Good execution and strategically well-positioned in an industry marred by doubts over long-term growth.Decent operating metrics, expanding product offerings and geographic expansion suggest continuation of current momentum.The stock, in the coming quarters, should benefit from not just increased float and coverage, but also acquisition synergies and improving cash flows.","Endurance International (EIGI) stock has been volatile since the company went public almost a year ago. Concerns contributing to this volatility have ranged from use of acquisitions to grow, sector's long-term growth trends, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) entering the domain business to price competition in a fragmented industry. Considering the stock's jump after the recent public offering that allayed some concerns over the concentrated shareholding, one can assume that there is considerable upside as some of the above-mentioned concerns are taken care of.Concerns are mostly related to the industry in general, but looking at the improving operational trends, good execution, relative undervaluation and decent cash flows of the company, the business offers a short to medium-term opportunity worth studying. With the proliferation of Cloud-based applications for websites, the business seems well-positioned, enabling applications while sitting between subscribers and partners, even though 90% of the revenue comes from products that are owned and operated by the company.The company is executing well, while following a disciplined approach to the acquisitions. Acquisitions that constitute an integrated part of the growth strategy are accretive and help the company gain scale, ARPS (Average Revenue Per Subscriber) growth via product synergies and expand into new geographies. The industry may be mature and traffic moving towards Mobile, but the company can still grow at a low double-digit organic growth rate in a consolidating industry with decent operating cash flows.Even though the stock may not get huge multiples usually reserved for trendy tech stories, there is an opportunity as the name catches up to the peers and estimates get adjusted for acquisition driven synergies. Looking at the superior cash flow management, whether one looks at the investments like Automattic (owner of WordPress), the price paid for acquisitions or the recent stock offering, the company may even derive a valuation premium versus the peers.Organic growth pocketsAlthough acquisitions have captured much of the discussion about growth prospects, catalysts for organic growth are present and strong enough to carry the current momentum forward. Even excluding the results of Directi acquisition for the first three quarters, new paying subscribers, which were up by 286,000, increased more than the new paying subscribers in full year 2013, ARPS increased by 3% and product attachment rate of 4.6 was up 18%. Subscribers that spend $500 or more in a year increased by 21%.Quarterly results EIGIOrganic growth was due to new subscribers that contributed almost 2/3 of the organic growth and increase in ARPS that contributed the rest. Besides the increase in the basic subscription rate, which increases from $6-7 when the time customer gets on board to $9.95 by the end of first year, ARPS benefits as subscribers adopt more services like SEO (Search Engine Optimization), SEM (Search Engine Marketing), security and backup & storage. Going forward, some of the initiatives that can contribute to the organic growth rate are:Doubts over Google's entry into the domain space look exaggerated, since Google seems to be interested mainly in bringing more businesses online and adoption of its own Apps & services. For EIGI, direct revenue from Google is miniscule, but the relationship is more important due to traffic and other partnerships. EIGI has already expanded its partnership with Google to help the small-medium businesses in Africa and Southeast Asia, building on top of its existing Get Your Business Online program with Google for US and India that helped EIGI grow ARPS. The company has also launched Google Apps product suite through its major brands.Looking at the increasing share of Internet traffic's move towards Mobile, the company has launched 'Business on Tapp,' which is a beta version of its Mobile App and should help in upselling other products. Offerings like the simple to use Website Builder, WordPress hosting, SEO Gears DIY (Do It Yourself) and proprietary data analytics, which utilize EIGI's various brands across different geographies, should help drive organic growth in the coming quarters.Offering different brands in different geographies, while leveraging the common infrastructure and marketing wherewithal should help maintain and grow EBITDA at 15-20%/year. The company is offering HostGator and Bluehost brands mostly in the emerging economies, where growth in certain geographies like Brazil is close to 50% for the company.A disciplined approach to acquisitionsEven though using acquisitions for sustainable growth rarely works or gets rewarded by the shareholders, in EIGI's case it looks like it is working yet not rewarded by the shareholders. The company's goal is to get to $500 million of EBITDA over the next three years and to achieve that, acquisitions would have to be a significant contributor.The discipline followed in doing acquisitions, at least so far, has been impressive. The company intends to keep doing acquisitions at or less than 10 times EBITDA excluding acquisition synergies and 5-8 times net of synergies that are usually accrued after the full integration period of 6-12 months. The discipline is reflected in the recent acquisitions that were done for $77 million paying 5-8 times EBITDA multiple. Maintaining the same valuation discipline may get difficult as the pool shrinks and market valuations stay high, but should not be an issue in the near-term.Besides being accretive, acquisitions can also help the company via:Simple to use Website Builder is one such product that is growing fast and an acquisition can help the company offer an in-house solution. The company has recently acquired Israel-based Webzai, which does not have significant revenue, but the product can be deployed across EIGI's brands, especially those catering to the emerging markets. After product distribution arrangement with Weebly, this is a step forward to have an in-house product offering. Indeed, this should make the market more competitive for Wix.com Ltd. (WIX), the name on which I wrote a bearish piece and the stock correction since has definitely made the name more attractive, but looking at the growth profile and the valuation discount on offer, EIGI looks like a better opportunity at this time.At the right price, acquisitions can complement the subscriber acquisition efforts, especially considering the subscriber acquisition cost of almost $60-70 per subscriber and if the target company is using somewhat similar marketing programs. The company recently acquired Arvixe - which should help build scale in the hosting business and create synergies via leveraging the existing infrastructure, and BuyDomains - that can help scale up the domain offering, especially the high margin premium domain market.Not just the acquisitions, but the company's ability to find good investments is visible from strategic investments like Automattic (owner of WordPress), which powers 22% of the world's top 10 million websites, and Directi that is performing ahead of the plans, post acquisition.Financially, things should get betterRelative to somewhat similar businesses like VeriSign Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN), Wix Ltd. (WIX) and Web.com Group (WWWW), the stock trades at a discount, but the divergence becomes even bigger considering the expected growth in cash flows. If the current momentum continues, the business may even draw a premium relative to peers.Compared to the rest of the tech sector, where decade is a lifetime, the sector is definitely showing signs of maturing and valuation multiples are rightfully reflecting the same, but the business can get multiple expansion as the following improvements get reflected in the financial.Free cash flows should get a major boost next year, as the recent acquisitions and related synergies start contributing. Guidance of $650 million revenue, EBITDA of $235 million and unlevered free cash flow of $190 million look conservative, since the company has already done close to $175 million of EBITDA and $143 million of unlevered free cash flow for the first three quarters of the current year. The EBITDA is expected to grow at 15-20%.Even though the company intends to keep the leverage ratio at 4 times or less, at least for the near future, which with the fast growing EBITDA suggests that debt can go higher from the current levels of $1.1 billion, but over time as the goal of $500 million of yearly EBITDA is achieved, de-leveraging can add significant value for the shareholders. Capital expenditure should not be much different from the current levels of approximately $20-30 million.ConclusionDoubts over the space may be valid, but the company's superior execution, efforts to lead the industry consolidation and disciplined approach to acquisitions, while maintaining margins, position the company well. Organic growth rate is low, but there is predictability and operating leverage of the subscription-based revenue model is high. Near term, improving yields from the digital marketing programs and the growth of the referral partner network seems to suggest that the current momentum can carry on for a while. Decent operational and financial metrics combined with selective acquisitions should boost revenue growth, cash flows and valuation multiples. Target of $21-23 is based on 12-14 times EV/next year's EBITDA of $235 million."
3646646,61281,2015-11-04T16:32:09-05:00,"Endurance will acquire leading email marketing company Constant Contact for $1.1B.The deal will help EIGI keep up with the competition, but it will not create any additional advantages.Currently, the deal does not offer any potential upsides, but it's still far away from closing.","Web hosting giant Endurance International Group (NASDAQ:EIGI) announced earlier this week that it will acquire email marketing services company Constant Contact (NASDAQ:CTCT) for $1.1B in an all-cash deal. Both companies are significant players in their niches - Endurance is a major web hosting/services platform for SMBs, and Constant Contact leads the email marketing services market together with MailChimp.Business OverviewEndurance and Constant Contact operate in very competitive markets with relatively low entry barriers for savvy software startups. Endurance uses a multi-brand strategy backed with several acquisitions that were targeted at expanding the company's portfolio to offer a broad range of online services for small- and medium-size businesses. These services include domain registration, web hosting, website creation tools and email services through Endurance brands such as Domain.com, HostGator, justcloud.com, BigRock and more.Endurance's biggest competitor is the infamous GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY), which went public earlier this year and which offers a similar web toolset. The company started by offering web hosting and domain registration and then expanded to other areas of web services. On the other side of the competitive landscape, we can find companies that started as web creation tools and expanded to hosting, domain registration and email services like the publicly-traded Wix (NASDAQ:WIX) and privately-held Squarespace and Weebly.In recent years, web services going through a commoditization process drove monthly fees down and pushed companies to offer more complementary services and increase their portfolio to more comprehensive SMB service platforms. As competition increases in this market of consistently leading web services, companies need to expand their portfolios rapidly, either through in-house development or acquisitions.As domain registration and web-hosting prices continuously drop, companies like Endurance and GoDaddy try to increase their complementary services by adding web-creation tools, security features, and marketing tools. On the other side, companies that started as web-creation tools, like Wix, try to increase their competitive gap from Endurance and GoDaddy. As most companies offer similar services at different levels of quality and price, email-marketing service was a complementary service that most companies preferred to implement through partnering with MailChimp or Constant Contact until Wix launched its internal service named ShoutOut. Together with another unique service, like the vertical solutions for restaurants, hotels, musicians and e-commerce, it opened a gap from the other players.Added-Value DealThe Constant Contact acquisition is a reasonable move for Endurance to maintain its competitive position and not lag behind. CTCT is a leading provider of email marketing services and social media integration tools, which would contribute substantially to expanding Endurance's SMB services, as shown in the chart below from the Endurance deal presentation:Source: Endurance IRHowever, it will only enable the company to keep up with the competition it experiences from startups like Wix and Weebly. The added value for Endurance is high, however, even with Constant Contact. I'm not sure Endurance's solution is superior to Wix.Terms of DealEndurance agreed to acquire Constant Contact for $32/share, which reflects a 23% premium over Constant Contact's price on October 30. Stock prices of both companies soared and currently reflect the terms of the deal. However, the deal is still pending approval by Constant Contact's shareholders, regulatory approval and clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. The deal is expected to close during Q1 2016.Source: Endurance IRConclusionAs I mentioned above, from a business perspective, even though the deal adds value to Endurance, it only enables the company to remain on par with competition and does not create any significant advantage. The companies' stocks already reflect the deal's price and they don't have much room for gains. However, the deal is still pending several approvals, and we might see further developments in this area before the deal is closed. I will keep an eye on the deal and the web services market for any developments that might turn this into an investment opportunity."

These shareholders include private equity firms and other investors, along with the company's executives and directors.The supply shock resulting from the sudden introduction of EIGI shares available for sale on the market will likely lead a temporary decline in the price of shares, creating a potential short opportunity for aggressive investors.Since the firm's disappointing IPO resulted in a price of $12 per share, well below the expected range of $14-$16 per share, EIGI has performed unsteadily, peaking at $16.33 in early March and trending downward ever since. EIGI closed at $12.32 per share on April 16.(Nasdaq.com)Potential Unlocking of Over 100 Million SharesThe April 11 unlocking will free approximately 105.2 million shares of EIGI stock for sale, approximately five times the 21.1 million shares offered in the IPO.The two largest shareholders are Goldman Sachs, which holds 20.9 million shares through various entities, and private equity firm Warburg Pincus, which holds 64.7 million shares of EIGI. Both firms will likely sell at least some of their shares in order to raise capital and return funds to their needy investors, especially because EIGI has been less than reliable on the market.EIGI directors and executives will also likely choose to unload some of their shares, having had no opportunity to do so since the time of the IPO.EIGI's Business Is Other Companies' BusinessEIGI provides small- and medium-sized businesses with more than 150 services and products, designed to promote business growth. The firm's offerings run the gamut from email and commerce solutions and initial website design for companies, early in the creation of their online presences, to more sophisticated solutions for established firms, which include scalable and on-demand computing, storage and bandwidth, security, and online marketing, among others.EIGI currently has over 3.4 million subscribers worldwide.Diverse CompetitionEIGI faces diverse competitors, due to the wide array of products that it offers. These competitors including shared hosting providers, domain name registrars, marketing and SEO firms, security offerings, and productivity tools firms, some of which are much better capitalized and have more technical resources available than EIGI. Major competitors include giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), along with others like GoDaddy.com and Justhost.com.Conclusion For InvestorsGiven EIGI's inconsistent performance on the market thus far, a move as potentially disruptive as the lockup expiration could certainly have a strong negative impact on the price of the stock.If EIGI's principal shareholders decide to sell, perhaps to avoid further volatility in 2014, this point could present investors with a short opportunity.Disclosure: I am short EIGI.

3051336,85776,2015-04-05T15:55:46-04:00,"Endurance masks a stagnant core business (~7-8% YoY growth) through constant acquisitions, creating the false impression of a high growth and high margin company.The ROIC of these acquisitions is poor, with the lifetime value of the customers acquired in the acquisition only worth 1.4x the cost of the acquisition.Despite building a reputation as a Free Cash Flow machine, Endurance has yet to be breakeven and has relied on raising capital to maintain the illusion of growth.Management seems to see the writing on the wall, with the CEO blowing out of 30% of his stock holdings, paying himself and relatives with company funds.Almost every executive is following the CEO's example, selling between a fifth and a third of their holdings.","Recently, I noticed that Endurance International Holdings (NASDAQ:EIGI) CEO Hari Ravichandran was jettisoning stock, selling 30% of his holdings in the last six months. This piqued my curiosity and I began to take a closer look at Endurance, trying to answer what it was that would make their CEO so aggressively divest his personal wealth from the long term success of the company.At first glance, the story seemed to be a promising one. EIGI combines a core business growing at 12-14% with a history of large acquisitions, including mainstays in web hosting such as Dotster, Bluehost, and Hostgator. What also seemed impressive was the price that EIGI was able to get for its acquisitions. EIGI purchased Homestead from Intuit Websites for $60 million, acquiring an asset with $76 million in revenues. EIGI acquired Hostgator, which produced $150 million in revenue, for $300 million and Directi, which produced $48.5 million in revenue for $110 million. This ability to consistently acquire additional revenues at an approximately 2X multiple (with the exception of Homestead) has demonstrated their ability to continually drive growth in their business in a difficult and commoditized industry.How real is the organic growth?The problem is when you add in the acquisitions, the organic growth doesn't seem to be too impressive.Note: Italicized estimates assume 2X forward revenue multipleIf we include 6 months of Hostgator revenue and 3 months of Homestead revenue in 2012, along with the $7.8 million in revenues from acquisitions in 2013, we get 7% of organic growth in 2013:Similarly, if we include one quarter of revenue for Arvixe, Webzai, and BuyDomains, we get:Even with this quick analysis, it seems that management's claim of double digit organic growth is overstated. In addition, it is questionable how much of this growth is actually organic or is the result of cross-selling products to a new customer base, which would imply that the core business without acquisitions would grow at an even slower pace.How Cash Generative is the Company?When I looked at the adjusted EBITDA numbers and the Unlevered Free Cash Flow numbers, I thought the company looked healthy. Then I saw that these numbers also include changes in deferred revenue, including upfront revenues but not the costs that are incurred over time. So in order to get a better idea of the financial health of the company, I looked at the Funds from Operations including their Acquisitions:What emerges is not a company that is using its own Free Cash Flow to drive further acquisitions, but rather a company that is using debt to fund growth, masking a core business that grows in the single digits.A reason that this could be is the horrible unit economics involved in acquisitions. If we examine Hostgator and Homestead, which cost $359 million to acquire and had ~700,000 subscribers combined, leading to a subscriber acquisition cost of $513/subscriber. We can compare this to the organic unit economics provided by the company:Clearly, the ROI from these acquisitions is poor, and it is not surprising that EIGI is hard pressed to drive returns from their invested capital through their strategy.Another major concern emerges from the 10K:SourceManagement seems to see the writing on the wall.Another interesting thing that I noted in the 10K was that the CEO seemed to be paying himself and his family as aggressively as he was selling stock. The company paid in a Third Party Application Agreement with an Entity Controlled by the CEO and a Board Member $2.2 million in 2012, $3.0 million in 2013, and $5.4 million in 2014. (Refer to note 17 Related Party Transactions in the most recent 10K).SourceIn addition, the company has an outsourced service contract with Glowtouch Technologies, owned by the CEO's sister, Vidya Ravichandran, that paid out $5.7 million in 2011, $6.8 million in 2012, $7.3 million in 2013, and $10.4 million in 2014, a growth of 42.5% year over year totaling over $30 million in spend since 2011. The CEO's father and mother are also benefiting from this business relationship. The father is the CEO of Diya Systems (a fully owned subsidiary of GlowTouch), and the mother (and sister) are majority owners of the parent company, Tregaron India Holdings. (Refer to Commercial Arrangements With Related Parties in the 424B4 prospectus).SourceAlso, taking a deeper look at management's stock holdings, I found that over the past 6 months, in addition to the CEO selling nearly 30% of his position, COO Ronald LaSalvia sold 28% of his holdings, Chief People Officer Katherine Andreasen sold 33% of her holdings, CIO John M. Mone sold 22%, and Chief Legal Officer David Bryson sold 20%. What emerges is a management team who is abandoning a sinking ship at an alarming rate as their CEO pockets more and more of the spend.I am inclined to agree with management. Between the nonexistent cash flow, low organic growth, saturated market, and prohibitive unit economics, things do not look promising for Endurance International Group Holdings."
1755792,21136,2013-10-20T10:38:24-04:00,,"Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ:EIGI), a provider of various cloud-based solutions for small- and medium-sized businesses, plans to raise $351 million in its upcoming IPO. The Burlington, Massachusetts-based firm is expected to offer 23.4 million shares on October 25 at an expected price range of $14.00-$16.00. If the offering reaches the midpoint of that range at $15.00 per share, EIGI will command a market value of $1.9 billion.EIGI filed on September 9, 2013.Joint Bookrunners: Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Credit Suisse, Morgan StanleyCo-Managers: Cowen & Co, Jefferies & Co., Lazard Capital Markets, Wells Fargo SecuritiesSUMMARYFounded in 1997, EIGI offers small- and medium-sized businesses over 150 products and services oriented towards helping their business grow; these include initial website design and email and commerce solutions for companies that are taking the first steps towards an online presence along with more advanced solutions that include scalable and on-demand computing, security, storage and bandwidth, online marketing, and more. The firm currently boasts over 3.4 million subscribers worldwide.VALUATIONEIGI offers the following figures in its S-1 balance sheet for the six months ending June 30, 2013:Revenue: $250,963,000Net Loss: ($64,686,000)Total Assets: $1,515,082,000Current and Long Term Debt: $1,134,000,000Total Stockholders' Equity: $6,208,000EIGI has experienced extremely rapid growth over the course of the past three years, with revenues increasing from $87.8 million to $292.2 million-an impressive compounded annual growth rate of 82%. However, net losses grew over the same period from a loss of $44.3 million to $139.3 million.CONCLUSIONDespite the firm's massive losses in recent years, we believe that EIGI is a promising IPO for an initial one day pop above the initial price set by the underwriters. We rate the company a buy in the proposed range of $14 to $16.We strongly believe that we are currently in a bullish IPO environment where a technology cloud based company with Goldman Sachs as the lead underwriter will most likely trade up to the clouds. However, the long term performance of this stock will ultimately be based of how the company does making profits for its shareholders.EIGI's focus on small businesses should pay off handsomely as the costs of online commerce continues to decrease and small businesses become increasingly integrated into the online global economy. The firm's financial position certainly introduces an element of risk to buying EIGI, but the firm's upside justifies serious consideration of its stock.BUSINESSEIGI's diverse product offerings mean that it faces competition from several different types of firms, including domain name registrars, shared hosting providers, security offerings, marketing and SEO firms, and productivity tools firms. Some competitors are much better capitalized and have more resources available than EIGI. Major competitors run the gamut from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) to GoDaddy.com and Justhost.com.The large liabilities on EIGI's balance sheet are a significant cause for concern for potential EIGI investors; the firm has over $1.1 billion in debt, more than twice its annual revenue. Though the proceeds of the IPO will help pay off a portion of outstanding debt, the firm will remain deeply indebted and will have to spend much of its profits on debt service in coming years.MANAGEMENT and MAJOR CURRENT SHAREHOLDERSPresident and CEO Hari Ravichandran is the founder of EIGI and has held various executive and strategic positions with the firm since its inception; he took the title of President in 2009 and became CEO in 2011. Mr. Ravichandran's compensation should be closely considered by potential EIGI investors; despite the firm's growing losses, Mr. Ravichandran received total compensation of $9.6 million in 2012, mainly through stock awards.It is also interesting to note that the two major shareholders besides the President and CEO are Goldman Sachs and Warburg Pincus who together own over 80% of the company pre-IPO. This ownership stake should motivate Goldman Sachs to work diligently to get this IPO safely up into the clouds.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: This article was partially based of the company's S-1 filed with the SEC. Potential investors should read the S-1 and review it with their financial adviser before making any investment decisions."
1772742,24145,2013-10-25T02:03:05-04:00,,"Based in Burlington, MA, Endurance International Group Holdings (NASDAQ:EIGI) has scheduled a $351 million IPO with a market capitalization of $1.9 billion at a price range midpoint of $15, for Friday, October 25, 2013.Four IPOs are scheduled for this week. The full IPO calendar can be found at IPOpremium.S-1 filed October 15, 2013.Manager, Joint Managers: Goldman, Sachs, Credit Suisse, Morgan StanleyCo-Managers: Cowen and Company, Jefferies, Lazard Capital Markets, Wells Fargo SecuritiesSummaryEIGI is a leading provider of cloud-based solutions designed to help small- and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, establish, manage and grow their businesses.Organic (internally generated) revenue grew from $339.2 million in 2010 to $414.9 million in 2011 and to $474.1 million in 2012, representing a compounded annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 18%, which is not particularly impressive.Recent subscriber growth was only 10% for the six months ended June 30, 2013 vs. the comparable year earlier period. Revenue per subscriber only increased 1% for the same comparative periods.A good portion of September '13 revenue growth is due to accounting gimmicks65% of the expected increase in revenue for the September '13 quarter vs. the September '12 quarter, is attributable to businesses acquired since June 30, 2012. Only 20% is due to an increase in the number of subscribers not associated with the acquisitions.In addition, a portion of the expected increase results from lower revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2012 due to purchase accounting adjustments to deferred revenue.ValuationThis is why institutions are interested in EIGI: ""SMBs are expected to spend approximately $96 billion annually on cloud-based services by 2015, representing a CAGR of 28% since 2012,"" page 3 in the S-1 filing. EIGI is a way to play the segment.On the IPO there will be an immediate tangible book value per share dilution of $23.10.GlossaryEIGI has an accumulated deficit of over $500 million, which suggests they have never been profitable, and the price-to-tangible book value is one of the lowest in the IPO arena. This means EIGI has a substantial negative tangible book value. Financially healthy companies have a positive, not negative tangible book value.ConclusionYes, EIGI has a 99% customer retention rate. However, its year-over-year growth in subscribers is only 10%, and EIGI's revenue increase per subscriber is only 1% year-over-year, EIGI continues to lose money, and private equity owners Warburg/Goldman stripped EIGI off as much cash as they can.EIGI at a $2 billion valuation seems too risky.However, because EIGI is in a market projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 28% (which seems suspect), we are neutral to negative on the IPO.It seems that EIGI is being sold to institutions who don't do underlying financial trend analysis.To put the conclusions and observations in context, the following is reorganized, edited and summarized from the full S-1 referenced above:BusinessEIGI generates revenue by charging subscribers for the products and services that they buy.A significant majority of revenue is generated on a subscription basis, and subscribers typically pay for solutions in advance through direct billing relationships. EIGI has a 99% customer retention rate.Not particularly impressive resultsEIGI serves 3.4 million subscribers globally, after having been in business since 1997.Organic revenue grew from $339.2 million in 2010 to $414.9 million in 2011 and to $474.1 million in 2012, representing a compounded annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 18%, not particularly impressive.During this period, the subscriber base grew from 2.5 million to 3.2 million subscribers, accounting for 75% of revenue growth, with the remaining revenue growth attributable to increases in average revenue per subscriber.MarketThere are expected to be more than 76 million SMBs worldwide by the end of 2013, of which more than 43 million will have direct access to the Internet. EIGI believes SMBs form the backbone of the global economy and will continue to serve as an engine of innovation and growth.Since EIGI's founding in 1997, EIGI has focused on the needs of SMBs and have demonstrated a passion for empowering its subscribers to build their businesses and navigate the rapidly changing technology landscape.ProductsEIGI offers a platform with a wide range of products and services designed to help its diverse base of SMB subscribers establish, manage and grow their businesses.Cloud-based offerings allow EIGI's subscribers to select a customized set of solutions from among a broad range of internally developed and validated third-party products.Intellectual propertyEIGI uses open source technologies pursuant to applicable licenses as the basis for the technology platform.As of June 30, 2013, EIGI has 28 pending U.S. patent applications and several pending foreign counterpart applications relating to aspects of the technology platform and offerings, including the shared services architecture, predictive analytics methods, virtualization technologies, subscriber migration technologies and web presence improvement technologiesCompetitionEIGI doesn't list competitors in the S-1 filing. The SEC should have required EIGI to list competitors.This is a major omission by a company that wants to IPO at $2 billion market capitalization, and begs the question 'what else did EIGI omit from the S-1 filing' and why did EIGI get special consideration to omit significant information that investors should know about.DividendsOn November 9, 2012, EIGI paid a $300 million dividend to shareholders affiliated with Warburg Pincus and Goldman Sachs, the private equity owners.5% stockholders pre-IPOWarburg Pincus, 61.1%Goldman Sachs, 19.7%Use of proceedsEIGI expects to net $325 million from its IPO.

1753122,20952,2013-10-18T03:42:33-04:00,,"The offer:Endurance International (NASDAQ:EIGI) is offering 23,390,000 Shares of its common stock in the price range of $14 and $16 per share. The expected listing date is September 25, 2013, on The NASDAQ Global Market. (Source: IPO prospectus)Business overview:Endurance International is an emerging growth company, which serves ""small and medium sized businesses"", or SMBs, and provides cloud based products and services including initial website design and creation, email and commerce solutions, scalable and on-demand computing, storage and bandwidth, online marketing, security, mobile and productivity solutions. The company also offers some third party solutions through its delivery platform. The main industries, which the company serves include retail, media, recreation, merchandising, education, construction, medical, and entertainment.As on June 30, 2013, approximately 80% of its subscribers were SMBs, and it generates about 70% its revenues from the United States.Industry:There will be more than 76 million SMBs worldwide by the end of 2013, including 1.1 million new SMEs added during the year. SMEs are the backbone of the global economy, as they represent 99% of all private sector companies in the world and employ more than 90% of the private sector, non-farm workers.Financials:Key points:Positive points:1. Cloud-based products and services:The company offers the cloud based products and services. Nowadays, the cloud platform is the most popular platform among SMEs due to the various benefits mentioned below.The rising popularity of cloud based services will argue well for the company in the future, as it will bring the more business and clients.2. Huge and growing market:The total addressable market for the company is huge and growing. SMBs are expected to spend approximately $96 billion annually on the cloud-based services by 2015, representing a CAGR of 28% since 2012.3. Client base:The company serves nearly 3.4 million clients. This huge client-base not only tells about its products/services quality but also gives the company an opportunity to cross sell its products/services with minimal efforts.4. Development capabilities:The company offers about 150 products and services. A significant portion of these products and services have been internally developed. The in-house products and services generates high margins.5. Dynamic offerings:The company follows a dynamic approach toward product development and offering. As mentioned the IPO prospectus:""We regularly retire offerings that are underperforming and add offerings that we believe will be in high demand based on our data insights"".7. Revenue growth:The company showed a significant revenue growth during the past three years, as its revenue grew from $87.8 million to $292.2 million, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 82%.Key negatives:1. Loss making entity:The company is a loss making entity, as it showed a loss of 139.3 million and 64.6 million for FY 2012 and H1 FY 2013, respectively. It is expected that the company will continue to show losses in the near future.2. Competitive industry:The cloud-based product/service market is becoming more and more competitive by the every passing day, as more and more companies are entering the cloud market. Some of its prominent competitors include Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), etc.Valuations:In December 2011, entities and investment funds affiliated with Warburg Pincus and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) acquires the controlling interest in the company for a consideration of $472.2 million in cash, issuance of 150,000 shares of series E preferred stock for $150 million, and a deemed capital contribution of $55.1 million from the ultimate parent company. The shares of series E preferred stock was later redeemed by the company for $150 million. So, the investment funds affiliated with Warburg Pincus and Goldman Sachs acquires over 85% interest in the company for about $472.2 million in cash.At $15 (mid range of offer price) the company's valuations stand at $1.93 billion. At $15, the company is available at P/S of about 4.2x (trailing twelve months).This means about 350% rise in valuations in just under two years (after the recent offering).Conclusion:The company operates in a competitive and dynamic market. Its revenues showed an exceptional growth, in the recent years, mainly due to the acquisition that it made during these years. Its gross margins are low but operating as well as interest expenses are high. Moreover, its balance sheet holds over a billion dollars of debt.Considering all the above things the company looks fully priced. I am of the view that the fundamentals seemingly do not justify over 350% rise in valuations (particularly with a debt-ridden balance sheet) in just under two years, yet its presence in the cloud industry can create some enthusiasm among the investors.Data source: IPO prospectus.Disclaimer: Investments in stock markets carry significant risk, stock prices can rise or fall without any understandable or fundamental reasons. Enter only if one has the appetite to take risk and heart to withstand the volatile nature of the stock markets.This article reflects the personal views of the author about the company and one must read offer prospectus and consult its financial adviser before making any decision.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

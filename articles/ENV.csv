These write-downs are becoming more common. With 50% of its capital structure composed of goodwill, ENV's capital structures puts investors at risk.","Tolstoy, in his novel Anna Karenina, suggests that happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Can a similar thing be said about stocks? Are bad companies bad in similar ways? I'm beginning to believe that to be the case, with a few oft-recurring features: non-existent earnings growth (often with earnings in the red in spite of revenue growth), share dilution, as well as a risky capital structure.This brings us to Envestnet (ENV). ENV provides ""intelligent systems for wealth management and financial wellness,"" as it states in its 10-K. Its ""unified technology enhances advisor productivity and strengthens the wealth management process"" as well as ""empower[ing] enterprises and advisors to more fully understand their clients and deliver better outcomes.""It also has several of those features I mentioned above. Negative earnings, dilution, and a capital structure more than half of which is comprised of goodwill - for an earnings yield that doesn't beat the risk-free rate. Let's begin.There is a classic SNL skit about a change bank whose business is - quite literally - making change. If a customer comes into First Citiwide Change Bank with a twenty-dollar bill, for example, it will give him the change he wants - two tens, four fives, 20 ones, etc. - basically, the works. Jim Downey describes how First Citiwide Change Bank profits from this strategy:Of course, with this strategy, we know that First Citiwide Change Bank will make a lot of sales. If the demand for change is strong, its topline growth will be through the roof! As word spreads and demand grows, it will have great revenue increases every quarter.And no earnings.With that being said, let's look at ENV's revenue growth and see if, unlike First Citiwide Change Bank, ENV has been able to eke out a profit.ENV Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsAs we can see, despite nearly 800% TTM revenue growth over the period shown, earnings are worse than they were back in 2010, with the company failing to turn a profit. In fact, an increase in revenue has hindered its bottom line, causing COGS and SG&A to increase even more rapidly - not unlike our friends at the change bank.This raises the question: if 800% revenue growth hasn't improved its bottom line over nearly 10 years, what will it take? Growth is easier, mathematically, from smaller numbers; as revenues get bigger, and its sales take up more and more of the market, growth will be harder, and more operational cuts will be required. It is the law of large numbers:To me, this means that if ENV hasn't been able to translate sales growth into earnings growth already, it will only become harder in the future. And investors, in my opinion, shouldn't stick around to find out if ENV can eke out a profit.The next feature of bad companies seems to be - in my opinion - dilution. When a company issues additional shares, an existing investor's proportional ownership in that company is reduced. Indeed, a company's choice of capital structure may convey management's (negative) expectations about the company's prospects. While higher debt ratios are binding constraints that may signal positive management expectations concerning future cash flows; in contrast, share issues may be a negative signal about management's expectations.And as we can see, ENV has diluted shares over 22% over the last five years.ENV Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Annual) data by YChartsTo demonstrate why dilution is so bad for shareholder value (and no, acquisitions funded with shares are not an exception; they tend to fare worse for shareholders than those funded with cash), let's use the following assumptions in a though experiment:1. Let's assume that the next five years resemble the last five years and ENV increases its share count by 22.6%.2. Let's assume that ENV manages to double its revenue in that same period.3. Let's assume we buy 100 shares at its current price of ~$54.75.Source: Author's WorkEven in that very charitable situation, because it diluted its shares, shareholders will find their return muted, as we can see:Source: Author's WorkTo break it down:Now, this revenue growth assumption is charitable; I don't believe ENV will double its revenue in five years (there's that law of large numbers again!). So, the point is this. A revenue increase doesn't equal a share increase. We're rewarded on a per share basis. And management's decision to dilute shares will impact your return negatively. Thus, I believe investors should avoid dilutive companies like ENV.The third feature a lot of bad companies have - in my opinion - is a capital structure largely comprised of goodwill. It is a problem because:Hence, investors should be wary of ENV's capital structure, which is made up of more than 50% goodwill alone.Source: YCharts Quarterly Numbers & Author's CompilationAs described above, this puts investors at risk of earnings impairment charges - something that would be bad for investors' bottom line. With ENV already struggling to turn a profit, this would be very bad news for investors.Product Quality Is Built Into Its PriceLet's not forget that, no matter how amazing a company's products are, the positive sentiment regarding its products is already built into its price. This public information is not news to the market. Consider the behavioral finance research into attribution bias:Source: Advances in Behavioral Finance, edited by Richard H. Thaler, pg. 42.Here's what, in my opinion, this research means for us. When we read positive information about a company, like the positive reviews above, we need to be careful. If we were already bullish on a company like ENV, that positively-reinforcing ""news"" will asymmetrically increase our bullishness, while any negative information is discounted away.Investing shouldn't be about nice narratives. It should be about paying a good price for a company's future earnings. Narratives about products often get in the way of a true analysis of the company's profitability.As Tolstoy wrote in Anna Karenina, happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. I'm beginning to believe that a similar picture can be painted of bad firms, with bad companies having a few oft-recurring features: non-existent earnings growth (often with earnings in the red in spite of high revenue growth), share dilution, as well as a risky capital structure.ENV is one such company. Not unlike our change bank, ENV makes a lot of sales and no earnings. Despite nearly 800% TTM revenue growth, earnings are worse than they were back in 2010 and its bottom-line is in the red. (Plus, now with a denominator 800% bigger, it has the additional problem that arises from the growth from larger numbers - that is, the law of large numbers.) Next, it has diluted its shares over 22% over the last five years alone. And half of its capital structure is composed of goodwill, which puts investors at risk of unexpected earnings charges.Taking a quick look at its earnings yield shows that it's -0.15%. If an equity can't beat the two-year risk-free rate - 2.37% - it is simply not worth the risk of its shares, and investors would be better off buying that T-bill. Avoid ENV; in my opinion, it's just not worth the risk."

As the leader in Turnkey Asset Management Platform provider to wealth managers, there is ample opportunity to upsell additional tools and services they need to better-advise and improve efficiency. The company's more recent investments into Fintech, particularly Open Banking, are helping to broaden out what Envestnet can offer customers as it continues to build out an ecosystem of services to consolidate banking, wealth management, credit, loans and mortgages. We see upside potential for Envestnet given Pandemic-related tailwinds and good progress being made with Open Banking. We are long-term bullish on Envestnet.Envestnet was founded after Jud Bergman left Nuveen where he was head of mutual funds as firm was not interested in backing the venture, so he set out to create software tools that would help financial advisers break away from big institutions and set up their own shops. Envestnet grew into a major Chicago fintech firm, acquiring other companies along the way as it built extensive performance-tracking, portfolio rebalancing, administrative and other software services for adviser clients and large institutions such as Fidelity.Source: 2019 Investor PresentationAcquisitions have allowed Envestnet to take greater share of the advisory market and put data at the center of its growth strategy. Notable ones include: Finance Logix (2015) put Envestnet's data into containers and made it more nimble. Yodlee (2015) data extraction platform with existing data they could use. Wheelhouse Analytics (2016), Yodlee is the extractor for the data, Wheelhouse is the refinery. FolioDynamix (2017), took out their largest competitor, effectively locking down the entire market and acquired another 3.2m accounts with data. Portfolio Center (2019), Tamarac is built on top of Portfolio Center and bought data on thousands more firms. MoneyGuide Pro (2019), 34 years of financial planning data and access to insurance sales tools.The company has successfully disrupted the wealth management sector and is ready to disrupt the broader financial services industry by using data to drive additional value-added services to their customers like insurance and credit.The business is comprised of 2 segments:Wealth Solutions: software and services to empower financial advisors at banks, broker-dealers and RIAs to deliver holistic wealth management to their clients. The tools and services cover: financial planning, risk assessment, investment strategies and solutions, asset allocation models, research, portfolio construction, proposal generation, paperwork preparation, model management, account rebalancing, monitoring, customized fee billing, overlay services (asset allocation, tax management and socially responsible investing), aggregated multi‑custodian performance reporting and communication tools, plus data analytics.Screenshots of Envestnet Taramac, source: Company WebsiteData & Analytics: Gathers, refines and aggregates a massive set of end-user permissioned transaction level data, and combines these with financial applications, reports, market research analysis, and APIs for customers. Includes the provision of data analytics, mobile sales solutions, and online educational tools to financial advisors, asset managers and enterprises.Envestnet runs an Enterprise SaaS, as it provides asset-based, subscription-based and professional services on a B2B2C basis to financial services clients, whereby customers offer solutions based on the platform to their end users. Asset-based recurring revenues consist of fees for providing customers access to platform services. The fee percentage varies based on the level and type of services the provided, as well as the asset values of customer accounts and is therefore sensitive to market fluctuations. Subscription based recurring revenues primarily consist of fees for providing customers access to the company's platform for wealth management and financial wellness. Subscription based fees include fixed fees and or usage-based fees and vary according to the scope of technology solutions and services used. Professional services revenue is generated from client onboarding, technology development and other project related work, which tends to be more variable than the rest of the business.Envestnet's Wealth Business is exposed to a $39bn TAM of which 25% is Turn-Key Asset Management Platform or 'TAMP' and the remainder spread across specific use-cases of their technology.Source: 2019 Investor PresentationTAM growth is driven by rising number of financial advisors adopting technology, more accounts per advisor and the relevance of the technology in more verticals e.g. not just RIAs, but banks, insurance companies, private banking and credit unions. Advised assets in the USA are expected to increase from $8.4 trillion in 2017 to $12.1 trillion in 2022 Cerulli Associates an 8% CAGR.The main competitors in the TAMP space are SEI (SEIC) and AssetMark (AMK), although there are many smaller tech firms offering some of their capabilities:Source: IBISWorld 2020 Financial Planning & Advice Industry in the US - Market Research ReportEuropean competitors include Bravura, FNZ, Novia, Nucleaus, Aviva, Fidelity, Standard Life, Tilney, St James Place among others.Envestnet is the largest US TAMP by assets under management, with 42% of the US advisory market's assets on its platform at $182bn. About one-third of US advisors use Envestnet's technology:Source: The WealthAdvisor American's Best TAMPS reportWe believe Envestnet has 3 distinct competitive advantages vs peers:We ran a 2-stage DCF model using the following base-case assumptions:Expected revenue growth for the next 2 years using consensus and trailed thereafter to achieve 10% p.a. over 10 years, 2% above 8% expected TAM growth of US advised assets, reflecting Envestnet taking additional market share and expanding internationally. We expect wealth managers to continue to turn to technology providers like Envestnet to generate efficiencies, comply with regulations and compete with Robo advisors. Terminal rate of 2.0% - above current 10-year yield which is depressed given extraordinary market conditions.We expect current Operating Margins of to reach 25% over 10 years, which is in line with more established SEI (28%). This reflects the business maintaining its market position as the leading TAMP for advisors and achieving scale benefits. We also assume some light take-up of vertical services via the platform including insurance, credit and advisory marketplaces.Source: Author's calculationsOur DCF indicates that a fair price for the stock is $87, although we can certainly see an upside case towards 15% revenue CAGR and 27% Operating Margins, which would see a fair value of $131. This Bullish scenario assumes Envestnet maintains its leadership position and takes half the US advisory market which would double its revenue, but also manages to scale its credit, insurance and advisor marketplace offerings which could add another $1.5bn in revenue, or compounding at 15% each year for the next 10 years.The company is due to report next on 5 November 2020, and we believe management will surprise to the upside given Pandemic-related tailwinds and good progress being made with Open Banking, where Envestnet has agreements with 5 of the top 10 US banks and is progressing with 25 in total - we're likely to get an announcement on additional progress. On their last earnings call management talked about the strong fintech momentum they were seeing with Yodlee - we expect a continuation of this given accelerated digital adoption.Envestnet is the largest provider of wealth management technology to financial advisors with over 103k financial advisors who oversee 12.3m accounts and $3.3t in assets administered via its technology. The company is focused on growing its market share and scaling its business to offer additional products and services to further enhance its market position and deliver profitability. As the largest TAMP by far (70% of the market by assets), Envestnet has a significant lead over peers in the space, and can work from this position of strength to build out additional capabilities and functionality into its platform, in addition to taking advantage of the large volumes of data it has visibility over. We believe the stock currently trades at a slight discount to fair value, and do not think a more optimistic upside scenario is unlikely given its position of strength, it is well-placed to execute. The Pandemic should serve to accelerate the adoption of digital wealth management technologies as advisors seek to become more efficient and do more with less."
4111207,87566,2017-10-02T20:54:44-04:00,"Envestnet is a financial services company that provides financial and wealth management technology to investors, advisors, and service providers.Positive forecasts come from analysts polled by Nasdaq, who suggest that the company will grow earnings at an annual rate of 15% over the next 5 years.The share price is up 41.7% in the year to date and 37.04% over the past twelve months, and currently trades at $49.95.","By Oisin Breen, ResearchEnvestnet (NYSE:ENV) is a financial services company that provides financial and wealth management technology to investors, advisors, and service providers. The company, through its fairly recently, acquired Yodlee platform also provides data aggregation and data analytics services. As an investment opportunity itself, the Chicago-based company has had a strong year. Its share price is up 41.7% in the year to date and 37.04% over the past twelve months, and currently trades at $49.95. ENV has a market capitalisation of $2.199 billion, and interestingly, it has just agreed to buy its close rival, FolioDynamix, for what seems like a cut-price $195 million from Actua Corporation (NASDAQ:ACTA).With this purchase, Envestnet, as Ed Swenson of Dynasty Financial Partners notes, becomes ""a true leader in the [fintech, analytics, and advice] space."" Indeed, not only does the deal seem somewhat of a steal, the 3.2 million extra accounts coming on board for Envestnet is excellent news and will certainly help to address fears that Envestnet is failing to market itself as much as it could to its addressable market. Furthermore, given that the company has yet to see its share price return to previous highs after the plunge that followed the Yodlee deal, there would seem to be growth potential left in the Chicagoan company. Indeed, analysts from Stifel Nicolaus and JMP Securities seem to agree, setting price targets of $52 (+4%) and $56 (+11%), respectively. Additionally, should markets react well to the FolioDynamix deal, these price targets may need to be revised upwards.Envestnet 1-Year Share Price(Source: Bloomberg)In terms of finances, the company has seen its expenditure occasionally rise, in part based on its M&A activity, which has been consistent and targeted. Since ENV's IPO in 2010, when it was priced at $9, it has acquired companies such as Tamarac, the aforementioned Yodlee, online investment platform Upside, Finance Logix, Wheelhouse Analytics, and most recently, has set up the deal for FolioDynamix. Envestnet's most recent earnings report was broadly positive, with second-quarter earnings up 38.10% year over year, whilst the company's average growth over the past four years is an excellent 34.85%.Envestnet Earnings History + Forecasts(Source: FT)Forward guidance for the company, taken from the latest earnings transcript, suggests that revenues ought to come in somewhere between the $667 million and $673 million mark, which is growth of upwards of 15% year over year, whilst EBITA guidance expects growth of up to 29% compared to 2016, in the range of $125-128 million. EPS guidance is also positive and expected to pull Envestnet out of the brief, albeit strong, drop it has suffered in EPS terms, with the figure analysts are suggesting being around the $0.35 mark. Further positive forecasts come from analysts polled by Nasdaq, who suggest that the company will grow earnings at annual rate of 15% over the next 5 years, with earnings expected to increase by up to 89.36% this year and 29.21% in 2018. It also looks clear that longer-term investors, in the form of institutions, are also banking on ENV's steady share price rise, with institutions owning 96% of the company's stock.Forecast Earnings Growth for ENV(Source: Nasdaq)The company's financial data is, however, not all positive. It has found it difficult, over the past few years, to fully integrate Yodlee, and suffered significant share price dilution as a result of the deal. That said, these bumps seem to be coming to an end, and synergies, most especially cross-selling, as the most recent earnings call makes clear, are now driving up earnings. Profit margins have suffered, it is true, yet it should be borne in mind that growth is always costly - and Envestnet is growing. Average three-year profit margins slumped to -1.5% owing to the last year's difficulties, although these figures are also showing signs of recovery.Gross, Operating, and Net Margins for ENV(Source: Macrotrends)The company's debt-to-equity levels, in the mid 50s, whilst high are not entirely unusual, and as long as Envestnet continues to pay down its debts, which it appears intent on, given its agreements with the Bank of Canada, as mentioned in the earnings report, its debt levels do not cause immediate alarm. Nevertheless, ENV will need to consolidate its acquisitions before embarking on much more spending.That said, the company is bullish about such considerations, inclusive of the new FolioDynamix deal. Indeed, as CEO Jud Bergman notes, Envestnet has been moving towards an open-architecture strategy called Open ENV, which Bergman believes gives his company a uniquely solid method for integrating companies like FolioDynamix into its own - meaning that, if Bergman is correct, short-term negatives owing to integrating the two companies ought to be minimized, whilst synergies ought to become evident quite quickly. With the FolioDynamix deal expected to close in Q1 2018, a net boost, which the company believes will impact EPS immediately, would certainly prove to be share price-positive. Furthermore, up to $20 million in cost synergies is expected within the first 36 months. So far, so good, though the Yodlee difficulties faced previously by Envestnet should not be forgotten.Envestnet CEO on the FolioDynamix acquisition(Source: Business Wire)The fact that earnings have been on the up, much like the company's share price, that they rose by $0.15 in the last quarter and are expected to rise by a further $0.45 this quarter, does suggest that Envestnet is back on the right track, as long as the FolioDynamix deal goes as planned. Indeed, as Jefferies Group analysts note, ENV's ""fundamentals more-or-less look intact longer-term, [and] [a]ny potential stock weakness [can be seen] as a buying opportunity."" Furthermore, should Envestnet break levels of resistance, which it has been testing, of around $50.05, the stock can be expected to post steady gains in the short-to-medium term. In the longer term, with the company growing its portfolio, establishing itself as a market leader, increasing its client base, and seemingly well into the process of addressing the difficulties it has faced for the past two years, ENV may well be a stock that is worth considering for your portfolio.Envestnet Revenues and Forecasts(Source: FT)Income Statement(Source: FT)Lastly, although it is true that the company has faced difficulties, it is certainly arguable that the large drop in the share price that occurred in 2016 was an overreaction to the dilutive purchase of Yodlee. Ultimately, with this acquisition, Envestnet increased its business, gained access to noteworthy clients, including Citigroup, HSBC, and JPMorgan Chase, and it also provided the company with a strong analytics platform that in the long run will serve it, its shareholders, and its customers well. As per the earnings call, the company's subscription and licensing revenue is set to continue to grow. It increased 27% year over year to record highs, and is expected to climb a further 20%. ENV's technology sales beat $33 billion, and with 6.5 million investor accounts on board and plenty of new clients in 2017, from Quantas to India's Kotak Bank and Axis Bank, to American Century Investments and lender Sierra Pacific, and increasing demand for services from banks, including Synovus, Hancock, and First Citizens, it's easy to see the positives in a long-term investment in ENV.Envestnet Income Statement(Source: FT)"
3784856,71595,2016-01-30T08:25:18-05:00,"Worst case scenario, ENV bounces around $30 to $37, the theoretically implied range assuming YDLE adds no economic value with full share dilution.But, YDLE does add modest revenue synergies, and its data sales could make it ENV’s Alibaba, at least in the short term. However, scaling the data business isn’t so easy.Once investors recognize (within the next year) even some of YDLE’s benefits, ENV should trade beyond $37, and higher if integration issues are addressed.","Investment ThesisEnvestnet (NYSE:ENV) stock is down after a surprising acquisition of Yodlee (NASDAQ:YDLE) at a 35% premium. The acquisition is somewhat dilutive to earnings in the next few quarters with moderate revenue add, although integration issues with previous acquisitions are already a concern for management. However, I believe investors oversold ENV based on a miscalculation of the potentials behind the ENV-YDLE combination. The stock should trade prior to where it was before the acquisition announcement, with additional upside based on the growth profile of YDLE and possible integration improvements.How does ENV make money? Selling web-based portfolio management software to independent advisors.ENV, a $1.1 bil. market cap company, provides end-to-end financial productivity software and services to financial advisors, wealth managers, banks, and broker-dealers. Solutions include cloud-based customer-relation-management (CRM), financial planning, performance measurement, account aggregation from multiple custodians, portfolio research and balancing, and aggregate account taxation and billing.ENV's customers, primarily independent advisors at small/mid-size advisory firms, use ENV because of its breadth of relatively integrated, premium-tier products. Without ENV, advisors who use different solutions for separate tasks (e.g., Advent for portfolio accounting, TurboTax for taxation) or have clients keeping accounts at different banks and brokerages will need to regularly update client account info by hand. Competitors' products are generally single-purpose solutions and/or lack multi-custodian support; e.g., Schwab is still building ProjectPM after 2 years. Large enterprise clients, including Fidelity, Northwestern Mutual, and Russell Investments purchase customized, private-label platforms.ENV charges customers a percentage of their assets under management and administration (AUMA) on the ENV platform, averaging 0.12% of AUMA in 2014. ENV's fees are often highest in the business; however, advisors who used ENV to manage back/middle-office tasks grew their account base (number of accounts) around 20% over 2014, 2x the industry growth rate.What drove down ENV stock? Downgrade in Q1. EPS-dilutive acquisition in Q2.(Source: Yahoo Finance)ENV traded around $57 (close to all time high) in early April before falling 13%: from $52 on Thursday, May 7th to $45 on Monday, May 11th. The stock limped sideways until August 11th, falling 33% to $30 in one day.The two-day 13% fall occurred after ENV simultaneously missed revenue estimates in its Q1 after-hours announcement, reporting $96.5 mil. versus consensus $98.9 mil. (2.5% miss), and missed EPS estimates by a cent (4% miss). These numbers, still hitting guidance, were not as concerning as Barrington Research downgrading the stock from outperform to perform on concerns of acquisition-related duties distracting management from ENV's core business.The 33% fall occurred after ENV announced a highly dilutive acquisition of Yodlee while reporting solid Q2 after-hours results on Aug 10th. As of November 19th, ENV will issue .1889 shares of ENV (considered at $31.66) and $11.51 in cash for 1 share of YDLE. The purchase price of $17.49 per YDLE share represents a 35% premium to YDLE's pre-announcement price. ENV will issue 7 million shares, resulting in approximately 43 million pro-forma diluted shares outstanding, and pay $371 mil. in cash. Assuming YDLE's average EPS of nothing to a penny, ENV's EPS will be diluted 16% in the next few quarters.Is the 33% fall justified? Definitely not, if you believe YDLE adds even some economic value.Paying a 35% premium for 16% dilution is certainly not attractive, and YDLE's dissimilarity with ENV's core services is a sore point among influential sell-side analysts. However, I strongly believe the financial and strategic impacts of the acquisition are overblown and provide the perfect opportunity to buy ENV for at least the next 12 months.As a high-flying growth stock, ENV's share price is largely contingent on investors' expectations of future revenue and earnings growth. Over the last year, revenue growth has slowed and sell-side analysts have increasingly focused on EBITDA and margin expansion in their questions.(Source: SEC Filings)Management noted a smaller post-2017 conversion pipeline in Q4 and recently confirmed in September that account growth per advisor has slowed for ENV and the industry; i.e., ENV is transitioning into a mid-stage company after IPOing five years ago.Thus, I assume investors have known since at least November of last year that ENV's revenue and earnings growth would be slowing down in 2015 and beyond; i.e., they are not expecting ENV to somehow grow revenues at 30% to 40%.With YDLE, ENV's growth profile is largely unchanged in the near term. Management believes YDLE will add 100 basis points to upcoming revenue growth, EBITDA will be accretive in 2016, and EPS will be accretive in 2017. Given YDLE's 20%+ revenue growth numbers and advisors' interest in the cross-sell products, I think this is certainly achievable.However, ENV just might surprise investors with some fantastic long-term growth. ENV CEO Jud Bergman states: ""The decision to acquire Yodlee is opening up another new world of opportunities and that's all about data… Frankly, we believe that there are going to be opportunities that are afforded by this trove of data that we can't even imagine today.""YDLE adds little value in the short term. If Bergman is wrong, YDLE adds little value in the long term. Subtracting $371 mil. in cash from ENV's $40 to $45 MCAP range, we indeed end up at $30 to $35. If we include YDLE's $72 mil. cash on hand, ENV should trade around $32 to $37.Thus, the 33% fall implies investors believe Bergman is wrong; i.e., the YDLE purchase is equivalent to ENV raising debt and nearly emptying its cash balance to distribute an enormous one-time payout to YDLE shareholders and diluting ENV share count. Put simply, YDLE is essentially worth nothing and ENV paid everything!However, I do not think this valuation is justified at all. ENV gained YDLE and saying YDLE is worth nothing is an understatement. I believe YDLE represents an opportunity for moderate to explosive growth.ENV already has the widest platform in the industry targeting advisors. In terms of opportunity cost, there's very little ENV can buy or do in its current space to enhance its existing platform that would lead to higher growth numbers. Once its first mover advantage is exhausted, ENV will need to compete on price, as administrative software becomes a commodity. This is already happening for the rapidly growing robo-advisor segment, whose advice is based on well-known algorithms rather than deep analysis. ENV's own software is not exactly difficult to emulate, and if robo-advisors result in an outflow of ENV's traditional independent advisor base (most of whom are not taking the threat seriously), ENV's long-term revenue will suffer significantly.ENV needs to add value to its advisory customers beyond its traditional administrative platforms or cheaply acquire customers in a new vertical if it wants to exceed its mid-stage growth capacity and remain price dominant. And of course, YDLE does both.How does YDLE make money? Selling customizable Financial Apps (FinApps) to big banks.YDLE has two customer types: Financial Institutions (FI), which include 12 of the 20 largest US banks, and Yodlee Interactive (YI) customers, a catch-all for web-based financial service providers and third party developers using YDLE's software development tools to build their own wealth management and financial planning platforms.YDLE's FI customers, primarily large banks, brokers, and wealth managers, use YDLE's APIs and pre-built FinApps to enable their own private-label personal financial management services; e.g., allowing clients to pay bills, track expenses, authenticate logins online.YI developers (Venmo, Dwolla, previously Mint acquired by Intuit) use YDLE's bank aggregation abilities to build apps with a single point of contact for a user to access account information, likely scattered across different banks and brokerages. Developers also use YDLE's APIs to build services for YDLE's FI customers; e.g., rewards programs for a regional bank.A small but increasingly valuable portion of YDLE's revenue comes from selling scrubbed-and-enhanced debit and credit card transaction data to retailers and investment managers (Point72/SAC) for use in economic analysis. This data is collected from YDLE's FI customers' clients. A controversial WSJ article estimates this business to be under 10% of FY2014 revenue, part of YDLE's data and analytics business. YDLE does not break out the numbers, but says data and analytics, originally started two years ago, is its fastest growing segment.Customers use YDLE because YDLE has the biggest platform in terms of apps, developers, and banks. YDLE's scale was built over 15 years and is unlikely to be emulated anytime soon. Banks have very little incentive to work with multiple account aggregators and YDLE's closest competitors are late-comers: Xignite (YDLE's partner) focuses on market data and Plaid supports fewer banks.Why did ENV acquire YDLE? To quickly grow accounts and differentiate its products, but mostly for YDLE's data sales.ENV categorizes its acquisitions as consolidating versus strategic (product expansion). Consolidating refers to acquiring competitors in order to gain their customers. Since IPO, ENV acquired FundQuest, Prudential WMS, and Placemark for $116 mil. in all, which makes up $55 bil. of its $250 bil. AUMA. Consolidating acquisitions are the fastest way to grow revenues, since integrating customers is easier than converting new customers due to high switching costs.YDLE is both a consolidating and strategic acquisition. Although ENV and YDLE share overlapping advisors, YDLE-exclusive customers have higher brand-recognition; e.g., HSBC, BofA, Citi, Scottrade, PayPal. ENV expects to add $36 mil. (run rate) cross-selling to YDLE's customers, $31.5 mil. with YDLE's aggregation offerings to existing ENV customers, another $50 mil. cross-selling to YDLE's international customers, and $87.5 mil. through its data business by 2020. Assuming YDLE grows existing revenues at 12.5% and ENV at 8.5% CAGR over five years, the revenue synergies will be 20% of total revenue in 2020.ENV believes YDLE's data business is the mother lode of growth, analogous to Yahoo's Alibaba. ENV wants to charge $200,000 a year to 25% of the top 1,500 asset managers, and $50,000 to 250 smaller managers, resulting in an $87.5 mil. run rate in 2020. Assuming a fund is willing to spend 5 basis points on research, this will result in a fund size of $400 mil. for large managers and $100 mil. for smaller ones. Considering the 500th biggest fund had $8 bil. of AUMA with the average US advisor managing $97 mil. in 2014, this is a reasonable revenue projection.Card data analytics is very specific; e.g., an investor can look at spending breakdowns at SeaWorld's different parks over a certain period to determine which one fared the best, data SeaWorld does not provide. YDLE is quite mute on this business, but adds that retail is a new target vertical. ENV believes YDLE is at an inflection point from scale to super-scale, and data is the growth catalyst. Businesses in any vertical will gain enormous informational advantages if they can understand their competitors' trends. This means YDLE's addressable market is exponential. ENV grew Tamarac's revenue from $10 mil. to $50 mil. in 3 years, and could possibly do the same with YDLE's $10 mil.+ data and analytics segment, which has considerably more target markets.Although YDLE's growth potential is very high, I believe YDLE will still face some resistance in its data business over the long term (3+ years). Any regulatory concern is overshadowed by the ease of emulating YDLE's data set. What stops Stripe, Square, PayPal, the Card Networks, the Payment Gateways, and the Banks from selling their transaction data other than bad press? Will banks turn a blind eye to YDLE once data sales scale? Will consumers continue to sacrifice privacy for convenience if part of the data distribution channel is compromised? YDLE might be secure, but a small advisor buying the data might not.Discounting YDLE's data super-scaling abilities, YDLE's applications provide modest revenue synergies and its transaction data adds one-of-a-kind investment research to differentiate ENV's advisor platform.I think a large part of the 33% reactionary fall was also due to the opaqueness of the exact pro-forma dilution and the inability of analysts to see the visibility of revenue in two relatively dissimilar companies. This led investors to think of the cash paid as a onetime payout rather than an expensive investment in a very unique data provider.The YDLE acquisition is anything but value-destroying and improves ENV's growth profile. This should be clearer now that the merger is completed, and guidance in November revealed a historically-on-track growth profile with high upside potential. The only factor hindering ENV's stock price is operational.What resulted in the original 13% fall? Integration issues from previous acquisitions.In his downgrade, Barrington/Northland analyst Jeff Houston pointed out ""we are concerned about the backlog of conversions which is handicapping organic growth."" His concern is justified, as ENV stated during the call: ""Big conversions are going to be backend-loaded for the year… and so there's going to be $5 million or $6 million by the end of the year that [will] not be a part of this year's recognized revenue."" This is a 2-3% drag on growth in the near term, although conversions have been lumpy historically. This scenario is a potential upside catalyst for ENV in the next few quarters; e.g., conversions spiked and revenue beat 2.2% in November last year, pushing the stock from $45 to $52 in a day.Integration in consolidating transactions is difficult, because clients need to be converted from their old platform to ENV's platform. Every integration requires ENV to transfer features from the old platform or add new features; e.g., ENV had to expand its multi-currency support and portfolio accounting abilities for its WMS acquisition (completed July 2013), whose last client is still not integrated. During this conversion period, ENV earns lower implementation revenues or lower AUMA fees.Integration is a real problem, and I do not think ENV will address this in the next few quarters. Glassdoor reveals ENV to have discouraging hiring practices and a near-term focus on expanding client services and business managers rather than engineers. Middle management is green and US developers are paid below average, largely as a result of moving operations to India. YDLE is a much more technical firm, although lacking in product vision and work discipline with no founders on the executive team. However, ENV's major competitors, including Schwab, Advent and SS&C, are not handling the competitive landscape much better.If integration efforts are addressed with Placemark in 2016 and YDLE truly transitions from scale to super scale in the next few quarters, I believe the stock can regain its 13%+ fall, roughly $6 to $7 with dilution. Super-scale implies blowing ENV's growth projections of YDLE's data and analytics business out of the water; i.e., YDLE experiences unparalleled growth in its data sales to retailers and other possible verticals. I believe this will be difficult due to the regulatory and substitute product concerns, but investors who do believe in this vision should consider the major risks in ENV's business model.What are ENV's major long term risks? Ties to the US equity market, revenue concentration, and high leverage.ENV's fees are tied to market values. In 2011, the US equity markets fell off after QE1 ended in July. Notice the decline in AUMA from Q2 to Q3 in spite of overall account growth. AUMA revenue also declined sequentially from Q3 to Q4. AUMA contains 45% US equities, 15% international equities, 30% fixed income, and 10% commodities, alternatives and cash. Roughly 85% of ENV revenues come from fees as a percentage of AUMA.(Source: SEC Filings)Both ENV and YDLE have highly concentrated revenues. Fidelity makes up 20% of ENV's revenues and YDLE's three biggest customers make up 25% of its revenues. In particular, Bank of America owns 10% of YDLE and contributed 14% of YDLE's revenue. Potential loss of a key customer is heighted by channel conflicts, although both ENV and YDLE management do not see serious issues here. Nevertheless, Fidelity has a history of testing digital advisor solutions; e.g., Betterment, Fidelity Go. Following Fidelity's acquisition of eMoney, a goals-based financial planner, ENV acquired the smaller Finance Logix. Some of YDLE's YI customers also use YDLE to build solutions competing against ENV's platform.Post acquisition, ENV will have pro-forma debt of $333 mil., leverage ratio (Debt/Adjusted EBITDA) of 3.8x, and debt-to-equity of 0.5x to 0.6x. The debt-to-equity is low due to the massive goodwill incurred from the YDLE acquisition. ENV's $160 mil. term loan assigns a per annum rate around 5% to 6%. The covenant also provides ENV with a $100 mil. revolver, although borrowing is unlikely as pro-forma cash should be $70 million. Cash interest should be around $15 to $20 mil. over the next several years, which implies an EBITDA/cash interest of 4x to 5x.My target: $42 within the next year, representing a 40% upside.Taking into account the probabilities of (1) investors realizing YDLE's low opportunity cost and strategic fit for ENV, (2) ENV improving its integration efforts, and (3) YDLE transitioning from scale to super-scale, I believe ENV should trade at $42. The nine sell-side analysts see ENV trading at $30 to $60 with a median price also at $40. I am unsure of their stories, but from my own analysis, it seems ENV presents a good opportunity to hit a conservative price target."
3984469,101861,2016-06-26T21:10:17-04:00,The company at the moment is offering its products to only 18% of its addressable market.The stock was recently upgraded and has a 23% upside potential.The stock is recovering after a drop from the highs of 2015.,"Envestnet (NYSE:ENV) is a top provider of software used by investment managers and financial planners. The company projected that its total addressable market includes over 265,000 advisors and more than $11 trillion in assets. But the company at the moment is offering its products to only 18% of its addressable market or about 49,000 advisors with more than $880 billion in assets.Due to the quality and integration of its products, Envestnet has a competitive advantage. Indeed, the company is trying to develop into a one-stop shop for wealth managers, with services which include financial planning, trading, portfolio balancing, performance analysis, billing, client portals, and customer relationship management software, and other services. In addition, Envestnet's Yodlee acquisition is doing well and has been helping to increase its value proposition.The company is clearly expanding with a PEG of 1.75, and seems to be fairly valued with a forward P/E of 24.83 which compares with the sector mean of 25.86. Recently the company received an upgrade from UBS. The firm issued a Buy rating and hiked the target price on the stock from $33 to $44, which represents a 23% upside from the current price of around $36The stock fell from highs of about $57 last year due to the surprising highly dilutive acquisition of Yodlee; however, the 30% drop was an overreaction from Institutional traders who think the company overpaid for Yodlee. Reasons why the acquisition was a brilliant move include: the company now can have all of its business units shift to the in-house brand; it helped differentiate Envestnet's platform; it was a good use for the $200 million that was sitting in the bank; and it provided with a lot of clients the company was having trouble gaining access to in the past like Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and HSBC.With a phenomenal huge growth opportunity, the future of Envestnet seems to hold plenty of promises. And because it is still a small cap stock (market cap of $1.4 billion) so does the stock. As we see more and more managers continue to migrate to its platform, we expect the stock to continue rising and reward investors."

(NYSE:ENV) brought its inaugural convertible bond to market. Almost immediately, the issue skyrocketed, ultimately grinding as high as 113.00. The stock traded appreciably higher as well. However, within a few months the bonds and stock began to trade lower on company-specific growth concerns. The breakdown was gradual at first. However, both tumbled following the release of Q1 2015 earnings. As a result, ENV's bonds closed last week at 101 while the shares now trade toward the lower end of their 52-week trading range ($37.76-58.21), closing the week at $43.81. Frankly, we weren't at all concerned by the company's recent results. They were ""in line"" from our vantage point. However, momentum investors obviously took the news differently.ENV's flexible and fully customizable cloud-based wealth management platform supports a large and growing network of over 41,000 financial advisors, nearly three-million investor accounts, and approximately $750 billion in total assets. The company's integrated software and services suite is known for its breadth and depth. This has resulted in the creation of formidable barriers to entry and ensures the company's high client retention rates.Ultimately, we remain bullish on ENV's near-term prospects. The company boasts a leading market position, consistent revenue growth, strong EBITDA generation and a solid balance sheet. In turn, our HOCS slash line measures an impressive 71 Overall / 69 Growth / 76 Safety. ENV definitely deserves a fresh look.A Large and Growing OpportunityIn the world of technology, there's often no better advantage than being a ""first mover"". That early advantage frequently carries over for many years. As a result of ENV's first- mover status, the company has been able to grow revenues at an impressive 37% compounded annual rate the past five years. While organic growth has been central to this top line improvement, acquisitions have also played a pivotal role. Specifically, several acquisitions completed in the past few years have succeeded in either expanding the company's customer base or enhancing its investment and technology solutions.ENV's revenue model is relatively transparent and predictable. Asset-based revenues, which total approximately 85%, are derived from the company's assets under management/administration (AUM/A). Related revenues are billed quarterly in advance, based on invested assets at the end of the previous calendar quarter. Revenues are highly predictable, being affected by two factors: net flows in the previous quarter and quarter- over-quarter market fluctuations. Software and services related revenues, essentially licensing and professional services revenues, account for the roughly 15% balance.The company typically earns such revenues as part of multi-year agreements with large enterprise clients. Fees are based on the level and types of investment solutions and services provided. Moreover, this revenue category is not subject to asset or account volatility.Ultimately, ENV enjoys several clear competitive advantages. Most importantly, ENV's large and growing network of advisors has proven to be extremely loyal, the result of an easy-to-use, integrated, and feature- rich platform. In addition, the company's end-to-end solutions provide pricing stability and pave the way for significant cross-selling opportunities.Finally, central to ENV's historical revenue growth has been the addition of advisors, a steady increase in accounts per advisor, and the addition of products as well as advisor relationships. Cerulli Associates, a research firm, specializing in global asset management and distribution analytics, recently published several studies which we believe support our general conclusions. One study highlights the proportion of domestic households investing in the markets and working with financial advisors as having increased from 50%in 2008 to 86% by the end of 2013. Another references the continued increase in registered investment advisors (RIAs). Specifically, the number of RIAs have reportedly increased from 42,200 at the end of 2008, to 57,100 by the end of 2014. Yet another estimates that fee-based AUM/A have grown from $2.7 trillion at the end of 2008, to $6.4 trillion by the end of 2014. A final study suggests that wealth management entities continue to allocate resources to technology. It is estimated that approximately 76% of such entities have shifted to cloud-based or outsourced solutions and 51% have embraced mobile technologies. In combination, all of these developments and resultant data points seem to point towards further company- specific revenue, earnings, and cash flow gains over the foreseeable future.Recent ResultsQ1 2015 revenues totaled $96.5 million, a 23% increase in the year-over-year comparison. The increase was driven by a 21% gain in revenues from AUM/A, the result of a 31% increase in total AUM/A. In turn, EBITDA improved to $16.8 million in the most recent quarter, in contrast to last year's $11.8 million. In addition, EPS came in at $0.22, up from last year's $0.17. Despite the above top- and bottom-line gains, Q1 2015 results were just in line with the $97 million revenue and $0.22 per share estimates, respectively. Again, perhaps the aforementioned results were a disappointment to momentum types. We see it differently.Acquisition Track RecordENV has an established track record of having strengthened its platform and grown its business, both organically and via acquisition. The company has proven disciplined when it comes to sourcing, evaluating, and completing transactions. Since 2011, ENV has spent approximately $200 million (plus earn-outs) on a combination of consolidation or strategic focused deals. The company's consolidation transactions have proven to be highly accretive and have resulted in the addition of advisors and assets. The company's strategic acquisitions have enhanced or expanded the company's platform or resulted in the addition of new capabilities. The acquisition of WMS (2013) is the only transaction to have gone less smoothly than originally hoped. However, the kinks were eventually worked out. Given this positive track record, investors should expect the company to continue to pursue strategic transactions and other relationships.Beware the Robo AdvisorTargeting relatively young investors with limited investable assets, so-called robo advisors are attempting to transform the world of financial advice by introducing websites supported by asset allocation software. Website users are asked a limited number of questions concerning their financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. From there, investors are presented with a recommended asset allocation. Once the account is funded, client assets are automatically invested in several exchange-traded funds. It's a quick, easy, and low-cost way of investing.Might the robo investors eventually encroach on the more traditional advisors' territory? We don't think so. Frankly, as investable assets grow and financial needs increase in complexity, investors still seem to value the ""high touch"" approach of more traditional advisors. As a result, while we see a real need and growing role for robo advisors, traditional financial advisors are not likely to be displaced.Business DescriptionENV's centrally hosted technology platforms provide advisors with access to a series of integrated services. These services include risk assessment and selection of investment strategies and solutions, asset allocation models, research and due diligence, portfolio construction, proposal generation and paperwork preparation, model management and account rebalancing, account monitoring, tax management, and other features. ENV believes that these attributes empower advisors to manage better client outcomes and strengthen their overall advisory business."
3775996,40841,2016-01-24T12:32:00-05:00,"Franchise business valued at +6% free cash flow yield with +20% long-term growth.Independent investment advisor channel will grow, and Envestnet is a pure-play beneficiary.Recent acquisition is applauded by the industry, but loathed by investors, creating an exceptional entry point.","I think an investment in Envestnet (NYSE:ENV) around $30/share offers the opportunity to compound capital at a +20% rate over the next 10 years.Envestnet is an end-to-end enterprise software offering for fee-based financial advisors and institutions. The company is the market leader and it has a defensible moat. I think the business is incredibly high quality, benefits from a long-term secular growth runway, and is currently valued at a deep discount to intrinsic value. Historically, Envestnet has been valued at 20x EBITDA. I believe it is currently priced at less than 12x 2016 exit EBITDA. Thanks to concerns around slowing growth and a large, expensive, poorly communicated (but moat enhancing) acquisition, Envestnet's stock has been cut in half from its 52-week highs and is down 38% year to date.The stock is trading at depressed levels because investors do not understand the acquisition of Yodlee (NASDAQ:YDLE), and the recent growth slowdown (from +30% to around 20%) has resulted in an investor turnover from growth to value-oriented investors.Pro forma for this acquisition, I believe Envestnet trades at roughly a 6.5% free cash flow yield on 2016 exit earnings. The company has articulated a long-term growth target of 20% top line and 25% EBITDA growth (versus 20% and 33%, respectively, in 2015). I think the growth runway has +10-year legs (perhaps at slower rates in out years), hence my expectation that this is a long-term compounder. I think fair value today is $50, but, as is typical with secular growers, pinning down a static price target is difficult. Suffice to say, a 40% discount to intrinsic value gives me a lot of margin of safety for a business I think so highly of.The following is my attempt to bullet point the investment case.Envestnet is a high quality business...o Generates ~25% ROICo Has a high market share - 44 of 50 top independent financial advisors, 12 of 15 top banks and a majority of the largest RIAs are customers.o Has scale - +$800B on the Envestnet platform.o Operates with barriers to entry that result in a deep and wide moat - owns a full suite of offerings that could not be economically recreated; at this point, it owns many of the service providers for current and would-be competitors.o Customers captivity - It can take well over a year to transition to a new technology system; Envestnet's customers are in a situation where they are either selecting a technology platform for the first time or upgrading to an ""end to end"" solution; once a customer becomes an Envestnet client, retention rates are in the high 90s.o Stable, visible revenues - Pro forma revenues are 70% asset based (billed quarterly in advance) and 30% license....growing at a high rate for a long time...o Independent/RIA advisor market share take from wirehouse is a 20-year, 5 MPH tailwind. RIA assets have grown over 1.5x the overall advisor market over the last five years. Their market share is expected to grow from 20% in 2013 to 28% in 2018 (Cerulli Advisors).o The advisory business is shifting from a commission-based model rife with conflicts of interest to a fee-based, fiduciary standard model. Envestnet is solely focused on the fee-only market. The current fee-based market share is less than 20% currently, but will likely grow at high-single-digit rates for the next several years.o Envestnet currently supports +43k financial advisors, with contractual access to customers with +120k advisors. Its total addressable market is +240k advisors. It will grow share within existing customers and add new customers for a long time to come.o The average advisor is 51, and 43% of advisors are over 55. As the advisor business becomes younger, technology adoption will increase....and reasonably priced.o Attractive on both a relative and absolute basis - 3x revenue, 12x NTM EBITDA, and a 6.5% free cash flow yield.o There aren't any great comps, but earlier this year, Advent Software (NASDAQ:ADVS) sold for 6x revenue and 17x EBITDA when it was growing revenue and EBITDA at 7% and 9%, respectively. SEI Investments Company (NASDAQ:SEIC), a not great but best we have comp, trades at 12x EBITDA and is growing top line 10% and EBITDA 15%.Why The Opportunity ExistsEnvestnet is trading at a depressed level because investors dislike a very large acquisition (~33% of pro forma enterprise value), and the slowing growth profile is being extrapolated to overly bearish levels. I believe that the Yodlee acquisition offers very strong strategic and financial rationale which will be proven out over the next two years. While growth has slowed from very strong levels, which management routinely communicated as being unsustainable, the secular tailwinds benefiting Envestnet are still as strong as ever.OverviewFounded in 1999 by current CEO Jud Bergman, Envestnet was one of the first cloud-based software companies. Jud had previously worked for Nuveen Investments, initially as a municipal bond investment banker and then as the Managing Director of Mutual Funds. Colleagues note that he successfully built the business from scratch by selectively acquiring ""best in class"" components that would be worth more together. He recognized two things in the wealth management business - the wirehouses were likely to lose share and the industry would transition away from a commission-based model to a fee-based model.The economic rationale for wirehouses losing share is obvious - most advisors get less than a 50% cut of the revenue they generate. It doesn't take a lot of AUM to cover the costs of putting together your own service providers for back office, compliance, technology and office space. However, access to product is another thing. Understanding that access to investment managers was the strongest hold wirehouses had on their advisors, Jud started Envestnet with the idea that it would help give independent advisors the product access they needed to provide their clients with a wide range of investment solutions. Today, Envestnet has relationships with over 1,100 investment managers and believes it has 90-95% product overlap with most wirehouses. Many have commented that the network effects that come from this level of scale almost requires that an independent advisor have access to the Envestnet platform.The second trend Jud identified was the industry's pivot away from commission-based wealth management towards a fee-based model. The conflicts of interest in a commissioned-based structure are obvious. The incentives to place clients into the highest commission-paying products are simply too great. Fee-based accounts are taking share from commissioned accounts. By 2018, fee-based advisory assets will eclipse commissioned assets (from Cerulli Associates, a research firm that specializes in asset management and distribution analytics). The trend will continue for several years. Recently, the government has taken a more active role in enforcing a fiduciary standard for retirement accounts. This will only serve to highlight the misalignment of interests present in commissioned relationships and could accelerate the adoption of fee-based models.After connecting the advisors with managers, Jud embarked on a 15-year process of building out a full-service financial planning suite in order to provide advisers with: proposal generation, billing modules, portfolio analytics, manager research, investment planning, trading and rebalancing tools, CRM integration, and, just recently, account data aggregation. The following table from an Envestnet investor presentation outlines the spectrum of services and functions that the company offers its advisors.This wide spectrum of services offered in a customizable (a la carte) open architecture (use any products you like and pick your own custodian) is unique. While there are several turnkey asset manager platforms (TAMPs) like SEI and Genworth, and portfolio management/accounting software providers like Advent, and financial planning tools like eMoney, none has the end-to-end service offerings that Envestnet provides. Furthermore, none provides an offering that can serve corporate purposes for overseeing advisor activities.As a result of its breadth of offerings and independence, Envestnet has successfully attracted customers across the entire wealth management spectrum. Its clients include large RIAs, broker dealers, banks, custodians and ""break away"" advisors of all shapes and sizes. ENV has over $800B in assets on its platform. Of these assets, $258B are fee-generating assets under management or assets under administration (AUM/A) and the remainder are assets which use Envestnet solely for reporting and portfolio management purposes. Of the 42,000 advisors using Envestnet, 29,000 are AUM/A advisors and 13,000 are using Envestnet strictly for reporting. The following graphic details its customer base by category:Yodlee Acquisition And Lumpy ResultsBefore diving into the business model, I'll take a moment to address the reason why Envestnet is trading at a 40% discount to its historical valuation levels. On August 10th, ENV announced its second-quarter results and its intent to acquire Yodlee for $660MM ($590MM net of cash; $540MM net of NOLs); the acquisition price was around 33% of Envestnet's enterprise value. The following day, ENV's stock declined 35%.The quarterly results were mixed, but in line. Management guided to the lower end of its annual guidance - 20% top line and 33% EBITDA - but this was largely expected due to industry-wide slowdowns (LPL (NASDAQ:LPLA) and Raymond James (NYSE:RJF) also had weak numbers), market volatility and already known delays integrating some fairly large advisor conversions (namely, the acquisition of Prudential's (NYSE:PRU) Wealth Management Services). The Yodlee acquisition, however, took everyone by surprise, and management did little to build confidence in the move. Hating the deal was easy. The headline purchase price was 5x NTM revenue and +40x EBITDA. Often prone to meander along weirdly cerebral analogies, Jud spoke more about the ""geometric strength of triangles"" and ""opportunities that we can't even imagine at this point"" than he did about the financial rationale of the acquisition. It was easy to conclude that management had fallen off the capital allocation wagon and that it was attempting to acquire SAAS-cache as its core business was slowing. But I don't think that is correct. I think Yodlee makes Envestnet's moat very deep and very wide. It also could offer an exceptional return.Here is my best attempt at (hopefully succinctly) summarizing Yodlee's business and the acquisition rationale:Yodlee is a consumer financial data aggregator. It has data feeds into 14,000 financial institutions. These feeds send anonymized consumer financial data. It has 3x as many fixed connections as the next largest financial aggregator (CashEdge, left to wallow in the depths of Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), is the next largest) and 10x the revenues according to the former head of CashEdge. With its connections, Yodlee can populate an individual's entire financial picture by delivering real-time feeds of savings and checking accounts, car loan balances, mortgages, investment accounts, etc. The company also is able to complete real-time verification. Due to the IT security hurdles and significant scale benefits, I think displacing Yodlee will be very difficult. Furthermore, Warburg Pincus and the venture funds that preceded it put over $300MM into building Yodlee. The success of YDLE was modest. I seriously doubt anyone could justify the financial requirement to vie for, what has turned out to be, a relatively small pie.Yodlee's customer base consists of retail financial institutions (9 of top 15 banks), wealth managers (6 of top 10), e-commerce clients (PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)) and peer-to-peer lending companies (Kabbage (KBGE), OnDeck (NYSE:ONDK)). Financial and wealth management institutions offer their customers FinApps that enable customers and wealth advisors to track personal finances. Offering these services increases customer captivity and offers the opportunity to better market to clients and increase wallet share. Its e-commerce and peer-to-peer lending customers use Yodlee more for financial data verification.Yodlee is a ""B2B2C"" company, meaning it licenses its data feeds and white-labeled software to other businesses, which then make their products available to end customers. The company grows by adding new clients and increasing its penetration into those clients' end customers. It has 850 clients and over 20 million paying users, which represents around 10% penetration with existing customers. The average ARPU per user is around $4.50/yr. Customer retention is very high since its service is low cost and, especially for its commerce and lending clients, mission critical.Yodlee is growing top line at a mid-20s rate. The S-4 proxy statement for the Envestnet acquisition shows its internal revenue growth estimates top 28% per year through 2020. The company is just hitting its stride from an operational leverage perspective - 55% of 2015 revenue growth is expected to fall to the bottom line. It is also developing new revenue sources. Yodlee's data feeds capture billions of financial transactions. Once scrubbed, this data can be very valuable. It's early days, but selling this data may prove to be a very significant revenue generator.Though I think Yodlee is a high-quality company, uptake on the retail banking side hasn't been as robust as expected (people care far more about their social lives than their personal finances, surprise!) and everyone involved with the company has been there for a long time. The CEO Anil Arora has been with the company since its inception. Warburg Pincus (owns 27%) has been invested since 2002. Impatience abounds. The door was already open when Envestnet came knocking.On the call announcing the transaction, Envestnet talked about buying Yodlee because a partnership would have given all the financial benefits to YDLE. My interpretation: We would have been the largest customer of a company that has a ton of operational leverage. The S-4 details Envestnet's attempt to make a minority investment in Yodlee, but when that was turned down and a competing acquirer emerged, ENV decided to acquire the entire business.Earlier this fall, Envestnet detailed the revenue synergies it expects to achieve by owning Yodlee. The company is targeting $200MM in revenue synergies, on top of the $400MM revenue estimate Yodlee forecasts, for 2020. At a 25% EBITDA margin (Q4 2016 estimate is 17%), Yodlee would generate $150MM in EBITDA in 2020; representing a modest 3x multiple on today's purchase price. Management has noted that it only requires 33% of its targeted revenue synergies in order to achieve a 25% IRR.In sum, while I can't say I would have been thrilled with the acquisition if I were previously a shareholder (it is 5% dilutive in the near term), I can say that I think the acquisition significantly enhances Envestnet's incumbent advantage and does little to shake my confidence in the management team's capital allocation discipline. Furthermore, the industry seems to love the acquisition, as per reports published at wmtoday.com, kitces.com, riabiz.com, and americanbanker.comNow back to discussing Envestnet's business.Envestnet Business ModelThe business model is straightforward - customers pay ENV a combination of asset-based and licensing fees to use a menu of services. The highest touch service occurs when advisors outsource the investment selection process to Envestnet's research team, PMC (acquired in 2001). In this role, Envestnet serves as the fiduciary and the assets are considered AUM. As of year-end, there will likely be around $80B in AUM. The company does not break out the exact fee on these assets, but says it's in the mid 30bps range. The AUM business contributes 55-60% of the pre-Yodlee acquisition revenues, but only around 35% of EBITDA since most of the cost of revenue is attributable to fees paid to sub-advisors on its platform. Growth in the AUM business is lumpy. Year to date, it is tracking in the low-double digits annualized, but the industry is believed to be growing at slower-than-average rates due to recent market-wide volatility, and Envestnet has several conversions on its platform that have taken longer than expected. Over the long term, I believe that assets will migrate into the AUM bucket as advisors realize there is much more downside than upside in taking on fiduciary obligations. While the AUM business is lower margin in percentage terms, the dollars are much, much bigger.For assets under administration (AUA), the advisor uses Envestnet for access to product and reporting, but does not cede fiduciary responsibility. At year end, we estimate AUA will be around $185B. Again, management doesn't break down the fees for AUA, but we estimate that it is charging around 5 basis points using total AUM/A fee rates of 13 bps and management's comments that AUM (which is 30% of all assets) charges mid 30s basis points. On this math, the AUA business is around 25% of pre-Yodlee revenue and 35% of EBITDA. AUA growth is similarly lumpy, but growing a touch faster.And finally, Envestnet's licensing business, which primarily consists of its Tamarac division that caters to the RIA market, offers rebalancing, reporting and customer relationship software. The fee rate is around 0.4 basis points. Licensing revenue is ~15% of revenues, but nearly 30% of EBITDA. It is growing at +30% yoy, and has the highest contribution margin (+60%) in the business.Growth DriversEnvestnet illustrates its growth opportunity with the following slide:The company builds up its 20% long-term annual growth target with the following growth buckets. In any one year, each component will vary, but, directionally, I believe that these components add up to a substantial long-term growth runway.- Organic Advisor Growth - Guidance 6-8%: As mentioned previously, Envestnet has 43,500 advisors on its platform. It has contracts with institutions that have over 120,000 advisors. This represents only 35% penetration into its existing customer base. The company's asset penetration is even lower, with only $800B of a potential $3.2T accessing Envestnet's services. This speaks to the fact that older advisors with larger books of business have been slower to incorporate fee-based, technology-driven advice models. As the industry continues to adopt fee-based advice and more integrated technology, Envestnet will continue to grow its share of advisors who are affiliated with existing customers.- Account Per Advisor Growth - Guidance 10-12%: The overall wealth management industry is growing around 4% per year. Over the last several years, you have seen a growing percentage of households utilize financial planners and that trend, though moderating, is expected to continue. Envestnet maintains that advisors who use the platform grow their clients and sat +2x the market. Additionally, as the industry shifts towards a more fee-based model, the number of fee-based accounts per advisor will grow. Historically, accounts per advisor have grown 10%. I think this number is likely a bit high, but not excessive.- Add New Relationships - Guidance 3-5%: The company believes its total target market is 240,000 advisors and $8.1T. Envestnet is less than 50% penetrated. It will continue to add new relationships, and the number of potential relationships will grow as the break-away broker trend continues.- Add Products and Upsell - Guidance 1-2%: Envestnet uses its ""a la carte"" offerings to bring on new advisors, especially recent breakaways. Over time, advisors tend to integrate more technology and use more services.CompetitionEnvestnet is competitively advantaged because its extensive roster of services increases its customer productivity in a manner that its competitors cannot match. ENV faces competition from several disparate service providers. Its competitor groups generally fall into three categories:- Turnkey asset management platforms (TAMPs) which provide access to investment product and practice management tools.- Single-service software providers which provide one-off functions such as financial planning or performance reporting.- Custodians which offer low-cost trading tools.Envestnet's key competitive advantage is that, for most advisors, opting for one of ENV's competitors will require the advisor to make several service provider decisions. Incurring the risks of managing each vendor relationship and ensuring that they properly integrate with one another is not an attractive route for most. Though it is possible to assemble a lower cost suite of services, the productivity loss very frequently overwhelms the potential dollars saved. ENV has given several data points for how an advisor allocates their time. For instance, they claim they can save a typical advisor 30-40 hours per client onboard and, with the benefit of Yodlee, they will save 60-100 hours per client per year when providing financial planning. Their advisor growth supports these claims. The average Envestnet advisor grows their business at a 2.2x rate the industry. For an advisor that manages $250MM, the difference between growing at 5% and 11% is around $150,000 of additional high-margin revenue per year. Considering that the average fee paid by Envestnet's AUM/A customers is around 13 basis points, the revenue from additional productivity far outweighs any potential cost savings in most scenarios.AcquisitionsEnvestnet has been an acquisitive company since its formation. The company segments its acquisition strategy into two types - consolidating and strategic. Not including Yodlee, Envestnet has completed seven acquisitions totaling just over $200MM since 2010. Going forward, I expect that acquisitions will be weighted towards financial accretion over strategic build-out. Consolidating acquisitions are aimed at buying sub-scale technology platforms and converting their advisors to Envestnet users. These acquisitions are exclusively geared towards growing cash flow. It articulates its hurdle rate by saying that consolidated EBITDA must exceed 25% of the purchase price. Over the past four years, ENV has completed three consolidating purchases (FundQuest, WMS and Placemark) for a total price of $130MM. These acquisitions brought $50B onto Envestnet's platform and, though Placemark has yet to be fully integrated, the company has met or exceeded its 25% EBITDA as a percent of purchase price goal. Management thinks there are around 40 sub-scale TAMPs with anywhere from $500MM to $20B in assets that could make for future consolidating acquisitions.The focus for strategic acquisitions is aimed at building out existing competencies or expanding to adjacent verticals that fit well with the technologies. The hurdle rate is measured over longer horizons, and the company targets a 25% IRR. Over the last five years, Envestnet has completed five strategic acquisitions (Tamarac, Prima, Klein Decisions, Upside and Finance Logix) for a total price of around $100MM. Of these, Tamarac and Finance Logix are the most significant. Tamarac is a web-based tool for rebalancing, portfolio management, trading and tax loss harvesting that is offered primarily to RIA clients. Envestnet bought the business in 2012 for $54MM, paying almost 6x revenue. Three years later, Tamarac (offered under the product name Advisor Xi) has grown revenues 500%. The 25% IRR hurdle rate will be well exceeded.Finance Logix is a financial planning software tool that will tie in with Envestnet's interface. It was acquired earlier this year for $30MM. While Finance Logix's market share in the financial planning market is relatively small (estimated at 3.4%), it was one of the last independent offerings of size and it brought Envestnet much closer to realizing its goal of becoming a truly full service investment management platform.With the recently completed Yodlee acquisition, the build out is all but complete. While I expect that Jud will likely find tuck-in acquisitions, I don't expect anything sizable in the near to intermediate term. I expect that as the company looks inward to focus on integration, modest debt reduction and, eventually, share repurchases, the operations will improve, margins will expand and the share count should come down. These three factors are the strongest components I know for driving excellent shareholder returns.Financial ModelingAn investment in Envestnet will work well if it can simply grow EBITDA and free cash flow at the same rate as the top line. In the S-4, the company estimates that the combined business will grow revenue at a 24% CAGR for the next five years and EBIT at a 40% CAGR, as margins expand 900 basis points. If this scenario plays out, ENV will be generating +$1.6B in revenue and +$460MM in EBITDA. At a modest 10x EBITDA multiple, the stock would be worth over $100/share. Factoring in cash generation over the way, the annualized return would exceed 27% - an outstanding outcome for a five-year investment. Even with more tempered expectations, like 17% revenue growth and 500 basis points of margin expansion, the return still exceeds 20%.In all candor, I have no idea whether top line will be 17% or 24% over the next five years. Envestnet has grown revenue at a 33% CAGR over the last five years, but the business is maturing. The combination of Envestnet and Yodlee is in its infancy, and while I have every reason to believe that the management team will continue its track record of dramatically increasing the revenue and profitability of the businesses it buys, I don't claim to have any special insight into future success. Either way, at the current price, I'm not paying for anything close to flawless execution.The following details my base case estimate for revenue and cash flow generation over the next five years. The only confidence I have in this estimate is that it is not correct and that, regardless of the magnitude of my errors, the intrinsic value of the business will be substantially higher in future years.RisksThe two biggest risks are capital markets performance and a potential combination of competing service providers that could assemble a more like-for-like offering. There aren't any good options for hedging out the second risk. Considering the incumbent advantages Envestnet has already established and the relatively small number of profit dollars available for a potential disruptor, I am okay accepting this risk. As for market risks, shorting the equity markets could be an acceptable hedge. On a pro forma basis, approximately 70% of the revenue is tied to assets and 50% of these assets are tied to equities. Factoring in the contribution margin from changes in asset based fees, a market short equal to around 50% of a potential Envestnet position size should roughly address equity market exposures."

Envestnet (NYSE:ENV) is wisely positioned to provide solutions and services to a wide range of investment advisory firms. From the company's website:ENV reported the following Key Operating Metrics (AUM/A Only) in their most recent quarterly/year-end report as of December 31st, 2013.Assets: $177.9 billion, up 81% from December 31, 2012Accounts: 735,845, up 64% from December 31, 2012Advisors: 22,838, up 42% from December 31, 2012Gross sales: $20.4 billion, resulting in net flows of $10.5 billionMore information on ENV's fourth quarter and full year 2013 results can be found in the company's February 20th, 2014 earnings report.It appears ENV is going after a high-growth area of the financial services industry and executing well. In this article, we will look at financial performance of ENV compared to the following three other companies: Financial Engines (NASDAQ:FNGN), Waddell & Reed Financial (NYSE:WDR), & LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA).I chose these companies for comparison because I come across each of them in my research; I have owned one of them previously and currently own shares in ENV. All three companies primarily serve individual investors. While ENV sells to financial advisors, those advisors are primarily serving individual investors. There may be better company comparisons but these are the companies I am most interested in potentially owning and I believe they make fine comparisons.Definitions for financial metrics are provided at the end of the article.Let's first take a look at top-line sales growth for all 4 companies:Data provided by MarketsmithThe above grid compares the last 4 quarters of sales growth for each company. As you can see, ENV is clearly outpacing the group. More impressive is the acceleration in recent quarters.Next we want to look at how much of the top line makes it to the bottom line:Data provided by MarketsmithAs a group they are all delivering impressive bottom line numbers. ENV topped the group 3 out of 4 periods and essentially tied in the most recent quarter with WDR. WDR is delivering a component of acceleration which can be a very bullish characteristic. Continued share price appreciation for ENV will likely require the continued balancing of internal capital needs with bottom-line earnings growth. This is clearly a risk for investors in ENV.How does longer-term earnings growth compare?Data provided by MarketsmithOther than the 2012 EPS growth, ENV has delivering outstanding annual bottom-line growth the last three years compared to the group.Here is another look at earnings via the Marketsmith proprietary EPS Growth Rate and Earnings Stability ranking.Data Provided by MarketsmithENV delivers a strong EPS Growth Rate but comes up a little short on Earnings Stability. 2012 results likely impacted the rating. Ideally ENV can stabilize bottom line results going forward. Their performance in this area is a significant risk given ENV's current valuation. WDR does the best job of the group delivering stable annual earnings.When we dig into the next set of metrics, we get additional clues regarding the riskiness of ENV's share price.Data provided by MarketsmithNothing spectacular for ENV, and reason again management must execute well on business strategy as well as financial management to continue being rewarded with a high premium stock value. The low annual pre-tax margin is the biggest concern. LPLA with a debt level of 116% is a bit on the higher side as well. WDR comes across as the strongest of the group on these measurements.A few other helpful metrics:Data provided by Marketsmith, except 1-year price return provided by Stockcharts.comWith a current P/E of 80, ENV has been rewarded with a high valuation. This is due largely to its historical as well as estimated future growth rates. The stock has a lot of growth opportunities in the rapidly transitioning investment advisory market.ENV has seen a huge increase in the number of mutual funds reporting positions in shares of the company at the end of the year, up 17% (221) from the prior quarter. While still a relatively small number of mutual funds, the number of new funds taking positions is encouraging; several top performing mutual funds I track own shares in ENV.In a side by side comparison, it is clear ENV has performed on par with peer in most areas and is currently experiencing the fastest top and bottom line growth. Of the group, ENV is expected to deliver the strongest EPS growth in 2014. Assuming ENV can continue to execute well and maintain a P/E of 80, the stock could trade for $84 a share in the next 18-24 months based on a 2016 earnings estimate of $1.05 (46% growth over 2015). These are high thresholds for certain but we have seen young high-growth companies deliver this type of performance in the past and ENV looks well positioned to deliver.Mutual Fund Ownership Reporting Provided By MarketsmithEPS Growth Rate: The compound growth rate using the least squared fit over the latest two to three years' earnings per share on a running 12-month basis.Earnings Stability: Indicates in percentage from one standard deviation of the variability around the trend line fitted through 3 to 5 years of earnings' history with a scale ranging from 1 to 99.

1884381,54942,2013-12-10T09:45:00-05:00,,"The proliferation of investment data providers, software companies, and technology services platforms to investment advisors over the last several years has been astounding. Having been in the industry for nearly two decades, it has been amazing how transformative the business has become as advisors and broker-dealers have access to a profound amount of options to support their practices.Envestnet (NYSE:ENV) is one such provider who began offering wealth management solutions to financial advisors in 1999. I noted a few of the same points I will make below in my article on a similar provider and competitor, Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN).The industry is still in its infancy and the intense competition will eventually lower prices and consolidate into a few, stronger players. The amount of data and technology for investment advisors are making the services more of a commoditized product. The stock of Envestnet is up a whopping 178% year-to-date and valuations are excessive, which is putting it mildly.Business OverviewThe firm was founded by current CEO Jud Bergman, who built the company to provide a software ""desktop"" that integrates the complex set of services and capabilities required to run a wealth management practice. The vision of the firm has always been to ""level the playing field for independent advisors"" giving them the same access, tools and support- research, analytics, advice and products - that previously were available only to the institutional community.Envestnet's revenues mostly come from fees earned on the assets the underlying financial advisors have under management. As of the end of the third quarter 2013, assets under management was $160.2 billion with 657,109 accounts served by 21,759 advisors.The company offers solutions through an array of products and services suites:The company has grown considerably in recent years with accounts under administration growing roughly 32% per year while assets have grown approximately 28%.IndustryThe wealth management industry has undergone a secular shift over the last two decades with the broker-dealer (think traditional stockbroker) model becoming obsolete while the independent registered investment advisor (RIA) has become the dominant retail choice for investors seeking professional advice. The conflicts of interest are significantly lower and the fees are much more transparent compared to the Broker-Dealer channel.Total households assets are at record highs thanks to a surging stock market with a total of $54.4 trillion in assets, up 7% in 2012 over the prior year and surpassing the prior peak in 2007. According to Cerulli and Associates, the number of advisers practicing as an independent RIA grew at a rate of 8% per year between 2004 and 2012. This was offset by weakness among the broker-dealer channel promoted by regional and national firms, insurance companies, and banks. The industry as a whole lost 1.2% of its advisors each year. In addition, Cerulli notes the increasing blurring of the lines between channels, as independent firms get larger and broker-dealers roll out new programs for the so-called breakaway advisors who leave brokerage houses.The increase in the independent financial advisor has increased the need for new technological products as the economics of the business do not work if these RIAs need to build large back-office operations themselves.In addition, the need to comply with the burgeoning maze of laws, rules, and regulations has increased the need for technology that allows them to do so at minimal costs.Drivers of the BusinessFor the year ended December 2012, they earned fees of $127,213 from assets under management (AUM) or assets under administration (AUA)- the difference being AUM refers to assets that are actively managed by advisors and portfolio managers on behalf of investors while AUA refers to the size of an institution's custodial portfolio, and can refer to capital still within the investor's control. In 2012, they received another $30 million in fees from licensing of data and other professional services.Asset-based fees accounted for approximately 81% of total revenues over the last couple of years. Licensing and professional services fees accounted for the remainder of sales over the last two years. In this segment, the company generates fee revenue from contractual licensing fees for providing access to their technology platform and from professional services.For most of their relationships with advisors, they bill customers at the beginning of the quarter based on the market value of customer assets on their platform as of the end of the prior quarter. Thus revenues are fairly transparent for the proximate quarter.Understanding the growth of the business is simple: grow the number of underlying advisors who use the platform and provide them the tools necessary to increase their book of business. Envestnet has grown through a combination of organic growth and through strategic acquisitions. The company generates roughly 15.6 to 15.9 bps of fee rate on the quarterly beginning AUM base of approximately $160 billion on their asset-based business.Short ThesisOver the last several years, Envestnet has undertaken several acquisitions to bolster their AUM and AUA and build scale and volume. These turnkey asset management programs (TAMPs) tend to acquire other TAMPs for several reasons: for one, they need to keep growing their book, adding assets under management to their platform and ever more advisors in order to keep growing their scale. This keeps the argument among advisors that bigger is better and that Envestnet is not going anywhere anytime soon and they won't have to migrate (convert) to a new platform every few years.In the last two years, they have purchased WMS, a similar software suite to add scale of roughly $25 billion in AUM, Tamarac, a well-known rebalancing and back-office software offering, Prima Capital, an investment manager research program, and FundQuest, a consolidating acquisition that added another $15 billion of AUM.The RIA channel is transitioning from a coalition of small businesses, which Envestnet relies on, to one that is populated by multi-advisor firms, similar to other distribution channels. Many of the largest broker-dealers have launched their own RIA custody businesses (LPL being the first) moving to a relatively new, dually-registered model as a means of retaining business. This is going to create a significant headwind as independent RIA growth is likely to slow, at least compared to the last decade, creating a smaller potential pool of clients to Envestnet.The below chart from their investor presentation details the opportunity they think they have to expand their business. Certainly they can continue to take on the RIA, dual-registered segments but they will likely only be able to scratch the surface of the large, albeit shrinking, categories below those. Most of these companies either have their own research and back office operations to use or have relationships with firms that do.Account growth, their version of same store sales growth, grew roughly 10% while advisor growth is targeted at 6%-8% per year. Envestnet currently has approximately 11% share of their target market of 260k advisors. Capacity is certainly something to keep an eye on as valuations imply continued strong advisor growth for many years to come. If they cannot break strongly into those other channels, it will become difficult to keep up that organic rate.The custodial platforms are also building out their own technology or gobbling up software pieces and firms in order to bolster their offerings to advisors. The institutional custodial business is led by Schwab with TD Institutional, and Fidelity far behind. These firms also see the growth of the RIA business over the last decade and are using their software technology to draw in more RIA business to trade on their advisor platforms. The larger custodians were caught off guard by the preponderance of new technology platforms that became available over the last decade while they tended to not invest heavily in their own platforms. Thus, they were forced to form strategic partnerships with firms like Envestnet, Tamarac, Black Diamond and the other larger software developers in high use by independent RIAs to integrate them with their own platforms in order to keep those advisors trading with them.A potential pitfall for Envestnet and other providers is that Schwab, TD and other custodians develop their own in-house technology that obviates the need to pay for Tamarac or other third-party software suites. This occurred recently with TD Institutional purchasing iRebal, a rebalancing software technology and adding it to their own platform therefore obviating the need for RIAs to purchase a third-party provider of that technology, which is one of the features of Tamarac, a recent acquisition of Envestnet.Fidelity, one of the largest custodians for the RIA space, currently has Envestnet on its WealthCentral platform for advisors. This relationship accounted for nearly a quarter of Envestnet's total revenues in 2012 with Envestnet's ten largest clients accounting for nearly half of the company's revenue. These are multi-year contracts that may be terminated after expiration of the contract term or prior for cause. The most recent contract with Fidelity was amended and renegotiated at the end of 2011 for a five-year term. Concentration risk is certainly something investors need to keep an eye on.The secular shift towards passive investments, which is becoming much more prevalent in the advisor world in addition to the retail world, is another risk for the firm as it will likely drive these advisors to seek lower asset-based fee rates. Typically advisors who are passive investors focus on fees carefully and may want to negotiate with Envestnet or other providers for lower rates.The explosion of new technology over the last five years has increased competition and will be moving the business towards a commoditized marketplace with falling prices. Even the big players are getting into the market with small business and small advisor products that are meant to compete and attract the registered investment advisor as the growth among the institutional world has contracted over the last five years.A large risk for Envestnet is Bloomberg and Factset, the two giants within the institutional world, who never discount on price (~$2,000/mo. per user) recently began offering contract buyouts for RIAs. In this large change in strategy, they will buy out an existing contract you have with a competitor- typically if it's less than 6-9 months- if you sign a two-year contract. This is clearly an attempt to break into the smaller, more cost-conscience RIA and small asset manager space.The strong sales environment over the last couple of years has also been driven by considerable market appreciation helping RIAs get to asset levels large enough to support investing in third party software. But what will happen when the market corrects again, which it undoubtedly will at some point? In down markets, you typically see a large jump in the number of advisors exiting the market.Another factor one has to consider is that this technology is continuously being updated and refreshed. Most advisors on their platform can switch at any time which makes execution on software and follow-on updates crucial. If the company has bugs that are persistent and debilitating to advisors, you could see a large migration away from their platform and to a competitor. This is also compounded by the fact that there really is no longer a competitive advantage around conversion. Previously, there was significant and costly downtime as assets moved from one custodian or software process to another. That time and cost has been shrinking and the advantage of 'legacy assets' is no longer sizeable.On October 10th, the company completed a successful (from the vantage point of the firm) secondary offering selling an additional 5.8 million shares at the price of $29.25. Share count was up 2.5 million shares in 3Q13 compared to a year before. While not an enormous amount of shares and dilution, it should worry investors if more are coming in order for the company to make more acquisitions. Shares outstanding since 2010 are up nearly 70.4%! That's not exactly shareholder friendly.But most of all the short thesis rests on the valuation call which I detail below.RisksThe primary risk stems from the proliferation of competition from startup technology firms looking to break into the very lucrative and massive space. The Bloomberg terminal was one of the precursors of the modern day turnkey platforms, built for bond traders over two-and-a-half decades ago. Since then financial data providers bloomed creating several competitors that served the burgeoning institutional asset management business. That time has arrived for the now flourishing RIA business with firms competing to create software platforms that aid in their business models.Go to any conference that serves the advisor business, for instance Schwab IMPACT which recently took place in Washington DC, and you will see hundreds of exhibitors paying big money to have a spot on their floor to peddle their new piece of technology aimed at making an advisor's business a whole lot easier and cheaper.The largest turnkey asset management platform (TAMP) providers include SEI Investments, Genworth Financial, Lockwood Advisors (BNY Mellon), as well as Morningstar. This area of the financial services technology market has become vogue and Envestnet certainly enjoys first-mover advantage. However, I've always thought too much emphasis is placed on the first-mover advantage giving an excessive premium to those companies.Additionally, custodial platforms are offering more choices and not locking in with one TAMP. For instance, Fidelity's WealthCentral recently added six new software choices and also created deeper integrations with existing applications. For the custodial platforms, it's about offering more choices in order to convince advisors to switch from other custodians. Envestnet's solutions are already on the largest RIA platforms, thus it becomes harder to organically grow simply by integrating on other custodian platforms.Risks to my short thesis include: 1) a booming market that continues for a number of years, 2) consolidation within the industry that allows for lower levels of competition in the market, and 3) a buyout of Envestnet by a larger organization which could include the larger custodians of Schwab, TD, or Fidelity.ValuationClearly, the risks are there and being underappreciated as the space is really in transition. The disruption within the financial data and back-office technology market has been in flux for several years.The valuation is dependent on several variables and a confluence of macro events taking place in order to justify this type of multiple and growth expectancy. In my discounted cash flow analysis, I used an average top line growth rate of 36% per year through 2019 when the company reaches $1.3 billion in annual revenue from the current expected approximate $230 million in 2013. Margins are currently microscopic and the entire thesis rests on the company being able to build significant scale within their operations, which to date, they haven't been able to accomplish. However, in my model I gave the firm the benefit of the doubt with operating margins increasing from 1.9% last year to 4% this year, 7% in 2014 and up to 15% by 2018. This would be a phenomenal accomplishment if it occurs. Still, with those assumptions, and no further share dilution, which is a fantasy, intrinsic value is still well below the current trading price.Other assumptions include advisor growth near 10% per year, account growth in the mid-teens, on average over the next 6 years, and conversions of roughly 5% on a current $25 billion run rate.This model also returns adjusted earnings of $50 million in 2015 (GAAP earnings of $32 million) on EBITDA of $88 million. This equates to adjusted EPS of $1.35, well above the Street's consensus estimates for 2015 of $1.05 for adjusted EPS on EBITDA of $74 million. In other words, my assumptions are not conservative by any means. Apply any reasonable multiple to those results you wish but you would have to apply a 30x multiple just to get to the current trading price. You need to apply more than a 50x multiple on the Street's current estimates to get to the current share price!These assumptions also assume the market moves up steadily from here. Given the significant correlation between revenue growth and assets under management, which is primarily driven by market forces, a swoon in the equity market would mean significant downside risk.Revenue growth was strongest in 2012 when it rose 27.7% but 2013 is expected to accelerate to 54%. But these numbers should taper starting in 2014 to 37% and then to 19.5% according to sell-side estimates. The growth this year was a combination of strategic acquisitions and market appreciation. But the chances in my mind that we see another 20%+ S&P 500 increase in 2014 are low which would help temper revenue growth somewhat. Clearly, models for growth on the company do not take into account the possibility of a recession (do they ever?) which would directly impact the company on both assets and number of advisors.When you can't make the numbers work no matter how bullish you make the assumptions, it typically means there is a mispricing in the market and/or expectations have become disjointed with reality.Catalysts LowerConclusionEnvestnet is a disruptor on a smaller scale than the Netflix's, Tesla's, and Google's of the world. However, technology without a moat is typically a short-lived event. The company has benefited from both a secular shift away from broker-dealers but that has been aided by significant market appreciation over the last several years. An ever higher market is something that cannot be assumed, just like forever rising housing prices in 2007. Valuations have become split from rational expectations and investors are ignoring many of the obvious risks within the industry.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

3549936,54942,2015-10-06T06:45:00-04:00,"Shares of Envestnet have fallen by half in the last several months as our thesis of slower growth and low-return acquisitions continues to play out.The company acquired data mining company Yodlee which while we think provides it added functionality, was expensive with no barriers to entry.Our contention is growth will continue to slow rather dramatically as the company's customer acquisition costs continue to rise.","We last wrote on Envestnet (NYSE:ENV) in late 2013 making a bearish call on the name. Our short thesis nearly two years ago was predicated on its perpetual acquisition strategy which we didn't think was creating value nor consolidating an industry that is technology-based with little-to-no barriers to entry. The thesis starting playing out last year as account growth slowed rather dramatically and ever softer guidance was disseminated from management.Shares continued to rise after we made our call going to over $57 from $39. Since early May, the shares have fallen precipitously by nearly half and we think could fall further before stabilizing. A portion of the decline came after the company reported weak first quarter results which missed expectations. The larger portion of the drop came in early August when the company announced its acquisition of Yodlee Inc. (NASDAQ:YDLE) in conjunction with slightly better second quarter earnings.Yodlee Acquisition Confirms Our ThesisEnvestnet announced that it was acquiring Yodlee, Inc., a leading cloud-based platform for banks and financial institutions that provides financial data and money movement. On the news, Envestnet shares fell more than 30% as the $590 million transaction which is expected to close later this year, clearly soured investor sentiment.The data mining company was founded in 1999 and has more than 20 million paid users and over 850 financial institutions on its platform. The company generated $99 million in revenue which means Envestnet paid 6x ttm revenue for the company. Management expects the deal to be accretive in 2017 but only to adjusted EPS. However, it will be dilutive in 2016 which indicates to us that the risk is to the downside should the synergies not materialize. But with the recent share price decline, the purchase price dropped to $470 million, net of cash with a present value of NOLs at $60 million. That multiple was approximately 3.5x 2016 estimated revenue and approximately 40% of Envestnet's market value.The market (and us) clearly does not believe in the cross-selling abilities. But we believe that the company is reaching the limits of its faster growth as many of the overhangs we cited two years ago are coming to fruition. The data mining market is a very crowded space with more companies entering every week. At a recent financial conference for RIAs that we attended, we couldn't help notice the plethora of new technology that is being marketed to advisors and independent representatives. The fall off in the share price was so egregious that the company felt compelled to update its acquisition presentation.Key Operating Metrics Growth SlowingThe slowdown we expected in account growth and other key metrics has materialized. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the company was generating new account growth of +64% with advisors assets growing by 80%+ YoY and advisor count up 42% YoY. Assets under management totaled $177 million at year-end 2013. Heading through 2014, the growth in accounts and nearly every other metric had fallen substantially. Accounts rose 33%, half the growth rate of the year prior with assets rising just 38%, less than half the prior year's growth rate. Moving into 2015, the growth slowed further, rising 23% and advisor growth of just 18%. While not slow growth by any means, the trajectory is clearly slowing as the business matures.More importantly, the company has been unable to generate much in the way of operating leverage. In fiscal 2011, EBITDA margin was 17.3% which fell to 11.9% in fiscal 2012, 11.6% in 2013, and has only slightly recovered in fiscal 2014 to 12.0%. This despite the ""synergies"" being realized from the six acquisitions that it has conducted over the last five years - all of which have been ""transformational.""(Source: Bloomberg)We think the sell-side is finally getting that growth is not going to be sustained at 40+% in perpetuity and that margins and operating leverage will not magically appear. Our contention is that account growth will slow further as advisors look to cut costs and combat the existing threats from robo-advisors and passive investing. The company's target market is the 240,000 advisors that comprise total market of financial services. Today, it has over 42,000 advisors equating to 17.5% of the total market.It's interesting to note that the company downgraded its total number of advisors in its target market from 258K to 240K in the last two years. We think capacity issues are pressing up against its growth rate, slowing it down markedly. We believe that the advisor acquisition costs - the costs to market, sell and bring on a new advisor onto the platform, is rising fairly rapidly resulting in lower returns (new advisor growth) on its investment.In addition to slower growth, we do not think the margin potential is likely to materialize the way the Street anticipates. As you can see in the Bloomberg chart above, revenue is expected to pick up in 2016 off of the 2015 rate with EBITDA margins some 700 bps higher than they were over the last twelve months. But the question is does the share price already not believe those figures?Lower Fee Rates And RevenuesThe company generates revenue based on assets under management to which a fee is applied. We think fee rates will be in secular decline for quite some time as the advisor world battles the growth of the robo-advisor industry. The robo-advisor space is largely passive, and the passive movement among both robo-advisors, financial advisors, and investors are highly focused on fees paid. As the percentage of total advisors continues to shift towards passive investing, the total capacity available to Envestnet is likely to continue to decline.The other threat is from the end of the bull market which would decrease the assets under management and create a market impact headwind to revenue. While we do not want to speculate on the overall direction of the market, any investor should realize that the current bull market run is likely nearing its apex. And with the current correction in the S&P 500 (SPX), it could be that the run is already over.Lastly, competition remains a key threat as we noted above. The massive proliferation of new technology and substitute providers of this type of platform means that fees are likely capped and more likely than not heading lower. We think the SaaS platforms of these companies are liable to focus on share and volume growth rather than high margin business to grow their ventures. We believe that much of the low hanging fruit for Envestnet in this regard has been picked as we believe it has captured many of the larger advisors.ValuationWe believe the valuation is currently in the midst of being reset much lower as the market finally realizes that the industry is in a state of high of flux. We think the disruption threats are finally being appreciated. That said, the market has substantially re-rated the shares lower. The chart below details the forward P/E and the EV/EBITDA ratio over the last five years. The red arrow shows where our prior call occurred. While the share price proceeded higher thereafter, the multiple contraction produced a strong headwind.(Source: Bloomberg)We think the multiple will ultimately match its underlying EBITDA growth rate in the mid-teens over the next two years. For now, the re-rating is likely producing a valuation that is close to fair given the risks and costs from the Yodlee acquisition.Our forecast calls for revenue to slow to 20% this year and the mid-to-high teens over the subsequent two years. This, of course, is predicated on the overall market not entering a bear market and declining further from here. If that were to occur, growth rates would have to come down further.We think the shares are worth around $35 today and high $30s one year out. But given current market dynamics and the amount of bearish sentiment, we wouldn't be surprised if the shares fell further from here before rebounding. We believe the market may be impounding negative market impact headwinds into the shares as it is set to report third quarter figures. The S&P 500 declined by more than 7.5% in the quarter, which will likely produce flat to slightly negative asset under management for Envestnet. As its growth rate continues to slow, net flows will likely continue to decline, especially as a percentage of total AUM. As such, the market impact piece of the formula will become more prominent and cause the shares to trade more based on market movements rather than net flows. This is likely to increase the overall beta of the shares as flows are no longer large enough to stabilize the growth.ConclusionWhile our call on Envestnet nearly two years ago turned out to be a bit early, it did turn out to be correct. We ultimately believe that growth is slowing fairly rapidly and that the multiple at which the shares trade will come down further, producing a significant headwind to the shares. In addition, assets under management are likely going to post their first year-on-year declines when the company reports its third quarter figures in early November. We think the shares are worth around $35 but that the shares will likely continue to be under pressure for the time being due to the Yodlee acquisition and weak overall market."
3061816,39591,2015-04-10T10:07:44-04:00,"I like Envestnet for its high customer switching costs, its edge over competitors and its growth prospects.
        But I am worried about the disruptive threat of robo-advisors and Envestnet’s current valuations offer a limited margin of safety.
        Target price, based on my assumptions of a forward P/E multiple of 35 and an estimated 2016 EPS of $1.59, implies limited upside.","Elevator PitchA significant number of software companies are high quality investment candidates due to their high customer switching costs and Envestnet (NYSE:ENV) is no exception. In Envestnet's case, it also benefits from a long growth runway with respect to the growing demand for financial advice and financial advisors' increased emphasis on technology. However, robo-advisors pose a serious disruptive threat to the traditional financial advisory model (and Envestnet' business) due to their lower costs and the dubious benefits of human expert advice. Furthermore, the positives for Envestnet have been priced in at current valuations. I arrive at a target price of $55.96 for Envestnet by applying a 35 times forward P/E multiple to my 2016 estimated EPS of $1.59. My target price implies limited upside based on Envestnet's share price of $55.70 as of April 8, 2015.Company DescriptionEnvestnet is a leading provider of integrated wealth management software and services to independent financial advisors and financial institutions. With more than $246 billion of fee-generating assets under management (AUM) and assets under administration (AUA), it was named by Money Management Institute as the largest independent wealth management services provider in terms of platform assets. Envestnet boasts a client base of more than 40,000 advisors across various financial institutions including 44 of the top 50 independent broker dealers and 12 of the 15 largest banks in the U.S.Competitive AdvantagesEnvestnet has performed exceptionally well financially in the most recent financial year and the past decade. It grew its revenue and adjusted EBITDA by 44% and 45% respectively in 2014. Over the past decade, it has done similarly well. Envestnet expanded its top line by a nine-year CAGR of 27% from $40 million in 2005 to $349 million in 2014. With respect to operating earnings, it increased its adjusted EBITDA by a 2006-2014 CAGR of 33% to $55.9 million for the most recent financial year. Envestnet's excellent financial performance is attributed to the competitive advantages that it possesses.Envestnet benefits from high customer switching costs, which drives its ability to cross-sell more services to its existing clients. A financial advisor who has moved his clients and their assets to Envestnet's platform would have already incurred significant time and effort to learn about and integrate his daily workflow with its systems. If the financial advisor chooses to switch to an alternative provider, he risks losing his clients during the potential disruption and downtime experienced during the transfer period. Envestnet's breadth of products and solutions also imply that its clients are more likely to sign up for additional services on its platform as their needs grow.Envestnet is also well-positioned to deal with the threat of various competitors. Asset custodians like Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) also have competing advisor trading tools, but the fact that they are custodians themselves and do not accommodate multi-custodian clients limits their ability to take market share away from Envestnet. Niche service providers that provide specialized products such as Advent Software (NASDAQ:ADVS) are also not competitive, since financial advisors will naturally prefer to work on an integrated platform (versus discrete single point services) such as Envestnet for the sake of efficiency and productivity. In my opinion, Envestnet's biggest threat comes from turnkey asset management platforms offered by companies such as SEI Investments Company (NASDAQ:SEIC) and Lockwood Advisors, since these companies provide a relatively broader range of services (compared with niche service providers) and have the ability to support a multi-custodian platform. Nevertheless, the turnkey asset management platform services providers still offer fewer choices of products and services compared with Envestnet. Envestnet's broad spectrum of services is shown below:Growth RunwayThe growth story for Envestnet is not over yet, despite its impressive historical revenue and earnings track record. There are two key trends supporting the positive outlook for Envestnet's future growth prospects.Firstly, an increasing number of people realize the need for financial advice. According to annual surveys conducted by Phoenix Marketing International, the proportion of U.S. households who expressed the view that they need more financial advice increased from 29% in 2009 to 35% in 2014. This is validated by the fact that the percentage of U.S. households who invested their monies via financial advisors grew from 50% in 2008 to 86% in 2013, based on research by Cerulli Associates.Secondly, more financial advisors are leveraging on technology to be more competitive. The results of the 2014 Fidelity RIA Benchmarking Study indicated that approximately 47% of respondents perceived ""investing in new or existing technology"" as a top strategic priority. Financial advisors utilizing technology platforms such as those offered by Envestnet benefit from increased efficiency and productivity.Envestnet can capitalize on these growth opportunities via both organic and inorganic strategies.In terms of organic growth strategies, Envestnet can either increase the sell-through rates for existing enterprises & advisors which it has relationships with or cross-sell more services to individual advisors. It increased the mean number of AUM/AUA accounts on a per advisor basis from 21 to 34 between 2010 and 2014, or equivalent to a five-year CAGR of 64%. Envestnet can also further broaden its products and services portfolio via research & development and mergers & acquisitions to expand revenue per advisor or account.With respect to inorganic growth, Envestnet has completed five major acquisitions since its IPO in 2010. These acquisitions can be sub-divided into the strategic and consolidation categories. Envestnet's acquisitions of Tamarac and Prima Capital Holding were strategic in nature. Tamarac was a leading provider of back office management software to RIAs; while Prima Capital brought its investment manager due diligence capabilities to Envestnet's portfolio. Envestnet added $30 billion of AUM/AUA with its acquisitions of FundQuest and Placemark in 2011 and 2014 respectively. However, not everything goes according to plan. Envestnet's integration of WMS (a consolidating acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2013) has fallen behind schedule, with the expected completion of the WMS integration delayed (from 2015) to 2016.Disruptive Threat From Robo-AdvisorsWhile Envestnet has a significant edge vis-à-vis its business-to-business competitors and has a seemingly long growth runway, changes in the business-to-consumer space have the potential to disrupt the traditional financial advisory model and negatively impact its operations.One such emerging trend is the rise of online, automated, ""advisor-less"" investment platforms, or otherwise known as robo-advisors. According to data collected on 11 leading online investment platforms by Corporate Insight, the AUM for these robo-advisors increased by 65% to almost $19 billion between April 2014 and December 2014. Besides growing their AUM at a rapid pace, these robo-advisors now also have access to more funds for growth. Based on CB Insights' research, the amount of funds raised by robo-advisors doubled to $290 million between 2013 and 2014. As a further validation of the future potential of robo-advisers, Charles Schwab became the first major investment firm to launch a robo-advisor platform this year, which it named as ""Institutional Intelligent Portfolios.""While the robo-advisors are still small in terms of AUM, there are a few reasons why they have the potential to take market share from traditional financial advisors in the mid-to-long term. Firstly, a significant number of people are unable to get access to the traditional wealth management financial advisors, as they do not meet the minimum investment requirements, typically ranging from a few hundred grand to a million dollars. Secondly, even for people who meet the minimum investment requirements, they might prefer robo-advisors as a more cost-efficient approach of managing their monies. Under the traditional financial advisory model, fees are typically charged at 1% of AUM. In contrast, online investment platforms usually charge under 0.5% of AUM, with some even going for a flat monthly fee pricing model. Lastly, there is an increasing amount of evidence to show that investors will be better off ditching financial advisors and relying on automated models. Researchers Andreas Hackethal, Michael Haliassos and Tullio Jappelli tracked the investment accounts of over 30,000 individual investors over a six-year period and found that ""advisors are associated with lower total and excess account returns, higher portfolio risk and probabilities of losses, and higher trading frequency and portfolio turnover relative to what account owners of given characteristics tend to achieve on their own."" A research paper titled ""Clinical Versus Mechanical Prediction: A Meta-Analysis"" published in 2000 analyzed 136 studies on the topic of mechanical analysis versus human judgment and the results showed that human judgment was substantially superior to mechanical analysis in 6%-16% of the studies.That being said, affluent investors might still stick with their human advisors. According to a Spectrem study titled ""Wealthy Investors and Their Perceptions of Virtual Advisors"" which surveyed more than 3,000 investors with a minimum investable net worth of $100,000, only 6% of respondents have ever used a robo-advisor.Target PriceEnvestnet trades at a significant premium to its peers, Advent Software, SEI Investments and Charles Schwab on both forward EV/EBITDA and forward P/E multiples. While I believe that Envestnet deserves to trade at a premium based on reasons outlined above, the disparity in valuations between Envestnet and its peers is too wide in my opinion.ENV EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YChartsENV PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsI arrive at a target price of $55.96 for Envestnet by applying a 35 times forward P/E multiple to my 2016 estimated EPS of $1.59. I assume that Envestnet will grow its top line by a two-year CAGR of 20% to $502.2 million for 2016. I also forecast that the Company will improve its adjusted net profit margin from 8.5% to 11.0% driven by operating leverage, resulting in a 2016 EPS of $1.60. My target price implies limited upside based on Envestnet's share price of $55.70 as of April 8, 2015."

It touches over $347 billion in assets, and its business model as a platform is highly compelling for its recurring revenue and stickiness. Strong management with skin-in-the-game and a long-term oriented strategy is likely to continue to build shareholder value. A series of strategic acquisitions that temporarily slowed EPS growth in 2012 and the overhang of a likely equity offering ahead of approximately 1/4 of the shares (from existing shareholders) have created a potentially attractive entry for new investors.Company DescriptionENV, based in Chicago, was formed in 1999 and is now one of the largest providers of wealth management solutions to independent financial advisors today. Its open-architecture approach allows its customers, financial advisors, to compete with entities with much larger resources. The solutions, delivered over the internet, are flexible and customizable.To give a sense of growth, five years ago total platform assets were approximately $82 billion with almost 600K accounts. 2.5 years ago, when it went public in July 2010 at $9, it had $139 billion on the platform, 910K investor accounts and 21,500 advisors. Today? $347 billion in total assets ($93 billion in assets under management or administration and the balance from arrangements covered by license), 1.6mm accounts and 22,500 advisors.The company recently presented at the ICR conference, and the following slide (link to complete slides at bottom of article) demonstrates its consistent and impressive growth:The growth is mainly organic, though the company has done both strategic as well as what it calls ""consolidating"" acquisitions. On the former, it bought Tamarac and Prima last year. Tamarac is a leading provider of tools for investment advisors that enable them to rebalance portfolios, report performance and manage their customer relationships. Prima provides investment manager due diligence, asset allocation and multi-manager portfolios. These are two premier organizations, with strong reputations in the investment management industry, where ENV can extend its solutions to its own customers. FundQuest was an example of a consolidating transaction, where it bought $15 billion of assets.Most of the business is tied to assets under management or assets under advisory, with this 85% billed quarterly, typically in advance and representing 82% of revenue. The balance is tied to multi-year fixed-fee agreements with large enterprise clients.The ultimate success of the company is tied to growing the number of advisors on the platform and increasing the share of its practices by offering high-value solutions. Recent trends bode well, as despite a lack of overall growth in the number of advisors, ENV has sustained approximately 20% organic growth, with almost 10% coming from adding advisors and a bit more than 10% coming from its advisors adding assets (more customers).Thesis & Catalyst For Envestnet, Inc.Quite simply, ENV is an effective way to play some trends that are well established and likely to persist. First, after two huge bear markets in the last decade or so, it's not surprising that many households are turning to financial advisors rather than investing on their own. According to Cerulli Associates, the percentage grew from 50% to 66% from 2008-2011. A second big trend is the shift away from transactional business, where a ""broker"" is paid a ""commission"" to a fee-based model. A third trend that plays toward ENV is the increasing prevalence of independent advisors, as investors run from the conflicts and poor performance that has been historically provided by brokerage or even advisory units of investment banks. Finally, technology has become an increasingly important aspect for independent advisors who want to be more efficient, enhance client service and scale their business. ENV is an outsourcing play that makes these advisors better able to compete and to focus on advising.ENV's solutions, which are integrated, comprehensive and delivered over the internet, serve to create a huge network effect. Its customers are able to easily manage portfolio strategies across multiple custodians, with access to best-of-breed solutions. ENV, then, seems well positioned to achieve scale as its advisors grow their own businesses and as the market appreciates over the long-term.Company ManagementOne of the most compelling aspects of ENV is the tenure and quality of the management team, led by Jud Bergman (56). Bergman, a veteran of Nuveen Mutual Funds, where he directed the corporate development activity from 1992-1997, is a visionary who has been able to draw a substantial number of his former co-workers, most who joined him at the inception.It also doesn't hurt that insider ownership aligns well with the public owners. Total insider ownership is somewhat exaggerated at 25% (8.4mm shares) because much of it is held by private equity funds with representatives on the Board of Directors, but it is compelling nonetheless. Bergman is the largest individual holder at about 1.4mm shares beneficially (4%). President Bill Crager holds about 1.6% of the company beneficially. Co-founder Brandon Thomas owns about 1.1%.Competitive LandscapeENV has been taking share of the overall market. While there are possibly some new platforms, the real competition now consists of turn-key providers, like Genworth (NYSE:GNW), SEI (NASDAQ:SEIC) and Lockwood Advisors [an affiliate of Pershing, which is a subsidiary of BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK)]. Here, ENV offers a more robust and complete solution. There are also technology competitors, like Advent Software (NASDAQ:ADVS), which offer solutions to just a small part of the overall need. ENV also competes to an extent with its custodial partners, like Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD). ENV plays to the real world, where most advisors are unwilling or unable to lock themselves into a single custodian.ValuationENV isn't a value stock by any stretch, but I think that the valuation is justifiable. Here is a look at two metrics: Forward PE and Price/Sales (using Baseline):In case it's not clear, the current forward PE is close to the median since the IPO and down from its peak in 2011. On a P/S basis, the current 3X ratio is near the median as well. It's important to understand that the growth in earnings slowed dramatically in 2012 due to the acquisitions mentioned above. Currently, though, analysts forecast robust growth to come back in 2013 and 2014. The current consensus for 2013 of $0.56 represents 73% growth over the 2012 consensus. For 2014, the consensus is $0.72 (+28%). The company has provided a long-term goal of growing sales by 20% and cash flow by 25% as it increases adjusted EBITDA to 30% over time.While one can view this as a 25% growth kind of company trading at 25PE, I actually prefer to look at that P/S metric, which has been relatively stable. Ordinarily, I might use EV/S, but I think that most investors assumed that the IPO cash on the books would be reinvested, as it was in 2012 (as of Q3, the company had $21mm cash, or less than $1 per share). Notice how stable this metric has been since mid-2011. 3X seems quite reasonable given the growth-rate and the margins.As I think about the future valuation, I look out a year and project a 24PE on that .72, which is a bit over $17 per share. Looking at sales, which are estimated to grow 26% in 2013 to $197mm, a 3X multiple a year out would represent almost $600mm market-cap (about $18). So, just harvesting the growth and maintaining current valuation ratios suggests 25%-30% appreciation.In terms of comparisons, ENV is much smaller and is growing much more rapidly than SEIC or GNW. SEIC ($4.3 billion market cap) trades at 18PE and 4.5X sales, while GNW ($4 billion market cap) isn't really comparable due to its different business model for the bulk of its business. ADVS ($1.2 billion market cap) trades at 21 PE and 3.5X sales. It is projected to grow sales by 6% and EPS by 14% in 2013, so much slower.One really neat company that I think does bear comparison though it is not a competitor at all is Financial Engines (NASDAQ:FNGN), which provides solutions to individuals with retirement accounts held at their employers. This company ($1.4 billion market cap) is projected to grow sales by 21% in 2013 and EPS by 24% and trades at 47PE and 7.5X sales!So,the valuation isn't the reason to buy, but it's not a reason not to buy. I believe that my 3X sales assumption could see some expansion, especially if the company delivers on its steady progression of operating margin expansion that was sidetracked by the acquisitions in 2012. Investors should appreciate not only the growth potential but also the fact that so much of the revenue is recurring.One note of caution and why I am on the sidelines now is that there is likely to be a large distribution of stock in the near future. On December 11, the company filed an S-3 detailing registration for potential sale of about 8.5mm shares (25% of the company!). Importantly, there are no new shares being issued. CEO Bergman may sell 40K shares and another insider 10K, but the bulk are on behalf of investors GRP Partners (3.4mm), Technology Crossover Ventures (1.4mm), Foundation Capital (1.4mm - all), FMR (1.1mm - all) and Apex Investment Fund IV (1.1mm - all). It's not uncommon after an IPO to see private equity funds move on, and, given the rise in the stock over the past 30 months, it's not too concerning, especially considering that insider ownership will still be substantial. The removal of this overhang and perhaps better liquidity are reasons to be more optimistic about ENV following the pending deal.Variant ViewAdditional ResourcesDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Its offerings run the gamut from back-office and reporting services to financial planning tools and account management. Envestnet is benefiting from the shift toward independent advisors, who lack the scale to perform these functions in-house and use Envestnet as a cost-effective alternative. The company, which was founded by executives from Nuveen Investments and is backed by venture firms GRP Partners and Foundation Capital, is looking to go public in a $100 million IPO; Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), UBS (NYSE:UBS) and Barclays (NYSE:BCS) are the bookrunners on the deal, which is on this week's IPO calendar.Business modelEnvestnet offers its clients the flexibility to pick from a range of front-, middle- and back-office services, including portfolio diagnostics, proposal generation, investment model management, rebalancing and trading, performance reporting and monitoring, and billing, as well as fiduciary oversight.

Most of its revenue is generated on a percent-of-assets basis (the average fee is about 0.17% of assets).Market tractionEnvestnet has grown the number of accounts it services at a 39% CAGR since 2005, and assets have grown at a 29% CAGR despite the financial crisis. The company has a customer base that consists of some well-known names (Ameriprise, Pershing, Charles Schwab, TIAA-CREF and Fidelity) as well as a large number of independent advisors. The company generated $78 million in revenue in 2009 and it believes it can grow sales at a 20% CAGR; near-term sales growth should be strong thanks to a large contract signed with a BNP Paribas subsidiary in May. EBITDA margins have been held in the low teens by large marketing and administration expenses, but the company believes it can eventually scale EBITDA margin to the upper twenties, representing long-term EBITDA growth of 25%.Key risksWhile Envestnet has gained traction in the marketplace and should continue to benefit from secular trends, there are numerous risks to this story. The company has yet to shown that it can scale expenses and it may never be able to reach its margin targets. Revenue is linked to assets and thus susceptible to market fluctuations. Fees have come down since 2007, which caused revenue to fall 15% in 2009. Finally, the business is competitive and some of its large customers also offer their own competing services.IPO OutlookEnvestnet addresses an important area of the financial industry and is growing in recognition (the company was recently highlighted in a cover story in Financial Planning magazine), which should boost interest in its IPO.  Additionally, recent financial services/technology IPOs like SS&C (NASDAQ:SSNC), Financial Engines (NASDAQ:FNGN) and Green Dot (NYSE:GDOT) have all traded up more than 10% since their IPOs. That said, Envestnet still has a lot to prove, and insider selling coupled with a valuation that bakes in its expected margin expansion may lead some investors to remain on the sidelines."

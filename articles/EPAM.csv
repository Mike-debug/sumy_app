        However, due to the impact of COVID-19, revenue growth has recently begun to significantly slow, and will likely be relatively flat in Q3 versus Q2.
        The still high valuation implies COVID-19 will just be a bump in the road for EPAM, and the market just might be right.","EPAM Systems (EPAM) is a Pennsylvania based leading global provider of digital platform engineering, architectural, consulting, and software development services. The company began in 1993 and has demonstrated a CAGR in revenue of ~25% over the past five years. As a result, the stock has been a ""high-flyer"" and is up ~45% YTD. However, COVID-19 has significantly impacted how EPAM directly engages with their clients and has therefore had a negative affect on the company's revenue growth. Today, we'll look at what EPAM does and if the current market valuation is in-step with the company's underlying fundamentals.As the graphic below summarizes, EPAM has a technically based staff that delivered $2.3 billion in revenue last year and has grown revenue at a CAGR of 31% over the past 10 years:Source: Q2 PresentationThe company's revenue is nicely diversified across six industry segments and derives 60% of revenue from North America, 33% from Europe, the 7% from the rest-of-world. The company's EPAM Continuum product, launched last year, is an integrated platform for Consulting and Engineering services. Continuum now serves 90 of the Fortune 500 companies and more than 50% of the Forbes 2000 (see slide 9).EPAM released Q2 earnings on August 6th and some 6 month yoy changes are highlighted in red in the graphic below: Source: Q2 EPS ReportAs can be seen, revenue over the past 6 months grew 19.7% as compared to the year earlier period. Cost-of-revenue grew relatively inline with revenue, while all other expenses came in relatively below the revenue growth rate. As a result, net income was up 26% over the first 6 months of 2020 as compared to 2019.In the report, EPAM CEO & President Arkadiy Dobkin said about the quarter:The company reported it had cash (or cash equivalents) of $995 million at the end of June, which was up $57 million from the start of the year. With only $25 million of long-term debt, net cash works out to $970 million, or an estimated $16.65/share based on the 58.246 million shares outstanding at the end of Q2. In addition, and judging from the company's first 6-month results, EPAM could generate an estimated $250 million in free-cash-flow FCF this year, or ~$4.30/share. The company does not pay a dividend.Due to COVID-19, the company is not giving full-year guidance, but for the upcoming Q3 it expects revenues will be in the range of $633-$643 million reflecting a 8.5% yoy increase at the mid-point of the range. Note also the midpoint of the range would be up less than 1% as compared to Q2. For Q3, the company expects GAAP diluted earnings will be in the range of $1.15-$1.24/share, the midpoint of which would be essentially flat as compared to Q2. Revenue is obviously and significantly slowing down from the company's historic growth rate:Source: Q2 PresentationOn the Q2 conference call, CEO Dobkin gave an example of how EPAM can help one of its customers, Epic Games:This is also an interesting anecdote for the power of Amazon's (AMZN) web services platform, which has obviously benefited from the growth in the number of Fortnite players.One risk that was pointed out in the article was the difficulty in finding technical talent in today's market. On the other hand, with such a large cash position and very little debt, EPAM has the ability to make some acquisitions to boost its growth rate.As can be seen in the chart below, EPAM has been a great performing company. It has significantly outperformed engineering based companies like Synopsys (SNPS) and Ansys (ANSS). It has even outperformed one of my favorite software investments - the iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (IGV) by 30% over the past year:Source: Seeking Alpha Charting Tool Over the past 12-months, EPAM has earned $5.07/share. The shares closed today (Monday) at $314.30 for a TTM P/E=62. Seeking Alpha estimates the forward P/E=53.Over the past 12-months, EPAM's total revenues were $2.5 billion. The current market cap is $17.7 billion, which equates to a price-to-sales ratio of 7x. That compares quite favorably with engineering services companies like Ansys at 56x 2019 revenue and Synopsys at 9.2x revenues, not to mention that EPAM grew last 6-months revenue much faster than either of the two (see Ansys: Simulating Its Way To An Astonishing Valuation). Note both those companies also have a large component of revenue coming from a software-as-a-service or SaaS-based recurring revenue model.EPAM has over $16/share in cash, hardly any debt, and could generate up to $250 million in FCF flow. While it is trading at a discount to peers like Synopsys and Ansys, the P/E (either trailing or forward) still seems rich in my opinion at ~2x the S&P500 P/E=28. While that valuation was warranted given EPAM's historical growth rate and margins, that growth rate is slowing because of COVID-19. However, if any engineering services company can figure out a way to engage remotely to collaborate on projects, it would be EPAM Systems. But it remains to be seen how long it will take for EPAM to get back to its pre-COVID 25% revenue growth rate. For now, and like many of the software based companies I have covered recently, the valuation is stretched in my opinion, and I much prefer a more diversified approach to the software sector - like the IGV ETF mentioned earlier, which actually closed 1.8% higher today (Monday) despite overall market weakness."
4346658,105417,2020-05-12T13:13:37-04:00,"Core verticals stand at 20%+ Y/Y revenue growth, in line with prior quarters, though some pressures around Travel and Consumer groups.COVID-19 is actually accelerating digital demand.Annual guidance remains suspended but 2nd quarter guidance was a pleasant surprise.","EPAM Systems (EPAM) beat first quarter revenue by approximately $1.5 MM, coming in at $651 MM and representing ~25% Y/Y growth. Further, the company's quarterly EPS was $1.43, or 3.1 cents above consensus. In our view, these small beats are less important than the overall picture painted by EPAM's management for the rest of 2020. We were glad they went into some level of detail, as it allows us to further reaffirm our thesis, despite some pressure points.More specifics on revenue beat: Revenue grew 24.9% Y/Y (note 20%+ growth even during a COVID quarter!) to $651.4 million, overcoming FX headwinds of 1.1%. We note that performance was strong for Business Information and Media in particular, which alone grew 46% Y/Y. Further, Life Science and Healthcare segment grew 26.4% in 1Q. Software / Hi-Tech and Financial Services closely followed at 21.9% Y/Y and 16.2% growth, respectively. We note that growth was strong both organically and thanks to recent acquisitions.APAC experience drove EMEA and Americas response: EPAM was wise to draw on its Asia-Pacific experience in January and February to make sure that by March European and American employees were operating from home while their systems are functional and secure. This is key for EPAM: establishing and maintaining business continuity around its technology. This is step one before anything else can happen - and EPAM demonstrated first-class efficiency in that regard during the quarter. Further, APAC - a very small contributor to the overall revenue pie (see below) - proved to be a vital experience.Geographic composition remains solid: North America is still around 60% of total revenue, followed by Europe at around 34%, CIS at 4% and APAC at 2%. North America's revenue grew 23% Y/Y, Europe was up 28.7% Y/Y, while CIS and APAC saw revenue increase 36.8% Y/Y and 4.7% Y/Y, respectively. Overall, we are seeing a very diversified geographic story for Epam, and we expect this 20%+ growth traction to continue throughout 2020.COVID-19 is actually accelerating digital demand: Management noted that while some of their clients are focused on cost-cutting, these same clients are also focused on improving their digital efficiencies and, hence, are expanding their contracts on the digital side. As EPAM's CEO, Arkady Dobkin noted, these customers ""have chosen to accelerate the pace of their digital transformation in order to support radically changed demands for how they engage and serve their clients."" Our initial estimates indicate a potential quarterly upside of as much as $75 MM during each of the three remaining quarters in 2020.Travel and Consumer verticals to experience the greatest hit: It comes as no surprise, but these two particular verticals are the most hit at Epam. While the company is not releasing much data yet, we are adjusting our revenue estimates by as much as $90 MM downward on a quarterly basis (which is more than offsetting the digital tailwinds from the previous bullet), albeit our decision may be a bit conservative, since we 1) have no concrete proof that clients, like Expedia and Adidas, have or will in the near term downsize their contracts with Epam Systems and 2) that these revenue streams will not come back in 2021-22. However, in establishing and maintaining our Buy thesis, we do want to be conservative.Utilization rates remain stable: Utilization rate stood at 79.5% in 1Q, accelerating from 77.9% during the 4Q. We view this acceleration of 160 bps as a tremendous accomplishment, given all the turbulence that took place during the first quarter.Annual guidance remains suspended but 2nd quarter guidance was a pleasant surprise: Recall that on April 9, EPAM preannounced and withheld guidance. At that time, we believed that providing quarterly guidance was also off the table. Yet, Epam has regrouped since then and provided the following for 2Q: revenue in the $590-$605 MM range, with 8.3% Y/Y growth at the midpoint of the range; non-GAAP income from operations in the 14%-16% range, and non-GAAP EPS in the $1.12 - $1.31 range. In our view, this guidance is fairly conservative and leaves the company room to update it later this quarter, if necessary, or - even better - position itself for a handsome second quarter beat. More importantly, this second quarter guidance is a signal that EPAM has been in touch with most, if not all, clients by now and has a solid idea of what to expect in the short run.We are currently modeling the P/E multiple of 36x for 2021 earnings, which we believe is fair, given the company's ability to navigate through the coronavirus crisis and actually up its digital demand. When we apply this multiple to our EPS estimate of $7.54, we get the target price of $273 (approximately 15% upside to the closing price on May 11).EPAM is a company that offers software engineering and product development solutions in the IT services space, being one of the leaders in the industry. The company occupies a niche space in consulting and outsourcing fields, focusing on lifecycle software testing, product deployment and end-user customization, performance tuning, managed services, and cross-platform migration, among other tasks. EPAM’s main competitors are Accenture, IBM, Cognizant, and Infosys, though its core differentiating factor is the labor sourcing platform, since the vast majority of the company’s employees come from Eastern Europe, largely Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. EPAM serves technology companies in financial service, travel and consumer, software and hi-tech, media and entertainment, as well as healthcare. It derives about 50% of revenue from the United States, 40% from Western Europe, and approximately 10% from CIS and the emerging markets.1. Geopolitical FactorsGiven that EPAM Systems sources labor force from the relatively volatile region of Eastern Europe, such as Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, we believe that political turmoil or destabilization could be harmful to the company’s operations. We saw how in 2014 EPAM shares plummeted 10-15% on the news of political upheaval in Ukraine. Further, continued sanctions levied on Russia could have a negative top-line impact on EPAM, albeit the company derives only 3-4% of total revenue from Russia. Finally, the price of oil, which has recently been on a steep decline, could play a major factor here.2. Pricing WarsWhile EPAM strives to make the pricing structure attractive to its core clients and, henceforth, attract greater business, we see Luxoft and Globant, EPAM’s two main competitors, potentially (and selectively) lowering prices as well. In turn, this could lead to a pricing war and result in lower revenues for both parties.3. Concentrated RevenueWith top 10 clients constituting about 45% of total revenue, we see any defection of a client or a reduction in the scope of the project as an inherent threat."
4333840,105417,2020-03-24T08:16:02-04:00,"In this note, we update our estimates on EPAM, while still retaining the Bullish thesis.
        We analyze the revenue stream on an account-by-account basis, since prospective losses vary based on the nature of each client's business.
        Financial services and tech companies clients should remain more loyal to Epam than retail and travel-related firms, as is implied by the nature of the coronavirus threat.","Our last update on EPAM was published on January 6 (See Article), long before the coronavirus scare became a reality. In that piece, we provided an update on EPAM's upcoming fourth quarter results and discussed the outlook for 2020. In the present piece, we believe it is important to provide an update on a client-by-client basis, which would offer insights into important revenue workstreams of the company. While we anticipate a hit to all major clients, and most likely to smaller clients as well, we see the IT Services workstreams as essential and believe that, relative to other industries, they will see the softest hit from major clients. We are currently modeling the impact of client hits (discussed below) to last through the fourth quarter of 2020. This is a more conservative assessment than what we are witnessing for most IT companies these days, which see the headwinds lasting mostly through the summer. However, even with these conservative estimates, we believe that the current impact to our 2020 EPS estimate is only 41 cents, which takes down our total estimate to $9.56 (from $9.97). When we apply it to our new market multiple of 20.5x (down from ~23.5, to reflect the impact to the S&P multiple), our new target price is $196, which represents approximately ~17% upside from the close on 03/20/2020.Barclays: One of the most loyal financial services clients, Barclays accounts for approximately 5% of total revenue for Epam. Barclays relies on tech backup systems, as well as some consulting revenue streams, from EPAM. At the same time, Barclays works with at least five other vendors, mainly large-cap companies, such as Cognizant (this is true for most large-cap bulge bracket banks). It is our understanding that Epam's pricing is far more competitive; therefore, once Barclays starts slashing consulting spending (a typical pattern during soft macro times), we expect Epam's share to be impacted less, relative to other vendors. UBS: A fellow European financial services company, UBS sources much of its cloud-related workstreams via Epam. Our channel checks indicate that about 20-30% of those workstreams may get impacted, which translates into approximately $20-$24 MM annually. We expect this impact annualized for 2020 (hence, translating into $15-$19 MM) and then potentially worsening in 2021, if the economic pressures persist. Overall, unlike during the Great Recession, banks are not as heavily hurt and their liquidity is much stronger; therefore, we expect the Financial Services sector to be among industries with the softest impact on the IT Services providers. Adidas: As is true for most retailers over the last two weeks, Adidas has largely went online. It is our understanding that the work Epam is doing for Adidas is largely digital. Therefore, there is a double-edged sword here. On one hand, Adidas would be more prone to cancel some workstreams with Epam than UBS or Barclays; on another hand, Adidas depends on Epam for the very services the company now needs to support. Therefore, we are not modeling any negative revenue impact from Adidas, but not excluding the possibility of revisiting the Adidas in the near term.Thomson Reuters: This business operates largely online, which, at a first glance, does not make it a likely candidate for reducing scope of engagements with Epam. However, over the last several years, TR has been meaningfully scaling back its work with Epam, as well as with other vendors. Business softness amidst the coronavirus outbreak may present further excuse to limit the Thomson Reuters' business engagement with Epam. We are modeling a hit of about $38 MM on an annualized basis.Google: This account, in our view, remains ironclad. The back-end outsourcing performed by Epam for Google's technology services team is integral to the latter's everyday operations. Even if Google cuts back on more than 25% of its operating expenses, the company's contract with Epam would remain solid. As a side note, the market rout has taken a heavy toll on the mega-cap technology giants, such as the FAANG names, but largely because these are high-beta names. In actuality, we expect Google and other fellow tech giants to remain solid in terms of their revenue streams, which in itself should further support companies like Epam.Expedia: This account could disappear altogether for Epam. There is no other way to say it! A travel-related business, Expedia has essentially come to a halt. We believe that Epam could lose this revenue stream its entirety in the next two-three months and possibly not get it back in the foreseeable future. This would be a hit of $24 MM on an annual basis. 1.

4310082,105417,2019-12-02T13:10:00-05:00,"Consumer remains strong, despite visible macro softness.
        Expect in-store sales to grow upper single digits in 2020.
        Consulting engagements are increasingly more prevalent, which is a major benefit for EPAM.","As we closely watched retailers report earnings over the last several weeks, there are several core takeaways for companies in our coverage. Below, after summarizing the company's business and reiterating the valuation, we discuss key implications for Epam Systems, where retail space makes up approximately 20% of total business.EPAM Systems (NYSE:EPAM) is a company that offers software engineering and product development solutions in the IT services space, being one of the leaders in the industry. The company occupies a niche space in consulting and outsourcing fields, focusing on lifecycle software testing, product deployment and end-user customization, performance tuning, managed services, and cross-platform migration, among other tasks. EPAM’s main competitors are Accenture (NYSE:ACN), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH), and Infosys (NYSE:INFY), though its core differentiating factor is the labor sourcing platform, since the vast majority of the company’s employees come from Eastern Europe, largely Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. EPAM serves technology companies in financial service, travel and consumer, software and hi-tech, media and entertainment, as well as healthcare. It derives about 50% of revenue from the United States, 40% from Western Europe, and approximately 10% from CIS and the emerging markets.ValuationPer our industry-wide analysis and EPAM’s strong fundamentals, as well as in light of the recent favorable guidance, we believe that EPAM shares merit ~22x P/E multiple on 2020 earnings. We note that this multiple comes at an ~1.5-2x discount relative to other players in the IT Services space. When we apply it to our 2020 non-GAAP EPS estimate of $9.81, we reach a target price of $216.Consumer Remains Strong, Despite Visible Macro Softness: Despite a slowdown in business investment across the board and softness in the manufacturing sector, the consumption sector remains strong in the United States. This is certainly good news for the economy, where consumer spending makes up about 65-70% of total spending. These strong consumer trends were solidly materializing in September-October government data; however, by late November reports from companies, like Target, Best Buy, and even Macy's, confirmed strong retailer traction. Expect In-Store Sales to Grow Upper Single Digits in 2020: Brick-and-mortar IT services projects should remain solid for EPAM's clients, like Adidas. These projects traditionally represent less than 30% of total revenue streams, but they are more stable and more recurring. Furthermore, initial indicators from Black Friday signal sales that could be as high as 15% Y/Y at some stores: this could be partly due to the fact that Thanksgiving 2018 took place amidst a much softer economic environment, hence, there were easy comps.Digital Traction is a Strong Read for SMAC: Most retailers have indicated continued strong demand for digital initiatives. We estimate that, on average, digital demand at retail stores has increased at 12-14% Y/Y in September-November, creating a strong set up for Cyber Monday and the entire month of December overall. If in-store offline sales are currently running above expectations, online sales are fairly in line, but they are strong enough to spell out enough demand for next-gen services.Website Work on the Rise: Of the twenty three retail companies we surveyed, more than half indicate upgrades to their websites, which is core to EPAM's offerings. We estimate that for EPAM this deliverable represents as much as 12% of total top line in 2019. Consulting Engagements Dominate: It is our understanding that new consulting workstreams in the retail space are outpacing new outsourcing engagements by a ratio of 4 to 1. This should come as no surprise since consulting work is usually stronger during good economic times, while outsourcing becomes a necessity during economic downturns. For EPAM, where consulting retail engagements are stronger, this is yet another tailwind. 1. Geopolitical FactorsGiven that EPAM Systems sources labor force from the relatively volatile region of Eastern Europe, such as Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, we believe that political turmoil or destabilization could be harmful to the company’s operations. We saw how in 2014 EPAM shares plummeted 10-15% on the news of political upheaval in Ukraine.

Concentrated RevenueWith top 10 clients constituting about 45% of total revenue, we see any defection of a client or a reduction in the scope of the project as an inherent threat.4. OPEX PressuresThe company faces incremental operating pressures, as it opens new markets not only to attract new clients but also to find new sources of labor. We believe that mismanagement of new OPEX investments may lead to higher-than-expected margins and thus threaten the company’s valuation."
4307968,105417,2019-11-20T07:10:36-05:00,"HP should do due diligence on EPAM, an $11 billion market cap company focused on IT Services.
        EPAM occupies a unique niche in the IT Services space, providing unmatched expertise and below-market pricing.
        While valuation may be rich, over time EPAM should prove as a profitable investment.","We have long maintained that EPAM Systems (EPAM) is one of the best acquisition targets in the IT Services space today. With HP's Board over the weekend unanimously rejecting XRX's unsolicited proposal to acquire it, the case for acquisition remains, in our view, albeit it is not one of Xerox. Given the generous cash flows of the HP and the company's well-known intent to diversify its holdings, EPAM may just do the trick. As we analyze HP's decision to reject Xerox's offer, we see three core possible reasons: 1) Xerox is too closely aligned with HP's core business, which may lead to some cannibalization effects; 2) There is disagreement on price (See article); and last but not least: 3) HP didn't initiate the acquisition talks, which in itself strengthens their bargaining position. We are not going to comment on the future of the HP-Xerox deal, though we do put the probability at less than 30%. Rather, we would like to reiterate our position that EPAM is an excellent acquisition target that would meaningfully diversify HP's platform, while adding a company with a 20%+ Y/Y annual revenue growth and 15% Y/Y annual EPS growth.Recall that EPAM is a company that offers software engineering and product development solutions in the IT services space, being one of the leaders in the industry. The company occupies a niche space in consulting and outsourcing fields, focusing on lifecycle software testing, product deployment and end-user customization, performance tuning, managed services, and cross-platform migration, among other tasks. EPAM’s main competitors are Accenture, IBM, Cognizant, and Infosys, though its core differentiating factor is the labor sourcing platform, since the vast majority of the company’s employees come from Eastern Europe, largely Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. EPAM serves technology companies in financial service, travel and consumer, software and hi-tech, media and entertainment, as well as healthcare. It derives about 50% of revenue from the United States, 40% from Western Europe, and approximately 10% from CIS and the emerging markets.Our channel checks indicate that EPAM should expect an expansion of their contractual scope from a number of core clients, such as Google, Expedia, Barclays, and possibly UBS. (Note that these clients are among the company's top ten, making up at least 23-27% of total revenue). It is our understanding that in 2020 these accounts would require greater expertise in cloud and analytics domains, as well as in business process outsourcing.Since EPAM's consulting arm was fairly under-developed in Western and Central Europe until 2017, we believe that EPAM will now aggressively take advantage of these newly-minted capabilities. We expect some of EPAM's clients in the financial services sector, such as UBS, to take advantage of the company's competitive pricing and switch from some of more seasoned providers, such as Accenture or Capgemini, to EPAM’s platform.Further, EPAM offers sophisticated consulting expertise from its employee professionals in Eastern Europe, more than 80% of whom have post-Masters degree educational credentials. Overall, there is aggressive new account growth in Eastern Europe. It is our understanding that EPAM is adding a number of new accounts in the Eastern Europe throughout 2019, a traction that should extend into next year. Eastern Europe has smaller margins than the rest of the continent, but we expect that to change in 2020-21.This brings us to pricing. On average (and this, of course, varies from client to client), EPAM gives approximately 16-23% discount to the pricing offered by its larger cap competitors. Lean operations and outsourced labor costs help explain their more favorable pricing capabilities. Further, the company offers about 5-7% discount to the pricing provided by IT services players of their own size, such as Luxoft and Globant.While in the past the company has been less transparent about disclosing its pricing structure, in recent months we see the Street becoming more aggressive in evaluating price-driven demand at EPAM, which leads us to believe that the company may now benefit from a wider recognition of fresh demand opportunities, leading in turn to a more aggressive valuation.Overall, with a wide range of verticals ranging from financial services and tech to consumer and media, we believe that the IT Services platform of EPAM would offer a great and diversifying revenue base to HP.Per our industry-wide analysis and EPAM’s strong fundamentals, as well as in light of the recent favorable guidance, we believe that EPAM shares merit ~22x P/E multiple on 2020 earnings. We note that this multiple comes at an ~1.5-2x discount relative to other players in the IT Services space. When we apply it to our 2020 non-GAAP EPS estimate of $9.81, we reach a target price of $216.Overall, this is a fairly expensive multiple, though not in the present market, albeit we see a number of IT Services companies getting cautious, with about 35% of them expecting a recession in the next 6-12 months. We believe that EPAM would become a viable target for acquisition, once its multiple becomes cheaper. This could be for a number of different reasons below (while the market multiple stays intact).Given that Epam Systems sources labor force from the relatively volatile region of Eastern Europe, such as Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, we believe that political turmoil or destabilization could be harmful to the company’s operations. We saw how in 2014 EPAM shares plummeted 10-15% on the news of political upheaval in Ukraine.

That article was crucial in helping us analyze trends for one of Epam's most volatile and profitable segments. We always welcome an opportunity to analyze industry-wide data and discern any patterns/implications/takeaways for the companies (or segments/parts of the companies) we cover.The present article is broader, as it focuses on the 4Q19 preview and, more importantly, comments on 2020 guidance that the company will issue when it reports earnings.Our core takeaways are as follows: 1) we expect solid growth across most verticals to translate into low teens top-line growth; 2) we see some bottom line pressures, but not so much that it would lead the company to miss guidance; 3) we anticipate a strong guidance, driven by new clients, cloud traction, as well as some conservatism around the SG&A and the resulting geographic shift in Epam's workforce.Per our industry-wide analysis and EPAM’s strong fundamentals, as well as in light of the recent favorable guidance, we believe that EPAM shares merit ~23.5x (up from ~22x) P/E multiple on 2020 earnings, largely due to the market multiple expansion in recent weeks. When we apply it to our 2020 non-GAAP EPS estimate of $9.97 (up from $9.81), we reach a target price of $234 (up from $216). We note that EPAM shares are up ~16% (vs. ~8% S&P 500 increase) since we published our first article on them on Seeking Alpha in September 2019.Expect Solid Growth Across Verticals: We expect technology and financial services verticals to grow in low teens during the fourth quarter, in the vicinity of 11-12% Y/Y. Further, we believe that retail should grow as high as 15.5% Y/Y, approximately 50 bps higher than we estimated earlier. At the same time, per our industry analysis across payer and pharma segments, we believe that the healthcare should grow only in mid-single digits, albeit this vertical is still fairly small at EPAM.SG&A to Trend Cautiously: In contrast to our earlier estimates, we believe that the SG&A should now be approximately $30 MM higher in 4Q, driven by incremental marketing expenses and higher-than-expected integration expenses from previous deals.Update on Key Clients: We expect the company to provide an update on its top 10 and top 5 clients across its core verticals, and, more importantly, to indicate which accounts may undergo meaningful changes throughout the year, both in terms of expansion, new business, and possible headwinds. Recall that among Epam's top clients are Expedia, Google, and Adidas, among others, with the company establishing presence across a diverse range of verticals.Cloud Growth to Accelerate: Competition in the cloud space remains fierce for Epam, with the company directly vying for business with Cognizant, Accenture, Infosys, and other large players (recall, large clients, such as UBS and Expedia, usually work with at least four-six vendors). However, we have also seen cloud-related growth at Epam faster, relative to its competitors, at times at 45%+ Y/Y. One of the outstanding questions at present is if the growth has peaked or if there is more room to accelerate. In our judgment, based on recent demand from retail and banking clients, cloud growth could further accelerate by 300-500 bps in 2020 and possibly 2021, and we will be looking for more color from management before we make specific changes to the model.Geographic Reshuffling Should Continue: We also expect an update on the numbers of engineers in Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, relative to other regions. Over the last two years, we've seen a meaningful shift from Eastern Europe to Central Europe and even Latin America. We believe that in 2020 as much as 4% of the company's labor force may shift geographies, thus continuing minimizing exposure to troublesome countries but doing so at a higher SG&A expense.Expect At Least Two Tuck-In Acquisitions in 2020: We expect Epam to channel at least $75-$100 MM of its free cash flows to tuck-in deals in 2020. We believe that at least one of these transactions shall be in the healthcare space, which could definitely use expansion. We note that in 2019 we were more wary around the acquisition activity, having expected a recession in 2020. With the recession now unlikely in the coming 12 months, we expect the company to be less conservative with its free cash flow usage."

The company occupies a niche space in consulting and outsourcing fields, focusing on lifecycle software testing, product deployment and end-user customization, performance tuning, managed services, and cross-platform migration, among other tasks. EPAM’s main competitors are Accenture (NYSE:ACN), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH), and Infosys (NYSE:INFY), though its core differentiating factor is the labor sourcing platform, since the vast majority of the company’s employees come from Eastern Europe, largely Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. EPAM serves technology companies in financial service, travel and consumer, software and hi-tech, media and entertainment, as well as healthcare. It derives about 50% of revenue from the United States, 40% from Western Europe, and approximately 10% from CIS and the emerging markets.ValuationPer our industry-wide analysis and EPAM’s strong fundamentals, as well as in light of the recent favorable guidance, we believe that EPAM shares merit ~22x P/E multiple on 2020 earnings. We note that this multiple comes at an ~1.5-2x discount relative to other players in the IT Services space. When we apply it to our 2020 non-GAAP EPS estimate of $9.81 (up from our previous estimate of $9.75), we reach a target price of $216 (up from $215).Financial Services: This vertical grew 24.4% Y/Y during the third quarter, driven by asset management, payment processing and insurance. There were also new financial services clients from Eastern Europe, namely Russia. At the same time, Russian revenue was incremental, while we continue to see the bulk of the impact coming from bulge-bracket accounts, such as Barclays and possibly UBS, where cloud-related and back-end services have been more aggressive than usual. While EPAM has been fairly competitive with pricing, we do not anticipate major pricing cuts in the financial services space, particularly with established accounts. Business Information and Media grew 29.3% Y/Y, as demand for data and analytics services helped deliver solid traction, much like across the consulting/outsourcing industry, where SMAC (social-media-analytics-cloud) deliverables are carrying the day and where these solutions are still at less than 20% of the entire IT integration and thus present a meaningful opportunity in the coming decade.Software and Hi-Tech: This vertical grew 22.9% Y/Y, with product engineering services remaining solid. This business is perhaps the most stable at EPAM, routinely generating double digits, quite often at 20%+. We believe that both business process outsourcing and traditional back-end IT support are helping deliver consistent growth.Life Sciences and Healthcare: This vertical grew 49.7%, as demand for R&D IT and customer-facing solutions helped EPAM establish its relevance in both pharma and payer segments. In operation for only a few years, this aggressive growth rate is justified by the low revenue base; by 2021-22, we expect the growth rate to stabilize around 20-25%. Furthermore, we do not yet see EPAM as a viable competitor against Cognizant and Accenture; therefore, it is essential that the company occupies some niche IT markets in healthcare, particularly pharma.Travel and Consumer: Finally, the weakest traction (which, in actuality, was still quite strong) came from Travel and Consumer, which grew 11.2% in Q3. Demand for e-commerce, data engineering, and retail remained solid, but there was some decreased scale from several consumer clients.1. Geopolitical FactorsGiven that EPAM Systems sources labor force from the relatively volatile region of Eastern Europe, such as Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, we believe that political turmoil or destabilization could be harmful to the company’s operations. We saw how in 2014 EPAM shares plummeted 10-15% on the news of political upheaval in Ukraine. Further, continued sanctions levied on Russia could have a negative top-line impact on EPAM, albeit the company derives only 3-4% of total revenue from Russia.2. Pricing WarsWhile EPAM strives to make the pricing structure attractive to its core clients and, henceforth, attract greater business, we see Luxoft (NYSE:LXFT), EPAM’s main competitor, potentially (and selectively) lowering prices as well. In turn, this could lead to a pricing war and result in lower revenues for both parties.3. Concentrated RevenueWith top 10 clients constituting about 45% of total revenue, we see any defection of a client or a reduction in the scope of the project as an inherent threat.4. OPEX PressuresThe company faces incremental operating pressures, as it opens new markets not only to attract new clients but also to find new sources of labor. We believe that mismanagement of new OPEX investments may lead to higher-than-expected margins and thus threaten the company’s valuation."

In the latest quarter, EPAM's revenues increased by a double-digit percentage, and the company currently has enough resources to continue to drive growth in the foreseeable future. However, the problem with EPAM is that it currently trades at a P/E multiple of over 60x, which makes it hard to justify opening a long position at the current price. In addition, there's a risk that some of its clients will not be able to survive the pandemic and as a result, it will lead to the decline of EPAM's revenues in the short-term. Considering this, I believe that EPAM is a great business that will continue to create shareholder value in the long run, but at the current valuation its stock is a risky investment and it's better to avoid it.EPAM provides IT solutions for businesses around the world, but the majority of its revenues come from North America. At the end of 2019, EPAM had,36 000 employees around the globe, while its annual revenue was over $2 billion. In the last three years, its revenue CAGR was over 20%, while its 3-year EPS CAGR was over 30%. The company also has a sizable presence in Europe, as two of the continent's major investment banks Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and UBS (NYSE:UBS) are EPAM's clients. While UBS relies on EPAM for cloud solutions, Barclays uses EPAM for digital consulting, data backup, and accounts for around 5% of the company's earnings.Source: EPAMIn the second quarter, EPAM had $632.38 million in revenue, an increase of 14.6% Y/Y. In addition, its non-GAAP income for the period was $108.2 million, up 16.9% Y/Y.The biggest advantage of EPAM right now is the fact that the company could help others to speed up the digitalization of their businesses in order to minimize the losses from the pandemic. In my recent article about adidas (OTCQX:ADDYY), which is also one of EPAM's clients, I noted that the growth of the company's eCommerce channels already helped the business to offset the losses that are caused by lockdowns around the world. The same is true for any other retailer, which started to invest more in the digitalization of its business.As more companies establish a stronger foothold online, EPAM will be able to benefit from such a dynamic and improve its own performance in years to come. With a TAM of $1 trillion, the IT solutions providers for enterprises will constantly be in high demand, and EPAM, as one of the largest players of the industry, which works with nearly 90 businesses from the Fortune 500 list, will be able to continue to create additional shareholder value along the way.Source: EPAMFor Q3, EPAM already expects its revenue to be between $633 million and $643 million, which represents a growth of over 8% Y/Y. At the same time, the street also expects the company to perform well in the following months.Source: Seeking AlphaWhile those growth prospects look promising, COVID-19 will still indirectly impact EPAM's business. As the pandemic brought travel activities to distressed levels, there's a high risk that EPAM will lose a portion of its travel clients, which will not be able to survive the current crisis. Expedia (EXPE), which is one of EPAM's largest travel clients, already cut its expenses earlier this year to preserve cash. As IATA expects the air traffic to return to normalcy only in 2024, EPAM should forget about increasing the number of its travel clients, as there is no money in the sector now.Another risk is valuation. Currently, EPAM trades at P/E of over 60x, which is above the S&P 500 P/E of 31x. At the same time, the company has an EV/EBITDA ratio of 40x and EV/Revenue ratio of 7x, also above the S&P 500. While, in recent months, EPAM's stock has greatly appreciated, it's now in the overbought territory, and as a result, there's a risk that the share price will substantially decline from the current levels, before reaching its new highs once more later on.Source: BloombergWhile investors should certainly be aware of those risks, I believe that, by having $994.9 million in cash reserves and less than $300 million in debt, EPAM will be able to deal with those headwinds with relative ease. Also, with a strong balance sheet and a solid business model, it's safe to say that operational risks for EPAM are limited. However, despite the fact that EPAM has solid growth prospects, it's hard to justify opening a long position at the current price. I believe that, at this stage, it's better to wait for a major pullback before purchasing the company's shares in order to have a greater margin of safety and a better average price. For that reason, I currently don't own EPAM's shares in my portfolio."
4253296,104958,2019-04-08T10:36:23-04:00,"EPAM Systems is focusing on becoming a technology consulting firm through its diverse range of acquisitions.EPAM Systems is a high growth company with more growth expected heading into 2020.The stock has rallied strongly this year, but it's still reasonably priced.","EPAM Systems, Inc. (EPAM) is a true growth stock providing investors with a solid long-term investment opportunity. The company has a strong history of earnings growth and more growth is forecast. The company is well managed and focused on generating future growth.EPAM Systems is a software development and technology consulting firm. The company is increasingly becoming more diversified and increasing its operations from software development to include consulting services through its strategic acquisitions.Over the short term, the stock has rallied strongly and may be due for a pullback. Even with its strong rally, the stock is still reasonably priced. I think that EPAM Systems is worth buying for a long-term investment for its future capital gains potential.EPAM Systems has reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2018 (data from Seeking Alpha and Yahoo).The company's reported revenue increased 26% from the same quarter last fiscal year. EPAM Systems reported a profit with diluted earnings per share of $1.05 compared to a loss $0.59 reported for the same quarter last fiscal year. Its EBIT was up 46% for the quarter. The EBIT (Earnings Before Tax and Interest) gives an indication of the company's profitability at an operational level.On an annual basis, EPAM Systems reported a revenue increase of 27% over the previous fiscal year. The annual diluted earnings per share were $4.24 which was considerably higher than the $1.32 reported for the previous fiscal year. Its annual EBIT was up 42% for the current fiscal year.The return on equity is currently 21%. The return on equity has ranged from 7% to 40% over the last decade with most years above 20%. The profit margin is currently 13%. The profit margin has ranged from 5% to 14% over the last decade with most years above 8%.The company's return on equity is mostly above 20% and its profit margin is mostly above 8%. With these margins, I consider EPAM Systems to be an efficiently run company which is able to extract a decent amount of profits from its revenue and assets base.EPAM Systems' current ratio is 4.6 meaning that its current assets exceed its current liabilities. EPAM Systems' current ratio has ranged from 3.3 to 6.0 over the last decade. The working capital is the company's short-term finances such as cash and short-term deposits that are used for paying its bills. With a current ratio of 4.6, the company has plenty of cash to pay its bills.The asset ratio (total liabilities to total assets) is 22% which means that EPAM Systems' total debt is 22% of the value of everything the company owns (note that the asset value is the book value and not the liquidated value of its assets). EPAM Systems' asset ratio has ranged from 13% to 30% over the last decade. Even with an asset ratio of 30%, the company is conservatively financed and can easily take on more debt if needed. The extra finance will certainly come in handy with any future acquisition plans that management might have.The company's book value is currently $23.35 and with a stock price of $175, EPAM Systems is trading at 7.5x book value. While I consider this to be high, I think it's only an issue with companies that have no earnings growth.The analysts' consensus forecast is for revenue to increase 22% in 2019 and increase another 22% in 2020. Earnings are forecast to increase 14% in 2019 and increase another 22% in 2020. The 2020 PE ratio is 28x and the trailing PE ratio is 41x. On their own, these PEs seem quite high, but in the next two sections, I'll look at the PE relative to its earnings growth to form an opinion on its valuation.The financials overall show that EPAM Systems operates profitably with solid returns on equity and decent profit margins. The company has ample working capital and its total debt is low meaning the company can easily take on more debt if needed.As an investor, I personally like to examine the company's revenue and earnings history. To make this task easier and more convenient, I like to visually present the data on a chart.EPAM Systems data by ADVFNThe above chart visually shows EPAM Systems' historical revenue and earnings trend along with the next two years of consensus forecasts.Examining the chart reveals that EPAM Systems' revenue has increased at a steady rate over the last decade with the analysts expecting this to continue into 2020. The company's earnings have increased over the last decade even though its earnings did drop in 2017. The analysts are expecting the company's earnings growth to continue into 2020.EPAM Systems' is a high growth company with its revenue increasing 26% per year and its earnings increasing 32% per year since 2014. The company's growth is also evident in the size of its workforce. Its employees have increased from around 14,000 in 2014 up to around 30,000 in 2018 (which represents a 21% per year increase).Personally, I like to see the company's workforce increase at a similar rate to its revenue, as this tells me that the company is actually expanding and becoming larger. The reason I look for this expansion is that larger companies are worth more than smaller companies. As a company grows, so does its market cap, which ultimately translates into higher stock prices.Over the years, EPAM Systems has broadened its business services from a purely software development focused company into a more diversified technological consultancy based company.EPAM Systems' strong revenue growth is largely attributed to its acquisition strategy - where the company seeks out businesses operating profitably in a technological field.Arkadiy Dobkin - President and CEO, stated in the company's earnings call:Over the last five years, EPAM Systems has acquired 9 technologically based businesses.1. Netsoft USA acquired in 2014 is a technology services company providing design services.2. Joint Technology Development acquired in 2014, offers analytics and business process solutions.3. GGA Software Services acquired in 2014 provides software engineering and management solutions.4. Great Fridays acquired in 2014 provides product design solutions.5. Navigation Arts acquired in 2015 provides web development consulting services.6. Alliance Global Services acquired in 2015 is a software developer for information-intensive businesses.7. Dextrys acquired in 2016 is a provider of engineering software.8. Continuum acquired in 2018 is a global innovation design consultancy.9. Think Ltd. acquired in 2018 is a digital agency working with world-leading brands.The technological fields these acquired businesses operated is ranged from data analytics to web design to design consultancy. One of the acquisitions was a software company operating in the specialized market of data security.I think it's usually better to expand inorganically into new businesses fields. The businesses EPAM Systems has acquired come complete with a skilled workforce who are proficient in their fields. If EPAM Systems attempted to branch into these fields themselves, the company would need to build up a workforce and also build up a reputation. Using the acquisition approach, EPAM Systems purchased not only a skilled workforce but also a business reputation.I think that EPAM Systems increasing its business from only developing software is a good move. While software development is profitable, it's the broader field of technology where the real growth and money lies. We live in a digital world that is only going to become even more technologically advanced and there's a huge variety of businesses looking to take advantage of this. However, in order for these businesses to take advantage, they need the assistance of a technology consulting firm. Now, this is where EPAM Systems is positioning itself with its acquisitions - as a technology consulting firm.As such, EPAM Systems is set to profit from the increased demand for technology-based services and this demand goes way beyond that from software development on its own.The company's CEO is confident that this demand will lead to strong revenue growth, having stated:Also the company's Senior Vice President and CFO, Jason Peterson made the statement:Management is confident that revenue growth will remain strong and I agree. I think management is on the right track with its business model and I think their approach to capitalizing on the demand for technology will maintain a decent growth rate for the company going forward.EPAM Systems has a history of growth with its earnings increasing 32% per year over the last five years. The forecast earnings growth heading into 2020 is 22%. An appropriate method for valuing growth stocks is the PEG (PE divided by the earnings growth rate).A forward earnings growth rate of 22% gives a forward PEG of 1.2 with a 2020 PE multiple of 28x.It's commonly accepted that a stock is fairly valued when its forward PEG is 1.0 which means that EPAM Systems is slightly overvalued with a stock price of $175. Its fair value would be around $145.As an active investor, I personally like to determine some likely price targets. This gives me a feel for how high the stock price could go in the short term and how soon it could get there.EPAM Systems chart by StockCharts.comThe stock chart reveals that EPAM Systems' stock price has reached a new high. The stock after peaking in 2018 pulled back along with the stock market. After bottoming late in 2018, the stock rallied strongly this year as the stock market resumed its rally.In the short term, the stock appears to be overbought and is due for a pullback. The stock rallied without any pullbacks from $115 at the start of the year up to the current $175. This is a 48% gain in only three months or an annual gain of 190%. Such high gains are not normally sustainable without pullbacks. These pullbacks only need to be minor and are needed to maintain an uptrend.It's always possible that EPAM Systems continues trading higher with the current rally, but sooner or later, the stock will pull back.From 2017 to the 2018 peak, the stock gained 120% with an uptrend that contained numerous small rallies and small pullbacks. If the stock market continues to rally over the next two years, EPAM Systems could reach $250 (based on adding the 2017-2018 gain of 120% to the $115 at the start of this year).EPAM Systems has a history of earnings growth and this growth is expected to continue. Over the longer term, EPAM Systems has the potential to continue higher and will probably do so as long as its earnings continue to increase.EPAM Systems has been on an acquisition spree over the last five years acquiring technological based businesses. Management is changing the company's business model from a pure software development firm into a broader technological consulting firm.EPAM Systems is financially in good shape and operates with strong returns on equity and decent profit margins. The company has ample working capital and carries little debt on its balance sheet.I think that management's focus on turning the company into a technological consulting firm will drive future growth. Even though the stock has rallied strongly this year, it's still reasonably priced. I think that even at current prices, EPAM Systems would make a good long-term investment. However, investors would need to be patient as the stock may pull back in the short term, but over the longer term, I would expect its uptrend to continue."

Not so much because of its valuation, which is fairly rich, but for the reason that in the ideal world it should be at the top of the list for every acquirer: it is a company that boasts continuous double-digit growth for both its top line and bottom line.EPAM is a company that offers software engineering and product development solutions in the IT services space, being one of the leaders in the industry.

It derives about 50% of revenue from the United States, 40% from Western Europe, and approximately 10% from CIS and the emerging markets.Our channel checks indicate that EPAM should expect an expansion of their contractual scope from a number of core clients, such as Google, Expedia, Barclays, and possibly UBS. (Note that these clients are among the company's top ten, making up at least 22-25% of total revenue). It is our understanding that in 2018 these accounts would require greater expertise in cloud and analytics domains, as well as in business process outsourcing.Since EPAM's consulting arm was fairly under-developed in Western and Central Europe until 2017, we believe that EPAM will now aggressively take advantage of these newly-minted capabilities. We expect some of EPAM's clients in the financial services sector, such as UBS, to take advantage of the company's competitive pricing and switch from some of more seasoned providers, such as Accenture or Capgemini, to EPAM’s platform. Further, EPAM offers sophisticated consulting expertise from its employee professionals in Eastern Europe, more than 80% of whom have post-Masters degree educational credentials.This brings us to pricing. On average (and this, of course, varies from client to client), EPAM gives approximately 15-20% discount to the pricing offered by its larger cap competitors. Lean operations and outsourced labor costs help explain their more favorable pricing capabilities. Further, the company offers about 5-7% discount to the pricing provided by IT services players of their own size, such as Luxoft and Globant. While in the past the company has been less transparent about disclosing its pricing structure, in recent months we see the Street becoming more aggressive in evaluating price-driven demand at EPAM, which leads us to believe that the company may now benefit from a wider recognition of fresh demand opportunities, leading in turn to a more aggressive valuation.Per our industry-wide analysis and EPAM’s strong fundamentals, as well as in light of the recent favorable guidance, we believe that EPAM shares merit ~22x PE multiple on 2020 earnings.

When we apply it to our 2020 non-GAAP EPS estimate of $9.77, we get the target price of $215.Overall, this is a fairly expensive multiple, though not in the present market, albeit we see a number of IT Services companies getting cautious, with about 35% of them expecting a recession in the next 6-12 months. We believe that EPAM would become a viable target for acquisition, once its multiple becomes cheaper. This could be for a number of different reasons below (while the market multiple stays intact).Given that Epam Systems sources labor force from the relatively volatile region of Eastern Europe, such as Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, we believe that political turmoil or destabilization could be harmful to the company’s operations.

Pricing Wars:While EPAM strives to make the pricing structure attractive to its core clients and, henceforth, attract greater business, we see Luxoft, EPAM’s main competitor, potentially (and selectively) lowering prices as well. In turn, this could lead to a pricing war and result in lower revenues for both parties.3. Concentrated Revenue:With top 10 clients constituting about 45% of total revenue, we see any defection of a client or a reduction in the scope of the project as an inherent threat.4. OPEX PressuresThe company faces incremental operating pressures, as it opens new markets not only to attract new clients but also to find new sources of labor. We believe that mismanagement of new opex investments may lead to higher-than-expected margins and thus threaten the company’s valuation."

EPAM provides software product development and digital platform services primarily in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The company was founded in 1993 by Arkadiy Dobkin who goes by Ark. Ark realized the success of Indian consultancy firms such as Tata Consultancy Services Limited (OTCPK:TTNQY), Wipro Limited (WIT), and Infosys Limited (INFY). Ark has strong connections back in Belarus and Eastern Europe where the caliber of software engineers is very high. This created a clear opportunity and Ark has executed very well ever since. EPAM's high level of execution from its IPO in February 2012 has led the stock price to increase from $14/share to $114.63 or a 714.29% increase over a 7-year period. Ark and his team continue to grow through both organic and strategic acquisitions and I expect EPAM's outperformance of the market to continue.EPAM has significant stickiness to its service offerings, which can be best demonstrated by its customer retention. EPAM has 90% customer retention for clients who have been with the firm longer than 1 year. It has a loyal client base with its 10 top clients using EPAM’s consultancy services for an average of 10 years. Its top 5 customers have been utilizing EPAM’s IT services for 11 years.The strong loyalty among customers has allowed Ark to have 80-90% visibility into the annual revenue. Strong client loyalty has enabled EPAM to have tremendous organic growth with 31 consecutive quarters growing 20% or more. This is a stunning feat among any business and is far superior over its peers such as Cognizant (CTSH), Wipro Limited, and Infosys Limited. (Source)EPAM has managed to almost triple its revenue in the last 4 1/2 years from $157.6M (all numbers are in USD) in Q4 2013 to $468.2M in Q2 2018. Wipro in the same time frame has grown revenue from $1.82B to $2.01B, Infosys from $2.09B to $2.92B, and Cognizant - strongest of the group - going from $2.42B to $4.08B (source SA data). Stagnating revenue at Wipro and slowing growth rates at Infosys point to stronger competitors in the market such as EPAM. Even Cognizant which is best of breed among peers, in my opinion, has seen growth rate drop from around 20% annually in 2013/2014 to currently high single-digits. One caveat to be mentioned is that it is easier for smaller companies to have their growth rate increase faster.The strength of EPAM’s services is a mix of quality of talent, strong leadership, and lower cost of IT talent as over 80% of its workforce is in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, and Central Europe. Russia, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Ukraine, and Bulgaria are all ranked in the top 12 countries according to HackerRank.(Source)These countries are the central talent hubs for EPAM. The source is from 2016, but should fairly accurately reflect current talent pools. The extreme software talent in Central/ Eastern Europe compares very well to its Indian competitors as India is ranked at #31. Forrester Research has also indicated that EPAM is far superior to its IT consulting peers in both strategy and market presence:(Source)The original focus for Ark and the EPAM team was predominantly on software and high-tech software firms at the beginning. Software and high-tech firms accounted for 75% of sales in 2006. Ark has been able to diversify his revenue base very well so that software/high-tech firms only account for 19% of sales as of Q3 2018. EPAM has made major inroads with multiple industries that proves not only its superior technology solutions, but also its ability to have strong domain knowledge required by many leading companies.EPAM Systems is currently working with 5 of the top 10 biggest investment firms in the world, 9 of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies, and all 4 of the biggest Broadcast Network firms. Furthermore, EPAM delivers consultancy services to 14 of the top 30 Broadcast. Picking up new customers outside of its traditional software market shows the malleability of EPAM’s offerings. Significant industry and increasing geographic revenue streams show a solid proof of concept for EPAM to grow into new markets and new industries.(Source)Investing in founder-led companies has always proven better results for myself as there is inherently more attachment to company performance. Ark has been running EPAM for 26 years now and I hope to see him continue for much longer. Founder-led companies also typically have managements which have an outsized portion of their wealth tied to the stock price performance. Ark is no different with currently owning 4.1% of EPAM or slightly over 250M in stock.The high level of interest alignment with shareholders is typically a very good sign when I am researching companies. Ark has multiple votes of confidence from his employees with an 88% CEO approval, 78% would recommend EPAM to peers, and a 3.8 score for employment with EPAM. Having a founder who is highly dedicated to the company, strong financial alignment with shareholders, and strong employee confidence code well to creating significant alpha.(Source)The main risk I see for EPAM is if and when Ark decides to retire. I think anytime a company has been run by a single leader for such a long time, it is hard for a successor to successfully run a company with the same level of efficiency and passion. I do not know of any succession plans in place. When Ark announces any significant step-down in responsibility, I will certainly be keen to see who steps up to make the major decisions. Ark is currently only 58, so he could feasibly be with the company for a very long time. There are many founders who run their companies well into their 60s and 70s and even longer as demonstrated by Warren Buffett (88) and Charlie Munger (95), so this does not seem like an imminent concern.EPAM has a rock-solid balance sheet with $685.1M in cash and only $25M in long-term debt. Operations are very profitable with Q3 2018 cash flow from operations totaling $102.3M. There should be no need for any type of significant equity raise and shareholder dilution in the near future. EPAM has a 27% CAGR for the last 5 years and 31 consecutive quarters with 20%+ organic growth. Given long-established relationships with key customers and a growing number of strategic accounts, EPAM is in a great position to continue its outperformance.Accounts worth $20M+ in value have grown significantly from 4 in 2013 to over 10 in 2017. Accounts valued $10-20M have doubled from 8 to 16 over the same period. There is a very clear trend in EPAM’s ability to acquire and grow key accounts and I fully expect this trend to continue.(Source)I believe that IT consulting firms in general will become more in demand as technology's increased rate of change will necessitate outsourcing highly complex tasks to specialists like EPAM Systems. EPAM's current market cap is $6.27B as of this writing. Consulting peers such as Cognizant at $36.76B, Infosys at $41.59B, and Wipro at $23.21B show that there is still plenty of opportunity to steal existing market share, let alone any industry growth. EPAM is still a small player in a large industry that I believe has proven its ability to outperform its peers. I personally like to invest in companies that are relatively small to their field, thus reasonably enabling a company to increase 5x or 10x its current market cap over a long period of time.EPAM Systems is an underfollowed consulting firm that has proven its ability to outperform its peers. EPAM has proven its ability to acquire, retain, grow, and profitably service clients in existing and new markets. Ark is highly dedicated to the company, has strong financial alignment with shareholders, and strong employee confidence. Consistent growth in revenue, earnings, cash flow, and customer stickiness make EPAM Systems a high conviction pick. I would recommend a buy and hold strategy for EPAM at or below $120/share."
3467456,54942,2015-08-27T08:00:19-04:00,The IT outsourcing services industry is highly diverse in its offerings. EPAM has one of the better product mixes with high exposure to higher-value complex software development.The company's differentiated product strategy and vertical expertise in banking and finance should allow it to grow above industry trend.The close proximity to Europe should help it take advantage of the growing secular trend within Europe which is only now embracing the IT outsourcing trend.,"EPAM Systems (NYSE:EPAM) is an IT outsourcer that should benefit from the secular industry shift to outsourced software development. The company is a fast-growing, under-the-radar name with significant upside potential once the Ukrainian crisis abates. EPAM focuses on European and US customers, but has significant exposure to Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, all of which have significant political risks.We think the shares represent a solid play on the IT outsourcing marketplace which is undergoing a massive secular growth story as large enterprises lower their cost structure by outsourcing these projects outside of their firms. The firm has several key differentiators including strong domain and specific vertical expertise, and a focus on highly complex software product development.Differentiated FocusEPAM got its start in highly complex software product development with expertise on high-value, domain-led vertical solutions capabilities that separate it from many other IT outsourcing competitors. This higher-value focus creates a tighter relationship with its customers which ultimately leads to strong penetration of those firms. The company is increasingly becoming a go-to firm for ISVs offshoring their research and development processes.Through the offshoring effect, enterprises can more effectively manage their IT budgets, raising and cutting them much quicker as the environment warrants. Ultimately, this is aiding these enterprises to increase their technology innovation and reduce product life-cycles, quickening the time to market of their products. Software development still accounts for roughly two-thirds of its revenue generation, and we think is the main differentiator compared to some of its larger peers that have more exposure to application testing and maintenance.We also see the focus on sourcing engineers from Central and Eastern Europe as a differentiator between EPAM and Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH), Wipro (NYSE:WIT), and Infosys (NYSE:INFY). These firms primarily use India for the delivery, and we believe that enterprises are looking for other sources for low-cost delivery for their IT outsourcing. The large pool of skilled engineers in Central and Eastern Europe is actually in excess of what India graduates each year in the sciences. We think this could lead to lower attrition rates and better wage inflation as compared to India.The hourly bill rate difference between India and Eastern Europe is surprising. The average hourly bill rate is only one-third more in the regions compared to India, but the wage rates are heading in opposite directions. Eastern European bill rates are expected to fall over the next several years according to SFG Research while Indian rates continue to rise at low double-digits for the next several years. If the trend continues, the hourly rate in India will be greater than in the Eastern European region.Product Development Services The Main DriverAs the market evolves, the traditional outsourcers are not in the same position they once were. Companies are shifting away from wanting these outsourcers to provide application maintenance work or simple BPO services for low cost. The high-value services are shifting towards more radical business transformation in order to compete in the new digital (e-commerce) world. This shift is eliminating the need for many organizations to have large ERP systems in place. The shift necessitates a large amount of back-office restructuring and investment and high amount of expertise.This is the bread and butter of the industry, as many of its much larger Indian competitors have substantial product mix towards lower-end BPO that is becoming increasingly commoditized. With approximately 80% of its revenues in this highly custom development and consulting segment, we think the company will be highly sought after as an acquisition among the larger, lower-value players. These include Accenture (NYSE:ACN), Cognizant, Wipro, and Infosys.Source: Investor PresentationThe main risk and why we think the shares have sold off is the exposure to the Ukrainian crisis in addition to the Belarusian political risks. Approximately 40% of the company's engineers are from Belarus, another 14% from Russia, and 25% from Ukraine, creating a significant amount of risk from the internal strife occurring in the region. The sanctions placed on Russia by the EU and US have significantly reduced Russian demand as well. Meanwhile, the conflict between Russia and the Ukraine is likely putting the company in the penalty box for now for some businesses or as an acquisition target.European And Banking Exposure A BenefitThe close proximity to Europe should be a benefit for Western European companies. This is due to the fact that Western Europe has been very slow to adopt the trend towards outsourcing of IT operations and BPO over the last half decade. The trend is just getting started there, and we think it would be apt to hire ""local"" organizations. We believe the amount of Western European contracts up for bid are going to grow significantly over the next few years as they catch-up to North American and Asian outsourcing trends. Given its advantage of proximity, we think EPAM could have a substantial advantage in these ""near-shore"" locations.The company also has significant exposure to the banking and financial services vertical (27% of revenue), which should provide EPAM a strong tailwind over the next several years. The main drivers of this growth is the trend towards heightened regulations of the financial and banking markets. In North America, Dodd-Frank legislation, new SEC rules, and other banking regulations are creating a myriad of compliance issues for financial institutions. Through EPAM's unique expertise in the space, we believe the company will benefit over the next few years from European and North American regulation implementation as these rules come into effect.Strong Growth and Compelling ValuationWe believe EPAM is one of the premier plays in the fast-growing software development segment of IT services. The company continues to add to its strategic account tally. New technology standards like Big Data, Agile, Mobile and the push towards SMAC (social, media, analytics, cloud) are quickly becoming critical components to large and medium-sized enterprises.Third-party research Gartner expects the total IT services market to grow at approximately 3.4% over the next five years. However, IDC expects EPAM's total addressable market to expand much more rapidly at 9.3% to $71 billion through 2018, much faster than the broader IT services industry.We also see a penetration opportunity as the company currently has a highly diverse customer base with low revenue per account given the opportunity. Most of EPAM's accounts were between $0.1-0.5m as compared to the just 6 accounts last year that generated $20 million or more in revenue. We believe the real opportunity is in the company being able to leverage its existing client base by adding new capabilities and services, increasing revenue per client.Source: Investor PresentationOver the last five years, the firm has been able to grow revenue at a 33% CAGR, and we believe could see low-to-mid 20% growth over the next several years, retarded by the Russian-Ukrainian issues. EBITDA margin should be a slight headwind as the company invests in new facilities and even opened contingency offices in order to relocate Ukrainian workers if the situation deteriorates further.We think the shares should be currently worth $82 with a very conservative multiple of 19x, well below the current 26x ttm EV/EBITDA multiple. The company has zero debt on the balance sheet, and a sizeable $175 million cash cushion equal to $3.50 per share. We like to use a declining multiple rate on high-growth companies in order to incorporate the slowing growth rate effect and the eventual re-rating of the shares.ConclusionEPAM Systems is one of the strongest IT outsourcing companies that you've probably never heard of. We think the shares are a compelling value as the Russian-Ukrainian issues have been fully embedded into the shares. Meanwhile, we think the company could benefit substantially from the growth in Europe as it begins a trend that began in North America several years before. The shares are likely worth around $82 and could be more if multiples and growth rates are sustained."
4009310,98236,2016-09-29T18:29:06-04:00,"EPAM is a billion-dollar IT consultancy that is little known among investors.The shares have underperformed this year as the company has lowered guidance due to macro concerns.The company's macro concerns appear to have been significantly overblown, potentially setting the stage for an earnings upside.The company is one of the faster growing, if not the fastest growing, IT services vendors and is outstripping its Indian rivals in terms of growth.The company, headquartered in the US, has the preponderance of its service personnel located in Eastern Europe which has turned out to facilitate the company's ability to deliver differentiated solutions.","EPAM - Not another software development outsourcing storySome years ago, there was a film of which I have read called ""Not another Teen Movie."" I do not see many films and even when that movie first came out, it wouldn't have been something of great interest to me. The kinds of teens I know are either nerds or pseudo-nerds, and this movie was apparently about cool high school characters of the kind I have never seen. In any event, EPAM (NYSE:EPAM) is really a bit different than the typical outsourcing companies that are a part of the landscape. It is located in Newtown, PA, a distant suburb of Philadelphia, but its antecedents and many of its key personnel come from Belarus, one of the former constituent republics of the old Soviet Union, as well as the Ukraine and Russia. While the politics of Belarus is far different than the democracies we know, the cost of doing business in that part of the world allows this company to charge very competitive rates and still deliver strong operating margins.On balance, EPAM has been a software product development company with 72% of its revenues coming from the software development process. It does have services that encompass less complex application testing and application maintenance, generally the cash cows of the IT outsourcing space. It does attempt to differentiate itself from the Indian outsourcing vendors in that it focuses a bit more on higher end projects such as the IoT, the data and analytics space and digital marketing and commerce. But then again, every Indian outsourcing company worth its salt either has or is building capabilities in those areas.And so it happens that EPAM has become one of the larger outsourcing vendors, and largest service providers overall, of which most readers have probably never heard. It is covered by 13 analysts who publish their forecasts and ratings on First Call. On balance, analysts appear to like the name with a rating average of just above buy and with a price target of almost $79, about 17% above current levels.The company has grown rapidly through the years, and today employs more than 18,000 IT professionals and that number is growing in the mid-30%/year. The company is forecast to reach $1.15 billion in revenues this year. And of course it is reasonably profitable in comparison to other high-end IT consultancies with GAAP operating margins of 11% thus far in 2016 and non-GAAP margins of 16%. Those margins are lower than would be typical for most Indian outsourcing companies but are fairly typical for companies that get most of their revenues from outsourcing product development, developing B2B commerce platforms and providing digital platform engineering services. Indian companies make huge margins in outsourcing software maintenance, which is typically half of their revenues. Software maintenance is 7% of revenues.Although most of the company's service delivery personnel are located in what is called the CIS (the old Soviet Union) most of its expenses are denominated in dollars and GBP. As a result, there is not a significant FX risk from the fluctuations of volatile currencies such as the rubles of both Russia and Belarus and hryvnia (Ukrainian currency).When I first heard the name of this company, I thought of the Greek general from Thebes, Epaminondas, who eventually defeated the Spartans and brought his city into prominence. And being old enough and having that kind of background, I thought of the eponymous story from the south as well. Given the culture of that age, and its jarring clash with the political correctness of these times, I will stick to the story about the Greek general named who developed a brilliant tactical innovation that overthrew the Spartans. He led additional expeditions against the military tyrannies of Sparta and ultimately Athens as well and was killed leading his troops at the battle of Mantinela. He is noteworthy not only for his tactical innovations but because of his support for democracy and his willingness to retire from power when he had a chance to establish himself as a dictator. EPAM the company has nothing whatsoever to do with Epaminondas the general - but it is an interesting story, regardless. I doubt that the founders were thinking about Epaminondas and his achievements when they first organized the company, and today it is certainly not a consideration.The company has enjoyed a mixture of both organic and inorganic growth, but has managed to keep organic top line growth above 20%, with much faster growth than that overall, and has more or less consistent trends in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins. There is some moderate Q4 seasonality, although it is not anything like what one sees in an enterprise software vendor.Any recent history that makes the name compelling at this point?EPAM shares have been relatively weak since the end of April and have lost about 14% of their value since that time. To put that in context, over that same time span, the IGV index has increased by 11%. So, that is more than a small level of underperformance over the last five months.The company missed both Q1 and Q2 EPS estimates by a bit and estimates for this quarter have come down a bit from $.80 to $.75. The EPS estimate for next year also has decreased by 4% and revenue growth in 2017 is projected to be just 21% compared to a 27% growth rate estimate for this year.EPAM, despite the EPS miss, actually reported a strong Q2 with 34% constant currency revenue growth and 27% constant currency organic growth. But the company suggested on its last earnings conference call that its most important customer overall, UBS (NYSE:UBS), and by far its most important account in the financial services sector, had shown signs of what was described as ""demand compression.""The CEO, Arkadiy Dobkin went on to say in the script for the call and several times in response to questions that ""we do anticipate some downstream effect both on overall pricing and demand elasticity with several key accounts in the BFSI vertical.""It has been nearly two months since those comments were made and the overall reaction to Brexit in the macro picture has been muted. Most IT companies have reported that demand in EMEA was at or ahead of their expectations. At least in the group of companies that I follow, no one specifically blamed EMEA or Brexit for missing estimates. As it happens, this company gets 57% of its revenues from North America and gets 36% of its revenues from the European region. It also gets 4% of its revenues from the CIS area (the old Soviet Union) and less than 3% of its revenues from APAC. I think that most other IT services vendors have found that demand to be relatively satisfactory in North America. Most other IT services vendors including such stalwarts as Infosys (NYSE:INFY) and Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) have found demand to be soft in the financial services vertical and some of the vendors have seen spotty weakness in other elements of different vertical markets as well.The Financial services vertical has been and remains EPAM's largest specific vertical. That is typical for any high-end IT consultancy, and indeed there are companies that are focused on just the financial services vertical. It represented 26% of revenues in the last two quarters, and that is down a couple of hundred basis points over the past couple of years. The strongest relative verticals have been life sciences and healthcare, 78% growth and 10% of revenues, followed by media and entertainment with 47% growth and 14% of total revenues. The other three vertical segments have shown little relative change with regard to revenue contribution. The company is currently forecasting constant currency growth in the 28% range. The growth seen in its two fastest growing verticals alone would be sufficient to produce 15% growth. Just on this kind of math, it appears that the company, back in August, went a bit overboard in reducing its growth expectations.The other segment analysis of interest is that compared to many other IT services vendors, the top 20 are growing in the high teens while the balance of the base is growing at 45%. I think that the ability to find new name accounts and the ability the company has had to decrease its customer concentration are very positive factors.The quarter has another two days to run as I write this, but of course I do not have any specific information as to what might have happened. But I think that overall expectations have been cut significantly based on macro concerns that may have been valid at the start of August, particularly with regards to the issues among larger European financial institutions such as UBS, and are perhaps a bit less of a concern coming into October. The specific revenue forecast EPAM had made for the current quarter is $295 million, up 4% sequentially and reflecting the specific headwinds which were questioned and described ad infinitum during the conference call. It is certainly possible for companies in this business to miss. It happens all of the time. On the other hand, usually these kinds of companies have a firm baseline of work going into the quarter. Transactional business is a function of closing new accounts and of large existing users adding to projects or needing some specific assistance to insure projects underway are completed on time. The summer quarter is typically a low point for transactional business and so a relatively smaller sequential growth rate is a reasonable expectation in Q3. On the other hand, it seems that the macro of Q3, particularly in Europe, was less dire than the fears of many. And this company has been seeing spectacular growth - 45% last quarter - from its ""less large"" customers below its top 20. That suggests to me that it would not be too surprising if EPAM exceeded its revenue and EPS forecasts for Q3.What I like about the set-up is that the shares are priced for ""growth compression"" and yet the macros that led to the forecast of growth compression have turned out far more benign than originally feared. The UK economy itself appears to have been quite resistant to the impact of Brexit. The EU as a whole has not seen the kind of negative impact that some had feared because of Brexit. And while there are doubtless issues within the financial services sector in Europe (Commerzbank (OTCPK:CRZBF) has announced significant layoffs today), there have certainly been fewer headlines regarding their problems and far more headlines regarding the problems at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). European business confidence was reported to have rebounded to the strongest levels in September, post Brexit. What it all means to the business of EPAM in the third quarter is not really visible to observers. What it ought to mean is that many of the issues that the company called out during its conference call that related to macro headwinds never really became a factor. This may have set the stage for both an EPS upside and some better commentary regarding the macro conditions as they relate to the company's Q4 outlook. Recently, the company published a blog whose points are that the impact of Brexit has been far less than feared. Significantly, the author, Jim Warburton, Senior Director, Business Consultancy at EPAM, wrote that ""investment programs, in the main, have carried on uninterrupted."" Indeed, the blog goes on to say that the impact of Brexit might be to stimulate demand as financial institutions need to buy additional solutions to deal with the separation of the UK from the single market. That is part of the formula for a potential upside and would stand the conventional wisdom on its head.What about the EPS shortfall and the guidance cut?Headline commentary for EPAM in the wake of its last quarter related to the fact that the company had missed the consensus forecast by $.01 and that it had reduced its full-year EPS forecast from EPS of $3.20 to EPS of $2.97. The issue in terms for earnings for a company such as this is utilization. Gross margin for a company like this is all about utilization, and utilization is far more complicated than it might seem from a 30,000-foot level. For many years, I had the great privilege to follow Sapient (NASDAQ:SAPE), another competitor in the high-end IT consulting space. Sapient was ultimately bought by the French advertising firm Publicis (OTCQX:PUBGY). The premium really didn't compensate shareholders, including this writer, for the agonizing years of waiting for a financial turnaround that never really happened.Nice people, very smart, some incredible pioneering work in terms of online marketing, but the company was never able to put together more than a single quarter in which it made its earnings forecast. They were simply never able to get utilization right on a consistent basis. It is a more difficult task than might be imagined. The shares always seemed cheap, but the company really generated the kind of sustained profitability necessary to support a decent valuation. Sapient's problem, and often the problem for many of the companies in this space, is effective utilization. One of the things that EPAM has gotten right over the past several years has been its stable utilization trends that have translated into reasonable and stable gross margins.The problem with utilization in this business is having the right people with the right skill level available to staff jobs that are in verticals in which they have expertise. In particular, if there is pressure in one job or in one vertical, it isn't easy to shift resources to another vertical. The people may seem to be fungible at some level but the fact is that they really aren't. This happened again and again at Sapient - it was, to be sure more of an issue for that company which really had and still has three very distinct business lines. But it is a fact of life in the high end-IT consulting practice. GAAP gross margins in Q2 were about 36.3% which compared to 38.3% in the prior year. On a sequential basis, GAAP gross margins were consistent between Q1 and Q2. Management's forecast and its explicit commentary on the call was that it had taken appropriate steps in its hiring practices such that it believed that gross margins would return to prior levels in the balance of the year.The fact is that the competition for high skill IT professionals is relatively lower in the CIS at this point than it is in India although wages are still a bit higher, at least to this point. Minsk and Kiev have loads of technical graduates and far fewer job opportunities than is the case in India these days. And that means that unlike India, where companies do have to consider competitive hiring pressures in staffing strategies, that is far less the case for EPAM which means it does have the ability to react quickly to changes in demand conditions.Overall, as mentioned earlier, EPAM was able to maintain its operating margins and grow EPS significantly last quarter because it was able to squeeze selling general and administrative costs to 22.6% of revenue in the June quarter, down from 25.7% of revenues in the prior year's quarter, and down from 23.2% the sequential prior quarter.Management's current EPS forecast is predicated on the company achieving margins within its normal targeted band of 16%-18% non-GAAP. That being said, if gross margins return to historic levels as has been forecast, the potential for operating margins to be at or above the ""normal"" band used in the EPS forecast exists. It is another of the potential shorter-term upsides that are part of this story.Secret Sauces, Special Sauces, Any Sauces?When looking at a professional services company the principal asset is the people. It isn't as though there is some kind of patented product or that anyone really has a special, unique service delivery methodology. This company is a little bit different than its peers in that most of its service delivery personnel come from the Ukraine and from Belarus. The IT wages in this area are low, the technical standards of the consultants are high and the demand for consultants in the region is measured, to say the least.The downside to using the CIS geography as the focus for its service delivery personnel is that many users have concerns regarding security and industrial espionage. As many readers are aware, data security is a paramount concern among many decision makers and whether justified or not, the CIS or the geo where most EPAM service personnel are located has a reputation among some potential users as an area in which the data security environment might be challenged. Obviously, the issues with regard to security haven't prevented this company from achieving remarkable growth, but they are ones that need to be mentioned.Overall, EPAM has a ""land and expand"" strategy so that security concerns have been mitigated for specific clients in the course of this company doing projects that have achieved planned objectives and have not seen security breaches.I think that the other secret sauce the company has is that it simply seem to have a far greater record of success with its projects than its competitors.I can't really say why that is so, but here is the quote from Forrester when it comes to describing the company's position in what Forrester calls Digital Platform Engineering Services (DPES).I think it is overkill to try to point out some of the other areas in which the company appears to have significant competency advantages. Just as an example - something called blockchain is causing serious disruption as a technology to enable higher levels of security as well as other functional advantages in the fintech space. This company was early to that party and has a competency center that enables users to develop a variety of use cases that can be differentiators for their businesses.Overall, the company appears to sell users with very specific expertise in the more advanced components of digital transformation that most users are unlikely to want to create in-house due to cost constraints. The company has formed many partnerships with industry-focused consultancies that focus on EPAM providing expertise in a particular technology and the partner providing vertical expertise. It is a model that has been effective and it is a tweak on the sauce that sets it apart.I think that the size of the company and the skill set of the company's management have allowed it to jump on technology trends in IT in their infancy and to exploit those trends in order to achieve significantly greater organic growth than its competitors. That is basically the secret sauce that this company has and is likely to continue to have into the future.ValuationEPAM's valuation appears to be quite reasonable relative to its organic revenue growth and its record of profitability. Based on the current valuations, the company has an enterprise value of about $3.3 billion. The consensus revenue estimate for the current year is $1.16 billion and for the following year, it is $1.41 billion. As I have written above, it is likely that both of those estimates will prove to be conservative. Using the consensus estimates, however, yields an EV/S of 2.8 and based on 2017 estimates the EV/S is 2.1X. These are valuation metrics that compare quite favorably with most of the other businesses in the space.The P/E based on the current consensus is just under 23X this year's earnings estimates and is at 19X the consensus estimates for 2017. These have to be considered favorably in the context of today's overall valuation environment and the relatively rapid growth the company has enjoyed for several years. Overall, the top line will have doubled in three years more or less and non-GAAP EPS will have more than doubled since 2012. These growth rates are perhaps the fastest that have been seen in the IT outsourcing space and dwarf those of the more visible Indian outsourcing vendors such as Cognizant, Infosys and Wipro (NYSE:WIT).I usually like to talk about cash flow at this point. For the record, the company's free cash flow yield based on 2015 numbers is just over 2% because of a rapid rise in receivables. Billed and non-billed receivables reached in excess of 90 days last year, far beyond reasonable levels. Receivable balances have been trimmed this year and that has led to a significant growth in cash flow. Cash flow on current trends will more than double this year but most of that has to do with the decrease in DSOs as the company works to ameliorate the collection of receivables. Over time, cash flow and reported earnings should be close analogs. CapEx for this company is running at rate of less than $30 million/year and it should remain at that kind of rate for the foreseeable future.Stock-based compensation has been moderate and is not growing. So far, this year stock-based compensation has been at 1.5% of total revenues and at 17% of GAAP reported earnings.I think that the combination of strong growth, a conservative short-term outlook and a modest valuation make this a good set-up for forecasting significant levels of positive alpha going into the future."
1787462,20568,2013-10-30T11:49:07-04:00,,"Editor's note: This article initially referred to EPAM's string of consecutive earnings misses without specifying which set of estimates the company had missed. We have now clarified that the miss was relative to Zacks consensus earnings estimates.EPAM Systems (NYSE:EPAM) has a downright lousy history of beating the Zacks earnings consensus estimate, but that is about to change. This custom IT services and solutions provider has cracked the code and is our Bull of the Day.CFO ChangeNormally, if I see a CFO is leaving a company I tend to sell first and ask questions later. In the case of EPAM Systems, their CFO is leaving and being replaced by the current VP of Finance and compliance officer. So congratulations to Anthony Conte, a six-year veteran of the company who has a firm grasp of what is going on at EPAM.Company DescriptionEPAM is an IT services and custom solutions provider. They offer software development services, engineering and custom solutions for medium and large businesses worldwide. The company primarily serves banking, financial services, business information, media, travel and hospitality industries. EPAM Systems, Inc. is headquartered in Newtown, Pennsylvania.One Is The Loneliest Number of BeatsEPAM did beat the number once. But that was the first report that Zacks has data on for the December 2011 quarter. It was a $0.02 beat or 7% positive earnings surprise and that sent shares higher by more than 17% in the trading session following the report.That beat was followed up with six consecutive earnings misses of the Zacks earnings consensus estimate. A string that started with the March 2012 quarter and runs right through the September 2013 quarter.Management Reboot, Guiding HigherI noted that the company had cracked the code and investors should look forward to a positive earnings surprise on November 8, 2013 when they next report earnings. This proclamation is an easy one to make given the fact the company raised guidance on October 9, 2013 in the same announcement that detailed the management change.Management knows that if you are going to guide higher, the worst thing you can do is then miss earnings. Analysts certainly don't expect the company to miss, and as a result of the increased guidance they have moved their EPS estimates higher.Estimates Moving HigherEven before the company raised its guidance, analysts saw some good things developing. The Zacks Consensus for the upcoming quarter stood at $0.33 in early August. By the middle of September, it had ticked higher by a penny. The increased guidance announcement sent shares to their current level of $0.35.The following quarter has seen fraction moves higher in the consensus, so a slight increase by only one analyst could result in a higher consensus number.Target Price Bumped UpStifel raised its target price on shares of EPAM from $38 to $42 as they believe there is potential upside. A key concern had been stability in margins, but the brokerage believes the management change will address that. They also pointed to the pre-announced earnings as a positive factor.ValuationThe valuation for EPAM isn't what you would expect for a company that has had six straight earnings misses. A 31x trailing PE multiple is higher than the 24x industry average, just as the 29x forward multiple tops the 23x industry average. Price to book is mostly in line with the industry average but the price to sales multiple show EPAM trading at a discount to the industry average. With revenue growth for 2014 expected to be 20%, EPAM is growing much faster than the industry average of 7.8% and they are growing the bottom line faster too. The company is expected to produce nearly 25% growth in earnings next year compared to a 14% rate for the industry average.The ChartNormally a chart of the stock price is what helps wrap the story up, but I want to go a different direction with this one. Instead of stock price graph, I am showing a graph of the revenue over the last few quarters. This graph just what aggressive growth investors like to see, a nearly 45 degree angle. That sort of consistent growth, coupled with better managed expectations should make investors more willing to take a deeper look at EPAM.Brian Bolan is a Stock Strategist for Zacks.com.

3998703,102103,2016-08-11T08:08:30-04:00,"Slight EPS miss of 1.4% and wary overtones in outlook provoked knee-jerk selling in EPAM after the 2Q16 financials release, but guidance and the company's growth story remain intact.Financial vertical might be under pressure, but IT spending share in banks’ costs is small, while potential cuts could seriously undermine competitiveness and regulatory compliance.Almost 60% of EPAM’s sales is derived from the US, where the economic situation differs favorably from most other countries.Key to EPAM’s investment case is exposure to the high end of IT services, with the emphasis on assisting companies’ digital transformation – secular trend which is there to stay.DCF valuation suggest upside of 50%+ from current levels, multiples supportive.","I believe that we have an excellent buying opportunity at the moment in EPAM Systems (NYSE:EPAM), a fast-growing US-based global software development company, which specializes in providing complex IT solutions to businesses in the process of their digital transformation. Last week, EPAM reported 2Q16 results which disappointed investors with a $0.02 EPS miss (1.4% below consensus) and cautious references to global macroeconomic problems affecting revenue visibility. However, the company's growth story remains intact as management confirmed 26% sales growth target for the full year 2016 (29% without the currency headwind) and reiterated long-term targets of 20% plus organic growth and 16-18% adjusted operating margin.On the surface of things, EPAM's exposures to the financial sector (27% of sales) and Europe (36% of sales), which overlap to a certain extent, might give investors a good reason to worry. With the European banks' index down almost 25% y-t-d and growing fears of Italy's banking crisis escalation, UBS as EPAM's top account (14% of sales) and Barclays among top 5 might indeed seem like not the best investment proposition. However, there are two reasons why I believe such concerns are overblown. First, EPAM's bill as % of UBS's operating profit is only about 2%, and IT services is probably one of the last areas where UBS (and Barclays) might want to cut spending, as such cuts would incur the risks of both weaker regulatory compliance and reduced competitiveness in the banks' interaction with clients, where EPAM's contribution is crucial. The second reason is that for the time being we are seeing no signs of any deterioration in the financial relationship between EPAM and UBS. On the contrary, as EPAM management revealed during the call, days sales outstanding (DSO) for UBS improved to 85 in 2Q16 from 115 in 3Q16.To better illustrate my point that now is the good time to buy EPAM, I'd like to briefly walk you through the company's business model and financials and then complete my story with a back-of-the-envelope DCF and multiples to support my Buy recommendation.Developers' developer turns into businesses' crucial IT service providerFirst, let's ask ourselves: why has EPAM been growing its revenue at a CAGR of 33% in 2011-2015 and is there end in sight to this fabulous growth story? Starting out in the early 1990s as ""developers' developer"", i.e. developing solutions for independent software vendors (ISV), EPAM gradually went on to engage directly with end-customers. The share of revenue from ISVs dropped from 75% in 2006 to 21% in 2015 (still, ISVs remain an important source of growing expertise in various industries for EPAM). Thus, put simply, EPAM has come to ride the wave of digital transformation that businesses all over the world are undergoing in order to engage with clients ""better, faster, and stronger"", as EPAM itself puts it.Relentless competition and regulatory pressures drive companies to move from legacy IT solutions, traditionally provided by the Indian offshore IT companies, to the most innovative and up-to-date technology solutions. And this is where EPAM, which from the outset has been focusing on delivering innovative solutions as opposed to relying on legacy systems, comes in handy.EPAM demonstrated 33% revenue CAGR in 2011-2015Source: CompanyNeed a modern, user-friendly interface with various customer personalization features? Look for someone to create an intelligence platform capable of micro-targeting and audience segmentation through the entire customer lifecycle? Need an application that maximizes selling opportunities while optimizing product orders? Or maybe what you want is a state-of-the-art data management system allowing you to increase data quality assurance, as well as improve data collection and storage capabilities? EPAM is there to help you. In other words, EPAM provides complex, turnkey solutions for companies that seek to build digital platforms to transform their business. And if your company is not on the list of EPAM's current or potential clients, we will probably not hear about it in a couple of years, because if you miss out on digital transformation now, you will be left so far behind that it will be impossible to catch up later. Which means that about any company worth mentioning should be on this list.Of course, potential clients can also go to competitors, but we should take notice of the fact that in a prestigious Forrester Wave IT industry review published in 2Q16, EPAM was ranked as having ""the strongest grasp and execution of digital platform engineering services of all the vendors evaluated in the report"" (see chart). Two years earlier, Forrester ranked EPAM as ""highest of all providers on driving innovation and helping to create innovative new products"". Just in June, EPAM was ranked sixth in The Top 100 Digital Agencies Report, an annual listing of the UK's largest digital marketing, design and build, technical and creative agencies published by Econsultancy. Thus, the strong execution record has ensured for EPAM a very strong competitive position in the industry where reputation, track record and long-standing relationships with clients are the key assets.EPAM's industry leadership confirmed by leading consultantSource: CompanyEPAM achieves its remarkable growth rates by growing both the number of accounts and revenue per account, mostly through scaling up existing accounts. Over the first five years of client relationships, major accounts have demonstrated an increase of more than 10x in the process of shifting from pure vendor arrangements to strategic partner relationships. This model is underpinned by high client retention: the average life of the top 10 clients is 8 years. Using an imperfect metaphor, EPAM is nurturing and growing its accounts like a skillful gardener looking after the plants in his hothouse. New sprouts are constantly being brought in, while the grown ones are moved on to more spacious compartments. The mature plants (clients) bring the bulk of the total harvest: over 80% of all revenue is recurring. This, in turn, provides great revenue visibility - 80-90% at the beginning of a given year and 95% at the beginning of a quarter.Unlike for its close competitor Luxoft, where top 2 accounts generate over 50% of sales, revenue concentration at EPAM is not a problem, with top 5 clients accounting for a reasonable 31% of sales. Revenue concentration has been decreasing steadily over the past years, with the share of top 10 accounts declining from 44% in 2012 to 41% in 1Q16. The company said at the conference call that in 2Q16 revenue outside top-20 accounts was growing at 45%, or 15 percentage points above average, thus further decreasing account concentration.Revenue concentration at EPAM decreasing steadilySource: CompanyMargin stability ensured by T&M contractsHaving discussed how EPAM's business model drives its top line, let's have a look at what determines the company's profitability. EPAM's business model can be characterized as ""growth over margins"". By limiting its operating margin to 16-18%, the company aims at growing market share and higher client retention.More than 85% of the company's contracts are ""time and materials"" (T&M), similar to the consulting industry business model, where clients are billed for the actual number of hours spent on engagement times the pre-specified hourly billing rate for each position plus all extra project-related expenses incurred in the process. Thus, the company essentially has full control over margins, even though at the cost of limiting margin upside that comes with fixed fee contracts. Therefore, long-term guidance of adjusted operating margin of 16-18% appears to be reliable. Given the exclusive nature of EPAM's product and the company's close relationship with its clients that is being nurtured over years and sometimes even decades, I don't think that the cheaper Indian IT offshore industry represents a serious competitive threat that could put downward pressure on the company margins in the foreseeable future.Talking about the margins, I'd also like to note that EPAM generates some of the highest revenue per employee among peers, despite the highest share of offshore staff in total staff (88%), because focus on delivering high-value added customized solutions allows the company to charge higher billing rates.EPAM's revenue per employee is among the highest in the industrySource: My calculationValuationBased on the above, I have prepared a ballpark DCF of EPAM, with the key variables being revenue growth of 20% in 2017-2020, terminal growth rate of 5% starting from 2021 (which I believe is pretty conservative), operating margin of 17% and capex at 3% of sales. Cost of equity is 12%. The resulting DCF yields price per share of $102, an upside of 55% from current levels.EPAM DCFSource: My calculationsRelative valuation also demonstrates that, while EPAM's operating margin is in line with that of its peers, the growth rates expected from the company by consensus are much higher, justifying even higher premiums on multiples than the current ones.EPAM vs peersSource: BloombergRisks to the investment caseI have already mentioned some of the key risks related to EPAM, but let me briefly recap them here again:Technical analysisI'm not an expert in tech analysis, but I like to confirm my fundamental analysis with some tech positives when I see a chance.First, I believe that EPAM's recent underperformance against NASDAQ is totally unwarranted and the gap should be closed upward, given the company's solid performance and outlook.EPAM vs NASDAQSource: BloombergSecond, EPAM stock is demonstrating a triangle formation, which is traditionally a continuation pattern and gives good chances of an upward break. While with triangles there is always a risk of them morphing into zigzags (i.e. we could expect another leg down), even a zigzag is still a correction figure, pointing to further upside upon completion. Current RSI at 31 is also marginally favorable for a long position.EPAM stock chartSource: Bloomberg"
2097463,62293,2014-03-20T09:01:20-04:00,"EPAM is a rising star in the IT services and outsourcing industry with around 30% of its engineers located in the Ukraine and 10% in Russia.Its share price has fallen 20% due to unrest in Ukraine, while its operations have continued uninterrupted.After considering the significant risks inherent to this crisis, the fall in EPAM's share price seems to have created an attractive buying opportunity.","About EPAMEPAM Systems (NYSE: EPAM) is an IT services provider based in Newton, Pennsylvania with 3,900 of its 9,300 engineers located in the troubled Ukraine and Russia, and offices in 12 countries including the UK, Germany, Switzerland and Poland. Its specialty is highly complex software engineering and it provides a range of complementary services like application testing, product support and infrastructure management. In 2013 EPAM worked with over 530 clients that led to at least $100K in revenues each, including important Blue Chips (see investor presentation PDF) like Google, IBM, UBS, MTV and Adidas among others.Company strengths and the impact of the Ukraine crisisOn Friday, February 28th EPAM shares closed just below $42, up nearly 20% since the beginning of the year, fueled by better than expected annual results and continued high expectations of a 21 to 23% increase in revenues for 2014. The company reported annual revenues of $555.1 million, an increase of 28% over the previous year and a net income of $61.89 million, 13.8% higher than 2012. Excluding a series of one-time expenses, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets and stock-based compensation expenses the company showed a promising increase in Non-GAAP income from operations of 33.2% compared to the prior year (see the bottom of the fourth quarter press release for reconciliations to GAAP measures).On Monday March 3rd, as pressures in Ukraine mounted and the Russian military presence on the Crimea started to threaten culminating into a war, EPAM released an 8-K stating: ""We have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the situation, as the political and civil unrest and reported military activities are fluid and beyond our control. Prolonged unrest, military activities, or broad-based sanctions, should they be implemented, could have a material adverse effect on our operations."" That same day the stock experienced an over 20% fall to $32, accompanied by a downgrade by Barclays to ""Equal Weight"". Even though over the next few days the stock recovered some of its losses as it was deemed as oversold by Forbes, the price has since been fluctuating between $33 and $36 since the 8-K, at around 17% below the February 28 closing price and well below its YTD high of $46.70.EPAM data by YChartsNow there are three questions that need to be answered in order to make an investment decision:1. Ignoring the Ukraine situation, is EPAM an attractive company to invest in?2. What is the probability of the Ukraine situation escalating to the point of the company's operations being adversely affected?3. Even if the company's operations are not negatively influenced, to what extent is the Ukraine situation likely to inhibit client retention and new client acquisition?Let's start by addressing the first question.1. Ignoring the Ukraine situation, is EPAM an attractive company to invest in?In order to answer the first question, let's look at EPAM's track record and past performance, as well as future expectations and the market it is in. EPAM was founded in 1993 as a low-cost offshore IT services provider for commercial software firms. Like many of its Indian and Eastern European competitors, it mostly relied on labor arbitrage to provide low-end IT functions at a cheaper hourly rate. In recent years the experience gained and maintained through increasingly more challenging projects and low employee attrition (11% in 2012 and 2013) allowed the company to quickly internalize emerging technology trends in the industry, adopt new developing methodologies, such as their highly marketed ""Agile"" approach, and to tackle more complex development projects. This allowed them to move on from almost exclusively working for independent software vendors (ISVs) to basically servicing the ISVs' clients directly. While the revenue generated from the ISV segment still grew more than 25% per year over the last 2 years, their client distribution looks quite a bit more diverse by now:*Others category includes energy, telecommunications, automotive, manufacturing, insurance and life sciences industries and governmentSource: Compiled from data from the Q4 2013 earnings callSimilarly the geographic distribution of clients has shifted from a CIS and North America focus to include more of Non-CIS Europe:Source: Investor Presentation from investors.epam.comNot only has EPAM managed to diversify its client base, management has also done an excellent job building strong ties with existing clients. The company's growth according to CFO Anthony J Conte is ""fueled by new clients and deeper penetration into existing accounts"". In numbers: 94% of EPAM's clients in 2013 had been working with the company for at least a year and 78% for two or more. Meanwhile more new customers were grown into larger accounts, as the number of clients generating more than $1 million in revenues grew from 81 to 95 in 2013. As a result of this continuous conversion of new clients into higher revenue sources, the business has seen strong growth over the past four years:Source: Investor Presentation from investors.epam.comNot one client accounts for more than 10% of revenues, and this diversity is also mirrored in the healthy growth across the company's client segments:Source: Compiled from data from the Q4 2013 earnings callThe information technology sector and in particular the software industry have been growing strongly, outperforming the S&P 500 by 24.1% and 23.4% respectively over the last 12 months, with promising forecasts. Ned Davis Research rates the IT Sector as overweight, with the software and services industry as one of the drivers, citing the positive momentum and healthy consumer spending on tech categories. EPAM is also seen favorably by analysts, despite the current situation: Reuters Research Average Rating puts it at Outperform with the ratio of Buy to Outperform to Hold recommendations being 3 to 2 to 3.On a more qualitative note, the company has received numerous recognitions and awards, which is relevant for a growing IT services company with a focus on new client acquisition. For example, Forbes ranked it as #2 in its list of America's Best Small Companies: 20 Fast-Growing Tech Stars, right after gyroscope producer InvenSense (NYSE: INVN). EPAM received an Oracle ""Top Business Impact Partner, EMEA"" award during the 5th Annual Oracle Commerce EMEA Partner Conference and it received an International Davey award for the website of USA Network that was developed by EPAM Empathy Lab. Independently of their validity as indicators of the company's services quality, these awards are likely to work wonders when it comes to marketing and client acquisition.The pre-Ukraine situation sell-off P/E ratio around 35 and P/S ratio of around 4.5 are both more than twice the equivalent S&P United States BMI Information Technology ratios and are therewith quite optimistic. However, taking into account the company's still relatively small size (market cap under $2B), its fast growth, its diverse client base and its great reputation in a growing market, the shares seemed to be at a fair price.After the ""Ukraine sell-off"" the P/E ratio of EPAM has fallen to 28 and the P/S ratio to 3.6, putting it at a per share valuation similar to its significantly larger competitors, such as Cognizant Technologies (NASDAQ:CTSH). CTSH has a market cap of 31B and shows considerably less growth than EPAM over the last years.In summary, ignoring the Ukraine crisis, EPAM seems like a healthy long-term investment showing solid growth, continued high future expectations, a stable market and, arguably the most important factor, a long and growing list of diverse, satisfied clients, as well as various indicators of the high underlying quality of the company's services.2. What is the probability of the Ukraine situation escalating to the point of the company's operations being adversely affected?This question is much harder to answer, as the realm of politics, especially in crises, is even more unpredictable than where a particular company is going. An investment decision into a company with considerable Ukraine and Russia exposure should be made only after the investor has made him/herself a picture of the situation, drawing from multiple sources. As an example, I will share my personal opinion on the likelihood of the Ukraine situation significantly affecting EPAM's operations, however this should be taken as a vague reference to a far more complex issue at best.My personal view is that the probability of the Ukraine crisis posing an obstacle for EPAM's operations is low. I am considering operations in Ukraine and operations in Russia separately, and assuming that this crisis will not affect the company's work in any of its other international offices.Operations in Ukraine:During the company's Q4 2013 earnings call, EPAM's management emphasized that the escalating demonstrations in the Ukraine were not affecting their workforce, that the offices in Kiev were at a distance from the plazas affected by the demonstrations and that they did not anticipate any problems coming from the crisis. Then, after some of the worst protests and Russian military movements in Crimea, the 8-K was released on March 3rd that triggered the fall in the stock price. However, before expressing that there are unquantifiable risks, the 8-K states: ""At present we have not experienced any interruption in our office infrastructure, utility supply or Internet connectivity. All EPAM offices remain open and fully functional, including those we use in the Ukraine and Russia to support our clients."" Furthermore, it clarifies that none of the company's employees are located in Crimea and that if necessary, the company has contingency plans that include relocating personnel and opening offices in new locations.The resilience (not in stock price, but in operations) up to this point shows that pure unrest can be managed by the company, and unless a war breaks out, this unrest should be leaving the worst behind. Putin, Yanukovych's major supporter, already stated that he viewed the displaced leader's political future as inexistent, and after approving Crimea's vote to join Russia, stated that he sees no need to further divide the Ukraine. Even though the international community has expressed displeasure with what they view as an unlawful secession, they have focused more on sanctioning individuals responsible for the affair. To me, it seems unlikely that after peaceful statements from Putin and relatively minor sanctions from the international community a war will erupt. Especially considering that this war would at least include the world's two most powerful militaries. What remains to the Ukraine, including its complete EPAM workforce, is now receiving financial aid from multiple countries and is unlikely to face more serious issues than usual in the near future, as long as it doesn't react too explosively to the loss of Crimea.Operations in Russia:Next to the - in my opinion - unlikely event of a war, an important risk of Russian businesses is further sanctions from the United States and the European Union among other countries, limiting business to be conducted between the nations. EPAM is an American company and it is unlikely that a sanction will forbid it from assigning work to its Russian employees, however if American companies are limited by any sanctions to conduct business with Russian clients, this would affect a maximum of 10% of EPAM's current revenues, not justifying the decline in the share price, especially since a sanction would most likely limit rather than completely block businessIn summary, I think that after seeing how smoothly EPAM's operations continued throughout the period of extensive unrest in Ukraine so far, I think it is unlikely that further developments will be grave enough for a significant disruption in the company's activities.3. Even if the company's operations are not negatively affected, to what extent is the Ukraine situation likely to inhibit client retention and new client acquisition?Again, this is hard to tell at the moment, however it seems that EPAM has very strong client relations, as explained before. The company's 20th birthday video, shows many happy clients across the world wishing the company all the best and almost nostalgically remembering their work together, and even though this is of course a marketing production, it reflects the company's ties with its customers to the extent that they are willing to enthusiastically compliment EPAM on camera. Loss of current clients in Q1 2014 is probably limited, especially since there has not been any interruption in the work EPAM is doing for them.New client acquisition, on the other hand, is more likely to be affected negatively this quarter. Given the unpredictability of the Ukraine situation, many potential clients probably either went with the competition that has its operations in India, or simply decided to wait and see how the situation develops before deciding to start a project with EPAM. The impact of this probable decline in new clients depends on how much new clients accounted for in the company's growth expectations for this quarter. At the end of 2013, 94% of clients had been working with EPAM for a year or more, meaning that it added 6% of its clients that year. Even though their new client acquisition plans are probably higher this year, it is unlikely that EPAM is basing too much of its growth forecasts on clients that they haven't acquired yet, especially considering that the stigma from the Ukraine crisis was already (at a lower degree) affecting the company when the forecast of 20% revenue growth in 2014 was released.In summary, existing client business should not be impacted significantly by the Ukraine crisis, due to the company's strong customer retention capabilities. On the other hand, new customer business is likely to decline in the short term due to companies being more careful conducting business with a provider with significant Russia and Ukraine exposure.Potential gainsShould the situation in Ukraine prove to be practically resolved in the next months, EPAM will have suffered no interruptions in its operations. It will likely miss the Q1 2014 analyst estimate consensus of 152.4 million (22.73% over Q1 2013 revenues) due to increased difficulties in new client acquisition and potentially some loss in business from existing clients, however its strong customer relationship management and continued high quality service delivery should keep these losses in business in track, in which case the stock price would at least recover to a point close to its February 28 price of $42, a 20% gain over the current price of $34.19. This previous price is conservatively achievable by the end of Q3 2014 when the company will most likely be in pursuit of new highs, assuming the geopolitical situation allows it. Analysts seem to agree: In addition to the general positive outlook described above, Needham & Company reiterated its bullish stance on the company last week, as well as its price target for the EPAM stock of $50. The fact that the February highs in the share price (as high as $46) were achieved at a time when the Ukraine crisis was already escalating rapidly, seem to indicate that the non-crisis price of the stock could easily reach this target.On the fundamental side, after revenue growth returns to the pre-crisis path (conservatively assuming that it left the path in the first place), the company will likely keep providing high quality solutions to complex IT problems, ensuring continued customer satisfaction. This means that the current political situation is offering the opportunity to buy a promising company with strong fundamentals at a nice discount that it should probably recover in the next 6 months, with near-term volatility, however, stemming from further speculation on the constant stream of news from the area (potentially providing the opportunity for a cheaper buy).The risks are still very real and dangerousWhile I strongly believe EPAM to be an attractive investment in the long term simply due to the high quality of its services and its strong financial position, the political situation as discussed in this article, as well as other intrinsic risk factors that I haven't discussed in depth, but that are very clearly explained in the most recent 10-K may very well have a longer term, significant negative impact on the company's performance and its share price. These include inflation and effective tax risks and competitive risks that are also accentuated by the fragile political situation. For instance, some important clients of EPAM might see large and well-established companies such as Cognizant Technology Solutions and Infosys (NYSE: INFY), which are active in India as a safer outsourcing opportunity and subsequently just stick with them, even if/after the political situation improves.On the crisis side, even though I am counting on a resolution soon, the new government of the Ukraine is declaring the loss of Crimea to Russia as a ""robbery on an international scale"", a Ukrainian soldier has been killed by Russian forces in Crimea and the United States and the UK seem eager to impose further sanctions on Russia, with Obama claiming that the international community will never accept the division of the Crimea that was unlawful under the Ukraine's constitution. Clearly matters are not resolved quite yet, and optimistically there will likely be further scares before the situation stabilizes.On the other hand, similarly to the secession of Crimea, the early removal of Yanukovych, as inept as he might be, was also unlawful according to Ukraine's constitution, yet readily accepted by the international community, especially considering that the ex-president had already agreed to early elections before he was forced to flee the country and promptly replaced by the new government. There are simply arguments and counterarguments on both sides, making it hard to recognize a clear right and wrong when looking at the situation objectively and there's too much devastation at stake, given the countries that would be involved should there be military action. Furthermore, I believe the European Union, led by Germany, while further claiming their disagreement with the secession, will try to ensure the sanctions on Russia are not too severe, due to the countries' strong reliance on Russia's oil and gas and the widely suspected among Europeans vested interest of the United States Government seeing the potential for a jump in demand in its own oil reserves if relations with Russia are further tarnished.Making an investment decisionThe Crimea aftermath will likely provide some even cheaper buying opportunities for the EPAM stock in the next weeks, yet an investment should only occur after the investor makes a careful evaluation of the political situation. Those who follow the thesis that the situation will be mostly resolved, in terms of potential effects on the business of EPAM, in the next months, should consider buying now and continue growing the position if the stock reaches new lows, while carefully following the geopolitical developments, as well as the company's own updates.Disclosure: I am long EPAM.

4073318,76785,2017-05-15T12:37:20-04:00,"All signs, company mantra or otherwise, point to EPAM Systems being the market leader in IT consulting.While other firms are struggling to find growth, the company continues to post 20% organic growth year after year.The company can appear a little expensive on trailing measures, but those shoes can quickly be grown into.","I've dabbled occasionally in the IT consulting space, having owned premiere Indian outsourcing firm Syntel (NASDAQ:SYNT) profitably for some time before cutting it for greener pastures. Syntel was well-regarded, particularly against other local peers like Wipro (NYSE:WIT), but for investors that want to own the true cream of the crop in the space, EPAM Systems (NYSE:EPAM) is the way to go. The company is a leading provider of software product development and digital engineering, building custom tailored products for Fortune 500 companies, many times from scratch. This isn't outsourcing of repetitive tasks or tweaking minor bits of code on simple programs - EPAM Systems is providing customers with solutions that they cannot source internally from their current workforce. That aspect is what makes EPAM Systems different, as services provided are not centered around labor cost arbitrage (e.g., Indian IT firms), but providing true turnkey solutions that can't be found elsewhere. Firm reputation in its verticals is incredibly strong, and the company arguably holds a higher reputation than even other quality companies in this space like Luxoft (NYSE:LXFT) or HCL Technologies (OTCPK:HCTHY). Like usual, quality doesn't come cheap, but the company remains a nice little niche company with a history of market-beating returns.Business OverviewAnyone that has worked in Corporate America is likely all too aware that many of the nation's leading companies are still operating on legacy IT platforms, some of which have been around for decades. This unfortunate circumstance has come around for many reasons: straight up cost, transition or integration issues, weak internal knowledge base, etc. EPAM Systems tries to solve these issues as best it can, providing strategy consulting and design services in order to help bridge the gap between thinking about a new a system implementation and actually putting it into place. This is radically different than most other companies in this space, which instead focus on either cutting costs on current legacy programs, or (at best) plugging holes or building off of a client's legacy IT infrastructure.Financial Services remains a key vertical, with UBS (NYSE:UBS) being the only client responsible for more than 10% of revenue in fiscal 2016; now below 10% this fiscal year, where it will likely stay. Revenue diversification has been seeing steady results across clients (now at highest levels ever) and verticals, with Financial Services share falling from 29.5% to 25.2% of total revenues y/y. On a nominal dollar growth basis, outsourcing to software/tech companies has been the strongest, and the company continues to build compelling Healthcare/Life Sciences and Media/Entertainment businesses as well. Investors are likely to be surprised by the strength in media, but demand is quite high for digital transformation and software development, leading to revenues that were up 50% y/y in Q1 2017 within that business. Overall, consolidated revenue growth has been above 20% for several years (five-year revenue CAGR of 28%), and current fiscal 2017 guidance calls for more of the same, with revenue set to top $1,400M.What I find most interesting (and compelling) about the EPAM Systems story is that a substantial portion of revenue growth has come from clients increasing their vendor arrangements each year, calling for more and more involvement from the company, rather than simply new client acquisition. In any given year, less than half of organic growth comes from new clients, with the majority coming from existing clients expanding existing contracts. That fact, coupled with excellent client retention, make the company very compelling. The top ten clients have been with EPAM Systems for nearly a decade; remember that this was a company with less than $150M in revenue in 2009. At the same time, I would caution on taking EPAM Systems' statements of this revenue being ""recurring"" in nature with a grain of salt. While customer retention has historically been good and they generally come back year/year, most contracts are based on time-and-materials and are singular in nature. A customer that spends $20M in one year may spend $5M the next - or none at all. These are not long-term commitments. There are perks to the time-and-materials contract structure, as this gives EPAM Systems very strict control over the margin structure:Gross margin has remained relatively stable, largely between 36-37% over the past four years, due to contract structure. Foreign exchange has been the primary driver of gross margin compression lately, and the volatility in EBITDA results above has almost entirely come from foreign exchange fluctuation and some SG&A pressure. During 2016, 36% of revenue and 40% of operating expenses were denominated in currencies other than the USD. Revenue has exposure to the Euro and the Pound (one-third of revenues generated in European region), and expenses have exposure to Forints, Rubles, and Zlotys (Hungary, Russia, Poland - a sizeable part of IT staff is located in Eastern Europe, particularly in what was once part of the Soviet Union). EPAM Systems does not hedge via derivatives - either currency or interest rate swaps on its debt - so there will continue to be a razor focus from investors on currency impact.Valuation, TakeawayAt 23.5x fiscal 2018 earnings estimates, EPAM Systems trades well above levels of the S&P 500. Earnings quality when it comes to cash conversion, however, makes EPAM Systems more attractive. Free cash flow on a trailing basis is around 3.5% yield, and assuming steady margins and projected revenue growth, the company should post $200M in free cash flow in fiscal 2018. That would push free cash flow yield above 5%, what I have found to be a fairly normalized yield for low growth companies in the current environment. If EPAM Systems can continue its current execution over the next several years, the company could prove to be solid value, even trading near fifty-two week (and all-time) highs.For deep-dive research on asymmetric risk/reward plays in the Industrial and Basic Materials sectors (particularly small and mid-caps), consider investing alongside me and other subscribers within Industrial Insights.

3514316,92076,2015-09-16T12:07:07-04:00,"Both companies are well positioned in the industry, and poised to gain from IT spending in financial and tech sectors.EPAM's business is more diversified, with lower margins. LXFT is highly concentrated, but more profitable.Valuation seems to speak more in favor of EPAM.","Luxoft (NYSE:LXFT) and EPAM Systems (NYSE:EPAM) are providers of software development services and IT solutions to a global client base consisting primarily of large multinational corporations mainly in Western Europe and North America. Here is a quick snapshot of both:Luxoft is a smaller company, but it generates better margins, and is priced lower, probably because of EPAM's higher expected growth rate.Luxoft provides services from delivery centers in Poland, Romania, Ukraine and Russia. It was spun off from IBS Group, a Russian technology company which still controls around 40% of its shares. Around 52% is floated and the remaining 8% is held by LXFT management.LXFT focuses on six industry verticals that have significant and growing demand for IT services and consider innovative technology to be a top priority in achieving their business goals: financial services, travel and aviation, technology, telecom, automotive and transport, and energy. However, the largest segment is financial, Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) and UBS (NYSE:UBS) alone represent 56% of sales. Other customers include Ford (NYSE:F), Avaya (OTC:AVYA), Harman (NYSE:HAR) and Boeing (NYSE:BA). 7 out of the top 10 clients have been with Luxoft for more than 5 years.Approximately 80% of their workforce has a Master's degree or higher and 85% have been in IT for more than 5 years. Luxoft maintains strong ties with universities in CEE, where it recruits educated IT professionals. EPAM does the same thing, while also building delivery centers close to university campuses.According to Luxoft, their main competitive advantages are strong client relationships, domain expertise (big data, mobile, open source, Agile, UX/UI/HMI), global delivery model, highly educated workforce and strong management team. I don't see this as a big differentiator - any IT company claims to have these.However, I do believe their management team is quite strong. Dmitry Loschinin was the director of IBS outsourcing division, which later became Luxoft. He has more than 20 years of IT experience and under his guidance, the company grew rapidly over the past 15 years. He has a 97% approval rating on Glassdoor, and manages LXFT along with Michael Friedland, who joined the company after his own business was acquired by Luxoft in 2006.Luxoft's aim is to increase ownership of client projects to the point of providing transformational engagements and as such substantially or fully replace a portion of clients' IT departments.EPAM Systems has a slightly different business model. They focus on major independent software vendors (ISVs). As a result, a higher level of product configurability and operational performance is needed to address the needs of a diverse set of end-users working in multiple industries and operating in a variety of deployment environments. Their main areas are financial services, technology, business and media, travel and consumer.Also, EPAM has more customers in North America than Europe:81% of LXFT revenues comes from the 10 largest clients, while for EPAM it's 44%. Luxoft is heavily concentrated on the financial services segment, where 66% of revenues come from. EPAM is much more diversified with 28% from banking and finance, 24% travel and consumer, 22% technology and 26% from others.They both share a big customer, UBS AG, EPAM's largest and Luxoft's second largest client. If either side can gain an upper hand and win the bulk of business from UBS, the other one will be significantly affected.EPAM was founded more than 20 years ago by Arkadiy Dobkin, who still remains as CEO. He also holds a very good rating on Glassdoor, and is the recipient of many industry and entrepreneurial awards.LXFT stock-based compensation has been relatively unchanged at around $6 million, compared to the past 3 years. EPAM, on the other hand increased its stock compensation of employees more than fourfold to $24 million. Part of it is due to rising market value, the rest is basically increasing the amount of shares outstanding, which went up 20% at EPAM vs. 10% at LXFT since 2011.As we can see, LXFT's gross and operating margins slightly rebounded, and are higher than EPAM; however, both companies seem to have their profits squeezed by competition. EPAM revenue growth has slowed and reached the lowest value in 5 years, while LXFT seems to be doing pretty well.ValuationEPAM trades at a slight premium to LXFT based on multiples. I have done a DCF model with the following assumptions:- FCFE of 93 mil. for EPAM and 61 mil. for LXFT- EPAM will grow 20% for the next 5 years, 10% for 5 years after that and then in line with GDP- LXFT will grow 15% for the next 5 years, 7.5% for 5 years after that and then in line with GDP- Discount rates of 7%-9%EPAM seems to be priced quite reasonably, given the expectations. LXFT looks like it overshot those expectations in terms of market value appreciation. It is almost impossible to forecast future earnings growth that far with any reasonable accuracy.However, what we can say is that if these companies grow faster than expected, the intrinsic value is higher than the current market price. If they grow slower, it's much, much lower.Benjamin Graham once wrote that an investor should seek to shield himself from the vicissitudes of the future, not profit from them. If we look at it like this, LXFT and EPAM probably do not offer much margin of safety at these prices.RisksBoth companies are reliant on spending and software updating mainly in financial and technology sectors. EPAM experienced a small decline in sales after the recession in 2008, the numbers for LXFT are not available from that period. If companies decrease IT spending, both stocks will suffer.LXFT is much more concentrated based on the number of top clients and sources of revenue. Any cancellation or modification of a contract with significant customers would deal a blow to its business.EPAM and LXFT's stock declined during the Ukrainian crisis, because a large part of their workforce is based there. They have since moved a large part out of Ukraine or far from the conflict zones, but should the situation escalate, both would probably go down in the short term.SummaryI like LXFT more due to its higher margins, improving revenue growth and high concentration on banking. I believe that financial companies will continue spending on IT infrastructure and new online products, as a means of gaining an edge on competitors and drawing more customers.Both businesses are well positioned in the outsourcing space, as they basically offer higher quality work than developers in India or Pakistan, for a fraction of the cost of such work in the EU or the US.Growth stocks seldom sell at low valuations, but LXFT still seems to be priced quite conservatively compared to prospects. I think it can grow faster than expectations, and as a result, Wall Street might be underappreciating it."
4201355,98236,2018-08-22T16:18:27-04:00,"EPAM is one of the dustier corners within the IT outsourcing space, with surprisingly little interest in the shares despite stellar operating performance.The company, with much of its service delivery capability coming from Eastern Europe, continues to grow at rates far in excess of the Indian peers.The company has the ability to perform the most complex assignments and is able to perform assignments using a combination of.The company is one of the leading outsourcing vendors that offers real inter-disciplinary capabilities incorporating engineers, designers and consultants.The company's strong growth in the 25%+ range is mainly challenged by its continued ability to attract superior talent in areas in which it has a strong presence.","I initially wrote an article about EPAM (EPAM) almost 2 years ago. The shares haven't quite doubled since I wrote about the company. That is a little bit better than the appreciation of the IGV index which is up 68% over the same time frame. On the other hand, EPAM's operational performance and share price performance have substantially exceeded its Indian outsourcing peers, and in fact, the company's performance could easily be said to have achieved hyper-growth status.At one point, the outsourcing space was considered to be fresh, new and exciting. That is no longer the case, but the market size is large, and still growing at about 4.5% according to the research report linked here or at a 6% rate according to another study linked here. Like many tech investors, I have typically owned a position in the space for one reason or the other. Recently, however, the inability of Cognizant (CTSH) to sustain its planned growth has led me to look at the space in some detail.One thing of note is that there are significantly different demand patterns in different areas of the overall outsourcing space. For example, outsourcing in the health care IT space is growing far more rapidly than the IT outsourcing space as a whole. And as many readers may know, the concept of digital transformation is one that has gotten lots of traction in the last couple of years and has enabled the space as a whole to maintain positive growth.One trend that has stood out during the course of my checks has been the rise of IT outsourcing in Eastern Europe. This isn't precisely a new trend to be sure, but it is one that I am told is becoming more noticeable over the years. Eastern European outsourcers are said to be able to offer their customers an overall better experience and to be able to perform more complex assignments more quickly and with higher quality than competitors. Obviously, that is not something I can validate-but to some extent, the numbers of the two public Eastern European outsourcers suggest that they are gaining market share.At the moment, there are but two public Eastern European IT outsourcing firms. One of these is Luxoft (LUX). Luxoft is a complicated story that hasn't worked as a stock for some time now, mainly because of the issues involved in dealing with customer concentration. It is very cheap, and when it hits an inflection point, it will be a very interesting investment, but that inflection point keeps getting pushed back, and I simply lack the temerity to take a chance on the name without more data points than I can collect.There are private companies; ones that I am told are doing very well, and there is a niche company called Globant (GLOB) which is of potential interest. But I was driven to select to focus on EPAM, which while certainly not cheap, does offer some interesting opportunities that might make sense to consider.EPAM is not quite a dusty corner with estimates provided to First Call by 15 analysts. But it really doesn't get lots of attention in the US despite having a headquarters outside of Philadelphia. and certainly is not a name that has gotten much attention on the pages of SA with the last article about this company published more than a year ago. EPAM's latest conference call had participation from only 6 US analysts.EPAM doesn't exactly match up with what most people think of as IT outsourcing and never has. While the company does do software implementation work and also competes aggressively for complex application design opportunities, it does offer a substantially broader array of services when compared to other Indian software outsourcing vendors.A significant component of EPAM's raison d'etre relates to its capabilities in terms of engineering consulting, and its ability to do outsourced product engineering/product development in different areas for its clients. While the development work is based on software, the output is typically that of product design. That said, EPAM does compete for contracts relating to the implementation of complex custom software and its largest vertical, financial Services, is obviously based on implementation work, sometimes of packaged software as well as developing a new software app for it clients. EPAM is the leading Eastern European IT outsourcing vendor with more than 24,000 service delivery personnel As part of this latest earnings release, the company forecast that its revenues this year are forecast to be around $1.8 billion +, up 26% from 2017. Interestingly, and certainly, a significant comparison compared to other vendors, while revenues are growing in the mid to high 20% range, adjusted for currency, professional headcount only has increased 19% year on year and just by 2.5% this past quarter.It is my belief, fostered by anecdotal checks, that what is happening is that EPM is pivoting to delivering far more complex services by employing more expensive and experienced talent when compared to most Indian outsourcing vendors. Overall, the company has been able to produce 30 quarters of more than 20%+ organic top-line growth. Most of its business comes from North America and from Europe. As previously mentioned, the company is headquartered in Newtown, a suburb of Philadelphia, PA, but its major service delivery locations are located in Belarus, in the Ukraine, in Russia and other parts of central Europe. The company largest verticals are Financial services, Travel and Consumer, Life Sciences and Media. These verticals haven't changed greatly over the past years.The company's newest functional capability is what is called Platform Engineering and Orchestration. The company is rated as the leader in a category called Digital Platform Engineering Services by Forrester, with competitors including Luxoft, Persistent Systems (a company with shares only traded in India) and HCL Technologies (another Indian headquartered company only traded in India.) It is one of the larger vendors in its space, although HCL is probably the largest vendor offering competitive capabilities, with total revenues of about $8 billion.Platform Engineering is described as the process of selecting frameworks while showing how to tie frameworks together to build a platform on which applications can then be built. It is as much a process as anything that can be specifically described, and it has some of the same attributes as DevOps. I am not sure that I am able to define with much more granularity but some market research professionals are able to do so-or so they say-and have suggested that EPAM is a leader in the space.EPAM's largest single vertical is financial services. One of the more significant assignments highlighted in the script this last quarter's conference call related to work the company was doing for one of the larger global insurance company. As is very typical for EPAM, its work for this client started with what is self-described as an engineering engagement. Over time, EPAM had the expertise to bring in its consulting capabilities and to deliver a comprehensive business assessment, detailing what the client actually needed to accomplish. While much of the specific script from the conference call is a commercial, what EPAM is doing these days is to sell clients on its end-to-end automation capabilities which allow the user to improve productivity and reduce costs and improve the probability of success in complex projects that often fail when they are done by other vendors.Interestingly, while Cognizant Tech cited a disappointing outlook in Financial Services for its projected growth shortfall, and reported sub-5% growth in that vertical last quarter, EPAM achieved 30% growth in that vertical, which is its largest. Historically, it has been Indian outsourcers who were able to get the kind of complex assignments described above. These typically grew into much larger contracts and were the fuel for hyper-growth in the Indian outsourcing space. That mantle has now apparently passed to outsourcers in Eastern Europe who offer the advanced capabilities that once were the province of Indian outsourcers.By the nature of things, large outsourcing vendors have a strong base of what is essentially recurring revenue, and EPAM is no different. More than 90% of its revenues come from clients who have dealt with EPAM for more than a year and with customer retention averaging above 10 years for its largest clients. It now has more than 10 clients with whom it bills more than $20 million/year. At this point, while 65% of its revenues are denominated in dollars and a further 23% of revenues are denominated in GBP and Euros, On the other hand, about 20% of its costs are denominated in Rubles, Polish Zlotys and Hungarian Forints. This has been a favorable arbitrage for EPAM over the last couple of quarters. In both Belarus and the Ukraine, salaries are denominated in dollars so in those regions, the cost issues of operating in a foreign currency are less of a factor that might otherwise be the case. The company, unlike its Eastern European rival, Luxoft, does not have substantial customer concentration, and its top 20 clients were just 23% of revenue last quarter, while clients below the top 20 achieved a 32% revenue growth rate in the quarter compared to the overall corporate growth of 27%.The company got about 2% of its revenues last quarter from a recent acquisition called Continuum. Continuum is a global design consultancy through that has helped mid-market clients move products to market through a holistic process.One interesting statistic that contrasts to the numbers reported by Cognizant, for example, in this latest quarter was the decline in gross margins. The decline wasn't huge, about 180 basis points on a GAAP basis year on year, which contrasts to the increase in gross margins reported by Cognizant. The company indicated that part of the reason for the fall in gross margins had to do with an increase in variable compensation while part was due to lower utilization. This is consistent with the company's forecast, and gross margins were marginally higher in fiscal Q2 compared to Q1.I think one of the things that is being seen through this comparison is that Cognizant is no longer providing its associates with premium compensation, while EPAM is able to hire cohorts of the ""best and the brightest."" In return, EPAM has been able to reduce Selling, General, and Administrative costs, because to a greater extent, the quality of the service is becoming better known in the market, and this has enabled EPAM to improve operational efficiencies and to maintain hyper growth.At this point, about 60% of EPAM's revenues are coming from the existing base in a typical quarter, with 40% coming from what the company calls new revenants. A revenant as I understand the term is supposed to be some kind of visible ghost that has been revived after death, so why the CFO chose to describe new customers using that term escapes me-but there it is, in any event.One of the hotter areas in the consulting business these days is something called Robotic Process Automation. RPA has been described as ""software automating software."" There are a number of vendors in this space-Pegasystems (PEGA) is actually an important factor in this market, but one reason for the relatively high growth of rate of EPAM has been its leadership in this market. It is hard for me to evaluate just how much intelligent automation projects are driving the company's growth but management has suggested that one significant element in winning new customers is the company's expertise in intelligent automation.One of the more interesting concepts that has helped EPAM maintain its growth rate is that about 20% of the company's business comes from revenues derived from technology and software companies. Put another way, a fair component of this company's revenue comes from other tech/software companies paying it to do development projects. The result of those engagements is, at the least, developing better exposure for EPAM in the higher growth areas of the technology space. But sometimes EPAM will not only get paid by tech clients but will work with those clients in building specific solutions that can be sold to third parties. It is apparently a very symbiotic business model and one that is working out well for EPAM at this point.I have mentioned that EPAM is able to offer its clients more sophisticated solutions when compared to other outsourcing vendors. Obviously, there is no objective way to prove this contention-it is mainly a function of anecdotal checks coupled with some of the work that EPAM has recently announced. Again, part of the recent script during the latest conference call related to EPAM's success in an engagement with one of the largest package goods vendors. The engagement started with what today is considered a relatively standard analytical project that encompassed revenue and pricing optimization models. At this point, the engagement is now part of a major initiative that using machine learning, natural language recognition and image recognition that is automating processes-the robotic process automation about which I wrote earlier. The output has been what is called a planogram model which shows this client where to place products throughout its physical locations in order to maximize revenues.Most outsourcers advertise some or all of these kinds of capacities-and many others besides such as Blockchain expertise, but many projects that incorporate the more advanced functionality or require interdisciplinary capabilities fail because of lack of skilled data scientists and engineers to implement some of these silos of technology. If I had to try to encapsulate the secret sauce that EPAM has been offering it would be its focus on multidisciplinary teams which incorporate engineers, designers, and consultants. That probably doesn't seem like a huge moat to readers, but in reality, at this point, it has been successful in differentiating the capabilities of EPAM when compared to alternatives to its services.I think the major challenge for this company is finding qualified people in its various service delivery regions that can allow it to continue its growth trajectory. The relatively modest increase in headcount last quarter was perhaps a sign that the company has had difficulties in meeting its goals for net addition.Over the years, EPAM has opened service delivery centers in India, China and more than a few geos in somewhat unfamiliar locations. At this point, the company is developing solutions in 25 different locations although the vast proportion of its delivery professionals remain in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and Central Europe. Managing the level of geographic diversification that EPAM has undertaken is a substantial undertaking, especially when the company's secret sauce is its focus on multi-disciplinary capabilities.One observation I might make is that offering multi-disciplinary capabilities is neither absolutely unique or a strategy that can't be adopted by competitors. And the company's geographic advantages in terms of finding staff can also be threatened.That said, there is no real evidence that the larger outsourcers from either India or the US are entering Eastern Europe or trying to build capabilities similar to those offered by EPAM. There is a certain first-mover advantage enjoyed by EPAM and its CEO is a very well known figure in the particular consulting circles in which EPAM specializes.Probably the biggest single risk that this company faces, is one that is common to all IT companies. These last couple of years have seen a strongly rising tide in which customers have been willing to invest substantially, both in packaged software, but in complex projects to effect digital transformations. Demand for EPAM's services is cyclical and the rising tide is something that concerns many observers, regardless of the ""Goldilocks"" macro conditions that prevail in the US at this point. At this point, I simply have no way of calibrating the correlation between EPAM growth and macro growth estimates.EPAM shares rallied modestly in the wake of the company's latest quarterly report which saw earnings but not revenues beating estimates. The shares are currently trading at a high for the year and are up 26% YTD and by 77% over the last year. Currently, based on projected outstanding shares, the company has a market capitalization of around $7.7 billion and an enterprise value of about $7.1 billion. So that yields an EV/S ratio of about 3.5X on a twelve-month forward basis, In these days of double-digit EV/S ratios for many high-growth software names, finding an EV/S at this level is certainly unusual in a positive way.EPAM is a profitable company and has been so for most of its life. I mentioned some of the major items on the income statement earlier in this article, but to repeat, the company's current level of GAAP margins was 12.5% last quarter compared to 11.6% in the year earlier period. The company has a relatively modest level of stock-based comp, which was less than 2% of revenues last quarter. Operating margins on a non-GAAP basis were 16% last quarter, compared to 15.6% in the year earlier period.Operating margins at this level are lower than those of the largest Indian outsourcers-and probably by design. The company pays more to secure talent and to staff multi-disciplinary teams and that is expensive. Part of the growth the company has been able to achieve is because its reputation of achieving superior results for its clients. I don't think it reasonable to imagine the company will be able to achieve a material growth in operating margins and after the unpleasant results of that kind of exercise at Cognizant, I have to wonder if the trade-off would be worth it.The current forecast EPS isn't based on any material expansion of operating margins. EPS, looking ahead 12 months is expected to be about $4.60-$4.65, and that yields a forward P/E of about 29X. That P/E is noticeably higher than the P/E ratios for the larges Indian outsourcing vendors such as Cognizant and Infosys (INFY), but then again, this company has had years of growth 3X or more the growth of those rivals.Like most other outsourcing vendors, this company is not an explicit cash flow story. CFFO has been and will remain less than reported non-GAAP earnings and the company will be spending significantly on facilities to support its growth in different geos. Over time, the balance sheet will expand to support higher business volumes. In addition, unbilled revenues will continue to rise significantly as the company undertakes assignments with greater complexity. As the company doesn't present quarterly cash flow results and doesn't forecast that metric, it would not be prudent for me to present any outlook which would be based on far too many assumptions to make it realistic.EPAM, despite achieving $2 billion of revenues, is a dusty corner in the IT services field. It has developed unique capabilities in terms of its offering that involve engineering, product design and consulting in one package. This has lead to the company being awarded, large and complex assignments that are the major fuel behind the company's 25% growth story. In addition, it has been able to staff its work with high-quality developers mainly coming from Eastern Europe and the old CIS countries, that has facilitated a competitive advantage, mainly in terms of recruiting high-talent people rather than through attempting to minimize costs or to maximize margins.The company has a long-serving CEO, Arkady Dobkin who founded the business in 1993, and who is well known in the industry and has built a strong team that has executed over many years now. The company has developed its advantages into a competitive positioning that is apparently resonating successfully when compared to the traditional Indian outsourcers.While valuation is not terribly stretched overall, the shares are up considerably over the past year. And the shares are more highly valued than those of the major Indian outsourcers whose shares are actively traded in the US. But given sustainable growth at or above the mid 20% range, an EV/S of 3.5 on a forward basis is quite reasonable and is far less than similar valuations that other companies which sell products more than services have been accorded.I am not suggesting that the shares are going to appreciate by 77% every year. I do think they will be able to contribute positive alpha to a portfolio, and that the company is likely to continue its growth cadence into the foreseeable future."
1530822,30811,2013-07-02T05:19:11-04:00,,"In this research note, I will focus on the investment analysis for the stock of EPAM Systems (NYSE:EPAM), which I believe to be notably undervalued as the current share price is not fully reflective of the company's robust growth profile.Business OverviewFounded in 1993, EPAM provides software product development services to corporate customers in various industries globally. The company's diversified service offerings include software development, application testing and maintenance, enterprise application platform, as well as infrastructure management. The details for each business are shown in the chart below.Aside from servicing customers in the software development industry, EPAM also targets many other industry verticals such as banking, asset management, travel, consumer, and media. The firm's service delivery centers are primarily located in Central and Eastern Europe (""CEE"") including countries such as Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, and Hungary. To effectively market and manage client relationship, EPAM has established several client management offices in the US, Canada, and other Western European countries.Stock OverviewTo obtain funding for further expansion, EPAM went IPO in February 2012. Since then, the share price has almost doubled (94% return) to its all-time high at ~$27 (see chart below) and the stock's market capitalization has reached to about $1.2B, propelled by EPAM's solid financial performance as the company has consecutively beaten both consensus revenue and EPS estimates over the past 6 quarters. On a next-12-month basis, the stock is trading at a forward P/E of 16.4x.Financial PerformanceSince 2009, EPAM's revenue has increased by a CAGR of 42.5% from $149.9M to $433.8M in 2012, driven by both organic growth and acquisitions (see chart below). Software product development and application testing are currently EPAM's primary service offerings as they represent about 67% and 20%, respectively, of the total revenue generated in 2012 (see chart below).EPAM's client base is well diversified. About 26% of the total revenue is generated from banking and financial customers, 25% from software and technology, 22% from consumer, 14% from business and media, and the remaining 13% from other verticals (see chart below). North America and Europe are EPAM's primarily markets, which together represent about 84% of the total revenue. The company also has certain exposure to the CEE region (see chart below).Over the same period, EPAM has also managed to achieve healthy operating margins ranging from 10% to 17% (the recent margin decline will be discussed later). The solid margin performance has translated into robust EPS growth. Since 2009, EPAM's EPS has grown by a CAGR of 73.8% from $0.22 to $1.17 in 2012 (see charts below).EPAM is currently in a strong liquidity position. The firm carries no debt and is sitting on a cash balance of $104.4M as of March 31, 2013. The cash position is likely to be supported by the company's healthy operating cash flow margin which was at 9.0% as of Q1 2013 on a trailing 12-month basis. In addition to that, there is a $40M undrawn credit facility available if EPAM requires additional funding for heavy capital expenditure or M&A.Competitive AdvantageTechnical CompetenceSince inception, EPAM has been servicing independent software vendors (""ISVs"") and technology companies, most of which are industry leaders such as International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and SAP. Due to the complex function and configuration of these clients' software products, they require a high level of sophisticated software engineering and infrastructure management services. Given that EPAM's service portfolio covers the full lifecycle of its clients' vigorous software development process, the company has been able to build a strong knowledge and expertise foundation in various software engineering services.EPAM's experience with the ISVs and technology clients also enables the company to develop vertical-specific expertise, which has been leveraged by EPAM to support and accelerate its vertical expansion. Over the past 3 years, this unique business model has driven EPAM's financial and consumer vertical revenues CAGRs to 61.3% and 62.8% (see chart below), respectively, significantly exceeding the company's overall top-line growth (39.8%). Management has indicated that the company will continue focusing on servicing the full software development cycle for the leading ISVs and technology companies to further develop technical competence and enhance its expertise in various industry verticals.Competitive Talent PoolStaff is a critical asset for a technology firm. EPAM's service delivery centers are located in CEE, which has approximately 950K science and technology students graduating every year as a result of the region's strong education focus. On a per capita basis, the number of new science and technology graduates is notably more than those in India, Western Europe, and North America, presenting a large talent pool for technology companies like EPAM in the CEE region. To capitalize on the talent advantage, the company places a high priority on attracting, training, and retaining its employees, and has successfully achieved a below-benchmark staff attrition rate.Loyal Blue-Chip Client BaseIn addition to the leading ISVs and technology companies, EPAM has also attracted many major blue-chip clients in different industry verticals (see chart below). The company has managed to retain an average relationship period of at least 7 years for its top 10 clients. As a result, approximately 80% to 90% of the company's revenue is generated from recurring services and thus roughly the same portion of the revenue would be visible at the beginning of a fiscal year and at least 95% of the revenue would be visible at the beginning of a quarter, allowing the company to be more effective in managing its financial budget and public market guidance.Upside DriversIndustry TailwindFacing increased global competition of streamlining software development and improving products' time-to-market, corporations are increasingly outsourcing their software product development function given that the offshore IT service providers with substantial development and delivery operations are able to effectively respond to the current challenges. In addition, the access to high-quality and cost-effective IT talent is difficult in many parts of the world. Due to the increased demand for improved quality and cost management, many corporations throughout the world find that offshoring the software development can result in significant quality improvement and operating cost reduction. According to IDC, worldwide offshore software development services spending will likely grow at a 5-year CAGR of 11.8% through 2014 to $14B.The growing offshore software development spending has created significant opportunities not only for traditional India-based IT service providers but also for CEE-based service companies due to the region's competitive talent pool and lower salary level relative to those of the more developed regions (i.e. Western Europe and North America). Further, based on a Cowen and Company's study, the CEE-based IT service providers are better positioned to capture market share in Western Europe as the Western European ISVs and technology companies are more comfortable with employing IT service providers with near-shore delivery capabilities. According to Central and Eastern European Outsourcing Association, the volume of the software development services exported from CEE has been increasing by 20% annually since 2010 and is expected to remain robust in the next 5 years.EPAM has been able to capitalize on the growing offshoring trend in the CEE region as suggested by its revenue CAGR of 42.5% from 2009 to 2012. It is also noted that the company's European revenue has increased by a CAGR of 72.8% over the period, substantially exceeding the overall top-line growth rate (see chart below).Future M&APart of EPAM's growth strategy is to pursue acquisition opportunities so as to expand its vertical-specific domain expertise, service offerings, client base, as well as geographical footprint. Since 2008, EPAM has successfully completed 5 tuck-in acquisitions (see chart below) and 2 of them were closed recently in 2012. For example, the acquisition of Thoughcorp has added Bell Canada, Rogers Communications (NYSE:RCI), and other known Canadian brands to the company's client base, and management has announced that the company is currently on track to realize the expected synergies (e.g. cross-sell) from the transaction. As discussed previously, EPAM's healthy operating cash flow, debt-free balance sheet, decent cash balance, and its undrawn $40M credit facility should provide the company sufficient M&A firepower.New Contract AcquisitionIn Q1 2013, EPAM continued to gain momentum on new contract acquisition. The company has disclosed the following developments in the Q1 2013 earnings call, which will support continued revenue growth in the near term:1. EPAM added new clients in each industry vertical in Q1 and many of them show strong promise to ramp rapidly in rest of 2013;2. A client acquired 9 months ago will expand its service demand and thus will likely be among the top 10 clients in this year;3. EPAM added a Canadian mobile device manufacturer which has the potential to become a major client in 2014; and4. Several Canadian clients have expanded their service demand and demonstrated potential for requesting additional services.Revamped Marketing MethodHistorically, EPAM's new contracts are mostly generated through referrals from existing clients (e.g. ISVs) and the company has limited sales force capacity. Given the significant market opportunities and that EPAM plans to compete for larger service contracts, management has been recruiting additional sales staff and investing in related office facility. Management has indicated that the sales platform ramp-up would weigh on the operating margin in the near term, which explains the decreasing operating margin trend since 2012. Despite the increased operating cost, management estimated that the operating margin would remain within mid-to-high-teens range. Over time, it is expected that the sales platform would be a notable operating leverage for EPAM to drive additional revenue growth and operating margin expansion.ValuationDespite the significant price appreciation since EPAM's IPO, I believe that the stock remains undervalued. According to the comps table shown below (selected comps were quoted in EPAM's 10-K as the company's major competitors), EPAM's consensus revenue, EBITDA, and EPS growth rates are considerably above the peer averages. On the profit side, EPAM's gross margin and capital return metrics are slightly above par, however, the company's other profitability margins are below the averages, though the difference is not significant.EPAM's current forward price multiple (on next 12 month basis) at 16.4x is 9% above the peer average at 15.0x. Given the company's superior growth potential, the 9% valuation premium is completely warranted. After accounting for the firm's consensus 5-year earnings growth estimate, the stock's PEG ratio of 0.7x is 30% below par. The large PEG discount appears to be exaggerated as EPAM's margin underperformance is not that significant and part of it is due to the company's increased spending in building the sales platform, which only has a near-term profitability impact. Moreover, I believe EPAM's unique business model (i.e. leveraging expertise developed from serving tech clients to enhance performance in other industry verticals) and its exposure to the CEE regions (4 of the comps are primarily based in the US) should substantiate a premium valuation relative to the comps'.From another perspective, EPAM's forward P/E multiple is currently 10.3% above that of S&P 500 Index, which stands at 14.9x now, and its 5-year PEG ratio is 61% lower (0.7x vs. 1.8x). Given the fact that EPAM's consensus 5-year earnings growth estimate at 23.3% is overwhelmingly above the average estimate of 8.2% for the S&P 500 companies, EPAM should reasonably deserve a higher market premium (see chart below).ConclusionThe promising industry growth prospect and solid company fundamentals would suggest that EPAM is capable to continue meeting or exceeding market expectations. As the company finishes building up the sales platform and the operating margin recovers, I would expect to see an expansion in valuation multiple. Based on the peer-average 5-year PEG ratio at 1.0x and a lower 5-year earnings growth rate of 18% (to be more conservative than the market), the stock would be priced at 18.0x forward EPS. Using the consensus 2014 EPS estimate of $1.88, this conservative method would imply a target price of $33.84, representing an approximately 25% upside.All facts and data used in the article are sourced from S&P Capital IQ, company financial filings, and company presentation unless otherwise specified.Disclosure: I am long EPAM.

It competes against Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), HCL Technologies (HCL), Cerner Corp (NASDAQ:CERN), Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH), and Infosys (NYSE:INFY).It has been characterized by a few bouts of intense selling since its rally from the July lows. What does its future look like?MetricsThe company has strong numbers and a tendency to beat estimates, at least in its recent history since its 2011 IPO.Gross Margins and operating margins are lower than industry averages, which is not where you want them. However, size of company frequently plays into margins, because of economies of scale -- the economics theory that as you produce on a larger scale, the cost of the goods or services produced goes down. When considering that its two main competitors have a market cap twenty times as large as EPAM's, lower economies of scale can be a factor.EPAM does have higher revenue growth rates than its industry competitors. The company's PEG is .74, which is 30% lower than its competitors. A PEG of .74 indicates that the stock may be underpriced when compared to expected earnings growth rates over the next five years.EPAM has no long term debt, producing a LT debt-to-equity ratio of 0. This compares to an industry average of .40. Finally, EPAM has a higher return on assets (ROA) that its competitors, meaning that it is more efficient at using its assets to create earnings.These are strong metrics and indicate financial health and the efficiency to turn sales into earnings going forward.AnalystsAnalysts view it favorably. Five analysts have the stock rated a ""buy."" One analyst has it rated an ""outperform."" Two analysts have it rated a ""hold."" Additionally, the company has beaten analyst estimates the previous four quarters. That is a good trend to have on your side. The company has beaten revenue expectations the prior four quarters as well, though not by as large of a margin.ChartOverall, the stock has been in an uptrending channel since August, only temporarily breaking the bottom rail on the Fiscal Cliff scare.(Click to enlarge)EPAM has been riding its 21 day exponential moving average up toward the top of its channel before breaking down.

I have found in my investing experience buying richly hyped IPOs are a good way to go broke and I was a skeptic on Facebook's IPO from the start. However, if one stays away from the high profile IPOs, there are some bargains to be had. One company, EPAM Systems (EPAM), went public in February and just released second quarter earnings.

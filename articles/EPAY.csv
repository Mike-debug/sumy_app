(XOOM) by PayPal Holdings (PYPL), may eventually lead to increased competitive pressures on the back-end service providers in the space, the sentiment around the payment processing space has benefited from the proliferation of new digital 'competitors', be it digital wallets, peer-to-peer payments or micro lending, all of which are growing at high double-digit rates.Bottomline is reporting fiscal year end (June) results next week. More than the results, the fundamental thesis should get highlighted as the spotlight turns to forward looking numbers, including the high visibility, an opportunity to deliver relatively stable high single digit/ low double-digit revenue growth and improving margins scenario. The scenario, based on which, the stock offers an opportunity to invest in one of the fastest growing names in the space trading at one of the lowest trading multiples.Just as a background, the company has a relatively more diversified product offering than some of the other players in the space, due to offerings like healthcare solutions and Legal Spend Management. Almost 77% of the revenue is recurring in nature, which has been increasing as a percentage of total revenue and last quarter, recurring revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, was at the highest level ever. Besides recurring revenue sources, subscription and transaction revenue, constituting more than 50% of the total revenue, offers high visibility to the topline.Revenue growth catalysts look strongThe backlog number alone, which grew almost 8% last quarter and 21% during 2014, can give confidence to the growth trajectory, but the trends underneath provide further depth and breadth about the growth, important for confidence driven valuation premium for the stock, which seems missing so far.For the Payments & Transactional Documents, the largest and most profitable business, the recently acquired Intellinx offers a big opportunity. By adding fraud detection and prevention solutions of Intellinx to the existing products, there should be relatively easy cross-selling opportunities in the existing financial institution client base. Revenue itself may not be big for the current year, approximately $10 million or so, but the expected growth of more than 50% from the solution itself and then some additional synergies by next year should help the growth rate of the business.The Hosted business has been doing well and the momentum should carry on, especially looking at Paymode-X and PartnersSelect programs. Paymode-X, the company's electronic settlement network focusing on the higher value payments execution part of the transaction, has over 270,000 enrolled vendors and is adding almost 3,000 vendors per month. Growing vendors should eventually lead to transactions and revenue. Last quarter, the company's Paymode-X payment network signed 17 new deals under the vendor pay model. Although the launch got pushed back by a few months, PartnersSelect, a new platform from the company to automate law firm selection, management and evaluation, should help the business monetize the strong position in the legal spend management space. In the last quarter alone, there were 7 new deals in the Legal Spend Management business leading to a total of 23 deals in the first three quarters.The new digital banking platform that was scheduled for general availability last quarter is expected to add more capabilities for corporate customers and additional features for marketing/ customer engagement, up from mostly a business operating system.Benefiting more than just the toplineThere is significant leverage in the model, but unlike ACI Worldwide, margins are also benefiting from decent growth and margin expansion in the case of Bottomline, as the sheet below shows.Indeed, gross margins reached 59% last quarter, while sales & marketing declined to 21% during that time. Operating margin came in around 18% and EBITDA 21% of the total revenue.Some of these improvements have been overshadowed by a large number of non-cash adjustments from the GAAP numbers, as shown below.But the adjustments should also start to decline from this fiscal year onwardsIn the meantime, cash flows have started to show the improvementExpectations, yet to catch upTying the fundamental trends to the Street expectations, expecting $332 million revenue and $1.44 EPS for the fiscal year just ended and $367 million of revenue and $1.58 EPS for the fiscal year underway, the expectations have yet to catch up.A simple back of an envelope calculation will highlight the conservative bias, as the calculation above shows. As mentioned earlier, the business is already generating almost 18% of operating margin and 21% EBITDA, which may further benefit from growth related synergies, leverage and new products.And from any change at the margin levels, there is high sensitivity to the earnings as well, as the calculation above shows.Even at an EPS level, the estimates for approximately 38 cents look rather conservative, if one compares the growth expected for the quarter with the growth seen in the fourth quarter last year or the growth seen through the year, as the calculation above shows. Worth noting that the company did deliver ahead of the expected numbers last quarter.RelativelyEven based on the current expectations, the name offers one of the highest growth rates in the space, while trading at a discount to peers. The name is barely followed on the Street and follows a relatively good financial discipline in terms of making acquisitions. Indeed, the company's preference of going for only non-dilutive acquisitions should offer solace to the public investors, considering the high current operating margins of close to 18%.Note: Detailed proprietary model is not attached in this note for the sake of easy readability, but happy to help and provide more details to readers interested in understanding the calculations used in this note."
4228420,104855,2018-12-14T14:27:26-05:00,"There is a huge growth potential of the digital transformation of B2B payments network with a CAGR of over 20%.
        The company offers a strong business model with double-digit organic revenue growth rate, a high share of recurring revenues and sticky customer base.
        As the company scales its business with product leadership, it will gradually expand margins and improve cash generation.","Bottomline Technologies, Inc. (EPAY) is a leader in business payments software & services and offers a great SaaS business model with diversified recurring revenue and a significant growth opportunity driven by the B2B payments market growth. There is an ongoing digital transformation of the B2B payments market as corporations are trying to shift from paper checks to digital solutions that are cheaper and increase operational efficiency. I believe the company is well positioned to capitalize on this trend, due to its strong competitive advantage based on technology leadership and reputation for offering smart, secure and easy-to-use solutions. The company is also the best-in-class leader in its niche industry and consistently maintains a double-digit revenue growth rate combined with EBITDA margin expansion over the last several years. I expect from the company to scale its SaaS business with further market penetration and potential M&A activities to acquire new best-in-class technologies across different verticals. That can drive further shareholder value-creation by achieving subscription & transaction revenue growth rate of 15-20%, together with margins expansion and share repurchases over the next several years.The company was founded in 1989 and throughout its history enables corporations and banks to make simple, smart and secure domestic as well as cross-border payments. Mr. H. Rob Eberle has been its CEO since November 2006 and has joined the company in 1998. The company is offering a broad line of payment, invoice, and document automation software solutions and services. That helps corporations, financial institution and banks to become more efficient, improve operations, and realize better cost savings. The key growth segments are settlement network solutions and legal spend management. Another important banking transactions segment might start to generate higher revenues than 5% Y/Y with recently established Digital Banking 3.0 solution that is also shifting from perpetual license to a subscription model.The key product in settlement network segment is Paymode - X that is a secure cloud-based payment network for businesses and easily integrates with ERP systems and bank accounts. It has more than 385,000 members and has processed over $200 billion transactions in 2017 and is achieving consistent growth over the last several years.Source: Investor Presentation, December 2018Members get real-time visibility into cash payments and transaction settlements data and the system is quick and user-friendly. The key benefits for customers are reduced DSOs, secure banking information, fully automated payment system, and cash rebates on ACH transactions. Integrations with Visa and Mastercard offer customers and vendors multiple payment methods with their corporate cards through a Paymode X network. In a recent collaboration with TD Bank, Paymode - X showed strong integration capabilities with cash management platform of Digital banking 3.0. Now customers can use cash management platform together with payment network in a simple way what creates a strong value proposition for them and also scales the company’s overall business.Source: Investor Presentation, December 2018Another important growth segment is legal spend management with its key product Legal X. Particular segment consists of cloud-based solutions and services that help organizations control legal spend with automated e-billing system, expense monitoring, and reporting functionalities. Revenues in this segment are based on a percentage of the legal bill combined with success fee based upon realized cost savings.New customers usually sign long-term contracts as products like Paymode-X and Legal-X connect thousands of vendors and customers, what makes products deeply integrated into their IT systems and become essential to day-to-day operations. Companies are reluctant to replace such products frequently as that would cause higher software implementation and training costs. Therefore, customers usually stick with Bottomline Technologies for 10 or 15 years and the lifetime value of a new customer addition is usually more than $10 million. That makes a sticky customer base with 86% of its revenues recurring and I believe the company is in a good position to profit from the ongoing digital transformation of business payments. It can easily outperform $300M in subscription & transactions revenues and $100M in EBITDA targets in FY19 together with $120M in revenues from other lower growth sources. Overall, strong retention rates with significant lifetime customer value are the most important growth drivers in any type of the SaaS business model. Over the last several years, the company changed from perpetual software license revenues to the SaaS business model that has contributed to strong revenues growth and EBITDA margin expansion, what is reflected on the Ycharts figure above. Fellow SA contributor pointed out that the company acquired around 20 companies at a cost of over $361 million as the reason for shareholder value destruction. I like his deep analysis throughout his article but in my opinion, some of these acquisitions helped the company to differentiate its product offerings from bank transactions to other several segments. That lead to a transition to the high-growth SaaS business model with over 80% of recurring revenues and that is also reflected in the figure below. Because of smart strategic acquisitions in Subscriptions & Transactions, the company could achieve revenue CAGR of 24% and adjusted EBITDA CAGR of 12% between FY 11 and estimated value in FY 19.Source: Corporate website, December 2018Well, the company doesn’t have a consumer type of product like iPhone, therefore it usually takes a longer time for the market to generate demand for new products or solutions. That is why product releases as the result of acquisitions like Paymode -X in 2009 or Intellnix in 2015 take several years to reach its full growth potential. The company also expects a further margin expansion over the next several years, because of a high operating leverage in the SaaS business model.The company operates in a highly competitive and fragmented market in all segments, against smaller private companies, and also against certain divisions of large companies like JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, ACI Worldwide, etc. However additional competition or rapid technological shift could cause a market share loss, intensified pricing pressure, and reduced margins. There is an ongoing digital transformation of business payments and according to Goldman Sachs payment ecosystems research report in 2017, the B2B payment volume is estimated at over $23 trillion globally and the market is expected to reach $41 trillion in 2027. Over 60% of businesses still make the majority of their payments by paper checks, and companies are expected to adopt more secure, efficient and cheaper payment processes like Paymode-X. Therefore, this is a key growth driver for settlement solutions and the company also expects subscriptions & transactions total addressable market growth rate of more than 20% over the next several years. The company believes its key competitive advantages are scale and experience as it has over 10,000 customers with average customer value time 5-10 years. It has also a broad portfolio of differentiated products combined with consistent innovation what reflects its deep domain knowledge.Source: Form 10-Q, November 2018The CEO Rob Eberle stated the following :The company reported, total GAAP revenues of $102.4 million in Q1 FY19, compared to $91.3 million in Q1 FY18, beating the analyst estimates of $99.9 million. Subscription revenue was $69.8 million for the Q1 FY19 or up ~15% Y/Y and an increase was driven by strong growth in non-banking solutions up 20% Y/Y while banking solutions growth was flat at 5% Y/Y. Q1 FY 19 settlement network and legal spend revenues were $31.2 million or up ~15% Y/Y and $18.4 million or up ~19% Y/Y, respectively. The company has a strong leadership in both segments and I believe revenues will continue to grow due to strong deal wins and new product releases over the next several quarters. Gross margin increased 30bps to 55.9% and operating margin decreased 240bps to 42.6%, respectively. Gross margin expansion was driven by strong revenue growth from cloud-based offerings and the company expects this trend to continue over the next several quarters. Operating margin detraction was driven by increased costs in Sales & Marketing and R&D, as the company is trying to win new deals and bring new products to the market. The company reported Q1 FY19 non-GAAP net profit and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $13.6 million and $0.33, respectively, in-line with analysts’ consensus EPS estimate of $0.33 and up 16.3% compared to Q1 FY18 numbers.The company also signed $17.4 million of new subs and trans bookings in the quarter, what makes trailing 12 months of $84 million and provides a visibility for strong FY 19 revenue growth. There were also 26 new customer additions in Paymode-X network and, 7 new clients in Legal Spend Management segment. That strongly reflects the sales effectiveness trend with consistent new deal wins over the last several quarters. During the recent quarter, Aite Group named the company as “Best in Class” U.S Cash management provider, based on advanced technology such as machine learning, modern customizable user-interface, and understanding of the industry trends. That award is important as it shows the company’s competitive advantage and strong customer value proposition that will lead to a higher growth of banking transactions segment over the next several quarters.ValuationThe company also provided its full-year FY 19 total revenue and EBITDA guidance of $420 - $425 million and $100 - $102 million, respectively. The analyst consensus estimate for FY 19 is total revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $425.9 million and $1.45, respectively.Shares are now trading at forward P/E and EV/REV multiple of ~34.6x and ~5.5x, respectively. Forward P/E is trading in-line with peers, while EV/REV multiple is trading at a discount compared to the peer group and in-line with SaaS market average EV/REV multiple of ~5x. As a lot of M&A deals of SaaS companies are going at more than 10x revenues, therefore, I believe the current stock price is still slightly undervalued and recent selloff offers a good entry point around $50. In case of any further correction in the stock market, I would “buy the dip” and slowly build up the position.The company has trailing twelve months GAAP gross margin of 56.5% in line with its direct peers, however, trailing twelve months EBITDA margin of 13.2% is well below peer average. The company has been lagging its peers because of costs related to transitioning into the SaaS business model and due to various hefty acquisitions over the last several years. Well, these days are a lot of rumors spreading through the media about an upcoming recession over the next couple of years. In the case of a next recession, the company has a strong, resilient business model as 86% of total revenues are recurring and evenly distributed across various segments and geographies.Bottomline Technologies is still an interesting buy even though the stock has outperformed S&P 500 over the last several years. As the company is trading at a premium forward P/E multiple compared to the S&P 500 forward P/E multiple of ~16x, any business growth slowdown or lower than expected guidance over the next several quarters might be a trigger for a significant decrease in the stock price. The key bullish catalysts are the gradual transition towards a pure SaaS business model with the sticky customer base that has significant customer lifetime value. Another important catalyst is a further market penetration of B2B payments where is an ongoing transition from paper checks to digital solutions what also leads to strong up-sell and cross-sells opportunities. Key risks to my thesis are intensified competition in business payments market, global macro headwinds or a significant slowdown in SaaS revenue growth rate."
178364,22787,2009-12-16T01:32:13-05:00,,"In a market starved for growth stocks, Bottomline Technologies (NASDAQ:EPAY) is an exciting tech-growth story which has just recently been discovered by the market. EPAY markets and provides electronic payment, invoice and document-automation solutions to corporations worldwide. The company’s products help to streamline, automate and manage transactions involving global payments, invoice receipt and approval, collections, cash management and document management. In our view, EPAY reached an important inflection point with its most recent earnings report. More importantly, with a strong and clear plan for growth and a very positive outlook, we feel that the best is yet to come for both the company and its stock. We must admit to being impressed by the confident tone of EPAY’s management team on its latest conference call. While revenues were only up 8% in its most recent quarter, analysts are looking for revenues to grow 9.5% in Q210 and 14.5% in the third quarter. Undoubtedly the biggest reason for management’s optimism stemmed from the impressive earnings and margin expansion EPAY has been able to achieve over the past few quarters. Some of the highlights from this past quarter, Q1, included: Commenting on EPAY’s strong performance in the first quarter of FY2010, president and CEO, Robert Eberle, stated: Looking ahead, EPAY raised its operating profit guidance to $1 a share for FY2010, from its previous outlook of $0.73-$0.75 cents a share. According to Barrington Research analyst, Derek Leckow, this level of profitability had not been expected until the end of 2011. Leckow also stated that EPAY is enjoying a strong secular-growth opportunity due to the transition from paper-based payments and invoicing to electronic-based processes. As we look out to FY2011, analyst estimates were recently increased from $0.84 to $1.17 a share. Based on EPAY’s current rate of growth, we feel these estimates are simply too low and will ultimately be raised to $1.30-$1.40 a share. Ultimately, higher forward estimates, coupled with an expanding multiple, should serve as important catalysts for the stock as we enter the first quarter of 2010.We have been and remain patient buyers of EPAY at current levels, slowly averaging into the position over the past week. After surging from $13 to $18, we continue to believe that the current pullback in price to the $16-$17 range should act as a solid long-term entry. Assuming that the market stays bullish, we can see EPAY working into the low-to-mid $20s within the first half of 2010.EPAY STOP LOSS: $14.95Disclosure: Long EPAY"
1624352,23407,2013-08-09T15:16:46-04:00,,"The market is always shifting and alpha seeking investors are always hunting for the right idea at the right time. One company investors may want to consider is Bottomline Technologies (NASDAQ:EPAY), a small cap software and services company serving financial institutions.In order to get a deeper understanding of the company and catalysts likely to drive shares higher, I reviewed the company's filings, press releases and marketing material. What I discovered is an aggressive software company with a solid offering of products and services targeting the improving banking and insurance industries.By offering software and services that make financial transactions easier and more transparent, Bottomline helps bankers, insurers and others drive customer engagement, reduce expenses and generate bigger sales and profits.The main catalysts supporting Bottomline over the coming year include:Bottomline's BusinessBottomline provides collaborative payment, invoice and document automation solutions to corporations, financial institutions and banks around the world. The company's solutions streamline, automate and manage processes involving payments, invoicing, global cash management, supply chain finance and transactional documents.Bottomline provides products and services to roughly 80 of the Fortune 100 companies and 70 of the FTSE (Financial Times) 100 companies and more than 500 banks use Bottomline's solutions and services worldwide.The story behind demand for Bottomline's solution is compelling.Banks are increasingly pressured by customers to provide fast-to-market solutions. Those solutions often can't be shoe horned into existing, legacy technology systems. Additionally, many of those legacy systems were designed for a single purpose not suited to today's demands. As a result, institutions are increasingly deploying scale-able and flexible systems to reflect next generation demands of business customers. That's bullish for Bottomline, which offers a suite of front-facing, cloud based solutions.The banking industry continues to evolve to meet the needs of mobile and online banking. According to a recent survey by Bottomline competitor ACI Worldwide, 19% of attendees at its 2013 Americas Exchange conference believe adoption of mobile banking would be the biggest trend over the coming six to twelve months. 12% believe the biggest impact industry trend would be banks offering more online bill pay services. Importantly, 27% cited integrating mobile solutions with legacy software would be the biggest obstacle.That presents an interesting opportunity for Bottomline to win business with cloud solutions.""The underlying purpose of our technology - and the substantial investments we're making in our products and our team - is to make it easier to do more business with banks through the digital channel,"" said Norm DeLuca, General Manager of Banking and Financial Services in a recent press release.Those cloud delivered systems offer Bottomline the stability of lucrative recurring revenue streams. Rather than selling install-and-forget systems, these new off premises products give Bottomline an opportunity to capture wallet-share over and over, rather than just once. As a result, Bottomline is increasingly focused on growing the share of subscription based services as a percentage of revenue.In addition to providing banking solutions, Bottomline has also carved out a healthy niche serving insurance companies. Bottomline has built a consulting base of professionals and online software allowing insurers to better track, plan and audit claim related payments to lawyers. That's a big and growing business as insurers try to rein in their legal costs.According to a 2009 article ""Expense spared"" in Post Magazine ""until recently virtually all insurance companies were accepting the bills from their legal advisers with barely any resistance. Comprising work ranging from counter-fraud, dispute resolution, and litigation, legal spend in the insurance industry is big business for law firms."" The article goes on to state 4 in 10 insurers are reviewing how legal services are procured and paid, a trend that likely accelerated over the past three years.That big business means big costs and big opportunity for Bottomline to offer cost saving services. The company claims its legal spend services can save payers 8-15% off their legal bill, a value proposition which helped the company win 32 new customers for the service last year.From Bottomline's website:""One of the major advantages for utilizing Bottomline for the management of our legal expense is our claims staff has more time to perform the job they were hired to do, e.g. investigate, evaluate, and negotiate claims…we have reduced our legal cost during our association with Bottomline. If a company has a need to reduce legal expense, Bottomline is highly recommended."" Cransta Jones, Litigation Manager, IAT Group/Occidental-WilshireFor Bottomline, growth in legal demand spend services is especially attractive because of its predictability and margin friendly leverage.In addition to cloud based banking and legal spending solutions, Bottomline also has high hopes for its Paymode-X, the latest iteration of the Paymode online payments software acquired from Bank of America in 2009.Paymode-X is an intriguing product designed to benefit from the global shift toward online invoicing and payments. The software-as-a-service product provides a more robust report oriented wire payment system that goes beyond traditional paper and ACH services.The shift toward paperless payment is one of the reasons ACH transaction volume increased 4.2% and payments in dollars grew 8.8% last year. In Q1, ACH transactions and dollars grew 2.9% and 6.1% from last year, respectively. But, as the volume has increased so have commercial demand for enhanced tracking, reporting and insight.Bottomline has partnered with Citizens Bank and its parent, Royal Bank of Scotland, and the two firms are already pitching the Paymode-X product to financial institutions worldwide.As more companies shift away from traditional paper invoicing and payment, Paymode-X provides financial institutions with a differentiated non-paper solution to win and grow commercial accounts.By the numbersBottomline's product line appears to be resonating with clients. Last quarter, the company posted record orders as total revenue grew 17% to $64.4 million. Organic growth was 11% higher.Importantly, the company is succeeding in shifting accounts to recurring payments from one time perpetual licenses. Subscription and transaction revenue grew 41% to $28.7 million and recurring revenue increased to $44.8 million, up 27% versus a year ago. This brought recurring revenue to 70% of total sales.""We posted record orders, evidencing the customer demand for our offerings and validating our strategy, and we significantly advanced our strategic plan with important new developments in each of our 3 main growth drivers, legal spend management, Paymode-X and banking technology solutions."" said CEO Robert Eberle.The sales growth helped operating income climb $2.2 million to $10.8 million in the quarter, up 26% from the prior year. This translated into non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.32, up from just $0.11 a year ago and ahead of the company's guidance. Gross margin improved 1% sequentially and 3% from a year ago to 58%. Bottomline believes it can eventually notch gross margins north of 60%.Last quarter's strength is likely to continue through year end, thanks to a record book-to-bill ratio of 1.46 and thanks to a 65% increase in orders from a year ago.""Third quarter, Bottomline posted record orders of $94 million. That isn't just a record, it's over $20 million more than any orders number we've recorded in any quarter in the company's history,"" said Mr. Eberle.Those orders brought the company's backlog to $121.6 million, up 45%. For comparison, Bottomline's backlog was $84.7 million in 2011.The order strength comes in part from increased penetration into the regional bank market. Six regional banks inked deals with Bottomline for digital solutions and online cash management services in the quarter. Additionally, 2 existing global bank customers chose to expand their relationship during the quarter.The legal spend also saw solid growth with Bottomline signing on 8 new clients including Endurance Specialty Insurance, Munich Re, New Jersey Manufacturers and American Integrity Insurance.Bottomline also suggested its partnership with Citizens Bank and its parent Royal Bank of Scotland is off to a good start. The partnership involves co-marketing Bottomline's Paymode-X vendor payment platform as a solution for enhancing banks settlement capability. Bottomline expects 2 or 3 customer wins by the end of the current quarter.The early 2013 success builds on a solid 2012, a year in which revenue climbed 18% to $224 million and core operating income improved 10% to $40.4 million.The 2012 growth was widespread.Payments & transactions revenue improved to $101.4 million from $97.2 million in 2011. Payments & transaction sales were $93.3 million in 2010.Banking solutions saw sales climb from $34.7 million in 2010 to $51.3 million in 2011 and $58.4 million in 2012. The outsourced solutions segment, which includes legal spend and Paymode-X, has seen sales improve to $64.4 million from $40.9 million and $29.8 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.Bottomline got 68% of its sales in the U.S. last year. 29% came from the United Kingdom. And, another 1.5% came from Asia Pacific. However, in absolute terms, Asia Pacific sales grew to $3.3 million from just $1.8 million in 2010.The Intuit acquisition integration continues this year.To ramp up the company's cloud-based offering, Bottomline bought Intuit's commercial banking business in 2012. The troubled business came at a good price, but not without headaches.Intuit unloaded the operation recognizing demands from its 500 customers would require substantial spending on upgrades. Nearly 20% of its customers had already announced they'd be leaving Intuit's product. So, Bottomline acquired a troubled business with an attrition headwind.""It is a natural headwind that we have as we go forward over the next couple of quarters. And that headwind was what we expected at the time of acquisition, it's just occurring a bit later than we had originally planned, because we've had more success in keeping those costumers on longer than originally indicated,"" said Mr. Eberle.But, the company believes the headwind is being overcome as it works to improve the customer service and systems. If so, the business may stabilize and provide the desired growth from smaller regional banks. That business is important given Bottomline's legacy client base is mostly large, global banks.The Final TakeBottomline has 216 sales and marketing people worldwide, positioning it nicely to grow its financial services oriented client base. If Europe's banking industry stabilizes and improves, demand for next generation software should pick up. And, new markets like those in Asia Pacific could offer growth too.Given the ongoing shift away from paper to electronic, and the rising adoption of off-site, cloud based solutions; Bottomline appears to have the right products at the right time. If Bottomline gets client growth from Paymode-X alongside ongoing wins in banking and insurance, the next year could be quite strong. That's evidenced by Bottomline's full year guidance for $254 million in sales and $1.24 in earnings per share.If so, the company will be able to do more shareholder friendly buybacks -- like the $20 million authorized in Q4, 2012. A combination of the right products at the right time suggests Bottomline may reward investors with alpha over the coming year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in EPAY over the next 72 hours.

3983867,52382,2016-06-23T10:21:36-04:00,"Well positioned to monetize the changing digital payment processing space.Transition to the SaaS-based revenue model has negatively impacted the growth, margins and stock, but the impact seems short term in nature.Post correction, expectations and valuation look reasonable, whether the business stands alone or gets acquired.","Bottomline Technologies (NASDAQ:EPAY) seems to be suffering from the problems usually associated with any business model in transition, but it should be comforting that once the transition is complete, the changing business model should offer high growth with visibility, something that usually commands a better trading multiple from investors.Since my previous note on the name, the stock is down almost 15% compared to a flattish market, failing to deliver on the promise offered by this B-to-B electronic payment network and digital banking solutions provider. The stock is bearing the negative impact of the revenue model changing from selling licenses to SaaS based, which in turn led to a negative impact on the profitability that is expected to last till 2017. The difficult market conditions did not allow investors to appreciate the long-term potential for the business to create value for the shareholders from this transition. But the pessimism surrounding the name is ignoring the fundamentals that are pointing towards good market demand and strong visibility, as evident from strong annual recurring revenue (ARR) trends and growing subscription and transactions.A business model in transitionInvestors of all hues may be happy of the eventual destination - the SaaS-based revenue model - but the concern is the transition period. At the beginning of the fiscal year, the company announced moving all digital banking products that are sold to the banks of all sizes to the subscription-based revenue model as part of a strategic plan to focus on and drive subscription and transaction revenues that constitute almost 57% of the total revenue right now. The new model coincided with the launch of the new digital banking 3.0 product set, which is driving strong interest from customers.Because the revenues are deferred until the customer goes live, while the expenses of services are recorded when they are provided, there is a short-term negative impact on the P&L, more so if the shift is combined with strong demand. The company, during the latest quarterly results, reduced guidance due to the business model transition and the three large new business wins in the digital banking business. As the expenses associated with the new business awards increased, margins also took a hit since a SaaS sale compared to a license sale has a negative impact on the margins on the first two years. Because a multi-million-dollar revenue stream, post implementation, is highly profitable, predictable and may last more than a decade, forsaking the first few years of profitability still makes sense.The long thesis intactThe fragmented payment processing and transaction banking industry is changing, and Bottomline with its cloud-based digital banking, fraud prevention, payment, financial document, insurance and healthcare solutions is one of the better-positioned players to monetize it.Excluding the digital banking business, which is undergoing a transition, the revenues are growing at a decent double-digit rate, 14% on a constant-currency basis during the most recent quarter. Even below the top line, subscription and transaction revenues grew 15% and ARR year-to-date was up 73%, with total bookings for the quarter up 39%. There were 24 new wins for Paymode­-X while the legal spend management business saw nine new wins.In the meantime, EPAY has probably the cleanest balance sheet in the space, with net debt of around $20 million versus much larger debt for peers like ACI Worldwide (NASDAQ:ACIW), Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) and Fidelity National (NYSE:FIS), which should work in favor of the company, in case consolidation heats up in the space."

However, red flags appear when a firm sacrifices profitability to join the cloud and transitions to a business model with negative margins. Add in significant competition and an overvalued stock price and investors should be running for the hills. Nevertheless, this stock is up 20% over the past two years. Bottomline Technologies (NASDAQ:EPAY) is in the Danger Zone this week.Profitless Revenue Growth Doesn't Create Shareholder ValueSince 2011, Bottomline Technologies' after-tax profit (NOPAT) has declined by 21% compounded annually to $3 million in 2016 and -$2 million over the last 12 months (TTM). This deterioration in profits occurred despite revenue growing 13% compounded annually during the same period, per Figure 1. Revenue growth means very little if the business cannot convert it to meaningful profits.Figure 1: Profits Decline Amidst Impressive Revenue GrowthSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsThe issues do not end with declining NOPAT. Bottomline's NOPAT margin has fallen from 5% in 2011 to -1% TTM while the company has burned through a cumulative $240 million in free cash flow (FCF) over the past five years. Across multiple key metrics, Bottomline's business is showing significant signs of deterioration.Destructive Acquisitions Cannot Be OverlookedOver the past five years, Bottomline Technologies has acquired 19 separate companies at a cost of over $361 million. Management touted the importance of the acquisitions to revenue growth and growing the business as a whole. While these acquisitions appear to be accretive (to EPS), due to the high-low fallacy, more rigorous research reveals these acquisitions did little to earn a quality return on invested capital. Bottomline's ROIC has fallen from 5% in 2011 to a bottom-quintile 0% TTM. Management must be held accountable for its capital allocation decisions. Per Figure 2 below, it's clear Bottomline's acquisitions have been a poor use of capital and led to the decline in the firm's overall ROIC.Figure 2: Acquisitions Fail To Earn A Quality ReturnSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsCompensation Plan Incentivizes Destructive AcquisitionsMisaligned executive compensation plans help line the pockets of executives at the expense of shareholders. Bottomline Technologies' executive compensation plan, apart from base salary, rewards executives for meeting revenue and non-GAAP operating income targets. Each of these metrics does not align executive interests with those of shareholders.As shown in Figure 1, Bottomline Technologies has been able to grow revenue, largely through acquisitions, and meet the bonus goal. At the same time, non-GAAP operating income conveniently excludes expenses such as acquisition and integration-related costs and restructuring expenses, which are quite meaningful for a firm that's done 19 acquisitions in five years. Ultimately, Bottomline is able to meet revenue goals through acquisition, and by excluding key costs related to acquisitions also meet non-GAAP operating income goals.As we've demonstrated through multiple case studies, ROIC, not revenue or non-GAAP income, is the primary driver of shareholder value creation. Without major changes to this compensation plan, preferably to emphasize shareholder-creation-friendly metrics (e.g. ROIC), investors should expect further value destruction while management continues to get big payouts.Non-GAAP Metrics Mask Economic RealityNon-GAAP metrics should be a red flag for investors because they often mask the true economics of the business. Bottomline Technologies uses non-GAAP metrics such as ""core net income"" and adjusted EBITDA to ""better represent the business."" We can agree that these metrics ""better"" represent the business in that they make the firm look profitable when it is, in fact, losing money, but these metrics are certainly not more accurate. Below are some of the expenses EPAY removes to calculate its non-GAAP metrics:These adjustments have a significant impact on the disparity between GAAP net income, ""core net income"" and economic earnings. In 2016, EPAY removed over $30 million in stock-based compensation expense (9% of 2016 revenue) to calculate ""core net income."" This adjustment allowed Bottomline Technologies to report ""core net income"" of $58 million,"" compared to -$20 million GAAP net income and -$28 million economic earnings, per Figure 3.Figure 3: Disconnect Between Non-GAAP And Economic EarningsSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsLagging Profitability In A Fragmented IndustryBottomline Technologies provides cloud-based business payment, digital banking, fraud prevention and financial document services. Ultimately, Bottomline facilitates the transfer of money between businesses and vendors. EPAY faces competition from many different angles, including firms that offer ""one-stop solutions"" and those that provide more customizable services that facilitate only one subset of payment transactions. Competitors include Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), Fiserv Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV), American Express (NYSE:AXP), NCR Corporation (NYSE:NCR), Infosys (NYSE:INFY) and even ACH capabilities offered by banks, such as direct deposit and money transfers. Per Figure 4 below, Bottomline Technologies lags the profitability of its peers within this fragmented industry.Most notably, the firms with the highest profitability in the industry are those that have business lines apart from payment facilitation. Firms such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Wells Fargo, and American Express each have NOPAT margins above 18% and can support payment processing through resources derived from main business lines. Bottomline Technologies, on the other hand, with its -1% margin, faces significant competitive disadvantages without a profitable segment to bolster its payment services.Figure 4: Bottomline Technologies' Bottom Barrel ProfitabilitySources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsBull Hopes Rest On Profitable Cloud TransitionAs noted above, the transition to the cloud and subscription-based revenues has not been a profitable venture for Bottomline Technologies. We've covered many unprofitable cloud companies in previous Danger Zone reports. Bottomline is unique in that prior to its transition to subscription-based products, the firm was able to generate positive NOPAT, albeit a small one.In transitioning to the cloud, EPAY prioritized revenue growth in hopes that investors would put faith in the firm's ability to regain profitability sometime in the future. However, as shown in Figure 5 below, this profitability seems far off, if not impossible.Per Figure 5, Bottomline Technologies' operating expenses are growing faster than revenues. Product development and engineering, sales and marketing, and general and administrative costs have grown 17%, 16% and 13% compounded annually, respectively since 2011. Meanwhile, revenue has grown only 13% compounded annually over the same time period.Figure 5: Costs Outpace Revenue GrowthSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsThese rising costs undermine any revenue growth EPAY has achieved through acquisition or organically. Soaring costs, industry-lagging margins and the poor executive compensation structure outlined above make it rather hard to keep the faith that EPAY will return to profitability anytime soon.Making matters worse, any bull case rests on the hope that EPAY will not only return to profitability but earn significant market share and grow profits at unrealistic growth rates, as we'll show below.EPAY Is Already Priced To PerfectionDespite deterioration in business fundamentals, EPAY is up 20% over the past two years, which outpaces the S&P 500, which is up only 13%. The significant price increase without a subsequent improvement in the business's cash flow leaves EPAY priced to perfection.To justify its current price of $25/share, EPAY must achieve NOPAT margins of 5% (highest ever achieved by firm in 2011, compared to -1% TTM) and grow revenue by 13% compounded annually for the next 14 years. In this scenario, Bottomline would be generating nearly $2 billion in revenue (14 years from now), which is greater than the combined revenue of competitors ACI Worldwide (NASDAQ:ACIW) and NICE Systems (NASDAQ:NICE) from Figure 4 and greater than Jack Henry & Associates (NASDAQ:JKHY) fiscal 2016 revenue. In other words, the expectations baked into the stock price imply EPAY taking significant market share moving forward.Even if we assume EPAY can achieve 5% NOPAT margins and grow revenue by a more realistic rate of 9% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is worth only $11/share today - a 56% downside. Each of these scenarios also assumes EPAY is able to grow revenue and NOPAT/free cash flow without spending on working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create very optimistic scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations in the current valuation are. For reference, EPAY's invested capital has grown on average $38 million (11% of 2016 revenue) per year over the last 10 years.Is EPAY Worth Acquiring?The largest risk to our bear thesis is what we call ""stupid money risk,"" which means an acquirer comes in and pays for EPAY at the current, or higher, share price despite the stock being significantly overvalued. Accordingly, we only see an acquisition as possible if an acquiring firm is willing to destroy substantial shareholder value.Below, we show just how expensive EPAY remains after assuming an acquirer can gain significant synergies.To begin, EPAY has liabilities of which investors may not be aware that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest.After adjusting for these liabilities, we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, EPAY is worth less than the current share price.Figures 6 and 7 show what we think Fiserv should pay for Bottomline Technologies to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. Adding Bottomline Technologies could bolster Fiserv's payments and banking services. However, there are limits on how much FISV would pay for EPAY to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT of free cash flows being acquired.Each implied price is based on a ""goal ROIC"" assuming different levels of revenue growth. In each scenario, the estimated revenue growth rate in year one and two equals the consensus estimate for 2017 (2%) and 2018 (8%). For the subsequent years, we use 8% in scenario one because it represents a continuation of 2018 expectations. We use 14% in scenario two because it assumes a merger with FISV could create revenue growth through cross-selling platform opportunities.We conservatively assume that Fiserv can grow Bottomline Technologies' revenue and NOPAT without spending on working capital or fixed assets. We also assume EPAY immediately achieves a 9% NOPAT margin, which is the average of EPAY's and FISV's TTM NOPAT margins. For reference, EPAY's TTM NOPAT margin is -1%, so this assumption implies immediate improvement and allows the creation of a truly best-case scenario.Figure 6: Implied Acquisition Prices For FISV To Achieve 6% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsFigure 6 shows the ""goal ROIC"" for FISV as its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) or 6%. Even if Bottomline Technologies can grow revenue by 10% compounded annually with a 9% NOPAT margin for the next five years, the firm is worth less than its current price of $25/share. It's worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 9% ROIC would be only value neutral and not accretive, as the return on the deal would equal FISV's WACC.Figure 7: Implied Acquisition Prices For FISV To Achieve 12% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsFigure 7 shows the next ""goal ROIC"" of 12%, which is FISV's current ROIC. Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to FISV shareholders. Even in the best-case growth scenario, the most FISV should pay for EPAY is $7/share (72% downside). Even assuming this best-case scenario, FISV would destroy just over $880 million by purchasing EPAY at its current valuation. Any scenario assuming less than 10% CAGR in revenue would result in further capital destruction for FISV.Fundamentals Matter: Investors Tire of Profitless Revenue GrowthDuring stock rally's, such as the recent ""Trump Rally"" stock valuations can often soar to levels that are simply unjustified by the underlying economics of the business. When these rallies end, investors are left holding overvalued firms with poor fundamentals. The stocks with the worst fundamentals are discarded accordingly.As the Trump Rally comes to an end, the time to evaluate EPAY on its fundamentals has arrived. As shown above, those fundamentals do not justify the current valuation, and even in the best-case scenarios, the stock faces significant downside.Something as simple as an earnings miss could be a catalyst for the market to re-evaluate EPAY. We've seen competitor ACI Worldwide, placed in the Danger Zone in June 2016, fall 10% since we published our report (compared to S&P up 9%) as revenue failed to meet expectations in two consecutive quarters.The same fate could befall EPAY as investors tire of the constant revenue growth the subscription model generates and begin to hold management accountable for the lack of profits at the firm.Insider Action and Short Interest Is MinimalOver the past 12 months, 312,000 insider shares have been purchased and 247,000 have been sold for a net effect of 65,000 insider shares purchased. These sales represent less than 1% of shares outstanding. Additionally, there are 2.4 million shares sold short, or 6% of shares outstanding.Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic AccountingIn order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital and a real shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to Bottomline Technologies' 2016 10-K:Income Statement: we made $25 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing $23 million in non-operating expense (7% of revenue). We removed $1 million related to non-operating income and $24 million related to non-operating expenses. See all the adjustments made to EPAY's income statement here.Balance Sheet: We made $238 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $20 million. The most notable adjustment was $38 million (7% of reported net assets) related to other comprehensive income. See all adjustments to EPAY's balance sheet here.Valuation: We made $355 million of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $133 million. The largest adjustment to shareholder value was $199 million in total debt, which includes $26 million in off-balance-sheet operating leases. This lease adjustment represents 3% of EPAY's market cap.Dangerous Funds That Hold EPAYThe following funds receive our Dangerous-or-worse rating and allocate significantly to Bottomline Technologies.This article originally published here on January 16, 2017.Disclosure: David Trainer, Kyle Guske II, and Kyle Martone receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme."
10841,20182,2006-05-18T02:43:57-04:00,,"From Insider Score: Director Selling On Weakness: The co-founder and chairman of Bottomline Technologies (NASDAQ:EPAY) sold almost 30% of his holdings after the company reported poor first-quarter financials that resulted in three analyst downgrades. Dan McGurl sold 100K shares of EPAY at an average price of $11.08 on May 12th, dropping his holdings in the company to about 235.8K shares. McGurl previously sold 100K shares at an average price of $11.53 on February 1st, and he has exercised options on and immediately sold 107.5K shares this year. Following EPAY's 1999 initial public offering, McGurl owned just under a 15% stake in the company. EPAY provide software that automates the financial transactions and financial reporting for businesses, enabling payments and collections. McGurl, a former executive at State Street Bank and IBM (NYSE:IBM), and James Loomis, a former executive at Nashua Corp. (NSHA), founded the company in 1989. EPAY went public at $13.00 per share in February 1999, and the stock closed that year more than 175% higher at $36.00. While EPAY initially weathered the NASDAQ crash, the stock slid into an abyss by April 2001, falling as low as $2.00. More recently, shares of EPAY re-based above the $10.00 mark in December 2004, trading as high as $18.62 last July, before falling to an 18-month low of $9.64 on April 19th. For the most recent quarter (fiscal Q3, ended March 31st, 2006), EPAY reported a loss of -$2.7M, or -9 cents per share, swinging from a year-ago profit of $1.8M, or 9 cents EPS. Costs related to the company's acquisition of Visibillity, Inc., a provider of legal e-billing solutions specializing in the insurance industry, as well as stock-based compensation, ate away at EPAY's profits, which excluding items, came in at 5 cents per share. Analysts, however, were expecting adjusted earnings of 9 cents per share, and EPAY's modest 1.6% revenue growth, to $24.9M, left the company short of Wall Street's consensus. As a result of earnings, three research firms downgraded EPAY. DA Davidson took the stock from a ""buy"" to ""neutral,"" while Stanford Group dropped the name from ""buy"" to ""hold."" Needham, meanwhile, revised its rating on EPAY from ""strong buy"" to ""hold,"" saying that sales were slower than expected and that it now expects revenue to be flat sequentially and earnings to stall at 5 cents per share for the next ""several quarters."" In a rare admission from a research shop, Needham said its ""strong buy"" rating, which was put on the stock in January, was ""ill-timed"" and that its models forecasting revenue growth based on EPAY's shift towards subscription-based products (i.e., recurring revenue) were too aggressive. Interestingly, Needham's original upgrade of EPAY came after the stock sold off in the wake of fiscal Q2 earnings, and the firm's analyst seemed to chastise investors, saying that the reaction to the company's new strategy, which would limit near-term growth, was ""misinformation at best and outright panic at worst."
9190,20140,2006-04-19T13:11:58-04:00,,"Bottomline Technologies (NASDAQ:EPAY) revised guidance down yesterday, saying that the first calendar quarter of the year, their fiscal third quarter, would come in at $24.5 to $25 million. Media reports indicate that Wall Street expected over $27 million. The company provides software products and services for financial process solutions across a broad range of industries.
Investors have to go back a quarter to find the really perplexing news. When the company announced results for its quarter ending December 31, 2005, the top line was $26.1 million up from $24 million a year earlier. But, expenses went up and income from operations fell to $546,000 from $1,111,000 the previous year.



Buried a bit in those numbers was the fact that Bottomline's highest margin business, software licensing, was shrinking. Revenue in that area went from $5.4 million in the 2004 quarter to $3.6 million in 2005. Cost of revenue on this line item only runs about 12%. Margins in the equipment and supply part of the business, where revenue was flat for the quarter, are only 20%, so COR is 80%. The company's largest business, service and maintenance, is growing, but cost of revenue there is 42%.
Bottomline seems to be expanding the wrong business.
The company says it is making a transition to a subscription-based revenue model, and this could have an impact on revenue recognition. The company has also made a couple of acquisitions recently, but they do not seem to be having much of an effect on top line. The company has about $90 million in the bank, so the balance sheet is not an issue.
The stock has put the big hurt on investors, dropping from $18.62, the 52-week high, to below $11. If Bottomline does not come up with some good news soon, $11 could be a ceiling and not a floor.

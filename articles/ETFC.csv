Source: CrunchbaseAccording to a market research report by Absolute Reports, the financial wellness market was valued at $1.4 billion in 2018 and is expected to reach $2.2 billion by the end of 2024.This represents a forecast CAGR of 9.1% between 2019 and 2024.The Asia-Pacific region will account for more market share in the following years, especially in China; also fast growing India and Southeast Asia regions.Major vendors that provide financial wellness solutions include:Source: SentieoETFC disclosed the acquisition price and terms as ‘a base purchase price of approximately $30 million in cash.’With the addition of the word ‘base,’ it is likely there may be an earnout provision, although it’s possible this could just refer to normal closing adjustments.ETFC didn’t file a form 8-K or provide a change in financial guidance as a result of the small transaction.A review of the firm’s most recent published financial results indicate that as of September 30, 2019, the firm had cash and equivalents of $493 million and $3.5 billion in non-deposit or customer liabilities, of which long-term debt was $1.4 billion.Free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was $852 million.In the past 12 months, ETFC’s stock price has dropped 1.5% vs. the U.S. Capital Markets industry’s rise of 19.9% and the overall U.S. Market’s growth of 17.8%, as the chart and corporate events graphic indicates below:Source: Simply Wall StreetEarnings surprises versus analyst consensus estimates have been positive in eleven of the last twelve quarters, as the chart shows below:Source: Seeking AlphaAnalyst sentiment in recent earnings calls has dropped markedly from Q1 2019’s result, as the linguistic analysis shows here:Source: SentieoBelow is a table of relevant capitalization and valuation figures for the company:Source: Company FinancialsBelow is an estimated DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) analysis of the firm’s projected growth and earnings:Assuming the above general DCF parameters, the firm’s shares would be valued at approximately $56.90 versus the current price of $45.63, indicating the stock is currently potentially undervalued, with the given assumptions of the DCF.ETFC acquired Gradifi on a likely ‘buy vs. build’ calculation which will enable them to gain a suite of products they can go to market quickly with while having minimal integration risk.As ETFC stated in the deal announcement,With the deal for Gradifi, ETFC also gains student loan refinancing marketplace with seller First Republic Bank remaining as a participant in that marketplace.Student loan debt has ballooned to more than $1.5 trillion according to reports, so if employers can offer services to help employees reduce or refinance their debt, that’s a win for the employer and for ETFC.ETFC can likely scale Gradifi’s offerings to a much larger user base, so the deal makes great sense from a growth potential standpoint as well as from its relatively low price.As a stock, ETFC is indicating some potential value at its current level. The DCF above shows it is undervalued.Additionally, an NYU Stern School basket of publicly held firms (January 2019 data) shows that brokerages and investment banks had an EV/Sales multiple of 5.56x versus ETFC’s current multiple of 3.45x.While the comparison is not exact due to a likely higher multiple for investment banks, ETFC may be a bargain at its current level, assuming it can reignite growth in 2020.Given its valuation, my bias is BULLISH at ETFC's current price of $45.00 per share."
4341014,105417,2020-04-29T12:54:07-04:00,"Despite volatility in March, ETFC delivered solid quarterly results which proved the viability of Morgan Stanley's transaction.
        Trading revenue was exceptionally strong during the first quarter, despite some margin pressures.
        Going forward, we believe that fractional trading may become an importance revenue source for the company.","Morgan Stanley announced its acquisition of E-Trade (ETFC) on February 20, when the stock market was at its all time-high. Days later - literally, on February 24 - a coronavirus-related rout began, with the market ultimately plunging ~35% by March 23, while E-Trade shares plunged approximately 50% during the same time period. At that point, some questioned the wisdom of Morgan Stanley's deal, seeing timing as terrible. However, as time went by and some dust settled, we now actually see that ETFC was quite an attractive transaction. As always, it is important to have a long run perspective when thinking about M&A. However, the recent ETFC earnings print indicates that the short run is not so bad either. E*TRADE Financial Corp is an online broker platform that allows consumers to place electronic trades, focusing on a wide variety of products: from stocks, futures, EFS and options to mutual funds, cryptocurrency, and various fixed-income investments. In addition to making money on transaction fees, the company earns revenue on margin lending and cash management services. The company's core competitors are Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, and Interactive Brokers, among others, with Schwab purchasing Ameritrade in 2019. It was only a matter of time before someone acquired ETFC, and we argued in our November 29 article that the company needed to differentiate itself in order to stand out in this narrowing field. Heightened Volatility Boosted Trading Revenue: ETFC saw above-average trading activity in late January and late February, in addition to benefitting from March - arguably, one of he most volatile months in the history of the stock market. Average daily trading revenue was $652K, which represented an increase of 129% Y/Y and nearly 100% on a quarter/quarter basis.Commissions and Fees Also Up Substantially in 1Q: Similar to trading revenue, 1Q20 commissions came in at $71 MM, growing sequentially by $15 MM. In addition, fees (which include service charges) were at $203 MM, up more than $20 MM sequentially. Once again: the first quarter was a fortuitous opportunity for E-Trade to prove itself as a viable acquisition target, particularly in this age of coronavirus uncertainty.Bottom Line Pressures Expected, But Less Important Post-Acquisition: While the margin decreased more than 500 bps Y/Y, at present SG&A and other expenses matter only to the extent they are integrated within Morgan Stanley's corporate platform. We expect anywhere between 3,000-5,000 ETFC employees to be ultimately laid off during the integration; however, will look forward for MS to provide more details.Fractional Share Pricing: Since retail commissions were largely eliminated by most trading shops in 2019, we reiterate that in the next few years fractional trading will become a profitable opportunity for E-Trade and others. Having fractional trading under the umbrella of Morgan Stanley would make it a more powerful platform, versus Interactive Brokers and Schwab. Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Growth Stands to Benefit: As far as the timing is concerned, these solid quarter results indicate that Morgan Stanley's retail clients will remain strong beneficiaries of this deal, triggering greater share of deposits and thus diversifying the bank's revenue segments. Recall that combined platforms will have $3.1 trillion of client assets, 8.2 MM retail client relationships, as well as 4.6MM stock plan participants. Dividend Yield Better at MS: With E-Trade's and Morgan Stanley's dividend yields standing at 1.5% and 3.5%, respectively, we expect ETFC shareholders to receive a better deal with Morgan Stanley's capital return.Valuation: Since ETFC was acquired by Morgan Stanley, we are not providing a valuation. Our rating is Neutral.We see the following four core risks:Macro risks: Should the recession unfold in the next 1-3 years, we should see meaningful decrease in trading volume from ETFC's key partners.Cyber attacks are always key in the trading business, as disruptions happen, on average, every 45 days. ETFC and its competitors frequently discuss annual increases in their technology budgets as a way of boosting cybersecurity.Interest rate risk is vital, since the company invests in interest-earning assets.Default risk is a rare event but (particularly in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis) is a real possibility, even from a large institution. It is our understanding that even the regulatory controls currently in place, such as Dodd-Frank, are not enough to prevent it."
4309766,105417,2019-11-29T12:36:29-05:00,"In the aftermath of the Charles-Schwab-Ameritrade merger, E-Trade needs to find its footing.
        With retail commissions eliminated, we believe that the years 2020-21 will become the year of fractional shares.
        Strong corporate services and international opportunities are also key.","E-Trade is in a difficult place. It had to adopt zero commission fees in a pricing competition that it didn't initiate. Furthermore, it has just seen its closest rival, Ameritrade, acquired by Charles Schwab in what is about to result in a $5.1 trillion conglomerate of wealth. On another hand, there may be an opportunity here, as E-Trade can redefine itself and morph into a company with a new profile. Below, we briefly summarize the company's business and remind readers of our valuation. We then discuss six reasons that could help E-Trade stand out. E*TRADE Financial Corp (ETFC) is an online broker platform that allows consumers to place electronic trades, focusing on a wide variety of products: from stocks, futures, EFS and options to mutual funds, cryptocurrency, and various fixed-income investments. In addition to making money on transaction fees, the company earns revenue on margin lending and cash management services. The company's core competitors are Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, and Interactive Brokers, among others.ETFC has a vast comps group, which ranges from online brokers to various money management firms, which have an average 2020 P/E multiple of 16x. When we apply it to our EPS estimate of $3.25, which already incorporates the impact from reduced fees (we note that not everyone on the Street has this impact in their numbers, hence our estimate is below that of consensus), we get the target price of $52.Introduce Tax Services: Many brokerage firms famously refuse to discuss taxation matters and thus essentially forego a potential revenue stream. We believe that by linking investment and taxation services under the brokerage umbrella ETFC can fill a void and differentiate itself within this market. Fractional Share Pricing: With retail commissions eliminated, we believe that the years 2020-21 will become the year of fractional shares. An opportunity to establish competitive pricing there may provide the entrant with a meaningful advantage. Acceleration of Corporate Services: This segment was never strong at ETFC, so the company would be prudent to invest accordingly and improve the value proposition, particularly for accounts above $5 MM. Specifically, the integration of Ameritrade into Charles Schwab is likely to create some entropy around corporate accounts in the short run, which could be an opportunity for a competitor to capitalize on and perhaps make a dent in the market share. International Markets: We’ve always believed that retail trading is under-penetrated in Western Europe. An opportunity to expand there organically or via a mid-sized acquisition cannot be underestimated.Continue With Buybacks: Recall that E-Trade bought back $566 MM in shares during 3Q, with $1.5 billion program as the latest authorization. We note that commission cuts may slow free cash flow generation in the near term, but we do not expect the buyback activity to be impacted. We anticipate about $200-250 MM in quarterly buybacks for 2020, with the authorization further increased by mid-year. Such strong buybacks activity will meaningfully differentiate E-Trade against Charles Schwab, since most of the latter's free cash flows have been channeled into the Ameritrade acquisition and there may not be as much room for capital return. Partnership with Ameritrade?: This is not a far-fetched proposal but with Ameritrade now soon to be under Schwab’s umbrella, there are various back end and technology ways and means for E-Trade and Ameritrade to collaborate. We expect Ameritrade to retain its brand which would make such partnership more feasibleWe see the following four core risks to our thesis.Macro risks. Should the recession unfold in the next 1-3 years, we should see meaningful decrease in trading volume from ETFC's key partners.Cyber attacks are always key in the trading business, as disruptions happen, on average, every 45 days. ETFC and its competitors frequently discuss annual increases in their technology budgets as a way of boosting cybersecurity.Interest rate risk is vital, since the company invests in interest-earning assets.Default risk is a rare event but (particularly in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis) is a real possibility, even from a large institution.

4307018,105417,2019-11-15T11:43:36-05:00,"Continued volatility provides upside to the company's top-line.Customer cash growth to remain strong, supported by recent selling.Share buyback activity remains on track, with authorization likely to go up by mid-2020.","E*TRADE Financial Corp (ETFC) is an online broker platform that allows consumers to place electronic trades, focusing on a wide variety of products: from stocks, futures, EFS and options to mutual funds, cryptocurrency, and various fixed-income investments.

Data shows that the number of shares changing hands has been 15-18% Y/Y higher annually in 2018-19 than it has been in 2017, and we expect this trend to continue.Corporate Services Business to Grow in Double Digits: We estimate an average growth of 11% for the Corporate Services business, which is ETFC's crown jewel, in our opinion. Independent of retail trading, this segment should continue to provide a solid upside both in terms of the top line, as well as on the margin side.Customer Cash Growth to Remain Strong: As of Q3, ETFC had total customer cash and deposits ending the quarter at $65 billion, with approximately 5% sequential quarterly growth. Further, margin balances held up well with $9.9 billion of quarterly average.Buybacks Remain On Track: The company did $566 MM in share buybacks during 3Q, with $1.5 billion program as the latest authorization. We note that commission cuts may slow free cash flow generation in the near term, but we do not expect the buyback activity to be impacted. We anticipate about $200-250 MM in quarterly buybacks for 2020, with the authorization further increased by mid-year.Management Clearly Unhappy About Zero Commissions: It is important to emphasize that ETFC was not the leader in the zero retail commissions pricing war. Furthermore, we believe the company found itself unprepared to manage this shock to the top line, even though during the earnings call it tried to put on the best face: ""While we did not favor this shift, we believe it enhances our competitive position in our core retail franchise. In this new paradigm, platform, functionality and customer experience are more important than ever."" We note that the impact from losing retail commissions for online stocks, ETFs, and options is approximately $300 million per year for ETTC.2020 May Become About Fractional Shares: Similar to what we've been voicing about Ameritrade, we expect fractional shares to become a hot-button issue in the near term and could also help determine who emerges as the key market share winner. As we stated in the past, we expect all trading players to eventually adopt fractional shares, with pricing within 1-3 bps of each other.We see the following four core risks to our thesis.Macro risks. Should the recession unfold in the next 1-3 years, we should see meaningful decrease in trading volume from ETFC's key partners.Cyber attacks are always key in the trading business, as disruptions happen, on average, every 45 days.

4297496,22717,2019-10-20T17:30:29-04:00,"I wrote a report on E-Trade on Sept. 16, 2019, right before the whole discount industry decided to zero out commissions. I wanted to provide some thoughts on E-Trade since then.I reviewed the company's recent earnings, despite the lack of a 10-Q filing. Most of what I originally wrote about in September is still intact. In essence, it remains a bargain.Management still seems committed to its $1.5 billion stock buyback program next year. The lack of commission revenue will hurt, but they have a plan to cut costs.At 10.5x earnings and a 14-15% return on equity, the stock still looks attractive. Moreover, its total yield (dividend yield plus buyback yield) is now over 17.5%.","I wanted to take some time after the discount industry decided to eliminate their commission revenue lines after I had just recently written up E-Trade (ETFC) on Sept. 16, 2019.I believe the market has adjusted to lower revenue for the company after ETFC's recent Q3 conference call on Oct. 17, 2019. In fact, a Wolfe Research analyst just raised his rating on ETFC with an Outperform Rating. Even though I am still waiting for the 10-Q to be released, I wanted to put out my thoughts on ETFC.In essence, my previous thesis that ETFC is a bargain stock with a huge catalyst - the $1.5 billion buyback program, along with the dividend - remains intact.The total yield, in fact, is now over 17.5%. Total yield is the addition of the dividend yield, 1.37%, plus the buyback yield of 16.19% (i.e., $1.5 billion divided by the market value of $9.265 billion).Moreover, the stock remains cheap at 10.45x earnings for 2019 and 11.69x earnings for 2020, according to consensus analysts' estimates measured by Seeking Alpha.As I mentioned, the 10-Q is not yet released, although it likely will be next week. But the CEO indicated that the share repurchases were quite large during Q3:Source: Q3 Conference CallThis was slightly higher than the previous quarters - $222 million in Q2 and $120 million in Q1. Keep in mind that ETFC bought back $1.139 billion in shares last year. And I showed in my previous article that ETFC had $375 million remaining in its existing $1 billion buyback program.So now ETFC spent 191 million this quarter towards its $1.5 billion buybacks this coming year (i.e., $566 million less $375 million). Of the $1.309 billion remaining in the $1.5 billion buyback program, ETFC could repurchase $436 million each quarter over the next three quarters.That seems doable since there will be a $100 million+ in lower commissions flowing into cash flow each quarter. However, management indicated it would dramatically cut expenses in order to lessen the impact of that lower revenue on its cash flow.Later on in the call, management seemed to indicate there would be some conditions in which it might slow down the buybacks, whilst staying on course for $1.5 billion over the year:Source: Same as aboveThis shows that management expects rates to continue to fall. But if rates rise and it seems prudent to ""grow the balance sheet"" - and by that, they mean net interest-bearing assets - then there might be a slowdown in buyback activity. That is because excess cash would be used to buy higher net margin securities than are presently available. That seems very reasonable.For example, right now ETFC is making net income and its ROE is at least 14 to 15%. So it makes sense to buy back shares and invest in the company this way since it is the highest and best use of the cash on behalf of shareholders.Moreover, I pointed out in my previous article that shareholders can expect large dividend per share increases as a result of the share buybacks.Frankly, I think the stock will languish for a while. The market will want to see in Q4 that management has adjusted to zero cost commissions. In addition, if interest rates keep falling, that is not good for the company's net interest spread in the long run. So, this is a mixed blessing.On the one hand, the stock price doldrums will allow management to continue to buy back shares on the cheap. That will increase book value per share as long as the company remains profitable and hence lower its price to book value. In addition, it will act as a catalyst for dividends per share to increase higher than they would otherwise.But on the other hand, no one likes a stock that is expected to languish a while. In effect, shareholders will have to be patient and more long-term oriented. Most cannot do that, and that will also help keep the stock cheap over the next year. But it will also potentially make the company a buyout target if industry consolidation takes place.I stand by my previous target price of $62.66 per share. But I think it will take longer than a year to reach that now. Management is now talking about reaching $7 per share in EPS by 2024, instead of by the end of 2023. So it could be much longer than 1 year - possibly up to 3 years.That is because if ETFC stays on track on increasing EPS to $7.00 from an expected rate of $3.99 this year and possibly lower at $3.49 next year (see Seeking Alpha reference above), then it will need an annual increase of EPS greater than 18% per year after 2020.So by 2022, it is possible the stock will start expecting ETFC to be on track for a $7.00 EPS figure by 2024 and give it a 10x-12x forward P/E. That means it could take up to 2 to 2.5 years ahead for the stock to reach my target price.Meanwhile, the extremely high total yield will underpin the stock. The bottom line is that the stock buybacks will act as a catalyst to help get the stock to this target price. This is because not only will EPS be higher as a result, but so will dividends per share. In addition, the buying activity in the market will sop up ""weak hands"" in the stock price, preventing it from falling in a dramatic fashion."
4291915,22717,2019-09-16T19:11:59-04:00,"E-Trade Financial has a 1.24% dividend yield and a 13.79% buyback yield giving the stock a 15.03% total yield.E-Trade's new massive $1.5 billion buyback program over the next year compared to its $10.8 billion market value is very unique. Management is highly focused on capital returns.The share count fell 7.6% last year, and I expect it to drop 10% this year and next. The dividend per share will increase as a result even without higher dividend payments.Return on tangible equity is over 29%, one of the highest in its industry. But price-to-book value is only 1.79 times, one of the cheapest. P/E at 10.4 times is also one of the lowest.My estimate of E-Trade stock's true value is $62.66, per share, an 38.3% upside. I believe the stock buybacks will help push the stock to that price.","This article will discuss my model for E-Trade Financial (ETFC) which declared a $1.5 billion stock buyback program recently in its latest earnings report. This is on top of a $1 billion program that ETFC is completing this quarter. As ETFC's market value is only $10.8 billion, this new program represents a buyback of 13.79% of its share value. Added to the 1.24% dividend yield, the stock's total yield is 15.03%.My estimate is that the stock is worth at least $62.66 per share or 38% higher. I highly suspect that the buybacks will push the stock to this price, and my model shows how this will happen. Subscribers to the Total Yield Value Guide have access to this model, but I discuss the main points in this article.Moreover, ETFC's stock is very undervalued. It trades for 10.2x my model's expected EPS and has a 1.70 multiple on book value, both one of the lowest in its peer group.Source: Hake estimatesIn addition, E-Trade produced a Y/Y 27.2% return on tangible equity over the last 12 months. I expect this to exceed 29% by the end of the year.Source: Hake estimatesManagement's discussion of its Q2 financial report was replete with a large discussion of its capital return program to increase shareholder value. The main point they made is that this is their focus on increasing EPS, book value, and returning capital to shareholders. The new $1.5 billion buyback program is clearly expected to be completed over the next year. Here are a few excerpts of E-Trade management's discussion on the topic:Source: ETFC Q2 earnings call transcriptHere, they discussed how the program was financed:Source: ETFC Q2 earnings call transcriptHere, they discussed the new program:Source: ETFC Q2 earnings call transcriptThen, the CEO took a good number of questions and clarified more:Source: ETFC Q2 earnings call transcript In an answer to a question, the CEO made it clear the $1.5 billion in buybacks would occur over a one-year period. In addition, he implied that the dividend might be increased as a result.In fact, the CFO made it clear that there would be no major drawdown of cash to finance the new buyback program - effectively funded by free cash flow and the sale of the low yielding asset in the past quarter:Source: ETFC Q2 earnings call transcript Based on these statements, my model predicts that ETFC can fund at least $375 million in buybacks quarterly over the next year, including an additional $157 million during Q3 2019 to complete the previous $1 billion program:Source: Hake estimatesNote, this shows that over the next year, you can expect over 15% of the ETFC stock market value will be affected by buybacks.Here is how I think that will affect the share count:Source: Hake estimatesThis shows I expect that the stock gains 5% each quarter this year. The buybacks bring the total 2019 share count down over 10%. With 11-13% stock gains in 2020's first 2 quarters, the share count will fall over 13%.This has huge implications for ETFC's dividends per share. Right now, the dividend yield is 1.24% based on a $0.56 per annual dividend, $0.14 paid quarterly. This costs about $34 million each quarter and has been paid by ETFC for the past 4 quarters.I think ETFC will increase the dividend per share by the end of Q4 and possibly earlier. That is because the new share count will be about 221 million by the end of 2019. So, $34 million divided by 221 million is $0.1538 per share. Rounded to $0.15 per share, this is a 7.1% increase in the dividend per share with no additional outlay in ETFC's cash flow. This is one of the major benefits of share buybacks - the dividend per share increases for the same expense.I believe management will likely increase the dividend 20-25% by Q3 or Q4. This would cost ETFC only $6.8-8.5 million in cash flow outlay. This seems a paltry amount compared to its $1.5 billion buyback program. In addition, ETFC has a low payout ratio. It earned $0.99 per share diluted in Q2. So the $0.14 per share dividend is only 14.1% of earnings per share. Moreover, the $134 million quarterly expense of the dividend for 2019 represents just 32% of my model's 2019 expected $425 million free cash flow.A 20-25% dividend cost increase in the company's cash flow would increase the dividend per share by 28.6% to 35.7%:Source: Hake estimatesAn $0.18 dividend per share would bring the dividend yield to 1.59% from 1.24%. A $0.19 dividend would raise the dividend yield to 1.68% and the total yield to 15.5%.I put together a financial model which shows that ETFC can easily afford these two major shareholder capital returns. Management pointed out that in Q2, they sold some lower-yielding assets and took a loss in order to increase the buybacks. So, Q2 net revenue suffered a bit with a net $52 million loss. Without that total, net revenue would have been roughly close to Q1:Source: Hake compilation of ETFC financialsI expect net revenue to be slightly lower due to lower net interest income in Q3 and Q4 from lower average interest-earning assets:Source: Hake estimatesSince interest-bearing liabilities will be lower, the net margin will be about 3.17%, just 3 basis points lower than in Q4 2018:Source: Hake estimatesBased on this model, I expect free cash flow (""FCF"") to be about $425 million. But look at the table's net income conversion below:Source: Hake estimatesHistorically, ETFC has had a much higher operating income cash flow conversion from net income. I am assuming just a 71.3% conversion rate, even though historically ETFC has had a much higher rate - 160% in 2018 and 95% in 2017. This is where I suspect I am being too conservative.One reason I suspect this is because management seems to indicate that the ongoing FCF, along with the sale of $4.5 billion in lower-yielding assets will keep the corporate cash balance even at $300 million. My model assumes that there will be a slight increase in debt based on the increased buyback activity. But if my model is assuming too low an operating cash flow rate from net income, the increase in debt may not be needed.But I could also be wrong in believing the cash flow conversion rate might be higher. The net corporate cash balance was $323 million at the end of Q2. This appears to not include the proceeds from the sale of the $4.5 billion, which will show up in Q3. In that case, my conversion rate is likely on target, but the increase in the liabilities balance will not be needed.Source: Hake estimatesI am referring to the column ""FCF less Uses"" above which shows that there is an excess of spending on dividends and buybacks of $443 million in Q3 and $271 million in Q4. This FCF level is close to the level of what occurred in 2017 and seems to be related to the operating cash flow conversion rate. This is hard to predict, so to be conservative, I kept that number at the average of the last three periods.Either way, as pointed out in their statements shown above, management is confident that its corporate cash balance will not fall below $300 million over the next four quarters. As a result, I believe that the model shows that the buybacks and dividend increases are easily affordable.Based on a review of the value metrics with its peers, ETFC should be worth considerably more than its present price. The table below shows this:Source: Hake compilation using Yahoo! Finance and Marketwatch dataNote that ETFC's ratios are better in the P/E, Price-to-book value, and Dividend yield than its peers. But it is worse in the EV/Sales and FCF ratios. I also compared the return on equity measures across ETFC peers. The table below shows that ETFC has a 24% higher ROE than the average ROE:Source: Hake compilationPutting this all together and adding in a premium show that ETFC has a true value of $60.99 per share:Source: Hake estimatesBut since using dividend yield assumes similar payout ratios, an alternative method excludes this measure. Averaging the two scenarios produce a true value of $62.66 per share or 38% higher than today's price (Sept. 13, 2019):Source: Hake estimatesOne Seeking Alpha author recently indicated he was concerned about the temporary unrealized losses in ETFC's available for sale securities. In Q1 2019, these amounted to $200 million. But the latest 10-Q shows that these are now only $45 million.Source: 10-QThis is no danger to net income. Keep in mind even realizing these losses has no real effect on cash flow, especially if the proceeds are used to buy back stock. This is because ETFC makes over 29% on real tangible common equity. This return comes from its net interest margin on existing yielding securities, plus commissions, fees, and other income.Another risk cited is if interest rates fall. I believe the net margin will not be as affected as it might seem. First of all, over 88% of its $43.1 billion pool of investment securities are agency mortgage-backed securities. They are matched to liabilities with a duration of three to four years. Second, the company estimates that a 25 basis point cut will result in just a 1 basis point cut in its net interest margin (""NIM"") for those securities. It will also cost 20 basis points in the third-party sweep program. This latter program holds only $6.5 billion in off-balance-sheet assets (compared to about $58 billion on-sheet assets and earns a net fee to ETFC):Source: ETFC September 2019 presentationThe off-balance sheet sweep assets earn income at roughly the Federal funds rate, net of deposit costs. Those fees are matched to the Federal funds rate and will rise and fall with changes in that rate. ETFC is doing this to free up capital to support its buyback program. The buybacks are effectively invested in ETFC stock which earns a huge 29%+ return on tangible equity.Here is an extended excerpt from the management call describing their philosophy related to freeing up capital:Source: ETFC Q2 earnings call transcriptThis $7 per share in earnings by 2023 is possible within 3.5 years from now. A good portion of this will be achieved by dramatically reducing the share count.Here's how. The share count will fall 10% or more over the next two years. Net income rises 20% above the estimated $1 billion in 2019. The share count will fall to about 179 million shares. EPS would be $1,200 million divided by 179 million shares or $6.69 per share.At a 10x earnings multiple, ETFC would be worth $66.90 per share, 47.7% above today. This is a 16.9% average annual return over the next two and a half years. Including dividend increases, ETFC will likely achieve a 20% annualized total return.ETFC has a 15% total yield. The benefits include increases in its earnings per share, the dividend per share, and the remaining shareholders' stake in the company. It also supports the stock trading itself. Lastly, the underlying business earns 29% on tangible equity. The buybacks are a good investment."

Therefore, take my observations below as the point of view of an outsider, more interested in pondering about the current state of the industry than to draw definitive conclusions about it.But today's announcement that Charles Schwab (SCHW) intends to slash its commissions on stock, ETF, and options trades to zero in early October caught my attention, as the whole space took a sizable hit following the news. E-Trade (ETFC), for example, lost a whopping 16% of its market value in what turned out to be the stock's worst trading day of the past 10 years at least.Credit: WikipediaBeing a frequent user of trading services, I may have been taking the price war among online brokers for granted. In my mind, the ""race to the bottom"" (i.e. the commoditization of trading services leading to zero or near-zero commissions) seemed inevitable, and stocks should have been priced accordingly to reflect the new industry dynamic. For example, ETFC had already lost one-third of its market value since reaching an all-time peak in June of last year - half of it now, following Tuesday's stock price action. But as it turns out, shares had (and maybe still have) quite a bit of fat to shed.It is interesting to note that E-Trade's trading volume last year increased by a bit over 30% YOY. However, in line with the fierce competitive pressures, most of the recent volume growth seems to have been driven by the sharp drop in commissions that took place about two years ago (red bars below). Not coincidentally, E-Trade's most robust revenue growth period of 20% to 28% per quarter happened precisely between 2Q17 and 3Q18, aided by the increased volume but hurt a bit by lower per-trade revenues.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company's reportWith Schwab's move to lower trading commissions to zero, E-Trade is faced with the challenge of jump-starting revenue growth (sales dipped nearly 4% last quarter) without much pricing power - peer Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) already offers ultra-low to zero trading fees, along with highly competitive margin rates. It is the typical case of ""a rock and a hard place"": not diving head first into the commission war will likely hurt trading volume, but doing so will probably send per-unit commission revenues tumbling.To be fair, E-Trade's total revenue does not come primarily from trade commissions, which barely accounted for one-fifth of it in fiscal 2018 - less than half of TD Ameritrade's (AMTD) commission revenues as a proportion of its total sales. But I imagine trading activity being perhaps the most important driver of E-Trade's top-line growth. As a result, the New York-based broker is likely to lower commissions as much as possible to protect its client base. This being the case, I bet E-Trade's commission revenues will most likely head towards zero in the foreseeable future, and the impact to the bottom line could be a hit of more than 20%, according to recent analyst estimates.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from multiple company reportsWithout digging much deeper into E-Trade and the online brokerage sector, I am highly suspicious that investing in the space might prove to be a losing proposition - or a ""value trap"", considering ETFC's timid 10.6x forward P/E multiple (as of Monday, but likely to remain unchanged after Tuesday's stock price unwind coupled with expected forward EPS revisions). See chart below.Data by YChartsCompanies within the sector seem to be all out of pricing power, and the highly competitive nature of the online brokerage and consumer lending businesses suggests that E-Trade and its peers might continue to fight industry-wide headwinds for a while."
4272505,105281,2019-06-27T14:15:58-04:00,"A dovish Fed means lower interest spreads for financials.E-Trade is particularly sensitive to interest rates with two-thirds of its net revenues coming from net interest income.Competitive dynamics in E-Trade's other businesses make it difficult to mitigate the potential earnings decline from lower net interest margins.Despite trading at close to 11.6x trailing earnings, investors should avoid E-Trade until it trades closer to $38.28 or 10.0x trailing earnings.","E-Trade Financial Corporation (ETFC) is a financial services company in the business of providing brokerage and related products and services across multiple channels. Many readers would be familiar with its various trading platforms. At its current price (as of this writing) of $44.40 per share, the stock trades ~30% below its 52-week high of $63.39 per share. While some may view this as a buying opportunity - I would caution those people: the macroeconomic environment has already shifted against ETFC's favor significantly.I previously wrote about the sharp turn in the Fed's policy stance in this article. Despite some pullback from the Fed chairman Jerome Powell in a recent speech - the market remains convinced that an interest rate cut is inevitable for the July Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy meeting. As seen in the table below, the market's only uncertainty is whether the cut will be 25 bps or 50 bps.(Source: CME FedWatch Tool)One would think that a cut in the Fed funds rate wouldn't significantly impact the earnings of a company most known for its stock brokerage platform. However, a detailed look at earnings drivers for ETFC makes it clear that they're more in the business of interest rates than anything else:(Source: ETFC 1Q19 investor presentation)67% of trailing 12-month net revenues are driven by spread-based income: net interest income and off-balance sheet sweep revenues. Everything else (which includes the trading-based income of commissions and order flow revenues) comprises just 33% of total trailing 12-month net revenues.To expand more on the net interest revenues, let's take a look at the average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities in more detail.(Source: ETFC 1Q19 10Q report)ETFC's interest-earning assets are primarily investment securities and margin receivables whereas its interest-bearing liabilities are primarily sweep deposits and customer payables.88% of the investment securities in the balance sheet as of 1Q19 are agency mortgage-backed securities. Said securities are guaranteed by US government sponsored enterprises and federal agencies (thereby presenting limited if not non-existent credit risk). While these securities do not carry meaningful credit risk, they may carry duration (or interest rate) risk.Do note that since these securities are classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity, they will not generate gains on the income statement as a result of marked-to-marked revaluations (arising from lower interest rates). At best, the gains in available-for-sale would be recognized directly in shareholders' equity as part of other comprehensive income.(Source: ETFC 1Q19 10Q report)On the other hand, the cost of the primary liabilities are already so low that a decline in interest rates would make it unlikely for ETFC to benefit significantly on the funding side. The downside limit will be 0% cost for these funding sources (much unlike the situation in Europe or Japan in which investors have already seen the interest rate floor to negative numbers).In sum, the combination of interest-sensitive assets and low-cost deposits in a declining interest environment means that net interest margins are likely to decline: reversing a powerful tailwind for ETFC.ETFC's disclosures make putting all of this content together straightforward.(Source: ETFC 1Q19 investor presentation)As seen in the table above, ETFC stands to lose $37 million in net revenues for every parallel 25 bps decline in interest rates. Considering the pass-through nature of net interest income this loss will likely be an almost straight decline in net income for ETFC. If the market's expectations of a 50 bps decline in interest rates for 2019 comes to pass, then we can expect to see ETFC's net earnings decline by $74 million (~7% of Trailing 12-month net income as of 1Q19). The expected decline in yields will also cut into management's guidance for the rest of 2019. Recall Chief Finance Officer (CFO) Chad E. Turner in the 1Q19 earnings call:Looking further out into beyond the next twelve months, it seems that ETFC's longer-term aspirations may be put at risk by this shift in interest rate policy. For one, the company's earnings per share (EPS) aspirations are dependent on a stable interest rate policy (note bullet point 1 on model assumptions): see how a portion of the revenue growth is dependent on some net interest margin (NIM) expansion which has become very unlikely.(Source: ETFC 1Q19 investor presentation)The Fed's dovish stance only solidified after the FOMC meeting that ended June 19. Since then, the price decline of ETFC has only declined by ~4%. We believe that this price decline does not fully price in a meaningful decline in interest rate spreads. Recall that before the end of 2018 the Fed was signaling another two to four rate hikes in 2019 and potentially another two rate hikes in 2020 before closing out the tightening cycle. Considering the $30 million impact per 25 bps hike (as seen in the sensitivity table presented earlier), ETFC potentially lost out of another $180 million in net earnings (calculated as $30 million per 25 bps hike multiplied by 6 interest rate hikes) which would approximately be 17% of trailing twelve-month net income.Data by YChartsIn response to this line of argumentation during the 1Q19 earnings call, CFO Chad E. Turner discusses:We believe that ETFC management has been amazing and will continue to be amazing throughout any economic cycle. One must only look at their long history of innovation and success to be convinced of that fact. (Source: ETFC 1Q19 investor presentation)But when two-thirds of net revenues are under attack by a dovish Fed and a President willing to do (or at least say) whatever it takes to cut interest rates - the road to earnings growth will be back-breaking.What makes it worse is that the rest of the net revenues aren't holding up a strong momentum when it's desperately needed to pick up the slack: (Source: ETFC 1Q19 10Q report)Daily average revenue trades (""DARTs"") are the primary revenue drivers for ETFC's commission revenues and they have been falling. So have Derivative DARTs. The volume part of commission revenues is falling and so is the price part: note how average commission per trade has also fallen over time. In a world where competition exists not only from traditional competitors but also from well-funded startups (e.g., Robinhood as discussed in this article by Seeking Alpha contributor Gary Alexander) - these trends are likely to continue if not accelerate.The Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) business which ETFC recently entered into is also going to face headwinds as other well-geared players continue to pile pressure into this industry. Alternatively, the banking business will also be negatively impacted by the decline in the fed funds rate. So really - there isn't a meaningful part of the business that can offset the headwinds on the interest rate declines.ETFC still trades at 10x forward earnings according to the SA ticker page. While this might be an attractive valuation on its own - we know that the business faces risks and is likely over-earning relative to the next twelve to eighteen months.Short of a complete reversal in the Fed interest rate trajectory (which isn't completely out of the picture given the exaggeratedly volatile political and economic climate) we can only find pockets of upside risk in ETFC. For example, corporate services is a bright spot in terms of customer segments:(Source: ETFC 1Q19 investor presentation)But again - this is a segment (on its own) that is nowhere near the size of the interest income and commission business.The only real protection we see before going long on ETFC is a lower price - and that is something we haven't really seen yet. So this is something we'd avoid or keep on watch list given the abrupt change in the interest rate environment.We estimate a conservative target entry price of $38.28 per share in order to generate an internal rate of return of 15% per year over a three-year holding period. The details of our calculation can be seen in the table below. Our entry price can be viewed as roughly 10x trailing twelve months (TTM) or last twelve months (LTM) diluted earnings per share.Our biggest assumption in calculating the entry price is the exit multiple applied to the 2021 diluted EPS. We note that ETFC has traded at a meaningful premium in the past (e.g., 20x and 18x LTM Price-to-earnings ratio over a ten-year and five-year average, respectively according to S&P Capital IQ). However, ETFC's earnings prospects have significantly declined as a result of encroaching competition (i.e., Robinhood), intense fee compression (e.g., passive investing), and falling interest rates. Hence, we believe that the high multiples of the past are not applicable for our 2023 earnings estimates and that a conservative investor (like ourselves) should apply a 'safe' multiple of 12x. Said multiple is what an above-average business with high returns on capital and a single-digit growth rate can reasonably get in the middle of an economic cycle.In addition, our earnings estimates already incorporate management's guidance which we believe to be balanced (i.e., not too conservative or aggressive). A more conservative view of earnings growth would imply an even lower entry price.(Source: Author; ETFC investor presentations and quarterly reports)Given the Fed's shift towards a more dovish stance - two-thirds of ETFC's net revenues are at significant risk of decline. Without immediate means to mitigate this earnings risk, we recommend that investors avoid ETFC until the price becomes more attractive - an estimate of $38.28 in our opinion."
4206460,103480,2018-09-15T08:07:01-04:00,"Shares of E-Trade have remained surprisingly resilient despite news of competitive advances.Most notably, JPMorgan Chase announced a free online trading service called You Invest several weeks ago.This is on top of existing competition from Robinhood, which has recently been reported as preparing for an IPO.E-Trade will need to cut fees and commissions in order to retain clients, but it will still likely lose customer assets. Interest income will slide as well.","There are very few trade ideas in the market that are simply obvious. Share prices fluctuate up and down because of a simple reason: for everyone feeling bullish about a particular stock at a particular price, there's someone else betting the opposite. In today's market, however, there is one thesis that can't be made more abundantly clear: E-Trade (ETFC), and, for that matter, all online brokerage companies, are slowly fading away. The numbers don't reflect it yet - E-Trade has still soared over the past year on strong customer growth as well as some inorganic growth from the acquisition of Capital One's brokerage business. But sometime as soon as next year, E-Trade's numbers will start sliding.Shorting E-Trade is perhaps one of the most prescient bearish calls you can make in the market at the moment. Forget the retailpocalypse and the threat of Amazon.com (AMZN) - retailers still have the advantage of giving their customers something to touch and feel in stores. But as for E-Trade, it's peddling a service that more and more investors are starting demand for free.There's one big reason for this: competition. E-Trade was never a stranger to competition, but for the majority of its lifetime, it was the one disrupting the traditional brokerage industry. Before discount brokers came onto the scene, investors would have to call up their stockbrokers to trade in the markets - and that came at a hefty fee, and still does. The rise of services like E-Trade took over the investing world by storm - who wouldn't want to pay a smaller $9.95 fee for executing a simple trade on your own time, and much faster at that?Now, E-Trade is the one being disrupted. The products its competitors are touting aren't new, but the pricing sure is - absolutely free.Let's be clear about one thing - the deterioration in E-Trade's fundamentals hasn't started yet. Its recent strength in customer additions (though most of these accounts were acquired). The fact that E-Trade has actually been able to produce positive y/y account growth comps is actually impressive in the face of steep competition.You'll note, in the chart below, that E-Trade has grown its period-end total accounts to 5.84 million as of the end of Q2, up 9% y/y:Figure 1. E-Trade account growthSource: E-Trade investor relationsTrading activity has also held up, with total trades up 27% y/y (the volatility experienced in the markets earlier this year has lifted fortunes at investment banks' trading desks as well as retail brokerages).Figure 2. E-Trade trading metricsSource: E-Trade investor relationsYou'll notice, however, that E-Trade's average commission per trade is down 9% y/y. Last year, E-Trade already cut its fee from $9.99 to $6.95; you can also get $4.95 trades if you place 30 or more trades per quarter. Eventually, E-Trade will likely have to go lower: Schwab has started pricing its trades at $4.95, putting it neck-and-neck against Fidelity:Figure 3. Charles Scwab pricing comparisonSource: schwab.comThere's one set of prices that's missing from this comparison above, however, and it's the one that will hurt E-Trade most: free.When Robinhood was founded in 2013 with the premise of free stock trading (the company's two co-founders believed in making the markets more accessible to millennials), many seasoned investors wrote it off as speculative. Why trust a small startup with your capital - potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more? Robinhood attracted primarily hobbyists and younger investors, while most serious investors stuck to their existing discount or full-service brokerages.That narrative has changed in the past five years, however. Robinhood has raised more than $500 million from some of the most famous VCs in Silicon Valley, at a reported valuation of $5.6 billion. See the company's funding history below from Crunchbase:Figure 4. Robinhood funding timelineSource: CrunchbaseRumors have also recently started circulating that Robinhood is preparing to go public, which will even further legitimize Robinhood in investors' eyes and take more business away from E-Trade. It's difficult to overemphasize this: you can't beat free. Whatever customer stickiness E-Trade was counting on in the past, it will be a much less solid foundation as time goes on.But the final nail in the coffin, in my opinion, came when JPMorgan Chase (JPM) unveiled its new trading platform, You Invest, last month. The service offers Chase customers up to 100 free trades in the first year, with 100 free trades every year for Premier Plus Checking (>$15,000 in balances) customers and unlimited free trades for Chase Sapphire Banking (>$75,000 in balances) customers. Brokerage balances also count toward these account minimums.Figure 5. You Invest featuresSource: chase.comPrior to the addition of You Invest to the brokerage landscape, there were still plenty of skeptics who didn't want to trust their assets into the hands of a Silicon Valley startup. That's understandable. But now, those who want to minimize brokerage commissions can move their money into the largest U.S. bank - which used to charge $25 per trade - and trade for free while residing in the comfort that the custodian of these funds is a bank that's been deemed too big to fail. What type of customer will want to remain at E-Trade now?E-Trade can't beat Robinhood and You Invest in a race to the bottom; that is, the race to $0 in trading fees. Robinhood has earned the Silicon Valley aura wherein it can do no wrong - it's like Amazon (AMZN); it doesn't matter how unprofitable the company is, as long as it produces growth. It can afford to offer $0 trading and subside on interest income alone because no one is pressuring the company to produce a bottom line.You Invest, on the other hand, is a small experimental piece of a major bank. It has real trading desk revenues, as well as investment banking and a massive retail arm, to produce its profits. Like Robinhood, whose investors are currently ambivalent about profits, Jamie Dimon probably doesn't care if You Invest runs at a loss - potentially forever.E-Trade, on the other hand, lives and dies by commissions, fees, and interest income. Yes, E-Trade would still be able to generate interest if it cuts down its trading commissions - but the loss of customer assets would still heavily drive down revenues. We haven't yet seen a full quarter where You Invest has fully ramped - when the effects of competition begin eating away at E-Trade's account growth and trade volumes, investors will begin feeling the chill.Remember MoviePass (OTCPK:HMNY)? That company tried to revolutionize the movie theater industry by offering customers a heavily reduced subscription to watch an unlimited amount of movies. What Robinhood and You Invest are trying to do isn't too different. What is different, however, is that these companies are incredibly well capitalized and can afford to bleed out their competitors like E-Trade while suffering losses, whereas MoviePass took on a costly battle against the likes of AMC (AMC) with very limited resources.Over the past year, shares of E-Trade have risen more than 30% despite the heavy threats in the competitive landscape. These gains are ill-deserved, and in my view, the company's recent slide from June highs is a signal of greater losses to come.ETFC data by YChartsAvoid this company. In two to three years, E-Trade will be radically diminished, if not gone altogether."

But past performance does not guarantee future returns, and investing decisions should always be made by looking through the windshield, not the rearview mirror.Backtested data shows that companies with strong attributes in terms of financial quality, valuation, momentum, and relative strength tend to deliver market beating returns over the years.In that spirit, the following paragraphs will be taking a look at E*TRADE stock in terms of these four key return drivers in order to find out if the best is already in the past for investors in the company or if E*TRADE still offers attractive upside potential going forward.E*TRADE is one of the leading players in the direct brokerage industry. Consumers around the world are becoming increasingly confortable with the direct-brokerage business model, which offers not only more comfort and convenience, but also substantially lower costs in comparison to traditional brokers.Source E*TRADEAccording to the company, direct brokers are rapidly gaining market share versus the traditional brokerage industry, and direct brokerage players still account for a relatively small 24% of the market, which means that the industry has substantial room for expansion in the long term.E*TRADE has delivered volatile financial performance over the years, since the business depends considerably on macroeconomic conditions and activity levels in financial markets. But key variables such as revenue and earnings are clearly moving in the right direction.ETFC Revenue (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsThe company reported record revenue numbers during the first quarter of 2018, with total revenue rising to $708 million, a vigorous increase of 28% versus the first quarter of 2017. Not only that, but key operational metrics such as Daily Average Revenue Trades (DARTs), customer margin balances, and net new brokerage assets also marked new records during the quarter.Source E*TRADEManagement is expecting adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 44.5% to 45% of revenue during 2018, so profitability levels are quite healthy.Even after such an impressive rally in the stock, shares of E*TRADE are still reasonably valued by industry standards. The table below shows key valuation ratios such as forward price to earnings, price to sales, and price to book value for E*TRADE versus competitors like Schwab (SHW), Ameritrade (AMTD), and Interactive Brokers (IBKR).E*TRADE stock is priced at a discount versus its competitors across the three valuation ratios considered.Stock prices don't just reflect current fundamentals, but expectations about those fundamentals can be even more important. When a company is delivering better than expected earnings and expectations about future earnings are increasing, this generally pushes the stock price in the right direction too.The chart below shows how E*TRADE stock price and earnings expectations for both the current year and next year have evolved over time. It's easy to see the close correlation between the stock price and earnings forecasts for the company.ETFC data by YChartsOn the back of rock-solid performance from the company and encouraging guidance from management, Wall Street analysts are materially raising their earnings forecasts for E*TRADE lately. This is a powerful upside fuel for the stock.Outstanding Relative StrengthWinners tend to keep on winning in the stock market. Besides, an investor's available capital has an opportunity cost. When you buy an investment with subpar returns, that money is not available to invested in companies with superior performance. For this reason, we don't just want to buy stocks that are doing well, we want to buy the names that are performing materially better than others.Most companies in the brokerage industry are delivering strong returns lately, as expressed by a gain of 30.71% for the iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF (IAI) ETF in comparison to a gain of 11.36% for the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY) in the past year.ETFC data by YChartsImportantly, E*TRADE is a king among kings when it comes to relative strength, as the stock has crushed both the broad market and the sector in particular with a vigorous gain of 75.73% over the past twelve months. When it comes to relative strength, E*TRADE doesn't leave much to be desired.The PowerFactors system is a quantitative investing system available to members in my research service, ""The Data Driven Investor"". This system basically ranks companies in a particular universe according to the factors analyzed in this article for E*TRADE: quality, valuation, momentum, and relative strength.The system has produced solid backtested performance over the long term. The chart below shows how the 50 stocks with the highest PowerFactors ranking in the Russell 3000 index performed in comparison to the iShares Russell 3000 ETF (IWV) ETF since 1999. The backtesting assumes an equal-weighted portfolio, monthly rebalanced, and with an annual expense ratio of 1% to account for trading expenses.Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123Backtested performance numbers are quite encouraging. Since January of 1999 the portfolio recommended by the system produced an average annual return of 14.62%, comfortably beating the 6.24% produced by the benchmark. In plain English, a $100,000 investment in the market-tracking ETF in January of 1999 would currently be worth around 322,200, and the same amount of capital allocated to the PowerFactors portfolio would have a much larger value of almost $1.4 million.E*TRADE is one of the companies currently recommended by the system, and the stock has elevated scores across all of the quantitative return drivers considered: quality, valuation, momentum, and relative strength.Backtested performance does not guarantee future returns, and this kind of analysts should always be interpreted with caution. That acknowledged, it's good to know that the numbers are clearly pointing towards further upside potential in E*TRADE stock."
4148322,104245,2018-02-20T10:59:38-05:00,"E-Trade is finally starting to show signs of serious recovery following a near bankruptcy experience in 2008 regarding their mortgage loan business.E-Trade has since slowly been recovering their losses and positioned the business to attract new retail investors, whom are key to growth.How does the competition of other low-commission and now, zero-commission trades affect the company in the coming years?A chart analysis of ETFC and potential breakout opportunity.","E-Trade Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:ETFC) is a discount brokerage company headquartered in New York City.(Image Source)In 2008, the company nearly went bankrupt after the housing crisis, causing defaults on mortgage loans to spike across the board. E-Trade was heavily exposed to these loans and nearly went into bankruptcy sparring a $2.5 billion cash infusion from Citadel. At that time, the company released it's ""turnaround plan"" which focused on getting max value from the risky loans that were holding the company down and focus on achieving more liquidity. Also, the company stressed growth of it's assets leading to increased revenue from net interest off of these assets.In E-Trade's 2016 Annual Report, the company posted an increase in income from fees of 28% from 2015-2016. This is coming off another positive 5% increase from 2014-2015. For 2017, fee related income increased from $268 million to $369 million. This represents a ~38% growth YoY. This is incredible growth for E-Trade and is a solid result considering the amount of stress that has been placed on increasing account signups. In this chart, we can see the YoY growth of income generated from net interest of E-Trade assets. This visual demonstrates the working ideas of the ""turnaround plan"" previously discussed. Through the growth of the core business in brokerage account signups, E-Trade has managed to turnaround the business and show steady profits from net interest. The key to this of course, is finding ways to continue to sign up new investors. In 2017 alone, the company added 172,000 new brokerage accounts which translated to a net new $12.2 billion in brokerage assets. Despite the overwhelmingly positive growth in assets the company had over 2017 from it's own business, the company looks to further continue it's vision. It was announced on January 25, 2018 that the company was purchasing over 1 million brokerage accounts from Capital One for $170 million. According to the report these accounts are worth ~$18 billion and the deal will be financed with cash.E-Trade Financial Corporation is undervalued when compared to it's direct competitors. The company is currently sitting at a 24.10 P/E ratio. The P/E ratio has remained relatively low because of it's incredibly strong earnings recently. For comparison, TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) has a 32.17 P/E ratio and Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) has a P/E ratio of 32.4. E-Trade is certainly not overvalued despite a more than 50% gain in 2017.So remember those defaults on mortgages that nearly caused the bankruptcy of the company? Most of these faulty mortgages were extinguished by 2016. Which is vital to the companies future, because it allows them to free up cash to focus on growing their core business. For example, the deal with Capital One to to purchase over one million accounts. However, in it's 2016 annual report the company stated that losses on their mortgage portfolio were still possible. The report stated that their one to four family loan portfolio was still $2.0 billion with an allowance of loan losses for $45 million and a home equity portfolio of $1.6 billion with an allowance of loan losses for $171 million. (Page 15)The highly competitive nature and technological advances of the National Brokerage industry has lead to a decrease in commissions for the average retail investor. TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab are E-Trade's two biggest competitors. E-Trade and TD Ameritrade have nearly identical fee structures, with flat stock and option trading fees of $6.95 plus $0.75 for each option contract. On the other hand, Charles Schwab offers a flat $4.95 fee for stocks and options plus $0.65 for each option contract.New challenges face the brokerage industry such as the introduction of zero-commission trading. This has been spearheaded by Robinhood, a brokerage which began in 2013 and has been populated by millennials since it's inception. It requires no minimum deposit and approximately 78% of the firm's users are under the age of 35. Robinhood is still far from being a preferred brokerage of the masses, as it has yet to roll out a web-based platform to all of it's users, lacks charting features, and may not provide real time data. However, if Robinhood is able to expand on these features, they may present challenges for traditional brokerages.On the monthly chart we can see the drop of E-Trade's stock price since 2007. From it's highs of $257.90 it plunged to $5.90 and has since risen back to ~$52. ETFC has tested resistance twice since 2007, which are marked by arrows on the chart. Circled on the chart in red are periods where the RSI Indicator rose above 70 and the stock price continued to rise. Notice how the stock price is also currently ""overbought"" according to the RSI indicator yet continues to rise. The arrows on the chart point to resistance which ETFC appears ready to retest again soon.On the weekly chart it is much easier to see the positive trend of ETFC and the bullish triangle pattern forming. The clear resistance of ~$56 and the positive trend of higher lows over the past two years are indicative of a potential breakout.E-Trade has consistently shown strong increases in fee revenue, account openings, and overall asset ownership. Since it's near collapse in 2007, the company has worked to decrease delinquency and gain max value out of their mortgage loans, and have focused on their core business and maximizing interest accumulations and fee revenue. On it's chart, E-Trade looks as if it may be poised for a breakout with a bullish triangle pattern forming. Thankfully, the worst should be behind E-Trade and the company should learn from it's mistakes and focus on expanding it's core business.Final NotesIf you enjoyed this article feel free to follow me at the top of this article.

4209742,69675,2018-10-03T21:07:57-04:00,"Right now, there's a great deal of upheaval in the financial space, especially when it comes to the brokerage side of the equation.Concerns of competition from startups and the impact they can have on big players like E-Trade are overstated.In the long run, competition is unlikely to negatively affect E-Trade in any meaningful way.","In this age of technological upheaval, with firms like Robinhood coming onto the scene and revolutionizing the brokerage space by moving toward free trading, there might be some concern among investors that legacy providers like E-TRADE Financial Corp. (ETFC) might be in trouble. The fact of the matter is that things are far more complicated than that. Though this transition may be, in a way, painful, E-Trade itself is actually performing amazingly well and, absent a disruption far more significant than anything Robinhood and its peers have brought about, the future for the incumbents in this space still looks bright.I spend a lot of time thinking about and performing work related to the fintech space. Initially, when Robinhood came onto the scene and as other smaller outfits have ventured out from obscurity and onto the mainstream, I thought the future might look radically different from the past, that incumbent firms might lose users and valuable assets might shift to the startups in this space. You, the reader, might think that now that Robinhood has surpassed the number of accounts that E-Trade has and now that it has garnered a valuation reported at $5.6 billion, that I would feel this way more than ever. You would be wrong.I have come to conclude that the new entrants (at least the ones who have made a name for themselves thus far) are right now more complementary services than they are competing ones. Yes, there is no denying that E-Trade has been hurt on the trading commission side of its business by the emergence of free trades. Between 2016 and 2017, for instance, the average commission per trade generated by E-Trade declined from $10.20 to $8.23. This year, that figure will certainly be less and at some point in the future, it might be at or near $0.This is painful for E-Trade because last year it generated $441 million in sales from trading commissions, down from $456 million three years earlier. This drop came despite the fact that the number of accounts on its platforms grew from 3.144 million in 2014 (up from 2.998 million in 2013) to 3.635 million last year. As of the second quarter of this year, it has an impressive 3.882 million accounts.What’s more, over time we have seen customer assets grow at E-Trade. Back in 2013, the company held customer assets of $261 billion. This figure had grown to $383 billion as of the end of last year, and this year it’s currently at $441 billion. Along the way, the actual average assets per account has risen, climbing from $73 thousand back in 2013 to $101 thousand today. Robinhood hasn’t made available what its assets are or what its average assets per account come out to, but despite its large user base of more than 4 million users, I’d wager it’s smaller than E-Trade is at the moment in dollar terms.Robinhood’s rise and E-Trade’s continued growth may seem odd, but there are good reasons for this. For starters, E-Trade has, like other players in the space such as TD Ameritrade Holdings (AMTD), continued to grow by means of acquisition. In January of this year, for instance, E-Trade announced that it struck a deal to buy 1 million retail brokerage accounts from Capital One that had aggregate assets of $18 billion in exchange for $170 million.Another reason, I posit, has to do with the role that Robinhood is playing. The barebones platform that it operates and the limited functionality of some of its other peers are strategically advantageous when it comes to drawing in users who otherwise might have eschewed online or app-based trading. In essence, the company and many of its peers happen to be drawing in users who are newer to investing. This can be seen when you consider that the average Robinhood user is just 28 years old. That leaves older and more sophisticated investors still wanting to use legacy platforms like E-Trade.Earlier this year, Robinhood stated that the company’s goal is to become the Amazon of finance. Though that moniker sounds flashy, it’s not really a new idea. After all, E-Trade itself is far more complicated than being an online broker. Even though the business generated $441 million from trading commissions last year, nearly 63% of its sales ($1.485 billion) came from net interest income.In short, through its sweep accounts, legacy loan business, margin accounts, and more, the business is able to use customer assets to generate investment income for itself. Undoubtedly, the most integral part of this is its sweep account model where it gives users the ability to invest excess cash into interest-bearing assets in exchange for paltry rates of return (between 0.04% and 0.30% per annum). Most of these proceeds find themselves invested into either available-for-sale securities or held-to-maturity securities, both categories overwhelmingly comprised of agency-backed mortgage-backed securities (aka MBS). The weighted-average balance of $18.391 billion worth of available-for-sale securities last year generated gross investment income for E-Trade of $390 million (2.12% per annum), while its held-to-maturity securities generated $572 million off of $20.699 billion (implying an annual interest rate of 2.76%).*Taken from E-TradeBecause of its ability to use customer assets in the way that it has, E-Trade’s business model has thrived in recent years. As you can see in the graph below, revenue for the firm soared from $1.61 billion in 2013 to $2.37 billion last year, while net income grew from $86 million to $614 million over the same time frame. If this year’s results so far are any indication, that trend is unlikely to stop for the foreseeable future.ETFC Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsAs Robinhood and other platforms switch to focus on all-things finance, they won’t be competing in any way that will serve to displace E-Trade (how many investors have you met who both know and care about picking up a few dozen basis points on spare cash?). The more likely scenario is that E-Trade will continue to move in Robinhood’s direction on the fee front, decreasing its trading fees and using its large net investment income to absorb any shortfall. This will institutionalize (in form, not name) the industry in such a way that both legacy providers and many (but not all) startups will benefit from the banking structures required to maintain these various operations. The differentiator, instead, will be emphasis. While E-Trade and its peers have a nice hold on larger account sizes, Robinhood will play the role of catering to less-sophisticated investors, some of whom will stay that way and remain on its platform or benefit as Robinhood grows its offerings, while others will transition to the slightly more costly, but perhaps more useful, platforms provided by E-Trade, its other legacy peers, and more niche startups.For investors who feel like the real outcome is more pessimistic, that this must be a losing game for somebody, I would like to draw their attention to the image below. In it, you can see that, in 2016, the brokerage industry was a whopping $17.6 trillion in size. Of that, direct brokerages accounted for $4.2 trillion and were growing at a rate of 12% per annum. Even traditional brokerage options, which would be the most susceptible to changes both at startups and among legacy providers, have grown at a respectable 7% rate per annum from 2008 through 2016. In short, there appears to be plenty of the pie for every player and even if that pie becomes more competitive, the traditional providers will likely be gobbled up first.*Taken from E-TradeRight now, the brokerage space is in an interesting position where technology is making trading cheaper and that has brought about a number of startups, the leader of which right now is Robinhood. While I cannot know the financial picture of it because of a lack of publicly-available information, I do believe that it is seizing on an interesting opportunity; but I believe that this will have little or no negative impact on big players like E-Trade. In some ways, it could even be beneficial for them. The next step in this space is for niche alternatives to come into play, but irrespective of what time frame that takes place over, I suspect that E-Trade and its legacy peers will be able to coexist in what is a massive and almost continually-growing space."
4212917,103480,2018-10-20T04:16:01-04:00,"E-Trade, the well-known discount broker, reported strong Q3 results that beat Wall Street's expectations on both the top and bottom line.Helped by a boost in net interest margins, E-Trade drove strong operating margins. However, asset balances remained flattish despite growth in new accounts.The brokerage industry is in the midst of a massive upheaval from free offerings, and legacy plays like E-Trade stand to lose much of its clientele.E-Trade might be appeasing investors in the short term with a dividend and a buyback, but it should be investing in growth instead.","For E-Trade (ETFC), it's the calm before the storm right now. The popular discount brokerage just reported Q3 results, and investors are overwhelmingly cheered by the results. In the face of a declining stock market (as trade tensions continue to weigh on good earnings and spark choppy trading, especially among small-/mid-cap and tech stocks), E-Trade was one of few gainers on the positive earnings news.Still, however, there's no doubt that E-Trade's future is slipping from its hands. Shares have been in decline since early summer, at the same time that JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the largest bank in the U.S., rolled out its You Invest offering with free trading options (unlimited free trades for clients with higher balances; up to 100 free trades for others), spooking E-Trade bulls about rising competition. At the same time, startup competitor Robinhood is rumored to be making moves toward a near-term IPO; at a current valuation of $5.6 billion, Robinhood is worth nearly half of E-Trade's market cap despite being a much smaller brokerage.ETFC data by YChartsIn my previous article, I highlighted how competitors like You Invest and Robinhood are gradually pushing E-Trade out of the market. Up until now, E-Trade has maintained its grip on the market by laying claim to larger net-worth clients, those with a healthy skepticism on newer offerings like Robinhood. Two factors are now working against E-Trade on that front, however: first, Robinhood's increasing size and public profile is heightening its legitimacy, which helps to convert skeptics on the edge; and second, most investors will have no problem trusting You Invest, as it's backed by the nation's largest bank.Even E-Trade CFO Mike Pizzi has acknowledged the risks that free competitors pose on the company's current fee structure. During prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call, Pizzi noted:At the moment, E-Trade's Q3 results show no decline in trading activity (though growth is rather flattish). However, the industry is headed toward free brokers, and E-Trade will be hard-pressed to compete. And while at present, E-Trade still maintains the highest market share at 22% among stock plan administrators (as shown in the chart below, taken from Robinhood's Q3 earnings deck), there's no guarantee that competitors like Robinhood won't eventually encroach upon this territory.Figure 1. E-Trade Q3 stock plan administration market shareSource: E-Trade investor relationsE-Trade has momentarily appeased investors by announcing a $1 billion buyback program and a $0.14 quarterly dividend, a first for the company. In my view, however, E-Trade's accelerated capital returns program is an implicit admission from the company that it's not actively pursuing growth opportunities. It's dangerous for E-Trade to be sitting still while competitors are fighting for its market share.E-Trade's seemingly strong results in the third quarter are a temporary respite for this out-of-favor stock, but the long-term fundamentals are still dubious in my view. The company has asserted to investors that it expects to maintain mid-teens EPS growth through 2023 (which would double EPS by 2023 relative to this year), but in my view, this is a fairly aggressive growth scenario in light of rampant competition. Steer clear of this stock - it's ill-prepared for the industry shift that's already underway.Here's a look at E-Trade's results in the third quarter:Figure 2. E-Trade 3Q19 resultsSource: E-Trade investor relationsTotal revenues grew 20% y/y to $720 million, surpassing Wall Street's expectations for $711 million (+19% y/y) by just one point. The company benefited tremendously from 43% y/y growth in net new brokerage accounts, as shown in the chart below:Figure 3. E-Trade key metricsSource: E-Trade investor relationsNote, however, that not all of this growth is organic. Recall that E-Trade acquired the Trust Company of America in April, and is on track to onboard ~1 million retail customer accounts from Capital One (NYSE:COF) by the end of the year. And despite the growth in brokerage accounts, E-Trade's total assets still remained relatively flat at $64.71 billion, up just 7% y/y from the year-ago period.It's largely an expansion in net interest margin, and not asset growth, that has helped E-Trade lift its earnings this quarter - similar to banks. Net interest margin this quarter expanded to 310bps, up 25bps from 285bps in the year-ago quarter. This is slightly higher than the company's NIM forecast of 305-310bps for full-year 2018. Here's some further color from E-Trade's CFO on the positive NIM trends:As seen in the financials above, net interest income accounts for the lion's share of E-Trade's revenues, bringing in nearly 4x as much as commission fees. Because of this, many investors make the mistake of believing that no-commission brokers like Robinhood only threaten E-Trade's commission revenues - but if customers defect to competing platforms, E-Trade will lose its interest-producing asset balances as well.For the moment, strong revenue growth amid flat expenses has produced tremendous operating margin expansion. Operating income grew 68% y/y to $374 million, representing a GAAP operating margin of 51.9% - up sharply from just 37.2% in the year-ago quarter. E-Trade's pro forma EPS of $0.88 also edged out over Wall Street consensus of $0.82.At surface level, it seems that E-Trade is doing well. Net new accounts are soaring, daily average revenue trades (DARTs) are up, and operating margins are shooting through the roof and producing strong double-digit EPS growth. Much of this growth, however, is inorganic; and even with multi-billion-dollar asset acquisitions, E-Trade's growth in interest-bearing assets has been far more modest than its account growth.In my view, E-Trade's moat is very thin, and the company is no less susceptible to competitive threats even despite strong Q3 results and a new capital returns program that attempts to instill confidence in the ability of E-Trade's performance. E-Trade will continue to be a losing investment - you're better off investing elsewhere."
4274954,105281,2019-07-15T09:15:05-04:00,"Return on equity performance has been volatile, but sources of volatility have been removed from the balance sheet.Return on asset performance has been improving as management's initiatives on revenue generation and scale have materialized.Asset growth has been reasonable with 2018 being the exception due to major acquisitions; said acquisitions have been performing in-line with management's expectations.Our valuation suggests that investing in ETFC will yield positive returns but we recommend that investors wait until a better entry price materializes (which we estimate to be ~$38) to maintain a wide margin of safety.","In my prior article regarding E-Trade Financial Corporation (ETFC), I discussed how the shift in interest rate expectations would have a negative impact on the company's intrinsic value. In this article, I plan to provide an assessment of ETFC's underlying business quality across time (2002-2018) using key drivers that potential investors and current shareholders should monitor. By the end of this article, I hope that readers will have a better understanding of ETFC's historical performance and its probable earnings generation ability in the near future. Consequently this analysis can be tied to our calculation of a conservative entry price which we will also include in our write-up.ETFC is a financial services company: its primary measure of profitability and performance is return on shareholders' equity. As seen in the chart below, ETFC's return on equity has been very volatile and cyclical. At its worst the company generated a negative return on equity of 41% in 2007 during the financial crisis. Consequently it was forced to raise additional capital during the depth of its financial challenges at the worst possible multiples.We broke out the 2003-2009 and 2010-2018 periods in the table below. The substantial spread between the max and min return on equity metrics are telling. Furthermore, we note that the mean return on equity during the prior economic cycle (2003-2009) was negative 7.1%. While the median return tells a more favorable story during that period we see that the large losses incurred during 2007 essentially wiped out the returns made for the rest of the period.(Source: Company disclosures; Author)The performance of ETFC on a standalone basis looks worse when compared to peers in our coverage: Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Raymond James Financial (RJF).Data by YChartsAccording to the 10-K for 2007, the culprits were losses on sale of asset-backed securities and an increase in loan loss provisions:The disclosure reveals that the bulk of the loss on sale was attributable to a bailout by Citadel in the fourth quarter of 2007. The asset-backed portfolio worth ~$3 billion was essentially sold for a little over $800 million: a loss rate of around 73 cents on the dollar.(Source: ETFC 2007 10-K)Meanwhile, the loan loss provisions were attributed to a general deterioration in the housing market:Pivot towards a more conservative balance sheetThankfully, ETFC has dramatically shifted its balance sheet since the financial crisis. As seen in the graphic below around 71% of interest-earning assets are in investment securities. More importantly, these investment securities are invested in government-backed US Treasuries and agency securities. Both types of securities are practically free of credit risk and pose no danger like those of asset-backed securities ETFC had to sell to Citadel at the height of the financial crisis. Consequently, we now view ETFC's return on equity performance to be more stable in the future (given lower tail risks from extremely volatile asset classes).(Source: ETFC 1Q19 10-Q)(Source: ETFC 1Q19 10-Q)While return on equity is an important metric, it can be heavily influenced by the degree of leverage a company has. Consider that return on equity is simply return on assets multiplied by the assets to equity ratio as described by the DuPont formula. As seen in the chart below, ETFC operates with an assets to equity of around 10x compared to 13x for SCHW and 6x for RJF.Data by YChartsIf we want to strip away the benefit (or burden) of leverage to measure performance, then we should use a return on asset metric instead. As seen in the chart below, ETFC actually overtook RFJ in that metric - reversing the performance gap between the two that starting in the mid-2000s.Data by YChartsWe believe that the catch-up improvements in ETFC's return on assets since the financial crisis were driven by its strategic push to migrate customers to the high-margin self-directed retail channel (vis-a-vis assisted broker channels), by its scale and best-in-class processes to increase productivity of client assets (into client activity and revenue), and by its high incremental margin on revenues (primarily driven by net interest margins).(Source: ETFC 1Q19 Investor Presentation. ROCA: return on client assets; EOCA: expense on client assets; POCA: profit on client assets).We also believe that there are significant tailwinds to the financial management industry and to independent and self-directed channels in particular. Consumers are increasingly dependent on digital channels rather than physical ones (i.e., the retail apocalypse). Consumers (especially the younger generations) utilize financial products and services via technology as seen in the massive adoption of Venmo as a payments and peer-to-peer app. Furthermore, consumers are starting to accept assistance from digital counselors as evidenced by the popularity of Robo-advisors. All of this has led to higher growth rates in the direct space in which ETFC is the market leader.(Source: ETFC 1Q19 Investor Presentation).Outside of our general outlook for interest rates (which we expect to fall given the Dovish tone the Fed has taken), ETFC's core business and expected return on assets should remain stable or improve over time.The third key driver which we monitor for financial services companies is the balance sheet growth as measured by assets. As seen in the chart below, the level of assets for ETFC has been relatively stable outside of the financial crisis in 2008 and acquisitions made in 2018 (e.g., TCA and Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) retail brokerage account acquisitions).(Source: ETFC Disclosures. Units in $ millions).The reason we are concerned with asset growth is that an unusual amount of it is usually a source of risk for financial services companies. In banking, for example, it means underwriting or purchasing loans in areas in which the bank has insufficient underwriting experience and is therefore taking on the risk of truly unseasoned loans. In insurance, for example, it is a similar risk in entering new lines of insurance in which future claims are difficult to estimate and could be well above the value of the premiums received. In the case of ETFC, it could represent a surge in mortgage lending or margin lending (which could pose above average credit losses).Nonetheless, a significant growth in the balance sheet as a result of an acquisition can still be a cause of concern. The accounts brought in from COF may not be behaving as expected (e.g., lower activity or higher risk) and the return on invested capital expected by ETFC may not materialize. Thankfully, in the 1Q19 earnings call Chief Executive Officer Karl A. Roessner states:Driving more revenues from the COF customers would be nice, but we're happy enough with what management has done so far on the integration side. However, the management still does have enough room to continue levering up which can potentially lead to more acquisitions. We would need to keep a close eye on those transactions and make sure that significant balance sheet risks don't materialize.Considering what we know about ETFC's historical return on equity, return on assets, and asset growth. We can now develop an alternative valuation method that relies on a justified price to book valuation. We used a similar valuation method in this article pertaining to RJF. We will also refresh the earnings-based valuation method we used in our prior ETFC article.(Source: ETFC disclosures; Author calculations)Justified price-to-book valuation(Source: ETFC disclosures; Author calculations. Cost of equity assumes a 2% risk-free rate based on the ten-year US treasury rate, a 6% implied equity risk premium based on the research of Professor Aswath Damodaran, and a market beta of 1.0 which we feel is appropriate for financial services companies. Justified price to book is estimated by divided the difference of the return on equity and sustainable growth rate and the difference of the cost of equity and sustainable growth rate)Considering our target return threshold of 15% for a buy recommendation - ETFC's target price falls short by a percentage point. As such, we believe our recommendation in our prior article still stands and that investors should await a better price in order to secure a sufficient margin of safety.We hope that our deep dive into the company's financial history sheds more insights into what matters for us and what we plan to monitor vigorously moving forward.ETFC's return on equity profile was volatile - especially during the financial crisis due to its exposure to credit risk in the asset-backed securities asset class and the real estate market in general. However, it has since de-risked its balance sheet and has practically removed similar tail risks.On the other hand, ETFC's return on assets profile has trended up and has been proof of management's efforts towards more revenue activity per customer and a more scale-driven organization.Finally, ETFC's asset base has remained stable with 2018 being the exception due to notable acquisitions. Said acquisitions have been integrated according to management's plan.Taken together we believe that investing in ETFC will generate positive returns, albeit falling short of our return target of 15%. Hence, we recommend that investors sitting on the sidelines continue to do so until a better entry price materializes (~$38 per share)."
4070639,102028,2017-05-08T12:08:38-04:00,"New CEO moving the company in the right direction.Income statement has been challenged, but balance sheet is healthy.Priced at a discount to peers, providing some value in an otherwise expensive sector.","E*TRADE Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:ETFC) began as a discount brokerage company 35 years ago in Palo Alto, California. Its initial online services were offered through America Online and Compuserve (can you even imagine using dial-up to place trades or transfer funds?!). It slowly grew throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, taking advantage of the rapid advances in technology, the tech stock bubble and investors' increased appetite for online stock trading. As online trading became more mainstream, the company acquired several competitors such as Web Street Securities (2001), Harrisdirect (2005) and Brown & Company (2005). By the time the financial crisis emerged in 2007, E*TRADE was on the brink of disaster after an ill-fated adventure into the mortgage business. Citadel Investments came to the rescue with a $2.6 billion cash infusion, in exchange for 20% of the company. Ten years later, the company has basically abandoned the mortgage business while refocusing its efforts and investments on offering clients a premium online and mobile service. Today, the company has over $330 billion in customer assets, 3.5 million brokerage accounts and over 200k DARTs (Daily Average Revenue Trades). Once again, the company is in a position to bolster its client offerings via acquisitions, the latest being the acquisition of OptionsHouse for $725 million in 2016. In response to competitors' cuts in trading commissions earlier this year, the company has also reduced its trading commissions. Undoubtedly, the company's fundamentals have improved recently, and by all appearances, new CEO Karl Roessner has the wherewithal to continue providing a world-class investing platform. But, as my readers have come to learn from my previous articles, there is not a lot of value to be found in the brokerage space. However, E*TRADE might be a good place for investors now. The stock is definitely not trading at a premium to its peers; in fact, you will see in my analysis that it is deservedly trading at a discount relative to its closest competitors. The new CEO and the turnaround plan, in the face of an industry-wide price war, still have to prove themselves. The company was very close to a complete failure ten years ago; it must tread carefully to become the industry leader it so badly wants to be.E*TRADE has had a wild ride since 2005, when this analysis begins. Total net revenues actually peaked in 2006 at $2.4 billion and have yet to hit that level since. In fact, revenues declined each year from 2010 through 2015, before increasing 42% in 2016 to $1.9 billion. Commission revenue, the largest component of non-interest revenues, has declined steadily from a peak of $664 million in 2007 to $442 million in 2016. Additionally, revenues from fees, trading and other revenues have been inconsistent, at best. Total non-interest revenues have declined 1% annually from 2005 to the present day. Net interest income (NYSEMKT:NII) has been the top line bright spot, sporting a 2.5% CAGR over this period, primarily due to the dramatic decline in interest expense over this period. Overall, not exactly a picture of consistency at the top line with basically flat revenues over the long term and declining revenues over the past five and ten years.ETFC Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsOperating expenses, on the other hand, have actually increased over the period 2005 - 2016, increasing at a 2% CAGR. This increase in expenses has been driven primarily by compensation and advertising expenses. Compensation expense was 26% of net revenues in 2016, up from the high teens following the financial crisis in 2010 and 2011. Advertising expense has averaged about 7% of net revenues over this same period of time, but has increased about 2% annually. Recently, the company has indicated that they plan a new marketing campaign with a new marketing consultant. Investors should watch that this expense line does not get much higher than 8% of net revenues.ETFC Total Operating Expenses (Annual) data by YChartsAs mentioned previously, the company has basically abandoned the mortgage and lending business. I think this is the right decision. With the benefit of hindsight, I cannot understand why they got caught up in that in the first place. As a result, the provision for loan losses, which reached a high of $1.6 billion in 2008, was actually a $149 million benefit in 2016. As such, this has been the primary driver of the increase in operating income, which posted a recent high of $838 million, or 43% of net revenues, in 2016. But given the volatility of provisions and non-interest expenses, the operating margin has been terribly inconsistent, with no real trends one way of the other.ETFC Operating Margin (Annual) data by YChartsThe company has posted positive net income in each of the past four years, with net margins increasing to 28% in 2016. Additionally, EPS growth has averaged almost 30% annually over the past five years, which is quite impressive. This earnings and EPS growth is driven solely by the reduction in the provision for loan losses. Remove that line from the income statement, and income shows a fairly remarkable decline over this period.ETFC EPS Diluted (Annual) data by YChartsThe income statement is not exactly a picture of excellence. ETFC has faced some major challenges over the past 12 years. The mortgage crisis put the company on the brink of failure, the low interest rate environment has put pressure on interest income, and the competitive pricing of trading commissions have limited the growth in commission revenue. These revenue headwinds coupled with an incoherent expense management strategy has resulted in very inconsistent results. It seems that the current management team has perhaps steadied the ship, with its recent results showing some early signs of promise.As terrible as the income statement has looked, the balance sheet, on the other hand, actually looks quite good. Asset growth has basically been flat, primarily since the mortgage lending business has wound down to the point where loans are now less than 10% of total assets. Securities are over 60% of total assets, compared to less than 20% before the financial crisis. Deposits have increased to about 65% of total assets and long-term debt has decreased to just 2% of total assets, or less than $1 billion at the end of 2016. Shareholders' equity has shown very positive growth of 4.9% annually over the past five years. Equity now represents about 13% of total assets, which is more than double what it was in 2007 and 2008. So, overall, I really like the progress the company has made with improving the balance sheet. Leverage is down, equity is up and the company is really seeing a successful strategy of building its deposit platform through E*TRADE Bank.ETFC Total Assets (Annual) data by YChartsFinally, a quick comment on cash flow. Despite the aforementioned headwinds and the many challenges EFTC has faced over the past decade, the company manages to generate positive operating cash flow just about each year. 2012 was the exception, which coincided with their last reported loss.ETFC Cash from Operations (Annual) data by YChartsReturn on common equity has been trending in the right direction. ROCE in 2016 was 9.5%, the highest level since 2006 before the financial crisis. Also, the capital structure leverage ratio is just over 8x, which is the lowest over the period of my analysis, and less than half what it was in 2008.ETFC Return on Equity (Annual) data by YChartsTo summarize the financial analysis, the income statement is good, not great. The balance sheet looks solid and appears to be on the right trajectory. The company seems to be able to generate positive operating cash flow. Return on common equity is healthy and leverage is declining. Sounds like a decent story, right?The stock's performance tells a different story. It's hard to believe but ETFC traded as high as $722 in 1999 and the stock had two 2 for 1 stock splits that same year. Amazing. More recently, the stock was over $250 in the months before the financial crisis. Then the bottom fell out late in 2007, the stock hit a low of about $5.90 in 2009, and then there was a 1 for 10 reverse stock split in 2010. It had basically been a grind to get to $28.65 on Election Day in 2016. Since then, the stock is up over 25% riding the ""Trump Bump"" wave of optimism for regulatory and tax reform.ETFC data by YChartsAt its recent price, the stock is trading at a P/E of 19x LTM earnings and a P/B of 1.6x, both of which seem fairly reasonable, particularly compared to competitors Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) which are trading at about 28x and 25x LTM earnings, respectively. Additionally, SCHW and AMTD are trading at about 4x book value. ETFC is trading at the lower end of its P/E range and the higher end of its P/B range. Relative to its primary competitors, ETFC is arguably slightly less expensive, although it may be a bit pricey relative to its fundamentals.ETFC PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsIt should be noted that ETFC could benefit more than its peers as this lower commission pricing takes hold and interest rates rise. ETFC relies on net interest income to a much greater extent than either SCHW or AMTD:2016 dataAs these companies continue to punish one another with lower trading commissions and as interest rates are expected to rise over the next 12 - 18 months (a recession notwithstanding), ETFC could actually benefit here. Management indicated that an additional rate hike later this year could add up to 100 basis points to their full year operating margin target. A rising rate environment could definitely provide a nice tail wind to the company.The stock is appropriately priced relative to its peers since the company has not yet proven they can produce consistent earnings growth, unlike SCHW and AMTD which churn out steady earnings growth year after year. The big question here is can the new CEO deliver on his major initiatives and become a steady earnings producer. I think it is still very early in the game, as Mr. Roessner has only had the top job less than a year. So far, he seems to have handled the major competitor pricing moves as well as could be expected. He seems to be focused on providing a solid, customer experience via the online and mobile platforms. Investors now need to wait to see if these moves will pay off.The entire industry is trading at or near its 52-week highs, given the enthusiasm following President Trump's Election Day victory. ETFC is priced at a discount relative to its peers. If you are looking for exposure to the brokerage industry, this is probably your best bet right now. I typically am hesitant to recommend anything trading near its recent highs, but I could see the stock continue to drift higher as investors gain more confidence in the direction E*TRADE is heading. A 10-15% rise would put the stock in the $40 - $42 range, at a multiple that is still less than its peers. Beware, though, the high beta. At the first signs that President Trump's agenda is going nowhere, this stock will probably erase its entire post-Election Day rally, returning to the $28 - $30 range. Trade carefully."
4107555,21815,2017-09-18T05:16:11-04:00,Slowly but surely E*TRADE is shedding its troubled past.Metrics are improving and it's likely this will continue.We think these are reasons the value gap with the competition will decline.,"Here is how CEO Karl Roessner characterized the second quarter during the Q2CC:Indeed, results were pretty good:In a way, the company is a bank, providing credit on the basis of collateral - that is, margin debt or stuff like share lending to shorts. For instance, customer margin balances amounted to $8.2B in the quarter.Net interest income is the largest category of income, rising from $286M in Q2 2016 to $356M this quarter. Income from commissions was actually down to $105M, from $106M in Q2 2016 en $127M in Q1 2017 as the company reduced commissions for the acquired OptionsHouse customers and as a result of a competitive market environment.Here is the last year in perspective, over a five year period:Revenues only really started to grow last year but profitability has been improving quite a lot over the years.However, the driver behind that is actually a remnant of a dubious past, when E*TRADE entered the mortgage business a decade or so ago. While they have abandoned that business, there are still lots of loans on the books. But a steady decrease of provisions for loan losses has driven the profitability of the company.The company has done it before:One element delivering a healthy increase in EPS:And EPS is likely to get another fillip, not only from increased earnings, but from the announced substantial new $1B buyback program until the end of 2018. That's nearly 10% of outstanding shares.The buyback is largely the result of the lowering of their consolidated tier-1 leverage threshold (from 7.5 to 6.5), which freed up some $520M in excess parent capital.The integration of OptionsHouse (bought for $725M in 2016) is nearing completion. In August, the OptionsHouse customers have been integrated in the E*TRADE platform, but integration is a sensitive issue. Here is CEO Roessner explaining things during the Q2CC:Most of it is done though, and most of the synergies, that is, all of the revenue synergies and most of the expense synergies ($49M) will have been realized this quarter.The largest part of revenue synergies actually come from the cash balances of the OptionsHouse customers which the company can deploy in a better rate environment.And then there are the state of the art tools from OptionsHouse which have only recently started to roll-out to E*TRADE customers. Management expects this to have quite an impact.For instance, futures trading is only 2% of DATRs, but the company is aiming to get this to 10% with the help of OptionsHouse.As interest bearing income is a greater part of revenues at E*TRADE compared to competitors like TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD), Interactive Brokers (IKBR) and Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), the company stands to gain from a rise in interest rates. In fact, this has already been happening.Average interest earning assets increased by $3.2B and net interest rate margin increased by 11 basis points to 274 basis point, the result of the Fed hike.The company is doing quite well in asset management for clients. They are particularly interested in the corporate services part, where they focus on all levels of a company, not just the top.Management thinks they can win market share here because of that, and because of the quality of their platform and the fact that a number of competitors have outsourced the software.In the corporate stock plan business, the company has about 1.5M corporate plan participants, which can potentially be turned into E*TRADE customers.They seem to be making some overall progress in the managed asset space. From the Q2CC:Managed assets is a wider category than just corporate clients, but nevertheless this is a metric in their core business that is moving in the right direction. Their goal is to achieve $6B in managed assets.There is also what's called the adaptive portfolio, which is a robo adviser. It has about 400M in assets right now, with room for expansion.While the company has been able to steadily improve its balance sheet, results have been quite dependent on improvements in provisions for loan losses. We have no reason to expect this not to continue but we have little visibility on that. And with loans now below 10% of assets, the scope for further gains seems to be declining. This is what management had to say on the Q2CC:The conversion takes place after a 10 year period of interest only loans, with the 2007 loans the most vulnerable for obvious reasons. However, 10 years on, these loans are seemingly in better shape than anticipated, hence the continuous decline of loss provisions.So he company will have to improve its core business, which isn't something they have been able to do on a consistent basis, at least so far. On the other hand, the company expects ongoing reductions in loss provisions, so that hasn't run its course yet.Valuation has been relatively constant on earnings but crept up on enterprise value.As a result of the dependence on the reductions in provisions for loan losses, the company is valued considerably below most of its peers.Analysts on average expect EPS of $2.26 this year, rising to $2.49 in 2018, giving the company a valuation in the mid teens. It still trades at a considerable discount to its peers, as one can see above.It is time for the company's core brokerage business to step up its performance. The company needs to deliver on its core business as it cannot rely on benefiting from lower loan default provisions forever.There are signs the company is indeed delivering on this. And with higher rates and the integration of OptionsHouse there certainly is scope for improvement - but it's early days."
3482726,22148,2015-09-01T15:53:27-04:00,E*Trade Financial was listed as one of the most oversold stocks.The stock declines appear justified after the large gains in early 2015 that weren't justified.E*Trade is likely to face earnings cuts from the weak stock market environment and reduced expectations for increases in interest rates.,"The collapsing stock markets and reduced hopes for rising interest rates have hit some financial stocks very hard. One stock hit hard is E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) that ironically has limited exposure to China. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) even listed the stock as one of the most oversold stocks in the current market.Brokerages such as E*Trade Financial, TD Ameritrade Holding (NASDAQ:AMTD) and Interactive Brokers Group (NASDAQ:IBKR) stand to benefit extensively from higher interest rates that allows the corporations to collect more income from margin loans. Though the market turmoil could increase equity trading levels, E*Trade is down nearly 20% since the stock peaked on June 23. The majority of the losses occurred in the last two weeks, but is the drop in the stocks justified?ETFC data by YChartsDependent On The SpreadWhile most people see E*Trade as a brokerage that makes money off commissions, the majority of revenue comes from interest income. In Q2, the company made $267 million off net interest income and only $167 million off commissions and fees. Both revenue totals were weak compared to the prior quarter.The net interest spread was down to only 2.50%, compared to 2.62% in the prior quarter and 2.55% in the prior year. Clearly, interest rate spread makes a big difference to the financials of E*Trade. Even with the weak interest rate environment, the company sill obtained roughly 60% of revenue from charging interest on loans including the lucrative margin loans that are near record levels.Some of the market volatility in August could help with trading volumes, but in general E*Trade and the other online brokers are struggling to grow volumes due to competition and reduced retail participation in the stock markets after the financial crisis. For July, the monthly DARTs (daily active revenue trades) were down 3% from last year.The ability to grow commission and fee related revenues appears limited so the key to the E*Trade story is the need to grow interest income from higher interest rates.Solid Earnings AnywayThe other side of the story is that E*Trade is generating solid profits despite a weak interest rate environment. The stock was up over $30 on the basis of profits jumping next year on the back of higher interest rates leading to a larger spread, but it isn't like the online brokerage needs higher rates for a viable business.E*Trade earned roughly $0.25 or slightly more in the last four quarters. Unfortunately though, the company has a $1.10 EPS runrate with the stock trading over $25. E*Trade trades at about 23x the base EPS case if rates don't rise.Analysts forecast the brokerage making $1.45 next year for a 30% jump in earnings per share. The number appears very aggressive considering the push back on interest rate hikes.Considering the difficulty of the brokerage making the 2016 EPS estimates, the forward PE of 17.7 for the stock appears aggressive. E*Trade trades similar to the online brokerage sector so it doesn't offer any special value either.ETFC PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsTakeawayThe recent drops in the online brokerage stocks like E*Trade Financial actually appears justified. The stocks ramped up in early 2015 due to the potential for higher interest rates that aren't materializing. With limited potential to grow the business outside of a higher interest rate spread, E*Trade doesn't offer much value even after the recent drop. The likelihood that analysts cut 2016 estimates will hold the stock down for now."
4064317,22148,2017-04-22T17:40:21-04:00,E*Trade reported decent Q1 results.The online brokerage faces a competitive environment that will pressure Q2 margins.Investors shouldn't expect the company to reach EPS targets.,"Despite recently trading at multi-year highs, E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) reported Q1 results with several discouraging metrics. The recent slashing of commissions doesn't help the expectations for the future competitive environment of the sector.Once factoring in the numbers for recently purchased OptionsHouse, a lot of the growth metrics aren't probably as impressive. The question is whether the stock is a buy at $34.55?E*Trade beat Q1 estimates by $0.09 which is the standard beat over the last year. The important number though is that the actual results aren't actually growing. The actual EPS has been stuck at or below $0.50 for a while now.Source: Seeking Alpha EarningsThe online brokerage earns revenue on two key fronts: interest income and commissions. In both cases, the rate per unit is declining.The key net interest margin is in decline as well despite the rate hike and somewhat counters the bull case for the stock. The margin dipped to 263 bps from 281 bps last Q1. In addition, the company outlined a scenario for higher NIM on rate hikes, if the competitive environment doesn't alter the outcome.Not as important as interest margins is the commissions for trades. For Q1, the average commission declined to $9.87 from $10.64 last year.The 7% decline from last year doesn't fully capture the pricing battle that started in March. Competitors like Fidelity and Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) cut equity trades to $4.95 causing E*Trade to lower commissions from $9.99 to $4.95 for those that trade more than 30 times per quarter. The company placed the pro forma commission rate down at only $8.10 per trade.For Q1, E*Trade only got about 20% of $553 million in revenues from commissions. The move was long overdue and only brings the company back into line with large brokerage competitors and still far above the likes of Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR).The key investor takeaway is that the sector remains far too competitive to pay up for E*Trade. One should probably question whether the online broker reaches an annual EPS of $2 and makes me unwilling to buy the stock above $35."
4039570,23479,2017-01-26T01:06:45-05:00,"Considering a significant improvement across all its key metrics in October and November, we expect the growth momentum that the company saw in the first three quarters to be reflected in Q4 results as well.E*Trade's revenues grew by about 13% in the first three quarters of 2016, excluding the $370 million loss in Q3 2015 related to the termination of wholesale funding obligations, and the consensus estimates peg fourth-quarter growth in a similar range.We believe the growth momentum spilled over in December because of highly volatile market conditions resulting from the presidential election results and improvement in the U.S. economy.","E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) will announce its Q4 2016 results on January 26th. Considering a significant improvement across all its key metrics in October and November, we expect the growth momentum that the company saw in the first three quarters to be reflected in Q4 results as well. E*Trade's revenues grew by about 13% in the first three quarters of 2016, excluding the $370 million loss in Q3 2015 related to the termination of wholesale funding obligations, and the consensus estimates peg fourth-quarter growth in a similar range. The year 2016 was full of challenges for brokerages, with industry wide-decline in trading volumes due to unfavorable macro conditions in the U.S. and stiff competition from traditional and discount brokerages. However, a sudden surge in trading volumes in the fourth quarter is likely to have positive bearing on the company's top line. Additionally, the acquisition of OptionsHouse in July is likely to contribute significantly to the growth in the brokerage accounts and trading volumes. We also expect the recent interest rate hike by the Fed to have a positive impact on the brokerage's interest-earning assets.Trading Revenues Will Benefit From The U.S. Presidential Election And Improving Market ConditionsTrading commissions account for nearly a quarter of the company's overall revenues. Although the first three quarters saw a marginal decline in revenue from this segment in comparison to the prior year, October and November saw a surge in trading volumes by 17% and 40%, respectively. We believe the growth momentum spilled over in December because of highly volatile market conditions resulting from the presidential election results and improvement in the U.S. economy.Fed's Guidance Continues To Boost Interest Earning RevenuesInterest-earning assets, which generate about 60% of the company's revenues, displayed 5% growth, generating 15% growth in revenues in the September quarter. The Fed's rate hike by 25 basis points contributed to this surge in assets. Additionally, the company has the highest yield on assets (at 2.7% in comparison to its competitors), which has contributed to an impressive growth in revenue. We believe the growth momentum spilled over in the December quarter as well, due to the 25 basis point rate hike announcement.The company's focus on increasing its customer base, mainly by extensive marketing of its products and services, is likely to have enhanced the growth of both customer accounts and assets. Its digital advisory service, E-Trade's Adaptive Portfolio, is likely to have boosted the company's assets under management."
4276404,105281,2019-07-22T09:45:12-04:00,"The company announced a massive $1.5 billion buyback program, amounting to 14% of market capitalization. However, investors should remain vigilant of key risks.First, we are cautious of the unrealized losses in the available-for-sale investment book. They may not be as temporary as we hope.Second, we are wary of ETFC's ability to deliver on the $7 earnings per share by 2023. Lower interest rates and balance sheet constraints make the number hard to meet.Finally we refresh our valuation of ETFC and find that the upside of 10% is insufficient margin of safety - especially when we consider execution and interest rate risks.We maintain our negative view on the stock. Sell or avoid.","E-Trade Financial Corporation (ETFC), in its second quarter earnings conference call, announced a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. Considering the $11.1 billion market capitalization of ETFC as of 18 July 2019, the share buyback program represents approximately 14% of total market capitalization. Such a large transfer of resources to shareholders was welcomed by the market as shares closed higher by 1.73% day on day.(Source: ETFC Ticker page on SA)However, we think that investors should focus on more than the announced buyback. Our analysis of the second quarter results affirm our negative view of ETFC at its current price. In this article we will highlight some of the issues we think should give ETFC shareholders or prospective investors pause.ETFC management disclosed key financial metrics for the second quarter in the press released. We have summarized the headline figures in the table below. Note that the headline figures for the second quarter are all below those for the prior quarter and the prior year. Management attributes this deterioration to a one-time loss on sale of investment securities as part of its balance sheet reorganization.(Source: ETFC 2Q19 earnings press release)Here is Chief Financial Officer (NASDAQ:CFO) Chad E. Turner in the second quarter earnings call:We find the loss on investments peculiar given the decline in the benchmark interest rates over the second quarter. As seen in the chart below, the U.S. 10 Year Treasury Note yield has actually fallen from well above 2.5% in the first quarter of 2019 to around 2.0% by the end of the second quarter. The decline in yields should have benefited most fixed income-based securities.(Source: MarketWatch)We cross-referenced the level of unrealized losses in ETFC's balance sheet and found that as of the end of the first quarter of 2019 (which is the latest information available since the 10-Q for the second quarter has not been filed yet) there is $200 million worth of losses in the available-for-sale (AFS) investment book.(Source: ETFC 1Q19 10-Q)Our concern is that the remaining unrealized losses in the AFS investment book are actually non-temporary (as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) and should be recognized as a loss in the income statement rather than as a direct charge to equity in the balance sheet.(Source: ETFC 2018 10-K)In fact, Richard Henry Repetto from Sandler O'Neill+ Partners asked a question related to this topic during the earnings call. Chief Operating Officer (NYSE:COO) Michael A. Pizzi responded:We are not challenging the existence of higher-yielding investments in ETFC's AFS investment portfolio. Instead we wonder whether the non-temporary classification for these unrealized losses are appropriate. We also recognize the wide degree of discretion management has in determining the accounting treatment for this event (and the degree of subjectivity involved in these issues).Finally, we want to highlight that the impact of valuation changes in the income statement affect management compensation; adjustments to net income and return on equity key performance indicators are primarily limited to after-tax effects of goodwill and provision for loan losses. Hence, there is a real financial incentive for management to maintain the temporary status for unrealized losses.We note that Chief Executive Officer (NYSE:CEO) Karl A. Roessner reaffirmed ETFC's commitment to the long-term EPS target of greater than $7 per share during the second quarter earnings call.Recall that we discussed this target in one of our first article regarding ETFC. Note that achieving the $7 per share EPS was partially hinged on the Fed funds rate. Management assumed that there would be no changes in the policy rate until 2023. We said in our article that we found the Fed's dovish stance has put management's aspirations at risk.(Source: ETFC 1Q19 earnings presentation)Since then management has converged to our perspective and has retooled its assumptions to account for two rate cuts totaling 50 bps in 2019 and no further policy action until 2023 (as seen in the chart below). Despite assuming a significant decline in the fed funds rate (which will likely result in a meaningful net interest margin compression), ETFC maintains its EPS target.(Source: ETFC 2Q19 earnings presentation)We are skeptical of how management reconciles a lower interest rate environment with double-digit earnings growth all the way to 2023.First, the market is already expecting a more aggressive decline in the Fed funds rate. Here is rate strategist Jon Hill speaking to CNBC:In fact, the futures market is pricing in a 50% chance of a 50 bps cut in July.(Source: CME FedWatch Tool)Second, even if we assume that the Fed only cuts rates by 50 bps until 2023, the impact to EFTC could already be substantial. According to the company's own scenario analysis, it stands to lose $88 million per year in earnings for a 50 bps cut in rates (according to the 2018 10-K). A summary of the company's interest rate scenario analysis is in the graphic below.(Source: ETFC 2018 10-K)The sensitivity analysis of ETFC can be found in the table below. Note that $88 million is roughly 10% of the annualized 2Q19 net income of $876 million (i.e., $219 million 2Q19 net income multiplied by four). ETFC would have to achieve the mid-teens annual earnings growth on top of an initial decline of 10% resulting from a change in the interest rate environment.(Source: ETFC 2018 10-K)For more information about ETFC's interest rate sensitivity, refer to our prior article here. In there we highlight that 67% of the company's trailing 12-month net revenues (e.g., net interest income and off-balance sheet sweep revenues) are directly affected by movement in interest rates. The rest of the business (which includes revenues from commissions and order flow business) comprises just 33% of the remaining revenues.Beyond management's expectations of the extent net interest margin compression, we are also wary of their contradictory statements with respect to the relationship between the balance sheet and achieving the earnings per share target. Note that in the revised guidance regarding the EPS target, one of the components of revenue growth is balance sheet growth. Essentially we expect this to mean that management will continue to grow customer balances in both sweep and savings and deploy those to interest-earning assets.However, it seems that management has shifted the strategy towards reducing the size of the balance sheet. Here is CEO Karl A. Roessner during the second quarter earnings call:Shifting deposits off-balance sheet means that cash sweep will be deployed to third party banks rather than in investment securities, loans, or other receivables in ETFC's balance sheet. This feels contrary to management's own guidance with respect to achieving the EPS target.Brennan Hawken from UBS Investment Bank posed a question in line with our own during the second quarter earnings call:To which CFO Chad E. Turner responds:We recognize that deciding between to buy back shares and to expand the balance sheet is very much dependent on the macroeconomic and operating environment. However, we think that achieving the $7 per share by 2023 would require a meaningful contribution from both share buybacks and balance sheet expansion rather than just having one or the other. Accounting for the incoming net interest margin compression just makes this expectation more valid.We have generally remained skeptical of ETFC achieving the $7 EPS target by 2023. The developments in the second quarter have only nudged us towards the more skeptical camp rather than the less.We now estimate a fair value and a target buy price for ETFC based on the second quarter earnings, management's comments, and our own views. In particular, we will be using a justified price to book valuation methodology. It is an approach we feel comfortable using for financial services companies. We used a similar valuation methodology in this article pertaining to Raymond James Financial (RJF).Note that this approach was detailed in-depth in the Equities section of the Chartered Financial Analyst (NASDAQ:CFA) Level II materials. The summarized version of this can be found in The CFA Glossary Blogspot. It is essentially an implication of the Dividend Discount Model as seen in the derivation below:(Source: CFA Glossary Blogspot)We prefer this valuation method as financial services companies are primarily constrained by capital. More capital retained by the entity will almost always result in more earnings. Thus, we are less inclined to use an earning-based valuation model. Nonetheless, we present one here as well to provide an alternative valuation model and to create a range of valuation estimates for our readers' appreciation.First, we estimate the run-rate adjusted net income to common shareholders. We take the trailing twelve months' net income of the company (from the second quarter earnings press release) and adjust it for the reversal of loan loss reserves and the loss on extinguishment of debt. We model a decline in earnings from a 50 bps decline in interest rates (amounting to $88 million as estimated by the company). The resulting figure is our run-rate adjusted net income to common (shareholders).(Source: ETFC disclosures; Author)Next we divide the run-rate adjusted net income to common by the end-2018 shareholders' equity to estimate the run-rate return on equity. We assume a 2% risk-free rate (as given by the current yield of the ten-year U.S. Treasury note), a 6% implied equity risk premium based on the research of Professor Aswath Damodaran, and a market beta of 1.0 which we feel is appropriate for financial services companies. Justified price to book is estimated by divided the difference of the return on equity and sustainable growth rate and the difference of the cost of equity and sustainable growth rate(Source: ETFC disclosures; Author calculations)Alternatively, we can calculate a target price for end-2023 using an earning-based methodology to triangulate our valuation from the justified price-to-book approach.(Source: ETFC disclosures; Author)We have downshifted the revenue growth assumption to 5% from our prior assumption of 7% (as per management's revised guidance). These figures are very generous with respect to giving managers the benefit of the doubt on the execution side of the business. Should management fail to generate the 5% revenue growth and the 3% operating margins growth over the next three to five years then the share price may fall far below our estimates.Another risk would be a more aggressive reduction in the Fed funds rate. Recall that every 50 bps reduction results in a decline in earnings of $88 million as per management's calculations.Finally for the earnings-based approach, we calculate a target buy price given a 15% rate of return hurdle over the next three years. As seen in the table below, our target buy price for ETFC is at most $40.14 per share(Source: ETFC disclosures; Author)We consider 15% as the target return threshold for a buy recommendation. ETFC's expected return at the target price is only 10%. This estimate does not even account for execution and interest rate risks (i.e., Fed funds rate declines by more than 50 bps). We find that ETFC has insufficient margin of safety for a long-term investment. Consequently we maintain our sell recommendation for ETFC.ETFC is priced at a relative discount compared to the other companies in our coverage in which we use a justified price to book valuation. We think that ETFC faces a similar set of market risks to RFJ but has a weaker return profile, and hence, a lower valuation. ETFC and RJF carry a balance sheet exposure to agency securities and loans (with a slightly different mix reflective of the size of their respective balance sheets).On the other hand, ETFC has a lower risk profile compared to SYF but its return profile is insufficient to close the gap with Synchrony Financial (SYF). SYF is primarily exposed to credit card, personal, and other consumer loans whereas ETFC is exposed to agency securities, real estate loans, and margin receivables.(Source: Author)We applaud the massive capital return program announced by the company during the second quarter earnings call.However, we think that investors should also consider the factors we've highlighted in this article: the potential losses in the investment book and the risks relating to management's 2023 EPS target.ETFC's current price is too high relative to our price target estimate and our return requirements. We think that investors should avoid this stock until a better price presents itself or the fundamentals shift to high gear."
4130073,102269,2017-12-06T12:34:41-05:00,The industry has consolidated.Interest earnings assets are increasing.Interest rates are increasing.,"In August of this year I logged into my E*TRADE (ETFC) account for the first time in four years. Four years ago I had switched my own personal account from E*TRADE to OptionsHouse in order to take advantage of the latter’s competitive rates. In an ironic turn of events OptionsHouse was bought by E*TRADE last year and fully integrated all accounts by August, bringing me back to the broker I left.E*TRADE is not alone in acquiring smaller brokers. In the past five years the online brokerage industry has seen acquisition after acquisition. Smaller brokers like OptionsExpress, TradeKing, and TradeMonster have been eaten up by their larger competitors. Late last year the largest merger in the industry was announced when the 2nd largest discount broker by accounts TD Ameritrade agreed to buy the 4th largest Scottrade for $4 billion. This consolidation has been good for the industry from the investor’s point of view. The price wars and race to the financial bottom, which defined much of the industry some 5 years ago, have become less of a problem. The upper end of the industry (TD Ameritrade, E*TRADE, Fidelity, etc.) are focusing less on trading fees and more on advisory tools and services.While trading fees and commissions are the most apparent ways E*TRADE and other discount brokers generate cash flows, a majority of their revenue streams come from utilizing customer deposits by investing them interest bearing securities. By the end of Q3 E*TRADE’s interest earning assets stood at $56.2 billion. A breakdown of these assets is below.YTD interest earning assets has made up more than 60% of E*TRADE's revenue stream. While daily average revenue trades or DARTs are at record highs, Etrade had made the decision to cut their trading fees for stock and ETF trades from $9.99 to $6.95. This has brought down their overall average revenue per trade to fall to $7.76 compared to $10.97 in Q3 2016. Looking forward, most revenue growth for ETRADE will have to come from interest earning assets.Last year Karl Roessner took up the role as CEO and outlined a plan to increase assets under management. The first point was to fully integrate OptionsHouse within E*TRADE, adding both customers’ assets and derivative tools. Personally as one of these customers who has had his account integrated into E*TRADE, I have been satisfied. Their mobile app is leaps and bounds better than the app OptionsHouse had. The pricing too has become more competitive with the price cut mentioned earlier, and developments like E*TRADE Pro which gives discounts for customers who trade often has been a plus. E*TRADE has been especially focused on catering to lucrative derivative traders. Derivative accounts are much more likely to trade on margin, which gives E*TRADE higher interest rates compared to agency securities.Roessner’s second point was to reinvigorate their marketing in an effort to bring in new accounts. E*TRADE has always had one of the best marketing campaigns within the industry. Their baby investor commercials are the most recognized in the industry. Now they have started a campaign, with the theme “Don’t Get Mad! Get E*TRADE!” The marketing campaign is attempting to relate to individuals “frustrated with the system” to join E*TRADE and gain through the system.The results of this campaign have been positive. At the end of Q3 Net new brokerage accounts had increased by 4.8%. Net new brokerage assets has broken its decelerating trend and has increased by 4.4% on a annualized basis.Looking forward I expect E*TRADE to be able to grow new brokerage assets between 4-5% over the next few years.US GDP growth has been strong this year and is expected to be going into 2018. Unemployment at the lowest point it's been at in 17 years. The Federal Reserve is strongly expected to raise rates multiple times in the coming year. This is a net positive for E*TRADE which only pays 2 basis points on customer deposits and has little corporate debt compared to its assets. E*TRADE has already begun to feel the effects of the increased rates this year. In Q3 of this year the average interest earned on assets was at 285 basis points, 20 more than the average interest earned in 2016. As some of their lower interest holdings begin to mature, and as rates continue to increase I expect E*TRADE’s average interest on assets to be a full 30-40 basis points higher next year than it was in the 3rd quarter. This by itself could increase revenues by 6.5%-8.7%, assuming 0 gain in actual assets.Currently E*TRADE trades at 19.1 times average estimates for 2018 earnings. While this may seem a little high at first glance, analysts estimate earnings to grow at around 16-17% per year. Additionally I believe analyst estimates of $2.61 are a little low and put my own estimate at $2.87 or 17.3 times earnings and a 1 year target of $60 a share."
4010390,84946,2016-10-05T15:33:20-04:00,"0.05-0.10% are about as low as fund expense ratios go, but add up to over $300 million each year in fees for a service many investors can easily replicate.Stock portfolios over about $100,000 are finding it increasingly easy and inexpensive to cut out the fund layer and enjoy benefits of direct stock ownership, including tax loss harvesting.ETFs still have a few advantages over traditional open and closed end mutual funds, but these are being lost to technology and falling trading costs especially for domestic stock funds.","Ask 100 fee-only financial advisors how they would invest an extra $100,000 that was not needed for at least 10 years, and odds are that one of the top responses would be to simply buy and hold a low-cost, broadly diversified index fund or ETF.This article makes no attempt to debate whether to invest in active vs. passive funds, nor whether the S&P 500 is the right or best index to use as a benchmark vs. any other index. Rather, I explain below how an investor may decide to track an index like the S&P 500 through a passive portfolio of direct stock positions instead of through an index fund or exchange traded fund (ETF).How To Track The S&P 500 As Completely As PossibleThe Standard & Poor's 500 index remains one of the most, if not the most, liquid and widely used investment benchmarks in the world. Ask 100 traders how they would invest US$1 billion in ""the market"" as quickly as possible, odds are that the top answers would include buying either S&P 500 futures or an S&P 500 ETF. The SPDR (Standard & Poor's Depository Receipt) S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) is the oldest (founded 1993) and still by far the most liquid S&P 500 ETF, but is no longer the largest ETF, or even the largest S&P 500 ETF, having been surpassed in size by the lower-cost Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO), whose management company pioneered low-cost S&P 500 index funds with the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (MUTF:VFINX) back in 1976. Below are some summary statistics of the top three S&P 500 ETFs:These top three ETFs represent three of the largest ETF managers. State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) manages the SPDR ETF brand while BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) owns the iShares brand, in addition to a suite of other separate account management, custody, cash management, and other services these giants provide to institutional investors globally. Vanguard is the world's largest provider of mutual funds and second largest provider of ETFs, but unlike STT and BLK, Vanguard has a mutual structure where it is owned by investors in its funds, and so is able to pass its profits back to its fund investors in the form of lower fees.VOO likely attracted an amount of assets under management (AUM) surpassing SPY's with its substantially lower expense ratio, but its lower volume indicates that VOO is still the ETF of the long-term ""buy and hold"" investor while SPY remains the choice of larger traders seeking the deepest liquidity. While the annual fees on these funds are among the lowest of any funds anywhere in the industry, they do still add up to massive dollar amounts for large investors, totaling almost $200 million, $125 million, and $55 million in the annual net expense ratios of SPY, VOO and IVV, respectively. Some of these millions are licensing fees paid to Standard & Poor's for its work on maintaining the index, but the other services provided by an index fund are increasingly replaceable by lower cost access to direct stock portfolios, especially for medium-sized investors whose #1 priority is not just minimizing tracking error. For much larger investors, Vanguard offers even further price breaks with expense ratios reduced to 0.02% for $200 million and 0.01% for $5 billion (though I am sure at those sizes, prices are negotiable and not fixed on a website).An investor investing about $10 million can almost fully replicate the S&P 500 by purchasing 50,000 shares of SPY and paying the $3,000 fee to exchange this ""creation unit"" for proportionate number of whole shares of each of the 508 stocks held by SPY. Alternately, the investor could simply go out into the market and buy the same number of shares in each of the 508 stocks, paying $500-5,000 in commissions plus perhaps some slippage and trading costs. The investor could then passively hold these 508 stocks, deciding what to do with each dividend, voter proxy, and index changes as they happen.The investor would have to directly sort out if/how to lend out any shares in the portfolio for additional yield, which a $10 million investor might not be able to negotiate as well as a $100 billion institution, but on this point, it is important to note that SPY is structured to not allow it to lend out its shares, unlike VOO or IVV (which helps explains why SPY's fee remains the highest of the three). The value of saving the $3,000-9,000/year in fund fees depends on how efficiently the investor handles the ""passive"" administration of the stock portfolio.There is also the question of how well the investor can avoid the hidden costs of index rebalancing more efficiently than larger funds. Several research papers, including The Index Premium and its Hidden Cost of Index Funds, have described the hidden cost of index rebalancing, and this paper estimates it to be at least another 21-28bp annually (that is $21,000-28,000/year for a $10 million portfolio) on top of the expense ratio.How To Track The S&P 500 ""Closely Enough""For an investor with $100,000 to invest, it would not make sense to buy shares in all 500+ stocks in the S&P 500, but it is not difficult to track the index ""closely enough"" with a smaller number of securities. Alongside the questions of how actively or passively a stock portfolio should be managed are the debates on how many stocks are needed to provide enough diversification for an investor.In terms of basic portfolio math, the incremental diversification benefit of adding additional stocks to a portfolio depends on how high the correlations are between the stocks in the portfolio. The below chart makes some simplifying assumptions, but broadly shows that most of the benefits of diversifying away single-stock risk in a portfolio are achieved with about 5-7 stocks when correlations are around 75%, 8-12 stocks when correlations are around 50%, and 15-20 stocks when correlations are around 25%.Chart 1: DiversificationSource: Excel Calculation, assuming equal weighted portfolio of stocks with 25% volatility and equal correlations.A quick calculation of five of the top 10 S&P 500 components in different industries using long-term monthly returns would indicate 25% might be a good lower-range estimate of what the average correlation within the S&P 500 might be:Chart 2: CorrelationSource: Portfolio VisualizerThese ""back of the envelope"" calculations should provide at least some comfort that an index like the S&P 500 should be easy enough to track well enough with a portfolio of fewer than 50 stocks and perhaps as few as 20-30.Perhaps the most ""obvious"" strategy for tracking the S&P 500 is to simply buy and hold the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500. Historically, these top 10 names have represented 10-20% of the market cap of the entire index, but tracked over 80-90% of the up and down moves of the index. Backtesting the current top 10 names over the past year shows the syncing of these daily fluctuations while the basket of 10 outperformed the index by over 10%, but this can be easily explained by the hindsight bias of including the high-performance FANG components Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as they entered the S&P top 10.Chart 3: S&P Top 10Source: Google FinanceFortunately, an easy-to-track portfolio of 30 stocks, called the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA or ""The Dow""), has been widely followed for over 100 years, and this portfolio has an amazingly good record of tracking the S&P 500. The Dow is not only far narrower than the S&P with only 30 names, but has different names that do not completely overlap with the S&P top 30, and it weights those names by price instead of by market capitalization. Price weighting has the often criticized features of giving 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) 6x the weighting of the 2.5x larger General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and allowing these weightings to be changed by stock splits, but price weighting brings the huge advantage of making it far easier to track an index exactly with a smaller portfolios. Surprisingly, this difference in breadth and weighting has resulted in little difference in long-term total returns over the past 55 years:Chart 4: DJIA vs. S&P 500, 1961-2016While the above chart shows the S&P 500 index has risen by an average of 0.4% per year more than the Dow Jones Industrial Average, this difference can be almost entirely explained by the difference in the respective dividend yields, which are currently around 2.1% for the S&P 500 and 2.6% for the Dow, and this spread has historically brought the total returns of the two indices even closer together.To replicate around $100,000 of the Dow at current (October 2016) prices would simply involve buying 37 shares each of the 30 components:Source: Yahoo FinanceTrading 30 stocks which each trade millions of shares on an average trading day means total trading costs are relatively minimal: almost no market impact or slippage costs plus $30-300 in total brokerage commissions. While I find this to be an excellent quick and simple solution for tracking SPY, I find the ease and low cost of perfectly tracking the Dow through 30 clicks on a computer to even more directly spell obsolescence of another long-known and respected ETF: the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA), also known as the ""Diamonds"". DIA was launched in 1998 (five years after SPY), just as online brokerages like E*Trade Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:ETFC) were beginning a new wave of technology and competition to drive brokerage commissions and trading costs down to their current levels. DIA still has just under $12 billion in AUM with a gross expense ratio of 0.17%, both of which are likely to see downward pressure as investors continue to see it easier and better to own the 30 stocks directly for portfolios as small as $25,000-100,000 (10-40 shares each).Advantages of Direct OwnershipOwning 30 or 500 stocks directly rather than through an index fund or ETF may or not be a hassle worth the cost savings, depending how well an investor's broker, custodian, and technology platform can handle dividends, rebalancing, stock lending, spin-offs, and other events. If the stock is not lent out, it means the investor retains the vote in shareholder elections and attends shareholder meetings, which the investor may or may not value. Among the main added advantages investors are likely to appreciate in the direct portfolio are tax loss harvesting and the ability to filter by quality.Tax loss harvesting is the practice of selling losing stock positions while not selling as many winning stock positions in order to defer capital gains taxes on the winning stock positions as long as possible. If a US taxable investor buys $100,000 of a fund that appreciates to $200,000, and the investor needs to withdraw $20,000, half of the amount withdrawn would be subject to capital gains taxes. If the investor instead bought $100,000 of a direct portfolio of stocks that tracked the same fund over the same period of time, then assuming some stocks did better than others and some might have even gone down, the $20,000 withdrawal could instead be done by selling the worst-performing stocks and reducing or even eliminating the immediate capital gains tax. This article is of course not meant to be tax advice, but as long as there is a capital gains tax, holding many different positions provides advantages over holding one position that must be sold pro-rata.Another potential advantage of holding stocks directly is the opportunity to select and filter positions by one or more desired qualities, depending on how important these qualities are versus the need to track the index closely. These qualities can be ethical qualities (e.g. tobacco), financial qualities (e.g. dividend or profit margin), or even familiarity qualities (sticking with businesses the investor can understand). Just as trading technology has made it easier and cheaper than ever to trade and maintain direct stock portfolios, it is also easier and cheaper than ever for smaller investors to apply qualitative and quantitative changes and see how these affect performance metrics.Mutual Funds are to Cassette Tapes as ETFs are Compact Discs as Direct Portfolios are to MP3sI often like to make the analogy of the history and features of different types of mutual funds to different types of recording technologies.The closed-end fund is like the vinyl record. Vinyl records are recorded once at the record company in the same way that funds for a closed-end fund are raised once up front. You can change tracks on a vinyl record by simply moving the needle, but like trading shares of a closed-end fund on an exchange, the number may not be as precise as what can be done with a compact disc (ETF). Although vinyl and closed-end funds have been largely eclipsed by later and greater technologies, each continue to be valued for niche traits the later technologies have not yet provided - deep analogue acoustic sounds in the case of vinyl and access to illiquid and closed markets in the case of closed-end funds.Open-ended funds are like cassette tapes. Unlike pre-cut vinyl records, cassette tapes can be re-recorded over and over again as easily as open-ended mutual funds can create and redeem shares when investors want to get in or out. Unlike the anytime access of a record or CD, open-ended funds are created or redeemed daily at NAV just as a cassette tape needs to be rewound from the beginning or end of the tape. Cassette tape adapters continue to be sold as a ""bridge technology"" allowing new MP3 players to play on the speakers of older cars, just as mutual funds continue to be sold through advisors and brokers that continue to be paid by them.ETFs are the compact disc of the asset management industry, combining some of the best features of the open- and closed-end mutual fund as compact discs combined the best features of bigger analogue vinyl discs and smaller recordable cassette tapes. ETFs can be traded intra-day just as compact discs allow instant access of any track while also providing the creation/redemption feature of open-ended funds (analogous to home recording of compact discs). Compact discs were a digital, modern, and flexible solution of the old problem of how to distribute a sound recorded in one place (just as funds distribute investment service performed in one place) to a large number of people in many far away locations.Just as iTunes and YouTube made compact discs mostly (but not yet completely) obsolete, the ability to buy index components separately or as a bundle easily and inexpensively will make the physical ETF wrapper obsolete, especially for the ETF holdings that are the easiest and least expensive to trade directly: large domestic equities. Digital distribution replaced not only the physical way we bought records, but also has been credited for killing the platinum record by allowing customers to more broadly individualize their choices rather than concentrating on a few stars. Online music was one explanation for why 2014 was the first year in modern history where no artist sold more than 1 million albums in the US. In the same way, platinum index providers S&P (which also owns Dow Jones Indices), Russell, MSCI and FTSE may see increased competition from other index providers that may no longer need to get a licensing deal from a $1 billion ETF to make publishing their index worthwhile.These changes may take at least another decade to fully shake out the ETF businesses and bottom lines of BLK and STT, but however they adapt, investors can look forward to greater choice and lower costs even in what should already be the cheapest core holding in their portfolio."

The net revenues of the company were reported at $440 million, and increased by 0.5% relative to the third quarter of the previous year. What came as a much bigger surprise for investors was the announcement of the net income. The company posted a net income of $86 million, which was 83% higher than the net income of $47 million posted in the previous year. Earnings per share were up by 81.25%, and came in at 86 cents per share for the third quarter. These results outperformed analysts' expectations who had expected revenues of $424.9 million, and earnings of 22 cents per share.E*Trade registered a 6% year on year increase in its Daily Average Revenue Trades (DART), which were 153,000 during the quarter. The company was also able to add 24,000 broker accounts to its user base, compared to the 13,000 accounts that it was able to add a year ago. This addition to user accounts drove up the total brokerage accounts to 3.1 million.The total customer assets by the end of the quarter were reported at $282 million, and were up by 17% from the year ago quarter.Net operating interest income was of $269 million, up by 11.6% relative to the results that the company had posted in the year ago quarter. Commission, fees and service charges and other revenues for the company also witnessed increases during the quarter and were reported at $163 million. The loan loss provisions for the company were reported at $10 million, which was 73% lower than the provisions that were made during the prior year's quarter. This is an indication of the improvement in the credit quality of the corporation, which raises investor confidence regarding the operational success in the future.Book value per share increased by 9% relative to last year's results and was reported at $18.26 per share for the third quarter.Former E*Trade unit finedThe SEC fined the E*Trade Securities and E*Trade Capital Markets division, which are now named G1 Execution Services after their acquisition by Susquehanna. They were levied a $2.5 million fine on the decisions for its poor role in preventing microcap frauds and ensuring that unregistered shares do not reach the market, and for selling penny stocks improperly during the 2007 till 2011 period. According to a spokesperson of E*Trade, the matter was 'previously reserved for'.These divisions were sold by E*Trade as part and parcel of a strategy implementation that would allow the company to concentrate its time and efforts on its core business and customers. The deal was completed in February of this year for a sum of $75 million and also agreed upon sending 70% of customer equity orders to the business for the next five year period.OutlookAnalyzing the share trends over the past five years suggests that share prices have been trending upwards and have remained bullish most of the time. Shares have shown some major spikes in prices over the course of one year as well. The 52 week range for share prices is noted at $16.84-$25.58 per share. The one year target estimate for share prices has been set by $24.93 per share. Currently, the share trades very close to its target estimate, suggesting that there are no huge jumps in share prices that are expected over the next 12 months. The P/E ratio of the share is fairly high at 20.01.For investors, the fact that the corporation has turned itself around remarkably after nearly being shut down following the US economic crisis in 2008 suggests that the investment is an intriguing one for investors to consider. Also, what keeps investors interested in E*Trade and other investment brokerage firms is the trend of the investment brokerage industry itself. For now, the outlook points upward and it suggests that firms, including E*Trade, are likely to follow the industry trend when this happens.When analyzing E*Trade on its own, the recovering company seems to be doing well financially and has been reporting solid results over the past few quarters. Given that analysts are constantly revising their estimates for the company's stocks indicates that they are bullish in their analysis of what the future of this company holds for its stakeholders. For now, E*Trade is a share that is worth considering when designing an investment portfolio. However, it may not be the best stock for investors who are seeking short term gains. This stock is better suited for investors who are looking for a long term investment, given that E*Trade Financial Corporation has set the momentum to post better results in the future and is well on its way to recover from its previous downfall."
3174226,58481,2015-05-13T11:10:45-04:00,"E-Trade receives 60%-65% of revenue from interest income.This leverage to interest rates makes the company a great hedge against rising rates.While the stock has gained 23% YTD, it still has room to run and momentum is on its side.","The biggest overhang in the market today is rising interest rates. Whether the Fed raises rates in June, September, or December of this year is of great debate. Some analysts are even predicting the Fed will once again delay increasing rates until 2016. However, even without actions from Janet Yellen, yields have been steadily increasing over the past couple of weeks.10-Year Treasury Rate data by YChartsThis has already spooked some investors and led to a selloff in stocks. In particular, investors are worried the search for ""safe yield"" will bring money out of equities and back into U.S. Treasuries. In this scenario, safe dividend stocks like consumer staples (NYSEARCA:XLP) and utilities (NYSEARCA:XLU) hold less value and underperform the market.XLU data by YChartsOne way to hedge your portfolio against rising rates is to increase exposure to companies that benefit from rising rates. A stock that can gain value in a rising rate environment would be extremely beneficial to nearly any portfolio out there. The company that benefits more than just about any other company out there is E-Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC).E-TradeThis financial services and online brokerage company has surprising sensitivity and leverage to interest rates. The company gets around 60%-65% of revenue from net interest income and just around 35% of revenue from commissions and fees. The company makes far more from holding customers' money through net interest spreads than it does from actual commissions. As interest rates rise, E-Trade will see a far greater impact than any bank or insurance company out there.Source: E-Trade 1Q15 quarterly statementFor comparison, back in the first quarter of 2006, when the 10-year and 30-year Treasuries were both above 4%, E-Trade earned over $594 million in operating interest income in the first quarter alone. This interest income was 88% higher in 2006 on similar enterprise interest-earning assets. In the first quarter of 2006, the company had $41.3 billion compared to $41.1 billion in 2015. Even though operating interest expense will increase as interest rates rise, the end result is a huge net positive for E-Trade.E-Trade has also turned itself around since the recession, when the company had exposure to the mortgage market and suffered greatly. In the first quarter of 2009, E-Trade allocated $453 million in provisions for loan losses. This compares to just $5 million in the most recent quarter. Since the recession, the company has significantly scaled down its loan portfolio from about $27 billion to $5.6 billion.In addition, the company has reduced debt from $1.74 billion to $1 billion in just 4 months. From the time the company submitted its capital plan in 2012, the company has reduced debt service costs by 70% to just $50 million. On the most recent conference call, CEO, Paul Idzik, stated:With loan legacy issues well under control and a rapidly improved balance sheet, there has been speculation that E-Trade is a potential buyout candidate for TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD), Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) or even Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). With total customer assets approaching $300 billion, as well as a growing customer base and interest-earning assets, the company is back on track and perfectly positioned to benefit from rising interest rates. The M&A speculation is an additional potential catalyst, but shouldn't be viewed as a main reason to buy the stock.Take-AwayRising yields have already put downward pressure on equities and could be the cause of the next market downturn. Having a hedge against rising rates is essential in every portfolio. The Fed will raise rates, it's just a matter of time. E-Trade is one of the most leveraged companies to interest rates in the entire market. With 60%-65% of revenue coming from net interest spreads, a small increase in rates would have a profound impact on the top line. This huge tailwind, along with a more efficient capital structure and loan profile, makes the company attractive.YTD, the stock is up 23% and the stock is ready to break through the $30/share level. This rapid increase has been fueled by M&A speculation, improving company fundamentals, and investors looking for equities poised to take advantage of rising rates. At current valuations, E-Trade looks expensive, but momentum is on its side. Investors looking to establish a position should view this company as a long-term position. Interest rates are at historically low levels, so even a return to normalized rates would be a huge catalyst for the stock. At the very least, E-Trade can be a short-term hold to hedge against the inevitable rate increase."

Some of these incentives are straight cash rewards while other are no commission trades for a period of time.After reaching a high of $25.58 in March of this year, E-Trade has struggled to keep its head above the $20 mark. It has seesawed back and forth at that level several times. Now you have a stock that is nearing the bottom end of a trading range while trading below its 40-day moving average. That could spell the onset of a downtrend coming for E-Trade.If you're looking to cash in on the brokerage business, a better idea may be to go with one of the older, established full-service brokerage firms.

The company also operates a bank for deposits generated through its brokerage business.ETFC was incorporated in 1982 and had its IPO in 1996.Excellent First Quarter EarningsOn April 23, E*TRADE reported its Q1 results. Net income for the quarter was $97 million-- highest in about seven years, and up from $35 million in Q1 of 2013. At $0.33 per share, it was also substantially better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.23 per share. ETFC has beat/met Zacks estimates in all of last four quarters, with an average quarterly surprise of 52.5%.According to the management, “overall positive investor sentiment elevated brokerage activity to its highest level in nearly five years, which aided our record net new brokerage assets and brokerage account retention”.Daily average revenue trades (DARTs) for the quarter were 198,000—up 24% from the prior quarter and 33% from the prior-year quarter.ETFC got 72,000 net new brokerage accounts during the quarter, taking the total to 3.1 million accounts. During the quarter, customers added a record $4.1 billion in net new brokerage assets--an annualized growth rate of 7.5%.As of March 31, 2014, bank and consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratios were 9.7% and 7.0% respectively, up from 9.5% and 6.7% at the end of the previous quarter.Positive Earnings Estimates Revisions After excellent results, analysts have raised their estimates for the company. Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next year are now $1.06 and $1.23 per share up from $0.95 and $1.20 per share respectively, 30 days ago.The following chart shows the positive earnings momentum for the stock:Rising estimates sent ETFC back to Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) after the results.Solid Industry RankZacks industry rank for “Investment Brokers” is currently 37 out of 265 (top 14%).The Bottom LineETFC is a Zacks Rank#1 (Strong Buy) stock.

Most important financial metrics, including revenue lines and costs, were similar with the prior periods showing a business stuck in a rut.The stock surged earlier this year on hopes of higher interest rates. The brokerage firm that has a principle business focused on equity trades still obtains the majority of revenues from net interest income. A big portion of the income comes from the roughly $7.9 billion in margin receivables.Even after a post-earnings bounce due to a positive EPS beat, E*Trade is listed as a favorite by Goldman Sachs. The firm originally listed the stock as one of the most oversold in the market and later listed E*Trade as lined up for out-sized gains.The stock is difficult to value with the shutdown of numerous operations including global trading and the recent termination of the wholesale funding obligation. The moving parts are creating short-term charges for long-term benefits though one has to wonder if absorbing $413 million in charges is worth a slight bump to net interest margins.For Q3, net interest income was $263 million and commission and fee revenue was $170 million. Even in the low-rate environment, E*Trade still obtains a disproportionate of revenues from interest income. The rally this year was all based on the Fed raising interest rates that didn't occur.With the recent rebound, E*Trade now trades at a multiple in the middle of peers like TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) and Interactive Brokers Group (NASDAQ:IBKR). The larger TD Ameritrade trades at a slightly lower EPS multiple. In the case of Interactive Brokers, the market is predicting a rather large increase in EPS next year in order to even achieve the already elevated multiple.The interesting part of the story is the EPS expectations for E*Trade and Interactive Brokers continue to rise for next year. TD Ameritrade is seeing its numbers pulled back.With E*Trade, the legacy loan portfolio is starting to wind down to immaterial levels. The legacy loan balanced ended Q3 at $5.3 billion, down 7% sequentially. As mentioned above, margin balances average near $8.0 billion. With improving loan delinquencies, E*Trade had the first reserve release in eight years.E*Trade remains a relatively cheap stock compared to a peer like Interactive Brokers. The sector though is richly valued for the growth expectations and the need for higher interest rates that aren't definite.My original investment thesis is maintained. After this initial rally on better than expected EPS numbers, the stock likely hits a wall near the previous highs around $31.50 due to the market pricing in a Fed rate hike that is far from certain."

1843192,49081,2013-11-15T11:47:29-05:00,,"E-Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) recently reported third quarter 2013 earnings per share of $0.16 on net revenue of $417 million. Although the results came in slightly below analyst expectations of $419.4 million in net revenue and EPS of $0.17, the overall trend of its operating metrics was generally in-line with those outlined in my September article on the company. The key take-away from the September earnings report were that management was executing its turnaround plan well and, in particular, made significant progress in improving its liquidity position to enable it to reduce its corporate debt load as well as being in a position to achieve sustained profitability in 2014.Deal To Sell Market Making Unit ReachedAfter announcing in July its intent to sell the market making unit, G1 Execution Services LLC (G1X), the company disclosed that it had reached a definitive agreement to sell the market making business to a unit of Susquehanna International for $75 million. Although the sale price was significantly below the $100 million - $200 million range originally expected by management and analysts, I believe management made a strategically correct decision to consummate a deal quickly due to continued deterioration of the unit experienced in the third quarter during which principal transaction revenue fell sharply from $21.7 million in the prior quarter to $12.6 million as the U.S. equity market was trading at historically low volatility and trading volume at the unit dropped 16% from the prior quarter. The deal allowed management to put the cash towards the more strategically important goal of reducing debt and improving profitability.G1X accounted for $93 million of revenue in 2012 and $56 million year-to-date in 2013. If the deal closes as expected by end of first quarter of 2014, total net revenue of E-Trade in 2014 will decline by approximately $60 million when compared to 2013 due to the exit from the market making business with an earnings impact of approximately $6 million.Continued Progress On Capital PlanE-Trade ended the third quarter with $372.9 million of corporate cash which included the previously approved $100 million of dividends from the bank subsidiary to the parent. On the earnings conference call, the company reiterated that it intends to seek approval for $100 million per quarter in the near term and any excess capital over the 8% Tier 1 leverage ratio over the long run. As of September 30, 2013, Tier 1 leverage ratio at the bank subsidiary stood at 9.5% with $4 billion of bank net capital and $42.3 billion of total bank assets. This suggested that a total of $635 million of bank capital in excess of the stated 8% target in Tier 1 leverage ratio could potentially be dividend back to the parent for strategic corporate purposes.Management also reiterated that it is focused on deploying the corporate cash towards reducing corporate debt. Assuming regulatory approval is received for its next $100 million dividend request at the end of 2013, pro-forma corporate cash would have been in the neighborhood of $550 million which would be sufficient to retire the $435 million of 6 3/4% notes maturing in 2016 sometime in early 2014 that could potentially save the company $23 million - $29 million of interest expense in 2014, depending on the actual timing.Provision For Loan Loss Declined Much Faster Than AnticipatedIn the September quarter, E-Trade reported $37 million of provision for loan loss from its legacy loan portfolio, a drop of 20% from $46 million in the prior quarter and representing the lowest level of provision for loan loss since early 2007. The company's legacy loan portfolio continued to see significant improvement in the 1-4 family home loans that allowed the bank to reverse $24.7 million of previously charged provision while the home equity loans remained weak and recorded another $59.9 million of provision. Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios have improved substantially over the last three quarters and now average 94% for 1-4 family home loans and 102% for home equity loans.For the next few quarters, the company expects to see similar diverging trends between the performance of the 1-4 family home loans and the home equity loans portfolio. Management guided $25 million - $50 million of total provision for loan losses per quarter in the near term with home equity loan provision expected at the $50 million per quarter level. Unless home prices take a larger than expected correction in the next few quarters, my original forecast of $35 million of provision per quarter in 2014 remains well within reach.Asset Gathering At the Brokerage Subsidiary Ramping UpIn 2013, E-Trade has turned to ramping up asset gathering efforts at the brokerage subsidiary, hoping to generate incremental trading commission, net interest income and fee revenue to make up for the forthcoming loss of principal transaction revenue from the exit of the market making unit. Year to date, the company brought in on average 25,000 net new brokerage accounts and $2.4 billion of net new brokerage assets per quarter, representing an annual increase of 3% and 5.5%, respectively. The company also grew its retirement assets under management by 16% YTD to $40 billion with over $2 billion in managed accounts. Trading commission in 2013 benefited from increased customer activity level as DART averaged 148,000 in the first three quarters of 2013 and jumped to 159,703 in October. While I expect single digit growth in trading commissions, net interest income, and fee revenue in 2014, I do not expect the loss of the market making revenue to be fully made up by other brokerage operating activities until 2015.New EPS Estimate for 2014 And Maintaining $23 Price TargetTaking into account the progress reported in the third quarter earnings report and assuming the timing of the sale of G1X and the early retirement of partial corporate debt to occur by end of first quarter of 2014, I have adjusted downward estimates for full year 2014 and now modeling FY2014 EPS of $0.91, a 3 cent decrease from the previous estimate of $0.94 due to a small decrease in net income (-$0.01) and a small increase in diluted shares outstanding (-$0.02).As the value drivers have not changed from my previous article and E-Trade continues to make great strides in returning to its roots as an online stock brokerage firm with an estimated 72% of total net revenue deriving from the brokerage subsidiary in 2014, I believe the shares should be valued more aligned with other online brokerage peers and therefore maintaining a $23 price target for E-Trade shares based on 25 times PE multiple of 2014 EPS.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2183493,62463,2014-05-01T16:16:30-04:00,"When a company's bull-market-inspired expansion produces losses, angry shareholders and temporarily reduced animal spirits, CEOs love to talk about returning to ""core competencies.""Around 2010/2011, after the market rout, it was a popular phrase as executives tried to show that they should remain focused on their primary business rather than empire-building.We take a closer look at a firm that has returned to a simple model – E-trade Financial Corp.","By Steven Carroll, Independent CommentatorThis late in the cycle, it's great to see firms that are sticking to this relatively disciplined model (rather than transformative M&A and all the value-destructive traits that mispriced credit markets encourage). Online broker E-Trade's (NASDAQ:ETFC) model is easily understood and eminently profitable. To focus on its core strategy, the company has sold its market maker business, sold down its portfolio of structured assets and reduced expensive debt.All of this is clearly evident in a StarMine ARM score of 100 - meaning the (positive) change in analyst sentiment is within the highest percentile for North America - with strong upwards revisions all across the income statement (OK, not EBITDA), as well as recommendation upgrades.Sewing up share performanceSuch a laser-like focus on its knitting has also been a boon to shareholders, with E-Trade outperforming the S&P by an enormous margin. With a largely fixed cost base, it's easy to see the attractive operating leverage of the model - though, of course, that's a two-edged sword if markets swoon and investors decide to sit on the sidelines.Focusing on valueDespite the impressive performance and the enthusiastic upgrades from the analysts, the company remains relatively inexpensive and looks to be an interesting option against a frothy market backdrop. By StarMine's calculations, the stock is still trading below fair value - at a ratio of 0.92, while forecast to deliver a 21% EPS CAGR over the next five years.A fair question that investors could pose is around the company's capacity for self-harm. ETFC moved into losses during the last two equity market routs - making one question its ability to navigate choppier water. Schwab, by comparison, remained largely unmoved as markets alternately fell and plummeted.Exercising the core musclesEvident from the bubble chart below is that ETFC is forecast to deliver the best returns against its peer group, yet doesn't carry the valuation premium of Schwab, trading at a much lower multiple (19.7 times next 12 months' earnings versus 25.3). Readers will know I'm not anti-growth - but I am anti-buying growth that's fully factored into the share price.Here you can see Schwab trades at a premium (perhaps partially justified on the basis of management's track record of remaining profitable throughout the cycle), but with a much lower compound growth rate. If management can keep its eye focused on the core function of E-Trade - providing electronic brokerage services - then ETFC looks like the better opportunity.Goal: customer satisfactionFor those wanting exposure to the financial services markets without the question marks over the sustainability of the investment banking business model, vengeful regulators and the thorny issue of how earnings should be split between staff and shareholders, ETFC seems to be a well-priced means of exposure. Just keep an eye out for announcements of paradigm shifts, M&A activity, new business lines or (top of the cycle) expansions. A focus on pleasing the customer and operational excellence will beat the visionary game changer every time.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Alpha Now at Thomson Reuters is a team of expert analysts that are constantly looking at the financial landscape in order to keep you up to date on the latest movements.

2197513,24088,2014-05-08T05:30:00-04:00,Silicon Valley Start-Up Robinhood will offer completely free trading for cash stock positions.This is an existential threat to E-Trade whose business is competing mainly on price.E-Trade's valuation and competitive position make it a better short than other discount brokers.,"Technology has continued to be a disruptive force in the financial services industry. In the late 1990's online brokerage platforms built by companies such as E-Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC), TD Ameritrade, and Scottrade reduced the costs of trading for retail investors to a fraction of previous levels. They also caused the extinction of the stockbroker, and took down many full service stock brokerages with it. However, with the innovations of tech upstart Robinhood, Inc., online brokerages such as E-Trade may become dinosaurs themselves.Robinhood, Inc. is displacing online brokerages by offering 100% free trades for cash stock and ETF trades. In fact the company has found a way to turn a profit, and will be charging commissions for margin-based trades, and derivatives trades (futures, FX, and options). Not having to pay brokerage fees will open trading up to millions of traders and likely increase volumes, but will cause failures of the business models existent within current online brokerage houses. Robinhood is a serious threat due to receiving venture backing from both Google and Andresson Horowitz along with already having 154,000 subscribers before launch. When the expected app launch occurs in Q2 2014, expect the subscriber base to be much higher. Skeptics argue that the lack of a marketing budget would prevent Robinhood from challenging the big brokers. The case of apps such as Skype, Dropbox, Evernote, Whatsapp, and Facebook disproves this notion. Translating a normally paid service to a free app is strong enough of selling point that awareness of the company will spread from user referrals and social media.Since Robinhood is private and likely faces a bubble-like valuation in venture capital circles, the best bet to capture on this trend is to short online brokerages. Scottrade is privately held, Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) is the leader in cost and in terms of popularity amongst professional clients, and Ameritrade has a strong balance sheet (NASDAQ:AMTD), so shorting E-Trade is the best way to profit off of the creative destruction as it is the weakest major company in the sector.E-Trade is already on weak footing, and the threat of obsolescence from Robinhood may worsen its outlook. Even after massive equity inflows from retail investors and a recovery in brokerage trading activity, E-Trade only squeezes out a 7.3% profit margin and a 0.6% return on invested capital. With Robinhood offering zero trading commissions for cash accounts, and lower commissions than E-Trade for margin accounts and options, E-Trade will struggle to compete. With a bloated expense budget that includes brick and mortar locations, 3000 full time employees, and high marketing budgets (such as Super bowl ads), E-Trade may not be able cut costs low enough to turn a profit.The outcome is that E-Trade will lose its client base to Robinhood or similar competitors. To slow down the loss rate, E-Trade will either have to increase its marketing budget or cut prices that will erode the company's profitability. Institutional investors and professional traders use either Interactive Brokers or prime brokers from big banks for brokerage services, so E-Trade is reliant on the more fickle retail investor for its customer base. Retail investors are far less likely to trade options, futures, or equities on margin, so they would be content with Robinhood's free platform to conduct trades. Any speed advantage E-Trade may have will not compensate the cost savings going with a broker providing free trades as well.Based on the degree of optimism revolving around E-Trade it has a lot of room to go down. Analysts are expecting 30% earnings growth per year over the next five years and have very bullish sentiment towards the stock. The company has also benefited from momentum investors who only trade on price acceleration. E-Trade's stock has doubled in the past twelve months and now trades with an inflated P/E ratio of 43. E-Trade only has a brokerage business, so they have no diverse assets to protect themselves. With a debt/equity ratio of 5.72 at current prices, debt servicing will also become an issue as revenues fall.Once the market realizes that the prospect of free stock trading will destroy E-Trade's business, the company can easily fall 40-50% within twelve months of Robinhood's release to the general public (only limited release currently). E-Trade could also buy Robinhood itself, but will hurt its financial position by overpaying for the acquisition in the process.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in ETFC over the next 72 hours.

546261,24324,2012-05-01T10:58:09-04:00,,"Earlier in 2012, I suggested E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) had upside based on a sum of the parts valuation. Since then the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 by 10% bolstered by Q1 results. I want to update the January analysis with the Q1 numbers, using a probabilistic approach with a bear, base and bull case scenario.Weighted Average ScenariosThen to arrive at a single estimate we weight the underlying scenarios according to estimated probability. Both the bull and bear case appear unlikely, but we give the bull case a slightly higher weighting given the declining trajectory on provisions.Notes On The Above TableLoan Losses As The Key UncertaintyLooking at the above sensitivities it is clear that loan losses are the key to the investment case on E*Trade. Currently provisions stand at just under $600M across all portfolios, with a provision run rate of $400M a year, but declining (see below).In addition, the vast majority of losses have come from the home equity loan book which currently stands at $5B, or just over 40% of its prior value.(Click to enlarge)ConclusionUsing a probabilistic approach highlights the risk in E*Trade, with a shock to the economy or the housing market, the loan portfolio could virtually wipe out the equity, yet on current macroeconomic trends this seems unlikely given a housing market that may have bottomed and declining unemployment.Conversely, the stock could double were it to put the loan issues behind it and achieve a ongoing revenue stream from the loan portfolio, this scenario seems slightly more probable, yet likely still too rosy given the loan issues are far from resolved with significant charge offs in Q1 and thus meaningful value in the loan business appears wishful thinking.As a result we are left with modest 17% upside, this seems attainable, but investors should consider whether this return offers adequate compensate for the risks and uncertainty surrounding E*Trade's loan portfolio. Personally, I believe there is still some upside in E*Trade for those with reasonable risk tolerance and positive view on the US housing market and US consumer. It remains a significant component of my portfolio.However, without further positive news on the loan portfolio in 2012 I would increasingly sell down my position were the stock to trade over $13.Disclosure: I am long ETFC."
1682522,49081,2013-09-09T17:27:27-04:00,,"Last Wednesday, E-Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) announced that it had received regulatory approval for its plan to dividend $100 million from the bank subsidiary to the parent company. According to the press release, E-Trade will also seek approval for similar $100 million dividend distribution per quarter over the near term. E-Trade provides online brokerage service to retail investors as well as operating a bank that offers deposit accounts and makes real estate mortgage loans. Back in 2007 and 2008, E-Trade suffered billions of losses in real estate loan provisions and write-off at the bank subsidiary and had to be rescued by Citadel. Since then, the company embarked on a long road to recovery by de-leveraging the bank subsidiary and running off its existing real estate loan portfolio while continuing to operate its online retail brokerage arm. The efforts were mostly successful at stabilizing the company and in recent quarters the company had shown accelerated improvements in the underlying capital position and earning power. The latest regulatory approval is a show of confidence that signifies E-Trade might have indeed turned the corner.Since the company reported second quarter 2013 operating earnings that beat estimates by a good margin in late July, consensus earnings estimate for 2013 and 2014 had already increased by about 25% to $0.63 per share and $0.75 per share, respectively. Looking ahead, there is increasing likelihood that 2014 earnings could expand further to reach $0.94 per share if macroeconomic conditions continue to be favorable, the company maintains its current operating momentum, and recently announced events and plans materialize. Specifically, investors could see higher earnings in 2014 driven by the following catalysts:De-leveraging of Troubled Loan Portfolio Paying OffAt the peak of the financial crisis in late 2008, delinquencies and provision for loan losses for E-Trade's loan portfolio were staggering and reached into billions of dollars. Over the past four and a half years, conditions had been steadily improving and by early 2013 delinquencies and provision for loan losses were down more than 70% and 90% from peak, respectively.(Source: E-Trade Financial - June 2013 presentation)In the first half of 2013, the company saw accelerated improvement as provision for loan losses reduced by 55% from an average of $101 million per quarter in 2012 to just $44 million per quarter. This striking improvement coincided with the rapidly rebounding housing market as well as a much improved labor market and also as a result of the company's efforts focusing on mitigating credit losses and enhancing credit profile such as loan modifications. As part of the company's turnaround strategy, the bank subsidiary is no longer making new loans and simply running off existing loans. As of June 30, 2013, total loan receivable balance was at $9.1 billion, a reduction of 72% from $32 billion in 2007, with just 4% of the portfolio delinquent past 89 days.Macro trends remain favorable to E-Trade's loan portfolioIn the past year, E-Trade's legacy loan portfolio had greatly benefited from a stronger U.S. economy that was characterized by low mortgage rates, robust housing market with existing home prices rising in double digits and unemployment rates declining to the lowest level seen since 2008.Approximately 47% of E-Trade's existing loan portfolio is concentrated in California and Florida. As the two charts below indicated, these two states showed similar improvement in macro conditions in-line with the national trend.A stronger labor market tends to have a positive effect on lowering loan delinquencies that could eventually lead to foreclosures and provision for loan losses. Rising home prices remove yet another obstacle for borrowers wanting to refinance or modify their mortgages. It also allows E-Trade to increase recovery rate in the event of a non-performing loan. All of these factors contributed to a much lower loan loss provision and charge-off at E-Trade. Another encouraging data point was that in July 2013, nationwide distressed home sales accounted for just 15% of total sales, compared to 24% of total home sales in July 2012.Looking into the next 12 - 15 months, although mortgage rates have risen by almost 1 full percentage point and there is also the likelihood of the Fed tapering of QE3 in the next 6 - 12 months, the housing industry is generally optimistic that the housing market will continue to be robust with room for housing price increases. The National Association of Realtor forecasted that home prices could rise another 5% in 2014, and the National Association of Home Builders expected existing home sales in 2014 and 2015 to keep pace with 2013 at an annual rate of 4.5 - 4.7 million homes.(Source: National Association of Home Builders)Assuming the housing market continues to see less distress, provision for loan losses for E-Trade's banking subsidiary could drop further to $35 million per quarter in 2014 from the current $44 million per quarter level. This amounts to an incremental gain of up to $36 million per year or EPS impact of $0.11 per share on the bottom line.Improved Liquidity Position Enables E-Trade To Reduce Corporate Debt LoadAs of June 30, 2013, the bank subsidiary had $1.9 billion of Tier 1 leverage capital in excess of the regulatory minimum level required to be considered ""well capitalized."" As the capital position at the bank subsidiary more than satisfies all regulatory requirements, E-Trade is now in a position to move excess capital at the bank subsidiary to reduce its corporate debt, a stated goal in the company's current strategy.In 2012, the company refinanced two high yield bonds with interest rates as high as 12 1/2% with new 6% and 6 3/8% bonds and achieved savings of $66 million in annual interest expense. However, the debt load remains high at $1.78 billion with annual interest expense payment of roughly $114 million. With the regulators approving the first such $100 million dividend in September, additional requests for similar amounts in the next two quarters would most likely not be denied.(Source: E-Trade)Another source of liquidity could be coming from the recently announced intent to dispose of the company's market making business, G1 Execution Services LLC (G1X). There are reportedly a few buyers interested in a deal worth $100 million to $200 million. The timing of the transaction is expected to be completed by late 2013 or early 2014. As a market maker, G1X takes positions in thousands of securities to facilitate the customers buying and selling in those shares. The market making business generated $105 million of revenue in 2011, $93 million in 2012, and $43 million in the first half of 2013. The decline in market making revenue was mostly attributed to lower trading volume. In addition to bringing in possibly $100 million or more of cash, the transaction could also free up regulatory capital that were tied up in the market making unit which was last reported at $28.8 million as of June 30, 2013.Combining the different sources of liquidity with the company's existing corporate cash balance of $250.9 million and assuming all going according to plan, the company's pro-forma corporate cash balance in early 2014 could reach $500 million to $600 million which would be sufficient to retire most, if not in its entirety, of the $435 million of 6 3/4% note maturing in 2016 that could save the company $29 million of annual interest expense or an incremental EPS impact of roughly $0.08 per share.Implication For Valuation & ConclusionAfter being a drag in the company's operating results for a number of years since 2007, E-Trade's banking subsidiary turned profitable in 2012 and its operating profit of $74 million in the first half of 2013 more than doubled of that in the same period of 2012. As loan provision for losses are expected to trend down in a reviving housing market, bank earnings will start to make a greater contribution to the earnings power of the company.Although E-Trade is exiting the market making business in 2014, the loss of approximately $80 million -$100 million of principal transaction revenue could be made up partially by single digit increase in brokerage commission and the company's $100 million cost-cutting plan. The brokerage subsidiary is reaping the benefits of renewed investor confidence and increased activity level arising from asset allocation shift from cash and fixed income to equities. In the first half of 2013, the company's daily average revenue trade (DART) increased to 150 thousand while 30,000 net new brokerage accounts were added per quarter, representing an annual growth rate of 4% in the company's total number of brokerage accounts.Modeling for 2014 based on the above trends and catalysts, I found EPS of $0.94 in 2014 to be well within reach for a company that is executing its turnaround plan well and seeing a pickup of momentum in its operating metrics aided by tailwinds from the current macroeconomic environment. If this scenario plays out, I could see shares of E-Trade trading for $23 at a P/E multiple of 24, which is comparable to the P/E multiple of TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD). It's also plausible that continued improvement in the bank's loan portfolio for another two or three years will finally make E-Trade a viable takeover target.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The market assumes the home loan portfolio will continue to reduce E*Trade's earnings, and in fact this view has been justified for half a decade. However, I believe, as soon as next calendar year, the losses may be a much smaller drag on earnings. The reduction in these losses could ultimately lift the stock as much as 122%. However, the valuation is very sensitive to the valuation of the loan portfolio and the stock is risky as a result.A Brief Summary of E*TradeE*Trade has essentially two operations:The results from the home loans have been so bad for so long that the market believes this will continue indefinitely, and looking at the E*Trade stock price for the past 5 years it's easy to understand why.ETFC data by YChartsWhy Things Are Changing For The Better At E*TradeThings are now changing for three reasons:The housing market now appears to be trending upwards with builder confidence increasing in September to its highest level since June 2006. This has an important psychological impact, because the housing market has not found the bottom and assertions of seeming unending losses can be disproved by evidence. Of course, this was not possible to do before the housing market turned.Provisions have fallen from $2.5B at their peak to under $0.5B for the past 4 quarters (see slide 6 of this presentation). Since E*Trade is not issuing new home loans the portfolio's value is falling over time through both pay downs and charge offs, and it is now at the point where it is a relatively smaller part of the business with $12B of outstanding loans in 2012 vs. $32B in 2007 (see slide 16 of this presentation).E*Trade Appears Reasonably Valued On A P/E BasisAs you can see below, E*Trade trades broadly in line with peers Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) on a P/E basis. However, P/Es can be misleading when part of the company is losing money as is the case with E*Trade's home loan portfolio where the losses significantly drag down earnings, and hence:AMTD PE Ratio data by YChartsWhat Reduced Loan Losses May Imply For ValuationSource: company reports, author's analysisSensitivitiesHowever, E*Trade's valuation is very sensitive to future loan losses. For context, over the past 5 years total losses (charge offs) were $7B, so arguably the worst loans are already out of the portfolio, the $1.5B assumption assumes that loans which have not been delinquent for the past 5 years, will not go bad in the future.source: author's analysisConclusionFor investors who want exposure to, and believe in, an improving economy and house price environment, E*Trade appears to offer substantial upside, though not without risk.Risks to the analysis aboveDisclosure: I am long ETFC.

Sales grew triple digits in 2010 but in 2011 the growth was barely 26%. 2013 could be even worse. It's time to expand overseas where there is less competition and higher margins.Why sell one company to Scotiabank when you can sell two?Craig McCaw was the highest paid CEO in the United States in 1990. If you need to move your stuff from Detroit to Chicago then you don't need to invent the wheel all over again. All you have to do is copy Craig McCaw's wheel and you will be fine.Craig McCaw sold McCaw Cellular to AT&T (NYSE:T) for $11.5 billion in 1994 just like Scotiabank bought ETrade Canada in 2008. All E*Trade needs to do now is copy his proven strategy.A second after he sold his phone company to AT&T he decided to buy another one. He bought a very small phone company called Nextel in 1995 and after only 4 years and only $1.1 billion invested he increased the number of customers to over 3 millionIn 2006 he sold Nextel to Sprint (NYSE:S) for $36 billion. Times were tough for everybody back in 2008 including E*Trade and they were forced to sell their Canadian division. Without that sale E*Trade wouldn't be alive today, maybe.The hurricane went away and now it's time to send the fishing boats back to Canada again. Open a few branches and get a few customers and try to sell the Canadian division again to Scotiabank for at least $1 billion in a few years.E*Trade does not have to start from scratch. They can buy a small Canadian broker and grow it just like Craig McCaw did with Nextel. Upfront costs could be shared with other companies also interested in entering the Canadian market.In 2006 Banorte from Mexico (A Forbes Global 2000 Company) entered the United States of America with the purchase of 70% of a small bank with 16 branches for just $259 million. They also have the option to buy the rest of the bank.There are millions of Mexicans working legally in the United States of America and they send each week cash to their families in Mexico using banks with operations in both countries. They send over $22 billion each year. Even if Banorte charges a very small fee for each transfer it's still a very good business.It's only a matter of time before they enter the Canadian market. There are millions of Mexicans working legally in Canada and they will switch from their current bank to Banorte if they enter the Canadian market. There are a lot of opportunities for global banks with operations in Mexico, Canada and the United States of America.In the future more Mexicans will speak Portuguese and they will go to work in Brazil and vice versa. E*Trade needs to open a new branch in France and allow Canadian customers to buy and sell French stocks in Euros and vice versa.It would be very hard for a typical customer from the United States of America to trade French stocks if he or she does not speak French. Canadians on the other hand are happy to trade in France because they share the same language.The reverse is also true. French customers could be interested in trading Canadian stocks. If E*Trade Canada offers their website in Spanish then people from all over Latin America could start investing their life savings with them.Here is another potential business for E*Trade Canada: Let's say I used to be a General Motors blue collar worker for 20 years in Detroit until I got fired and moved to Canada. It's hard starting over in a new country and Canadian banks are reluctant to issue credit cards to consumers born in the United States of America because their credit history is totally blank. You cannot just take your credit history with you to another country. You have to start over.A special E*Trade Credit Card designed just for Canadians or Mexicans going to the United States of America or for Americans and Mexicans going to Canada could be a very profitable business. E*Trade already has access to your credit history in the United States of America and they will also have access to credit histories from any Canadian coming to the United States of America to work.For the Mexicans going to Canada or the United States of America they may need to hire a company from Mexico like America Movil, (NYSE:AMX)(NYSE:AMOV) which already lends money in Mexico. Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD) cannot buy more than 45% of TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) until 2016. It is highly likely that they will acquire the entire company after that date leaving J. Joe Ricketts with nothing but a pile of cash.E*Trade cannot stop the bleedingIn Q3 they lost $29 million. In Q4 they lost $186 million. At this rate the Q1 loss will be $302 million or 100% of the revenues. Paul Idzik can still save the company. He needs to hire smart people with experience in small loans in Mexico and Canada. Current or former employees of Banorte and Grupo Elektra can get the job done quickly for very little cash. They may even accept options instead of cash.It looks like E*Trade has only 4 years to start and grow a Canadian company big enough to compete against TD Ameritrade (100% owned by Toronto-Dominion Bank) that can be sold for billions to J. Joe Ricketts. He is not going to retire after the sale.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

801621,25229,2012-08-12T09:35:12-04:00,,"E-Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) announced today that its Board of Directors has fired CEO Steven J. Freiberg and is searching for his replacement. In the news release, the company said that the move was to ""transition the role of CEO to a new leader to guide the Company through the next phase of its evolution."" That sounds exciting, but exactly what drastic changes can or should the company make to increase shareholders' value?The company's financial results in recent quarters were generally in line with its two biggest rivals- Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD)-until the last quarter. As Table 1 shows, E-Trade's revenue suddenly dropped in the last quarter. Revenue contracted due primarily to a 12% sequential drop in daily average revenue trades (DARTs) and a 4.1% sequential drop in average commission per trade. The drops in the revenue metrics suggest that the company has some work to do in marketing and branding to increase its market share and pricing power. Interest income also dropped slightly because margin interest rates decreased slightly over the past several months due to the continuous decline of prime lending rate.From a valuation standpoint, the temporary dip in quarterly revenue was not a major concern, at least for now, because operating expenses decrease roughly proportionately as revenue decreased. As a result, operating profit margin remained roughly the same from Q1 to Q2 of 2012. Income before tax margin also stayed roughly the same from Q1 to Q2. It should be noted, however, that Schwab's and TD Ameritrade's income before tax margin is noticeably higher than E-Trade's. The reason is that E-Trade has a much higher long-term debt to equity ratio and that E-Trade's debts bear very high interest rates locked in during period of high interest rates in 2007.From what I can recall after listening to what management said in previous conference calls, the contracts for a lot of the company's debts bearing high fixed interest rates will be unfrozen before the end of this year. After they are unfrozen, the company can choose to pay down these debts or refinance them at a much lower interest rate. So, the disadvantage of higher-than-usual interest expenses E-Trade is bearing right now will be removed very soon.In conclusion, even though there are other potential measures the management team can adopt to improve daily business operations, the improvement obtained from these measures will not likely be dramatic enough to be considered a major break-through or evolution.In my opinion, the only two major changes that the Board of Directors can make to significantly and immediately boost shareholders' value are (1) liquidating a large amount of its fixed-income assets, paying down high-interest bearing debts, and buying back a large number of shares or paying a huge special dividend, and/or (2) selling the company to its competitors for a price significantly higher than its current market capital. That's the idea I stressed laboriously in my previous article for ETFC.Once again, let's review the valuation multiples of E-Trade and its two biggest rivals. As shown in Table 2, while Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade are both valued at around 4.0 times sales and 2.5 times book value right now, E-Trade is currently valued at less than 2.0 times of sales and 45% of its book value. Its competitors can offer a 100% premium (0.9 times its book value of equity) and still realize some gain from arbitration on the net value of the company's assets (total assets minus total liabilities). In addition, the acquirer will probably enjoy increased brand recognition and pricing power and can let go a big portion of E-Trade SG&A workforce to save at least several million dollars in operating expenses each quarter. It is a win-win deal for E-Trade and its acquirer.Any inactivity on either the side of E-Trade or its major competitors on engaging in an M&A negotiation would strongly degrade the image of their executives' leadership ability and financial knowledge. I gave a stern warning about this in my previous article. Unfortunately, Mr. Freiberg did not listen to me and did not push hard to market the company to potential buyers. In my opinion, that was a very unwise decision similar to Yahoo's ex-CEO Jerry Yang's rejection of Microsoft's takeover bid. Now it seems that E-Trade's Board of Directors has finally fully embraced the idea of selling the company to one of its major rivals and is getting rid of any obstacles blocking the road.At the current price level, I feel quite comfortable holding E-Trade along with Longwei Petroleum (LPH) and Actions Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ACTS) in my extremely book value arbitration portfolio. After these stocks have been put at around 40% of their respective book values per share for so long, I believe more and more institutions are starting to recognize these companies' strong positions in their respective industries and the unmistakable potential gain on arbitration of their current market capital and book value of equity.Disclaimer: Please read my standard disclaimer for my articles here.Disclosure: I am long ETFC, LPH, ACTS."
480321,25229,2012-04-05T07:11:43-04:00,,"Last October, I wrote an Instablog article about E-Trade (ETFC). Six months have passed, and the stock has advanced more than 15% since then. I feel that now is time to review the trends of company's several key performance indicators over the past 6 months and predict how they may shape up for the remaining of the year.KPI 1 - Provision for Loan Losses (PLL-OLD): In the previous article I predicted PLL would keep on decreasing in the coming quarters because housing and mortgage market had bottomed in 2010 and stabilized in 201. This prediction was mostly validated by the last 10-K report. PLL decreased by 43.5% YOY for full year 2011 (from $779.4 million in 2010 to $440.6 million in 2011) and 36.5% YOY for the last quarter of 2011 (from $193.8 million in Q4 2010 to $123 million in Q4 2011). From statistical stand point, because seasonality can be part of quarterly fluctuations this number needs to be compared to the number in the same period of the previous year, not sequentially to the number in the previous quarter.Because Loan loss and delinquency rate stably stayed at low levels over the past year and average interest spread on these assets only decreased marginally, operating interest income thus almost stayed fixed from 2010 to 2011 ($1,546 million in 2010 and $1,532 million in 2011). Since housing market is seeing no sign of deteriorating again anytime soon and in fact has seen some signs of improving since the beginning of 2012, interest yield and interest income should at least stay at current levels and possibly move higher going forward as housing market further improves, however gradually.KPI 2 - DARTs (Daily Average Revenue Trades), trading commissions and fees: As Graph 1 shows, although monthly DARTs have not grown as fast as I would like them to grow during this peak period of European debt crisis, it nonetheless has been running at high levels except for December. Trade commissions suffered a moderate pullback last quarter because of the low DARTs in December. Fees and service charges suffered a smaller drop from Q3 to Q4 last year. Because the downward trend of DARTs was reversed at the turn of the year and has gone up strongly in January and February, commissions and fees revenues should be running high again this quarter. More and more reports on investors' behaviors, such as the one published by investment news.com on 1/16/2012 and the one published by Bobsguide on 1/18/2012, contend that more investors are putting bigger portions of their investment portfolio in self-managed online trading accounts like E-Trade than in traditional mutual funds. Historically mutual funds, especially actively managed funds, have consistently underperformed the general market. The underperformance deteriorated during market crashes in 2008 and last summer. As such, it can be expected that E-Trade's brokerage accounts and clients' assets will continue to grow for the years to come.(Click to enlarge)* Numbers provided by E-Trade's monthly activity reports for October 2011, November 2011, January 2012, and February 2012 (each report contains data for two months).Table 1 shows other key metrics relevant to the company's brokerage accounts. As we can see, all four data series exhibited upward trends over the past 6 months and especially over the past three months. Meanwhile, average commission per trade stayed very stable at slightly over $11 over the past two years. In all likelihoods, I believe the upward trends of DARTs, customer accounts and brokerage assets will stay for the foreseeable future. If so, the company naturally will enjoy steady growth in trading commissions and fees over the next several years.(Click to enlarge)* Numbers provided by E-Trade's monthly activity reports for October 2011, November 2011, January 2012, and February 2012 (each report contains data for two months).KPI 3 - Margin Interest Rate and Margin Borrowing Revenue: Average margin receivables balance increased by 11.2% from $4.47 billion in 2010 to $4.97 billion in 2011 (compared to $3.31 billion in 2009 and $4.985 billion in 2008). According to last 10-K, net yield on interest-earning margin assets only decreased by about 4% YOY from 2.96% in 2010 to 2.84% in 2011 (2.80% in 2009). As a result, interest income from margin receivables increased from $200 million in 2010 to $221 million in 2011. Again, just by eye-ball observations, over the years I saw very small changes on E-Trade's margin interest rates and almost no change in spreads over reference national ""base rate"" (closely tied to E-trade's funding cost) E-Trade posts on its website. I do not see any reason for the situation to change in the near future and thus do not see any reason that the company will not continue to enjoy steady growth of its margin interest income in the foreseeable future when spreads stay steady while receivable balance keeps on growing.Now, it is time to ask the million dollar question: having advanced 15% in 6 months, is the stock a buy, hold, or sell right now?On one hand, one can argue that, many of the positive operational trends that E-Trade enjoyed over the past two years were not proprietary to the company. E-trade's two biggest competitors Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade also enjoyed quite strong growths in DARTs and brokerage accounts in the last several quarters. Also, as a financial institution, the stock seems to be heavily affected by European debt status. If any negative news on financial health of any key European country hit wire again, all stocks in finance sector will drop, and so does E-Trade. In my opinion associating E-Trade with other banks that are deeply tangled in European bonds is baseless because in the last 10-K the management team clearly stated ""We do not hold any positions in sovereign debt of European countries and therefore have no direct exposure to the concerns regarding the creditworthiness of certain sovereign governments in Europe"". There is indeed no sign anywhere in the company's financial reports that it has any loss associated to restructuring of European sovereign bonds. However, the market certainly can be irrational at least for short-term. Thus, the risk is real for investors with short term investment horizon.Over longer terms (beyond 6 months), I feel that the stock still has strong upside potential and is materially undervalued at current level. The biggest silver lining lies on its valuation multiples. As shown in Table 2, while Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) are both valued at around 4 times of sales and 2.5 times of book value right now, E-Trade is currently valued at only a little more than 2 times of sales and less than 2/3 of its book value.(Click to enlarge)* Numbers provided by Yahoo Finance as of 4/3/2012.Because the company has written down a huge portion of its mortgage loans and because there is no sign strongly suggest that another housing crisis is on the horizon, the 36% discount from its book value is especially unwarranted. E-Trade is still strongly standing as one of the ""Big 3"" in online brokerage business, commanding a market share and valuable brand name that cannot be easily taken away by any competitors. I still see a clear and strong value E-trade offers its competitors at a price of up to $30 per share. It is in its competitors' best interest to dish out a buyout offer sooner than later because right now they still have a chance to buy the company at $20 or lower per share. It will be like giving AT&T a chance to buy T-Mobile at 40% discount to the price AT&T offered last year! The synergy created in the merger of E-Trade and either Charles Schwab or TD Ameritrade will be much more than the synergy created in the merger of TD-Waterhouse and Ameritrade several years ago. The window of opportunity will be closed soon because the company will see a huge chunk of its high-cost borrowing obligations unfrozen later this year. After that, E-trade can dramatically reduce its funding costs, increase net profit, and buy back shares, inevitably pushing up the stock. The choice is on the hands of the CEOs of Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade now.

319163,24324,2012-01-12T10:41:17-05:00,,"E-Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) has a robust brokerage backed by memorable ads with a talking baby, and a terrible bank enduring ongoing losses in the billions. Performing a sum of the parts analysis enables us to split out the two core aspects and form an opinion on the fundamental value of the business. The Brokerage - A $5.5B Diamond In The RoughE-Trade has a strong technology focused trading platform backed by years of advertising to build a brand and a good brokerage operation. This business is subject to the fluctuations of the stock market, but delivers strong cashflow. Projecting the first 9 months of the year forward, E-Trades brokerage should deliver $330M of net income this year after of tax and corporate costs.Comparable companies are TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) and Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) trading and 18.1x and 15.4x net income respectively. If we put E-Trade's brokerage on average of the two multiples (a 16.8 p/e), we arrive at a valuation for the brokerage of:$330M x 16.8 = $5.5B of brokerage valueCash and DebtDetermining E-Trade's corporate cash and net debt is straightforward, from the September 2011 SEC filing there was $438m of corporate cash and $1,490 of corporate debt, so that's essentially $1B of debt.Superficially, that sounds interesting, E-Trade's entire market cap is $2.5B, and we have a valuation of $4.5B but, of course, we haven't got to quantifying the banking losses yet.Banking Losses - $1.4BIt would be an understatement to say that E-Trade's loan portfolio is not pretty. E-Trade has $12.5B of home equity and 1-4 family home loans on its balance sheet. The majority of these loans are from 2005-7 made across the US but primarily in California and the height of the housing bubble. Weighting for the year of vintage using the Case-Shiller home price index the average house price in E-Trade's portfolio is down about 20% from when the loans were issued. That simple back of the envelope math gets you to $2.5B in losses and E-Trade have already taken $4B in charge-offs on these loans, which gives you a sense of the credit quality. The reason is in part that I'm using the current loan number whereas many of the original loans have now been paid down or charged off. However, despite these large charge-offs, there are still ways to go. The chart below shows charge-offs per quarter and the current run-rate is $150M/quarter, as an investor in E-Trade the decline is good, but you want to see net charge offs at zero.One way to size the future cost of these loans is to sum all the non-performing loans (more than 90 days delinquent) - $966M and the special mention loans (notably poor credit quality and 30+ days past due) - $458M and you get $1.4B in future losses on the loan portfolio. Perhaps this seems conservative, but bear in mind the $4B of losses that have already occurred. E-Trade's current allowance for additional loses is $0.8B, so this estimate is significantly higher than E-Trade's own.Deferred Tax Asset - $0.7BPerhaps the only advantage of lending money to home buyers at the peak of the housing bubble is you ultimately end up with significant losses for tax purposes. E-Trade values these as a $1.4B deferred tax asset that should reduce their future tax burden over the next 17 years, subject to various caveats. I will reduce this figure by half from $1.4B to $0.7B to be conservative, in part because parts of the deferred tax asset are in different parts of the corporate structure making it harder to use the asset fully. It is nonetheless reasonable to expect E-Trade to pay a lower tax rate going forward, because of this and that should be reflected in the valuation, since the brokerage is valued on a post-tax basis.Sum of the Parts ValuationE-Trade's current market cap is $2.6B, therefore $3.8B suggests 46% upside from the current $9 share price to $13.1SensitivitiesConclusionE-Trade is not a stock for the risk averse and is very much a value play. However, we are past the worst on loan losses and the value of the underlying brokerage operation should start to come through allowing the stock to appreciate as a result. I believe $13.1 is a reasonably price target but the stock could easily trade -/+ $2 either side of that figure ($11 to $15) dependent on the actual losses on the loan portfolio.I believe that at the current $9 price there is sufficient margin of safety to invest in the stock.Disclosure: I am long ETFC."

Net interest on assets is one of the major revenue sources for the company.(Chart created using Trefis' app)Watch out for Reduced Loan LossesA few factors that contributed to the recent decline in stock price, reaching its 52-week low at $7.74 Oct 4, 2011, are the concerns over instability in markets, low interest rates in the economy that will adversely affect the net interest earned, and the risky assets sitting in company’s mortgage portfolio. ETFC was able to report a higher profit in Q2 2011 than Q1 2011 or Q2 2010, despite lower revenue due, to reduction in the provision for loan losses. Continued efforts towards reduction of loan losses and risk will likely have positive effect on this quarter’s earnings as well.The uncertain regulatory environment, with Dodd Frank reforms and Volker rule, might have an unpleasant effect on the E-Trade bank (fully owned subsidiary of E-Trade) resulting in higher compliance costs if rules are changed for financial sector.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"

However, there are four reasons to consider buying ETFC now.Price/BookETFC is trading at just 0.6339 times book value. This valuation is near an all time low for the company.Improving Yield CurveRecently, long-term interest rates have started to rise somewhat. This is good for ETFC, because the company makes money on the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates. ETFC will benefit from higher long-term interest rates, because short-term interest rates will likely remain near zero through 2014.Stock Market RallyThe stock market is back to levels not seen since 2008. The rally should lead to increased activity by retail trades. The increase in activity will lead to more profits for ETFC.Takeover PotentialETFC has a market cap of just over $3 billion. Competitors such as Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (AMTD) are both much larger than ETFC. Consolidation is likely to continue in the industry because of how competitive the discount online brokerage business has become. ETFC is a ripe for a takeover.ConclusionFour reasons to consider ETFC are: Cheap valuation, increasing long-term interest rates, stock market rally and takeover potential.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Some important metrics:Valuation:Profitablity:Income:Balance Sheet:All of the above data fares well when compared to those of its competitors, and as the company continues to write down and move away from its exposure to old toxic and non-productive sub-prime mortgage based investments while focusing on its core brokerage business, the company looks better as a long term investment with each passing quarter.

If you spent a little more time thinking about that question though you would be missing out on some very clear and obvious parties that stand to benefit as well. In fact most individuals reading articles on this very website use the services that stand to benefit. Brokerages that charge a fee for making trades and appeal to a large mass of investors such as Etrade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) and Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) are poised to benefit the most. However, ETFC has much more going for it then SCHW does and choosing ETFC over SCHW would be the correct move.ETFC has been experiencing a tremendous explosion in volume as of late due to the impending European doom. Investors who were traditionally strictly long investors have been forced to become more agile in lieu of rapidly fluctuating markets. The extraordinary swings in the market have coerced participants to move in and out of positions quickly. Each transaction, buy or sell, is another fee for ETFC.The ultimate potential upside for ETFC is in the fact that Citadel Hedge Fund, the largest shareholder, is pushing for a sale of the company. Citadel owns nearly 10% of Etrade shares outstanding. Many parties including SCHW and TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) have openly expressed interest in such a deal. Goldman has been working with ETFC and is still putting together its findings on whether the deal is ultimately executable. It is my belief that this deal is going to happen and is a certainty. It is merely a factor of when not if. The whisper price previously was around $16 a share.ETFC should be on any active investor's mind as a possible position in their portfolio. I don’t believe people should buy today because of the enormous 5%+ moves the stock can make depending on the headlines. Given a week or two shares will be cheaper based on some headline regarding Greece or Italy. I would add a half position at a price point around $10.00 and if the stock retreats back to the $9.25-$9 level I would double my position.Disclosure; Long ETFC with a considerable amount of shares.

For those not familiar Citadel is the hedge fund which saved E-Trade from collapsing during the financial crisis, and now appears ready for the board to sell the company.  Our thesis was that first it was not a seller’s market and that the usual suspects were already digesting recent acquisitions, while other suitors were either unwilling or unable to make a move due to their balance sheets still being in shambles.With Europe once again at the forefront of every investor’s mind, followed closely by the banks and their situation here in the U.S., we still think that E-Trade could wait months, if not years, for buyers to come and ""kick the tires.""  At this point it is a foregone conclusion that Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is too preoccupied with its own problems to pull off an acquisition, and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is probably too involved in the long awaited rebranding of the Wachovia business to get side tracked with a business that would require a bit of TLC to fully integrate.  We considered these two to be long shots, but with the current market climate for banks, both Bank of America and Wells Fargo are out of the picture.  Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), which we thought was the furthest possibility for E-Trade looks to be exiting the business as well via a divesture of their brokerage business, Morgan Keegan.We feel safe at this point in making the all encompassing statement that no traditional bank, investment bank or traditional broker will be touching this asset before the mess in Europe is cleaned up, Washington finalizes the debt agreement and the overall business environment in the US improves.The short list of potential acquirers is just that.  We still feel that either Charles Schwab or TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) will ultimately purchase E-Trade, but with the current state of the balance sheet and income statement it is quite difficult to envision a large multiple being paid out.  Our belief is that ETFC would receive a buyout offer no more than 20-25% higher than today’s price, and far below the current 52-week high.In the current environment it appears investors have come around to our belief that ETFC will be a tough sell with all of their baggage.  If Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade are the only bidders, a bidding war is hard to imagine as both companies are disciplined buyers.  Unless a buyout materializes or there is improvement in the economy as a whole, we view ETFC shares as underperformers to their industry peers over the next 6-12 months, thus our belief that those wanting to participate in the sector would be better suited buying EFTC’s potential future acquirers.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
294337,20568,2011-09-18T10:00:23-04:00,,"We have downgraded our recommendation on E*Trade Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:ETFC) to Neutral from Outperform due to volatile trading business and the turbulence in the global markets.In July, E*TRADE reported second-quarter 2011 earnings of 16 cents per  share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the prior  quarter. However, the company’s net income compared favorably with 12  cents per share earned in the prior-year quarter owing to higher net  operating interest income and decrease in provision for loan losses,  partially offset by increase in operating expenses and lower  non-interest income.E*TRADE has been severely hit by the global crisis and has incurred  significant losses. Higher competitive pressure has added to the woes.  In addition, technological advances and regulatory changes in the  marketplace might continue to tighten securities spreads. Tighter  spreads could reduce revenue capture per share by its market maker, thus  squeezing revenues for this line of business.E*TRADE is reducing the size of its balance sheet, which signifies a  decrease in savings and other bank-related customer deposits and net new  customer assets, along with a reduction in total assets, thereby  creating a weak liquidity and a rickety scenario for the future. We  expect net interest margin to remain pressured as well.Recent regulatory issues also remain a headwind for the company. It is  difficult to predict at this moment the specific impact that the  Dodd-Frank Act issued in July 2010 and the yet-to-be-written rules and  regulations will have on the company. E*TRADE expects its compliance  costs to be up slightly given the legislation materially changes the  regulatory environment for the financial services industry in which it  operates.On the flip side, E*TRADE returned to profitability in the prior  quarter and continued to record positive earnings in the second quarter  2011, driven by higher net operating interest income, decrease in  provision for loan losses and positive trends in loan portfolio. The  second-quarter performance demonstrated business strength even as  trading activity slowed across the industry. We expect the company’s  positive trend to continue in the upcoming quarters owing to utilization  of E*TRADE's broad range of trading and investment products and  services.The company’s online brokerage business showed positive trend in July  and August after reflecting volatile performance over the past several  quarters. The delivery of its products and services, primarily through  online and technology-intensive channels, aided in delivering strong  organic growth in brokerage accounts and margin receivables. Moreover,  E*TRADE continues to streamline its balance sheet risk by reducing  credit risk in its loan portfolios. It lowered balance sheet risks as  its legacy loan portfolio contracted by $0.9 billion from the prior  quarter, including $0.7 billion related to prepayments or scheduled  principal reductions.Initiatives to reduce balance sheet risk look promising, although it  will add near-term pressure on the interest margin. Moreover, volatility  in global markets and uncertainty in economic recovery remains cause of  concern.E*TRADE currently retains a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term Hold rating. E*TRADE’s closest competitor - Charles Schwab Corp. (NYSE:SCHW) also retains a Zacks #3 Rank."

I won’t sell E*Trade to anyone, as I’m very happy with the service, especially the platinum group division, whose services are much better than those of Fidelity. But as a current shareholder, I’m for the proposal. I will sell to anyone who is prepared to enhance shareholder value, because the current leadership hasn’t.

Also, there's the expensive and ineffective marketing campaign"" E*Trade's commercials feature a baby trading. I’m not sure what the message is trying to convey to current and prospective customers.  E*Trade further organizes investor conferences in New York City during trading hours.

The income also compares  favorably with loss of 11 cents and 25 cents per share in the prior  quarter and prior-year quarter, respectively.E*TRADE reported fourth-quarter net income of $45.2 million compared  with a net loss of $24.1 million in the prior quarter and $47.8 million  in the prior-year quarter.Performance in DetailIn the first quarter of 2011, total net revenue inched up 3.6%  sequentially, but was flat year over year to $536.7 million. Moreover,  the revenue substantially surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  $381.0 million.The total daily average revenue trades (DARTs) for the reported quarter  was 177,000, surging 18% sequentially and 14% year over year. Net new  brokerage assets reported were $3.9 billion in the quarter, up from $2.4  billion in the prior quarter and $2.2 billion in the prior-year  quarter.At the end of the quarter, E*TRADE reported 4.3 million customer  accounts, which included a record 2.7 million brokerage accounts. In the  first quarter of 2011, net new brokerage accounts scaled up to 51,000  from 28,000 in the prior quarter and 2,000 in the prior-year quarter.Net operating interest income was up 1.6% sequentially, but down 3.3%  year over year to $310.0 million in the quarter. The sequential increase  was due to a $1.3 billion increase in average interest-earning assets,  largely offset by four basis points decrease in the net interest spread.  In the quarter, net interest spread was 2.84%, down from 2.88% in the  prior quarter.Total operating expense inched down 2.2% sequentially, but edged up  0.9% year over year to $298.0 million. The sequential decrease was  attributable to lower professional services costs, occupancy and  equipment expenses and other operating expenses, partially offset by  higher compensation, clearing and advertising expenses. The  year-over-year increase was due to higher advertising and market  development expenses.Overall credit quality metrics trends were mixed in the quarter.  E*TRADE's provision for loan losses decreased 40.0% sequentially to  $116.1 million. Net charge-offs were $193.6 million, down from $195.5  million in the prior quarter, while allowance for loan losses remained  flat sequentially at $1.0 billion.Balance SheetE*TRADE reduced its balance sheet risk further, with its loan portfolio  contracting $0.9 billion from the last quarter, of which $0.7 billion  was due to prepayments or scheduled principal reductions.The company maintained bank capital ratios well above the regulatory  well-capitalized threshold. As of March 31, 2011, E*TRADE reported Bank  Tier 1 capital ratios of 7.54% to total adjusted assets and 14.29% to  risk-weighted assets.Performance by PeersE*TRADE’s closest competitor, Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW - Analyst Report)  reported first-quarter 2011 earnings of 20 cents per share, a penny  ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. This also compares  favorably with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 11 cents. Charles  Schwab’s results benefited from improved revenue and increase in  interest-earning assets. Additionally, fall in non-interest expenses was  also a positive for the company.Our TakeThe competitive position in the market for brokerage business depends  on trading customers, predominantly active traders. As the long-term  investing customer group is less developed compared with the trading  customers, there is an opportunity for future growth as and when the  long-term customers expand.Development of innovative online trading and long-term investing  products and services, delivery of advanced customer service, creative  and cost-effective marketing and sales, and expense discipline can be  considered as key factors in executing E*TRADE’s strategy to profitably  grow trading and investing business.Additionally, stabilization in the credit quality suggests that  management can now focus more on the company’s core business. The  company reported an improvement in the brokerage business and the retail  investors’ environment is visible.Initiatives to reduce balance sheet risk are encouraging but it will  add near-term pressure on interest margin. Yet, the company’s capital  position and restructuring initiatives are encouraging, but increase in  operating expenses can have an adverse impact.E*TRADE currently retains its Zacks #3 Rank, which translates to a  short-term ‘Hold’ rating. Considering the fundamentals, we are  maintaining our ‘Neutral’ recommendation on the stock."

That  would explain the launch of the E*TRADE Community – the latest attempt  by an online brokerage firm to harness the power of social networking  for investors to “connect with each other, share ideas, and validate  their investment strategies”. [1]  With many casual and retail investors preferring peer outlooks to  analyst reports while making their investment decisions, this move can  go a long way for E-Trade in attracting new customers. While Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) incorporated community features in 2008, whether competing online brokerages Ameritrade (NYSE:AMTD) and Fidelity will follow suit with new feature launches remains to be seen. [2]We have a $18.14 price estimate for E-Trade stock, a premium of about 15% to market price.E*TRADE Community: The What and WhyE-Trade’s new community feature is being provided to all retail  investors that have an online brokerage account with the company. Just  like other social networking websites, the platform allows investors to  join as a member and create an online profile – although people with  brokerage accounts can access the discussions in the community space  without having to specifically join as a member.Members can provide their own opinions, understand the overall  sentiment regarding individual stocks, and even see which stocks a  particular investor has traded over a period of time. E-Trade also  claims that personal information about individual investors (including  names and account details) are adequately protected.(Chart created by using Trefis' app) The Potential Upside for E-Trade’s Stock is SignificantOnline brokerage firms are not very well differentiated. In the  recent past, competition has been fierce on commissions & fees,  types of investment products offered, research & advice for  investors, and customer service. And the technology has been largely the  same for all of them, with brokerages offering similar interfaces for  trading using a computer or mobile phone.But community options may set E-Trade apart in the near future, with  more retail investors wanting to leverage opportunities and insights  distributed through social networks. E-Trade had about 2.7 million  active brokerage accounts at the end of 2010, a number dwarfed by the 8  million active brokerage accounts that each of its competitors Schwab  and Ameritrade had.We currently project that E-Trade could grow its total number of  brokerage accounts by about 3% annually. But if the social-networking  platform does take-off, growth could be as high as 10% annually, given  the huge amount of churn among online brokerage firms. In this scenario,  the number of brokerage accounts would nearly double in the next 5  years and represent an almost 10% upside to our $18.14 price estimate, pushing our number close to $20.See our full analysis and $18.14 price estimate for E-TradeNotes:"

With all this talk about E-Trade still being sold, I am sure many shareholders have been crunching numbers to see which scenarios could play out. For those of you who have been patiently waiting for a nice pay off, you may find my analysis below helpful.In 2008, The Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS) purchased 125,000 brokerage accounts from E-Trade in an all-cash deal for $442 million. The result of this sale was $3,536 per account. According to E-Trade’s website at the end of September 2010, E-Trade indicated that they had a total of 2,656,702 brokerage accounts. Using $3,536 as the selling price per account, E-Trade’s total brokerage accounts are worth just under $9.3 billion. So what would $9.3 billion dollars mean to E-Trade shareholders? First Case Scenario:By looking at Table 1 below, paying $9.3 billion for E-Trade’s brokerage accounts would equal to roughly $31 per share for shareholders after all the debt is paid off.(Table 1 – “Buyout Price after Buyer Pays off Total Debt”)Second Case Scenario: By looking at Table 2 below, paying $9.3 billion for E-Trade’s brokerage accounts would equal to roughly $41 per share for shareholders if E-Trade pays off all its debt including the senior convertible notes on its own before someone makes an offer.  (Table 2 – “Buyout Price after E-Trade Pays off Total Debt”)The second scenario will be hard to visualize since E-Trade has roughly $2.3 billion (including the senior convertible notes) of debt. However, E-Trade does have around $490 million in cash on hand at the parent company and they are moving money up from the bank which is now profitable to the parent company. In E-Trade’s last conference call, they did say that in the near future they may start buying back debt or issue a stock buyback program with their extra cash on hand so that $2.3 billion debt can shrink down by a substantial amount.

We maintain a $16.88 price estimate for E-Trade stock, in line with market price.(Chart created by using Trefis' app)Increasing competition in the brokerage business to push trading commissions southThe online financial services market continues to evolve rapidly and  we expect it to remain highly competitive. E-Trade’s trading and  investing segment competes with full commission brokerage firms,  discount brokerage firms, online brokerage firms, Internet banks,  traditional “brick & mortar” retail banks and thrifts and  market-making firms.E-Trade has had to slash its commissions in the past to stay  competitive in the market and acquire new client accounts. Because most  of the revenue per trade is made up of commissions from equity trading,  E-Trade’s average revenue per trade is expect to decline in the next few  years before steadying in the long run, as we do not expect E-Trade to  slash its commissions beyond a certain level.(Chart created by using Trefis' app)Recovering markets invite investors to cash in on the bull runMarkets have been depressed in valuations for the last 2 years.  However, as they are starting to recover from these lows, we anticipate a  pickup in investments into the markets. This should result in an  increase in the number of clients, and hence an increase in the number  of active brokerage accounts.(Chart created by using Trefis' app)Rise in equity trading volumes to increase principal transaction revenuesAs equity markets recover from their depths of early 2009, we expect  equity trading to increase. This will lead to increased number of stocks  in which E-Trade acts as a market-maker and larger volumes of trading  in these stocks. Both of these will boost principal transaction revenues  over the years to come."

The decline in revenue was due to weak  trading volume during the reported quarter. However, revenue reported  substantially surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $323 million.The total daily average revenue trades (DARTs) for the reported quarter  was 127,000, down 26% sequentially and 30% year over year. Net new  brokerage assets reported was $1.4 billion, down from $2.1 billion in  the prior quarter, but up from $1.1 billion in the prior-year quarter.At the end of the quarter, E*TRADE reported 4.2 million customer  accounts, which included a record of 2.7 million brokerage accounts.

The sequential decrease was due to $1.3 billion  decline in average interest-earning assets, largely offset by a six  basis point increase in the net interest spread. In the third quarter of  2010, net interest spread was 2.95%.Total operating expense decreased 3% sequentially to $267 million,  attributed to lower compensation, clearing, advertising and professional  services costs.Overall credit quality improvement was recorded in the quarter.  E*TRADE's provision for loan losses for the reported quarter decreased  8.4% sequentially and 56% year over year to $152 million. Net  charge-offs were $222 million, down from $225 million in the prior  quarter, while allowance for loan losses declined by $70 million to $1.0  billion.Balance SheetE*TRADE was continual in reducing balance sheet risk as its loan  portfolio contracted by $1.0 billion from the last quarter, of which  $0.8 billion was due to prepayments or scheduled principal reductions.The company maintained Bank capital ratios well above the regulatory  well-capitalized thresholds. As of September 30, 2010, E*TRADE reported  Bank Tier 1 capital ratios of 7.41% to total adjusted assets and 13.75%  to risk-weighted assets.Performance by PeersLast week, E*TRADE’s closest competitor The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW)  released its third quarter results reporting net earnings of 18 cents  per share, substantially surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9  cents.Our TakeThe competitive position in the market for brokerage business depends  on trading customers, predominantly active traders. As the long-term  investing customer group is less developed compared with the trading  customers, there is an opportunity for future growth as and when the  long-term customers expand.Development of innovative online trading and long-term investing  products and services, delivery of advanced customer service, creative  and cost-effective marketing and sales, and expense discipline can be  considered as key factors in executing E*TRADE’s strategy to profitably  grow trading and investing business.Additionally, somewhat stabilization in the credit quality reflects  that management can now focus more on the company’s core business.E*TRADE currently retains its Zacks #3 Rank, which translates to a  short-term Hold rating.

For the month of April, 2010, Daily Average Revenue Trades (DARTs) were 181,556, up 17.0% sequentially, but down 14.0% on a year-over-year basis. DARTs represent the number of trades from which brokers can expect commissions or fees. Broker performance is measured through DARTs.  At the end of the month, total accounts were approximately 4.3 million, including more than 2.6 million brokerage accounts, 1.0 million stock plan accounts and 0.6 million banking accounts. Total brokerage accounts include gross new brokerage accounts of 45,744 and net new brokerage accounts of 17,627 during the month.   To date, net new brokerage assets were $2.9 billion, of which $0.7 billion was recorded in April. Total brokerage accounts and net new brokerage accounts indicate the company’s ability to attract and retain trading and investing customers.  During April, customer security holdings were $110.9 billion, up 4.0% sequentially, while brokerage-related cash was down 1.4% sequentially to $21.5 billion, as customers were net buyers of approximately $1.3 billion in securities in April.  Bank-related cash and deposits declined 3.6% sequentially to $10.7 billion in the reported month.  The competitive position in the market for brokerage business depends on trading customers, predominantly active traders. As the long-term investing customer group is less developed compared with trading customers, there is an opportunity for future growth as and when the long-term customers expand.  Development of innovative online trading and long-term investing products and services, delivery of advanced customer service, creative and cost-effective marketing and sales, and expense discipline can be considered as key factors in executing ETFC’s strategy to profitably grow trading and investing business.  During March 2010, ETFC sold $1 billion of savings accounts to Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), which enabled the company to grow brokerage business as the savings accounts sold were primarily with customers and were not allied with an active brokerage account.  Last week, ETFC’s closest competitor The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) released its monthly activity report for April, which recorded net new assets of $3.8 billion, exceeding ETFC’s assets by $0.9 billion."

The online brokerage firm is still trying to recover from the subprime mortgage crisis. E*TRADE had 3 billion dollars in asset backed securities and collateralized debt obligations. The company sold these obligations but the firm has struggled to find its financial footing. Analysts are forecasting a .03 per share loss for 2010 and a gain of .08 per share for 2011.E*TRADE has been a rumored takeover target for the past 2 years despite denials from other brokerage firms. While the company’s brokerage accounts would be attractive to another broker/dealer; E*TRADE’s balance sheet has a few issues. E*TRADE has twice as much debt as cash and a negative ROE. Even though the company has a market cap of $3.1 billion, the enterprise value is $9.55 billion. Revenue and profitability are continuing to decline.

As the company's largest shareholder, Citadel is planning to sell over 27 million shares.Keep in mind that even after Citadel divests its almost 9% equity stake, it still owns a sizable chunk of convertible debt. If converted, this would ratchet the stake to almost 30% ownership. But this is not the first time Griffin's firm has sold shares, as Citadel sold ETFC back in late 2009 when shares traded around $1.20 per share. Since then, the shares have undergone a 1:10 reverse split and shares trade around $15.85 today.The company underwent turbulent times during the financial crisis as it strayed from its stock brokerage roots and into the mortgage market right at the peak. After slowly but surely returning solely to its core business, the company still sits in limbo as shares are only up around 2% over the past year.Hedge fund legend Leon Cooperman and his Omega Advisors are long E*Trade and see it as a potential takeover target. (To see the rest of Omega Advisors' portfolio, head to Hedge Fund Wisdom). This seems to be the common investment thesis on ETFC as many investors argue it could be a prime asset to bigger houses like TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) or Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW). This thesis has not played out over the past few years (obviously). Perhaps activity in this regard would be spurred once interest rates start to rise, as this would help improve brokerage profitability.Per Google Finance:Disclosure: No positionsOriginal post"
174298,23345,2009-11-19T09:39:06-05:00,,"Key Points As the month of October drew to a close, Treasury bond prices were under a bit of pressure when the market absorbed yet another record week of auctions, this round totaling $123B in new supply spread out over various maturities. It is not easy selling record amounts of ultra-safe Treasury bonds at the same time economic data are being released showing the expansion of the economy and business cycle. The final leg of the auctions ($31B in 7-year Treasury notes) occurred on the same day that the much anticipated advance GDP numbers were released. The GDP report confirmed what many had forecast -- the economy has turned the corner from negative to positive growth. The debate now centers on how long the recovery will last, how significant it will be and even whether or not this will be a double-dip recession. For the time being though, we will take the positive economic news. The good news to be taken from the data is that taxpayers are starting to see something in return for their money that the government has been spending on various stimulus programs (e.g. cash for clunkers and first time home buyer incentives). The positive GDP report suggests that efforts to pull the economy out of recession have been effective, at least on some levels. I find it interesting that earlier in the month we learned the Treasury Department has plans to extend the average life of its outstanding debt. The plan is to extend the average maturity of Treasuries to 72 months. This extension to six years is up from the current average of just over four years. What is the motivation? To lock in lower rates before they begin to creep up with the improving economic picture. According to Bloomberg News, almost 25% of the Treasury’s existing debt will mature in 2010.   One final word on the Treasury market involves the Federal Reserve’s purchases of Treasuries at various spots along the curve. The “quantitative easing” program, which was initiated with the intent of forcing interest rates lower saw the Fed buy as much as $300B in Treasury debt. The Fed has also been buying large amounts of mortgaged-backed securities as well. The plan has been successful to the degree that interest rates, especially home mortgage rates, have remained low. Now that the program has ended, it does not necessarily mean that Treasury yields will spike up without the Fed’s support, though we could see some additional volatility in trading. Treasuries remain in significant demand from buyers, both domestic and global.The municipal bond market pulled back a bit last month with the primary index down 2.1%. Longer maturity components of the index were down even more. It is not too surprising that the market has taken a breather after turning in a 14% return for the first nine months of the year. The good news is that the pull back added a little more value back into the asset class in certain areas, so take advantage where you can. Even though many of the high quality names on the short end of the maturity scale may be seen as fully valued, that area is still appealing to many. Investors can find bonds with tax-exempt yields of 0.50% to 0.80% on maturities between six months and a year. I have pointed out in the past how these levels may not be appealing in absolute terms, however, on a relative basis, they are fair. Relative to what? Money market rates at 0.01% to 0.25%. This remains an area where many individual investors prefer to invest as opposed to the total-return managers that tend to look further out. If you don’t require daily liquidity and can lock-up your money for six months to a year, then this is worth a look. I was recently asked why munis are so popular among individual investors. The answer is a straightforward one. The primary appeal is the tax-exempt interest income they provide. Also, this is an asset class made up of predominately higher quality issuers with either tax-supported revenue streams or fees from essential purpose utilities to meet debt service. They also have low historical default rates and are seen as relatively safe.Those who joined our latest web-seminar heard me explain why it is my belief that there is a greater probability of income taxes going up as opposed to staying flat or even going down at the Federal level. The government simply needs more money to pay the increasing size of its bills. Several states this year have already increased income tax levels or added new top brackets. Potential tax increases are just one more reason for the municipal bond asset class to continue being popular among upper income earners or with anyone who wishes to shelter some income from taxation. Now that I referred to the overall safety and low defaults on munis, let me not overlook the fact defaults do occur. Several months ago I mentioned a California based wine museum (Copia: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts) that is in default on ~$77M in debt. This issuer accessed the muni market through the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank. According to an article in The Bond Buyer newspaper, legal proceedings are moving this bankruptcy toward the liquidation phase, so if anyone is searching for 17 acres in the Napa area here is your chance. The land comes with a 78k square foot building. It looks like they have a bid for the property of $37 million and that translates into roughly 48¢ on the dollar. What went wrong with Copia? The museum’s bonds are backed by “gifts, grants, bequests, donations, admission fees, parking fees and other operating revenues”. In the end it was simply not enough to meet their obligations. More traditional muni borrowers (states, cities, towns, municipal agencies and utilities) have the option of cutting spending or raising taxes and user fees. This adds a layer of safety that has proven to be dependable and attractive to investors. The more traditional munis are the types of individual bonds that I invest in for our clients at Kobren Insight Management. We do have exposure to the more risky kind as well, but we look to mutual funds to gain that exposure and I fully recommend that retail investors do the same."

After the dust settled (for the moment at least), we thought we'd survey the damage in total to provide an overall look after the fact. This comes after our previous post that disclosed some of Citadel's sales. This time around was no different as the selling continued.In late September, Citadel engaged in a debt-for-equity swap where it converted $87.9 million worth of Class A debentures. This yielded Citadel 84.9 million shares with an exercise price of $1.03 per share. The fund then also sold around 85 million shares ranging from prices of $1.70 to $2.08 and netted over $160 million from the transactions. After it was all said and done, Citadel was left holding 166.2 million shares of ETFC, or around $941 million worth at the time.The hedge fund made the sales in order to manage its exposure levels in its portfolio. Citadel had previously planned to sell a bunch of shares under a pre-arranged trading schedule but then abandoned that plan. Its equity stake in ETrade was down to a 9.9% ownership stake, having previously been as high as 14.9%. We fully expect more SEC filings to come down the line if the past is any indication. To see the rest of Citadel's holdings, head to our post on its portfolio.Ken Griffin started his career trading options from his dorm room at Harvard his freshman year. He then launched a convertible bond arbitrage fund his sophomore year and by his senior year, he had $1 million from investors. Since then, Citadel has seen average annual returns of around 20%. The year of 2008, however, was a difficult one for the fund as its flagship Wellington and Kensington funds were down big. In fact, it was among the top 10 hedge fund asset losers.

However when it comes to bonds, there is definitely a difference. Trying to research and invest in bonds on most of the sites I tested ranged from mediocre to downright awful. E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) was the most comfortable bond service platform I used.First, E*Trade maintains a large selection of bonds and other fixed-income securities that can be purchased for as little as $1.00 per bond ($10.00 minimum/$250.00 maximum). What E*Trade doesn't have online directly they will procure for the investor promptly and at a satisfactory price. If you want to sell a bond, I found the process to be user-friendly and on target with prices.Second, their online research tools are easy to manipulate and comprehensive. When I called the bond desk, I was not faced with what seemed like a high school GED candidate - which was my impression from some other brokerages online. Plus, they acted quickly upon my phone inquiry without the usual waiting period which at one brokerage took almost an entire Symphony's worth of time.Third, the investor will find E*Trade's bond fund selector an easy tool to work with.

161915,22329,2009-09-17T02:48:02-04:00,,"Citadel chief Ken Griffin is starting a full-scale investment bank, to compete alongside Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), according to an interview the hedge fund manager gave to Bloomberg recently, which was published Tuesday.That won’t be surprising to readers of BNET Finance, who first heard the story here on Friday when I wrote that the fund’s Omnium subsidiary and E*Trade holdings effectively gave it a full-scale back office (see story here).After a tumultuous year in 2008, Griffin is launching three new hedge funds, while he’s reducing the size of his two largest flagship funds (Kensington and Wellington). He expects to meet the entire $1 billion amount of redemptions from investors this year, after the two funds gained some 52 percent through September 1 in the market upturn.The shift in strategic focus is a good idea from a growth perspective, but it’s going to be interesting to see how exactly it plays out. According to sources that I’ve spoken with, demand from competing hedge funds for Citadel’s new back office functions has so far been tepid, since asset managers are still uncertain about the strength of the Chinese Walls that lie between the firm’s trading and transactional divisions.What’s notable too in the Bloomberg interview is how quiet Griffin is on the subject of E*Trade. Since the broker is one of the few publically-listed companies in which Citadel holds a full-blown operating position, it makes for a sensitive topic in terms of E*Trade’s share price.Griffin’s silence on this subject and candidness about having employed 70 people to run a new investment bank for him certainly implies a much more central operating role for the online broker than many investors may currently realize.Building on E*Trade’s facilities would, after all, be a great way to reassure competing money managers that the walls between trading and back office platforms were well away from one another. In fact, they would then be in completely separate cities."

The people I speak with guess $3 to $4 a share will be the offer and could come any day. A few years ago analysts said ETFC could fetch between $10-$11 per share on a buyout deal. Now the book value is about $2.70 a share. Cost savings to an AMTD bottom line of a merger make a lot of sense. ETFC CEO Donald Layton will step down at the end of the year.

AMTD instead purchased TD Waterhouse, with TD Bank holding a 39% stake in the new entity.In 2005, ETFC acquired Harrisdirect, formerly a discount brokerage service of the Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO), and BrownCo, formerly a discount brokerage service of J.P.

Layton had joined ETFC board of directors in November 2007, at the same time as the Citadel deal. Layton has been aggressively acting on the turnaround plan and the company has stabilized and is seeing the beginnings of a return to growth.I fully believe ETFC will be bought before the end year.

164890,21733,2009-10-05T15:35:07-04:00,,"It appears that the mandatory regulatory repositioning of E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) stock is complete. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings show that E*Trade’s largest shareholder, Citadel, has now sold off $206.8 million over the last couple of weeks. These sales reduce their stake to a more comfortable level of 9.4% of the shares outstanding. Citadel’s primary purpose for selling is to stay below the 10% mark; bank stakes above 9.9% require investors to submit intensive federal oversight that a hedge fund like Citadel desperately wants to avoid. Citadel actually owns much more than 9.4% of E*Trade but because of an agreement that restricts their ability to convert E*Trade debt into stock, they are able to escape the regulatory headache. Citadel may want to continue to reduce their holdings in order to have increased wiggle room underneath 9.9% for future conversions but the rate of sales appears to have moderated significantly. The selling pressure caused by Citadel as well as E*Trade’s own capital raising efforts have created quite a burden on E*Trade’s attempts to go higher. The burden is over. Now we can focus on fundamentals. The fundamental outlook for this company is as solid as it has been in over two years, yet the stock is still priced for failure. Now that the structural selling pressure has subsided, E*Trade stock will be free to run in a unique window of opportunity spanning the next six months. Consider the following catalysts: 1) An Improving LandscapeThe mortgage losses that have slammed E*Trade are on the verge of becoming a positive for shareholders. The bottoming process in housing is taking root. On Monday, the Treasury Department announced that Blackrock Inc, Wellington Management Company LLP,. and AllianceBernstein LP will commit $1.94 billion to purchase troubled real estate assets in the governments Public Private Investment Program (PPIP). The purchasing power of the 3 funds will increase to $7.74 billion because of Treasury financing incentives. So far, there is $12.27 billion in purchasing power through PPIP with that number expected to rise to $40 billion. This program will serve to boost a mortgage market that is showing signs of improvement on its own. The Financial Times reports that the Q3 rally in toxic securities could deliver a significant boost to US banks earnings if the institutions choose to recognize the short term improvement. These mortgage securities that forced massive ‘write-downs’ in 2008 may be on the verge of ‘write-ups’ as we near 2010. In the last three months, the Market ABX Index, which tracks securities backed by home loans, has gained more than 30 percent as investors have rediscovered their risk appetite and the US government flooded the debt markets with liquidity.  In a recent upgrade from FBR Capital, the analyst commented, “investors should focus on evidence of continued improvements in delinquency trends in Etrade’s $8.8 billion HELOC portfolio, as well as stabilization in delinquencies in the $11.4 billion one-to-four-family portfolio.” E*Trade expects total net charge-offs of $375 million during Q309 representing a sequential improvement over Q209. Analysts from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have joined FBR in upgrading E*Trade because of signs of improvement in the mortgage portfolio. 2) A Thriving Core BusinessEven during the carnage of 2008, E*Trade was able to grow its core brokerage business by adding $6.4 billion in customer assets. 2009 has witnessed more growth. CEO Donald Layton said on the Q2 conference call, “Our online brokerage business in thriving...volumes are up versus last quarter, our average commission per trade is higher, and interest spreads are much improved.” The movement to online trading continues to be a high growth trend. As high speed mobile Internet access becomes increasingly available, this trend will continue. E*Trade is a company perfectly situated for success in the tech revolution. Layton is stepping down at the end of year and I expect the naming of a new CEO to be met with optimism from shareholders who are looking for a new beginning. A renewed emphasis on E*Trade’s strength should be applauded by Wall Street. Surviving the financial crisis was no small thing. 3) Buyout PotentialI rarely buy a company for its buyout potential because of the uncertainties involved, but this one is different. The mere speculation of consolidation within the industry will fuel a stock rise whether it happens of not. There may be multiple suitors for E*Trade beyond TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) and Schwab (NYSE:SCHW). An institution looking to become a major player in the online brokerage business like Wells Fargo or Goldman Sachs might actually be a better fit with E*Trade because the mortgage portfolio wouldn’t be as much of a problem. As evidenced by the recent success of PPIP, firms are actually beginning to view mortgages as a positive. I’ve been looking forward to October as a prime opportunity to increase my position in E*Trade. I made my first purchase in March with the stock under $1, and I’m adding to it now because it appears the dilutive improvements to the company’s capital structure are complete. I believe E*Trade is ready to resume its climb. I'll be purchasing out of the money $2 April 2010 calls and $2.50 January 2011 calls. DISCLOSURE: LONG ETFC"

Matt Goldstein at Reuters reports:This new exclusive six-year arrangement would mean even bigger bucks for Citadel’s already highly-profitable high-frequency trading business, given that E*Trade customers make more than 4 million trades a month.Is this merely a way for Citadel's other divisions to have advance notice on the intent of a significant number of daytraders? Citadel claims no:Yet is it as black and white as all that? In order to get access to nearly double the order flow from E-Trade it currently sees, Citadel is willing to make an upfront $100 million payment to the brokerage that until 2 years ago was selling mortgages, whose resultant implosion left it on the verge of bankruptcy.One would hope the OTS is carefully examining the implications of this transaction, for several very valid reasons:In the options world, Citadel’s market-making division, Citadel Derivatives Group, is the big kahuna. Its high-frequency trading-powered desk controls some 30 percent of the daily trading activity. So if this exclusive pact with E*Trade goes through, Citadel’s stranglehold on the options market will simply get a bit tighter.And as Matt concludes:Let's not forget that Citadel (along with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)) is a minority owner of Direct Edge, which is at the heart of the Flash trading scandal, and is the one firm that to date has refused to voluntarily ebolish Flash trades. Perhaps the OTS should figure out what informational advantage (if any) Citadel gleans from Direct Edge either directly or indirectly, and then decide on whether the proposed transaction is truly for the benefit of E-Trade's numerous customers."

Then, on Monday, Griffin and Citadel said, “never mind.”Citadel offered no explanation for its sudden change of heart beyond pointing to the press release it issued on the matter.The Citadel about face also comes a few weeks after E*Trade’s regulator put the kibosh on an application by the hedge fund’s big high-frequency powered market making unit to get its hands on most of the online broker’s customer order flow. The Office of Thrift Supervision, on Aug. 14, put the application on ice and asked Citadel and E*Trade for more information.Did the OTS decision impact Griffin’s decision to put off the stock sale? It’s hard to know since neither Citadel nor E*Trade are talking. And the OTS is not helping matters much, either.The OTS, the regulator the Obama administration would like to merge out of existence, recently denied my request for a copy of the letter it sent E*Trade and Citadel about its decision to “suspend consideration” of the order flow application.I’ve attached a copy of the letter denying my Freedom of Information Act below. The regulator’s FOIA officer says the request was denied because it might impinge on “trade secrets and commercial financial information,” as well as reveal “information contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports.”When a giant hedge fund conglomerate tries to get its hands on the vast majority of a retail broker’s customer order flow and the regulators have an issue with it, it would be nice if the regulators could tell us what the problem is.In any event, I will appeal the denial but I’m not holding my breath waiting for a positive response."

161127,22329,2009-09-12T14:54:29-04:00,,"Among asset management circles on Wall Street, there’s a persistent rumor that just won’t go away: the world’s most aggressive hedge fund is gearing up to become a full-scale banking institution.Citadel Investment Group, a Chicago-based hedge fund, is on many asset managers’ radars right now to one day become a full-service boutique investment bank. Recently, the fund seems to be doing little to hide that ambition.Citadel’s interest in online broker E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) is a good starting point. With nearly $2 billion invested in its long-time holding E*Trade this year, Citadel has become far more than a speculator in the stock: it’s pretty much an operating manager. Signs of that status were confirmed by its recent refusal to enter into a 120 million share sale in late August in the interests of the company, despite financial benefits for the fund.More recently, E*Trade’s chief executive Donald Layton said he will step down from the job at the end of the year. That announcement followed Citadel manager Ken Griffin’s ascension to the broker’s board earlier in the year. It’s a well-known fact that Layton and Griffin frequently argued over the E*Trade’s strategic direction.In other news, Citadel’s administrative division, Citadel Solutions, recently gained a contract to provide accounting, IT and back-office services to a $50 billion piece of what remains of the former Lehman Brothers carcass. Citadel re-branded its Solutions subsidiary Omnium on the eve of the deal. Citadel is also one of the first hedge funds to resume hiring after last year’s market train-wreck.The two deals are a pretty clear sign that Griffin has more in mind for his financial war chest than pure asset management. In fact, via both the E*Trade and the Omnium subsidiaries, it’s evident that the financial warlord (most of his companies have names borrowed from military contexts) is building a sizeable back-office, capable of handling a range of financial services functions.Griffin is the kind of Type A, leap-feet-first-into-the-next-big-thing-when-the-going-gets-tough, hyper-aggressive money manager that you more often see on the big screen than casually strolling around Chicago. According to hedge fund lore, he paid his way through college with his trading profits.In that light, it wouldn’t be surprising to see Citadel become a sort of Goldman Sachs-style (NYSE:GS) bank: with a strong trading arm, a razor-sharp team, and an increasing tightening in hedge fund regulation, the move definitely makes sense from a growth perspective."

In fact, the Obama administration wants to merge it out of existence.So I was quite surprised when the OTS late Friday decided to suspend consideration of an application that would have enabled Citadel Investment Group to get control over virtually all of E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) customer trades–what’s known as order flow on Wall Street.I wrote about this move by Citadel earlier and how it would have been a big boon to Citadel’s highly-profitable high-frequency trading business. And I urged the OTS to move cautiously on this application.OTS spokesman William Ruberry said the agency has decided to “suspend consideration of the application while we examine certain issues.” He declined to elaborate on the regulator’s action. He added that a confidential “policy and law” letter about the decision to suspend the application had been sent to the parties.I had been expecting the OTS to approve the deal, since E*Trade desperately needs the $100 million in cash that Citadel was prepared to pay it for access to the customer trades. But maybe this is an indication that regulators are finally starting to take a close look at high-frequency trading and the ramifications it has on the markets.And how ironic that it’s the least respected regulator that may have taken the first bold step towards controlling the rapid spread of HFT.Mary Schaprio and the SEC, are you paying attention?"
144855,21181,2009-06-23T11:00:05-04:00,,"The largest broker in the U.S. -- E*Trade Financial Corp. (NYSE:ETFC) -- is living on borrowed time. It received a reprieve of sorts when it refinanced its mountainous debt load on Monday with its largest shareholder Citadel Investment Group LLC, but many say that the move only buys E*Trade two to three years of breathing room. Furthermore, critics conclude the company may be better off seriously considering a breakup and sale of the brokerage division.E*Trade's current handicap comes from the massive debt it inherited from its merger with online bank Telebanc Financial Corp. for $1.8 billion in 2000. The company levered up and took on deeper exposure to what are now toxic mortgages. In April, E*Trade announced a 13% rise in delinquent loans to $2.24 billion.Selling all or part of the company has been considered before by E*Trade, but with its financial picture worsening -- it posted a loss in 2008 and is expected to do the same in 2009 and 2010 -- the need for action is becoming more acute. The sale of its brokerage unit could fetch between $3 billion and $5 billion for paying down debts, according to Reuters. But even those figures may be too optimistic considering that some buyers may take a ""wait and see"" approach on a sale in hopes of buying the brokerage assets out of bankruptcy or in a distressed price.That appears to be the outlook of one analyst. As David Trone of Fox-Pitt Kelton told Reuters, ""We continue to firmly believe that E*Trade will be either bankrupt or sold by the middle of 2010, with the latter now looking more likely."" - Gerald Magpily"
144341,22329,2009-06-21T04:12:37-04:00,,"E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) may end up the only major financial services company to make it through the financial crisis without any help from the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). But that won’t be from a lack of trying.In the company’s latest move to shore up as much cash as possible, E*Trade this past week sold a higher-than-expected 435 million shares, netting the online broker $478.5 million in an offering discounted at 23 percent to Thursday’s closing share price.And that’s only the first part of the capital raising. In the second part, E*Trade is swapping up to $1 billion of new zero-coupon convertible debt for all its senior notes paying 8% interest, and some 12.5% notes. In other words, E*Trade is giving away nearly credit-card sized interest payments in order to stave off the worst case scenario.Hedge fund Citadel, which is E*Trade’s largest outside investor, is expected to participate in the debt exchange to the tune of $800 million.The offering is somewhat of a last resort for the beleaguered broker. Back in November, E*Trade gleefully announced that it would be accepting $800 million from the federal government in TARP payments. But that money failed to materialize when Treasury deemed the company insufficiently illiquid to take on aid. Ever since, E*Trade has been praying and waiting for TARP approval.The problem for E*Trade is that while it looks as if it is in better shape than large banks loaded with toxic assets such as Citigroup (NYSE:C) or Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), it’s not that much better off. There is still a lot of bad debt residing on the balance sheets. Hence the desperate capital raising rounds.Despite the woes, having one of the world’s largest hedge funds behind it has certainly helped. Further, ask around the investing community, and you’ll find a host of speculators who think that E*Trade is the next “five-bagger,” a term used for stocks which have the likely potential to increase by five times or more in value.And arguably, not accepting TARP funds (albeit through not being allowed to) may mean that the broker didn’t suffer the unintended consequences of doing so, such as disincentivizing key employees by introducing ludicrous long-term performance-linked salary structures. In May, E*Trade shareholders voted down a proposal by the company to tie executive bonuses to long-term performance goals.There’s some support for E*Trade’s methods in cobbling together the money it needs, too. The Motley Fool’s Rick Munarriz likes the latest capital-raising structure:At the end of the TARP era, E*Trade may indeed serve as an example for many economists of how banks ought to have been forced to act once they discovered their woes: selling down nonessential assets, paying a premium for liquidity, and squeezing operating costs. And the fact that E*Trade has had to do that where rivals haven’t may ultimately make it more durable and more competitive.E*Trade is not being shown much compassion by the Treasury Department today, but one day, it might silently thank policymakers for the tough love."
143927,22892,2009-06-18T05:36:50-04:00,,"Yesterday was supposed to be a great day for E*Trade's (NASDAQ:ETFC) stock price.Most retail longs were waiting anxiously for the Loan performance data release as promised. It was widely expected that E*Trade will continue to see improvement in loan performance which should once and for all put an end to speculation that E*Trade's loans will destroy the company. And indeed, the loan performance metrics released at 6.49am (link) showed that the delinquencies decreased further which would have meant that provisions would have been reduced in coming quarter and hence we could have seen a relief rally in the stock price today.However, within minutes of excellent loan performance data, at 6.52am to be exact, E*Trade announced that it is giving away a majority of the company to Citadel for approximately $1 to $1.20 per share (link).This is a massive take-under of the company with full co-operation (indeed active assistance) of the current management. The key point here is the timing of the two announcements. Clearly, if the Citadel announcement was done even a few hours after the metrics release - it would have looked VERY embarassing (or suspect), for the CEO to suggest a price of $1 to $1.20 since the stock price could have easily risen from closing price of $1.65 after the loan performance details.Indeed, ever since it has been clear that E*Trade was putting its trouble behind, every attempt has made to push the stock price down so that such a ""take-under"" can be completed. Note that at last quarter's earnings report, earnings were missed by 1 cents to suppress the stock price (which at that point had risen to $2.90s). See my previous article about that release.Subsequently price has been suppresed by continued short-selling.All this was in preparation of the take-under of a great American company - the only company that managed to survive after the same players who shorted Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, WaMu and Wachovia out of existence also attacked E*Trade. Yesterday the final plan was executed - in a terrible haste - because otherwise the $1-$1.20 conversion price on debt-swap would have never been acceptable. By manipulations, they have diluted current E*Trade shareholders 2x to 3x more than what was necessary.Note the extreme haste with which this deal is being consummated and the events that led to this deal. It started with surprisingly good loan performance numbers in March 2009. To avoid the stock from rising up too fast, my belief is that earnings were missed by 1 cent in Q1 by over-provisioning and OTS's requirements were suddenly brought forward with a threat of major dilution. When Schwab indicated that it may be interested in E*Trade, I suspect that take-under plan had to be put in high-gear. The Citadel CEO joined E*Trade's board suddenly probably to make sure nothing goes wrong. The stock price was kept in control with heavy shorting, and then the deal had to be announced within 3 minutes of the loan performance data.My question to E*Trade management is, did OTS require you to do this deal within 3 minutes of loan performance data being released? Or would they have been OK if the deal was done 1 week later or even 1 day later? Do you believe that good loan performance data and metrics would have helped current share-holders more and hence would have garnered us better conversion price on those debt swaps? And if so -- why not wait for 1 day -- or even few hours before the deal? Further - what is the hurry in closing this deal by June 18th (i.e., 1 day after the announcement) as indicated in filings yesterday? It is all geared towards making sure that no-one has a chance to challenge ""the deal"".The saga that started with Citadel approaching E*Trade in the summer of 2007 for something (not realized), Stock Analyst Prashant Bhatia causing a run on the bank in Nov. 2007, which caused $3B in deposits leave the bank, which caused a shot-gun wedding to Citadel - has now come full circle.It is clear that only thing killing E*Trade is the debt it was forced to take on due to a manipulative report by an analyst. E*Trade would have survived its loan portfolio fine (as it is clear now).I am only a small investor writing from my bedroom - I have no power to stop anything. The last few years have taught me that as a retail investor, you are up against an entire system that is working against you (Wall Street professionals, analysts, reporters, politicians, regulators and maybe even the management).I just hope that a large investor steps up to question this deal and that much better alternatives to this deal exist in an open and ""free"" market.Disclosure: Author is long in E*Trade (sadly)."

In a nutshell, the commenter opened an account with E*Trade in August 2007, and wired funds into the brokerage account on the same day.At the same time as the stock market cratered (creating a huge opportunity for gains in short-selling shares), the commenter reports being “slapped with a 12-day restriction” on his funds. At that point, the issue became for him “[a] return OF capital rather than return ON capital.” Numerous other account holders were affected:This commenter is not the only one to report such account restrictions for little or overly-draconian reasons. Over at personal finance blog Interesting Money, another new E*Trade customer by the handle of Mr. B reports in a series of posts his frustrations with E*Trade’s account restrictions. While Mr. B was initially relaxed about the restriction, after more than a week the broker’s lackadaisical service began to wear him down.What’s startling is the number of commenters on Mr. B’s posts who report the same experiences. For example, one writes:Note how in particular, most account holders with these experiences are new customers. In a time when E*Trade desperately needs to increase revenue in order to compensate for its above-average cost of debt, losing enough new customers could really hamper the broker’s ability to get ahead.E*Trade ought to bear in mind too how suspicious in general people are right now of the safety of financial institutions. In the case of another sudden market downturn, if the same events as described here transpired, that could very well create a “run” on E*Trade’s “bank.”In the financial malaise, customer service experiences with financial institutions have gone all but forgotten as banks desperately acted to clean up their balance sheets. But these experiences are a good lesson of the types of “real-world” operations management banks must now embrace to get ahead and stay off government funding."

This price and volume data was collected from yahoo finance website.Volume, Price and short action in ETFC between May 16th and May 29th, 2009What is interesting to note here is during these 9 days, 9.55% of total volume was new short positions in E*Trade. This is a substantial amount of volume which, in normal circumstances, can create quite a serious price decline.Surprisingly, during these 9 trading days, the price of E*Trade declined by only 2 cents (from $1.46 to $1.44). So, in spite of this heavy shorting, shorts only managed to push the price down by only 2 cents. One only has to wonder that in absence of such heavy shorting, E*Trade's stock price would have probably gone up along with the market. And indeed, it would have been a great news for E*Trade shareholders as E*Trade is in the middle of a secondary offering and higher price would have reduced the dilution due to the secondary offering.This indicates that all this shorting was done with the objective of keeping E*Trade price from going up.This further affirms the belief by many unfortunate E*Trade shareholders that E*Trade's stock price continues to be manipulated by wall-street professionals, hedge funds, analysts and even media reporters. Further, government agencies continue to do nothing to protect retail shareholders. Indeed, when the short-selling ban and disclosure requirements went into effect last year, Citadel was the most vocal opponent of that and managed to convince SEC and then Chairman Cox to exclude options market-makers from both short-selling and disclosure requirements.Fortunately, things are really looking up for E*Trade on the operational side. Brokerage growth and revenues remain envy of the rest of the industry and loan performance has turned a corner. Citadel chief Ken Griffin has officially joined E*Trade Board of Directors and one hopes that this would mark and end of stock price manipulation and never-ending shorting and E*Trade can start on the long and arduous road to unmanipulated recovery.Disclosure: Author is long E*Trade Financial."

E*TRADE’s crucial date will be after the market closes on October 27, 2009.In order to fully understand E*TRADE’s performance one must evaluate its earnings history. Table 1 shows E*TRADE’s earnings for the past two years. In my opinion, the second half of 2007 and the full year of 2008 was disastrous. The 3rd quarter of 2007 is when the whole mortgage crises began. Over the quarters, E*TRADE disappointed Wall Street by posting lower than expected earnings. On the flip side, the 2nd quarter of 2009 showed E*TRADE’s earnings above analysts’ estimates by $0.067 or 23.34%. Ever since the 3rd quarter of 2008, earnings have been on a rise from $(0.60) to 2nd quarters $(0.22).Table 1 (Source: www.etrade.com)Many variables have changed in E*TRADE’s history and in order to get an accurate picture you must take in to account the following:Currently, analysts predict estimates per share around $(0.08). Some analysts predict earnings per share as high as $(0.03) and some as low as $(0.20). Personally, I believe E*TRADE will report better than expected with a slight possibility of producing flat to positive earnings. My reasoning for this is because last quarter’s operating income was $(20,443,000) with 666,103 DARTS. Since DARTS will be higher and delinquencies lower, there is a slight possibility that E*TRADE posts earnings in the green.Disclosure: Long ETFC."

The loss was the seventh consecutive money-losing quarter for E*Trade.Now, the Office of Thrift Supervision has told the company to ""quickly"" raise new capital for its bank and cut the debt of its holding company, Reuters reported. Will the company consider putting itself up for sale as an option to survive?This wouldn't be the first time E*Trade would be flirting with going on the auction block. But this time around, its circumstances seem more dire. The economy has reduced the number of potential buyers, and more importantly E*Trade's financial picture hasn't improved. Corporate Dealmaker reported in March 2008 that then-newly elected CEO Donald Layton told The Wall Street Journal that he would certainly entertain a sale if it made sense for the shareholders. Citadel Investment Group LLC eventually rescued E*Trade with a $2.5 billion cash infusion, crushing rumors that TDAmeritrade Holding Corp. (NASDAQ:AMTD), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) or Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC) would swoop in on the online brokerage firm.What does E*Trade have to offer? The company's core brokerage business seems healthy, but its Achilles heel is its mortgage business, where delinquent loans totaled $2.24 billion, up 13% from the previous quarter.Overall, the future for E*Trade looks bleak. E*Trade Bank's Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of capital strength, was 5.63% at quarter's end, down from 6.29% in the previous period. A well capitalized firm needs at least 6%. Meanwhile, it's stock has languished, dropping as low as 59 cents a share in the last year (shares have since rebounded).Besides selling itself, the company could still raise capital if Uncle Sam gives a green-light on its application for $800 million in relief under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. However, the application was made back in November. But if that doesn't happen, E*Trade may try to dive into the onerous task of either tapping into the debt markets or even issuing more stock to stay afloat. E*Trade's escape scenarios seem precarious at best, but that's what happens when a billion-dollar deal based on a speculative bubble blows up. -Gerald Magpily"

Plus, ""Asset flows continued to be positive, as the Company realized $300 million in net new customer assets during April, marking the seventh consecutive month of positive inflows."" (quoted from linked article).ETFC's brokerage business is obviously healthy, which is an encouraging sign considering the overall company's murkier picture. ETFC recently announced that it would sell $150 million in common stock, boosting capital reserves to meet regulatory requests. The shares would be sold ""from time to time at market prices"" by JP Morgan. As I wrote in March, ETFC shareholders will have to wait and see if the thriving brokerage business can endure and outlast losses from the asset-holding component of the business. The capital raise and continued healthy customer statistics are promising, though the battle is likely far from over.I have accumulated some more shares of ETFC over the past few weeks after shares fell nearly $1 from the recent highs near $2.50.

133834,22892,2009-04-29T15:04:28-04:00,,"E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) financial reported results on 4/28/2009 after the market close.However, something is really strange at E*Trade. By all means, E*Trade had spectacularly good numbers to report -- you heard it right -- the numbers were spectacularly good and indicated that E*Trade had clearly turned a major corner.Yet, the spectacular numbers were presented with a major negative twist that led to a huge negative move in stock price and media headlines.To understand these contradictions, first let us look at the numbers. It is important to compare Q1 numbers against Q4 numbers to see the tremendous progress E*Trade has made. Q4 numbers can be accessed here.Let us first look at loan performance.Loan PerformanceAs seen above, new delinquencies are much less than the prior quarter. And indeed, in their HELOC, which is the most risky portfolio, the delinquencies have DECREASED.Now let us look at income.Q1 2009 Revenue Comparison Vs. Q4 2008Once again -- each segment income increased; which is spectacular given a difficult interest rate and trading environment where other OLBs have seen decreased revenues.Even E*Trade's expenses looked good.Q1 2009 Expenses Vs. Q4 2008So, so far, all numbers are spectacular and show a company that has turned a corner and performing much better on all fronts.Until we consider the ""New Provisions"".New Provisions comparisonMy thesis here is that provisions on 1-4 Family are excessive given the trend in delinquencies and given prior provisioning ratios on this portfolio. Let me explain why.On December 31, 2008, 1-4 Family new provision was $185M. Total 1-4 Family delinquent loans at that time were $1187M. Which is a ratio of 15.58% -- which is quite reasonable given that these are 1st lien loans with good recovery ratios.For Q1 2009, E*Trade took a $67M charge-off on 1-4 family portfolio and new delinquencies were at $282M. Against this, E*Trade took $190M in new provisions. This is a ratio of 54.44% of new delinquencies + charge-offs against the provisions. The same ratio was 30.7% in Q4 2008. New provisions on 1-4 Family loans could have been $10M to $50M lower and still be considered conservative.In general, excessive provisions are a good thing, but if that is coming at the cost of substantial shareholder dilution, it is not a good thing.The reason I say this over-provision is coming at a substantial dilution is as follows:Clearly, missing the target by one cent by over-provisioning, followed by announcing that we need to do an equity offering at substantial dilution to current shareholders is sure to result in the share price dropping. If the equity offering is not concluded already, this is like offering potential new shareholders of E*Trade even a larger stake in company at the cost of current shareholders due to reduced share prices.In addition, in the conference call, management stated that they have chosen NOT to take advantage of new mark to market rule revisions. The question then becomes, ""Shouldn't ALL other measures of balance-sheet improvement be exhausted BEFORE leading down the path of shareholders dilution?""What is truly concerning is the timing of this announcement, which seems to be when E*Trade is close to its lowest price and its business is thriving and its loan portfolio is turning a corner for better days.As a long-term E*Trade customer and a shareholder, I am sincerely hoping that:After doing a commendable job as E*Trade CEO, I hope Mr. Don Layton and Partner Citadel (Citadel was referred to as partner in the conference call yesterday) continue to look after the interests of other shareholders of this great company.By the way, kudos on Mobile E*Trade Pro for iPhone.Disclosure: Long E*Trade Financial."
125873,21263,2009-03-13T07:20:06-04:00,,"E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) shares have suffered one of the greatest declines of all (non-bankrupt) financial service companies - a whopping 97% from pre-meltdown levels. (From the start of 2006 through the first half of 2007, ETFC was a $20+ stock.)The verdict remains out on ETFC. Obviously the possibility (or probability?) of bankruptcy is priced in, as shares changed hands at $.66 on Thursday. However, the core brokerage business remains strong... if only management had had the foresight to have avoided banking and investments over the past five years.Shares slumped Thursday amid the strong rally after a Citi analyst slapped a ""sell"" on the stock in the morning. The Citi analyst provided a price target of $.25/share. However, along with that bleak statement, he pointed out:There are about 500 million ETFC shares outstanding, so theoretically, the brokerage-only component would be making $1/share per year and trade at $10-$20. However, the institutional component, which focused on investing in mortage securities, threatens the viability of the company. ETFC hasn't reported a profit since 2007 as mark-to-market writedowns of assets have forced ETFC to take losses. However, management has proactively dealt with the losses and associated need for increased capital; they sold E*Trade Canada for over $500 million (after taxes) and sold a portion of their asset portfolio to private buyers. They now seem well capitalized, and a recent stress test confirmed that conclusion. (Read the article here.) The analyst concludes that while ETFC would need more capital in a (harsher than realistic) immediate full-writedown scenario, it would be able to maintain a Tier-1 capital ratio if the writeoffs happen over a few quarters.The wild card that could still significantly change things is ETFC's still-outstanding request for TARP funds. ETFC requested $800 million, which would cover all losses even in the aforementioned analyst's doomsday scenario. The bottom line is that ETFC will do one of two things - go bankrupt, or go way, way up. When it comes to the financial services sector, the most important thing now is survival. For the past year (or more), companies have written down assets repeatedly thanks to mark-to-market accounting. Assets have to be written down to prices they'd fetch on the open market, while in reality, many instruments have intrinsic value (based on interest payouts, etc.) above their current marked values. Eventually, these assets will be written up. Some firms will fail or be bought out before they have the opportunity to do this; others, whether due to good management or the government's good graces, will survive until the day they report a gain on their held assets. Even ignoring any writing-up of ETFC's assets, if they can survive to the day that their non-brokerage business no longer impairs their results, the shares will skyrocket - eventually back to double-digit (dollars, not cents) territory. (Note: Seemingly ridiculous claim is based on $1/share brokerage-component earnings). However, current market pricing indicates that most investors don't think that will happen.I find buying ETFC a bet worth making - The slim possibility of a 10- or 20-bagger makes the probability of bankruptcy worth betting against. I currently hold some shares, but I'm planning to add to my position if shares stay at current levels. ETFC shares are not for everyone, and I'd almost classify going long as closer to gambling than true Buffett-like investing... but I'm young and I like taking risks. I'm hoping that management can continue to bail water out of this sinking dinghy until the storm clouds have cleared.Disclosure: long ETFC."
137090,21733,2009-05-12T03:21:23-04:00,,"Most financial stocks have experienced nice spikes from their lows and no longer offer the opportunity for investors to make easy money. In this case, easy money is defined as the profit that comes when failure is taken off the table. The easy money in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) took the stock from $2.50 up to $11. The easy money in Citigroup (NYSE:C) took the stock from $1 to $4. Investing in E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) right now is all about one thing and one thing only; bankruptcy. If they avoid bankruptcy, the stock will at least double over the next year. Many are fearful of dilution, but at the current price of $1.75, a capital raising would eliminate the threat of bankruptcy and the stock would go up on the dilution news. Just as we saw with Citigroup. Evidence of this phenomenon was observed last Friday when E*Trade filed for a $150 million stock offering and the share price actually rose by 16%.The current assumption is that E*Trade has to triple their current float in order to comply with the regulatory requirements coming from the Office of Thrift Supervision. Investors were scared out of the stock immediately after the Q1 earnings conference call because the word ‘quickly’ was used in reference to the pending capital raise. Nobody wants to hear the word ‘quickly’ when you’re talking about an estimated $400 to $450 million in new capital along with $1.7 billion in debt for a total of $2.1 billion in new financing according to FBR analyst research.The interesting story with E*Trade is that the government has not given them any TARP funds. These funds would provide E*Trade with a period of forbearance to either raise private capital, convert the funds to common stock, sell off assets, or earn their way out. No TARP equals no time; hence the unpleasant word ‘quickly’ comes into play.The most perplexing part of this whole thing is that over 500 banks have received TARP funds and most want to repay it immediately; you’d think there is a surplus available for a company like E*Trade who has almost 5 million brokerage accounts. Because of this strange subjective governmental behavior, the general assumption regarding E*Trade is that they won’t be given the time or the money to survive.I think E*Trade will survive and am buying shares on this thesis. The core of the company is just too strong. Trading activity in Q1 was up 8% year over year with an increase of 63,000 net new brokerage accounts with $3.5 billion in new customer assets. On the mortgage side of the company, special mention delinquencies are down 25% since 2008 which should result in reduced charge offs in the second half of the year after more are expected in Q2.An important part of E*Trade’s strategy is what Layton referred to as a “very active loan modification program that was implemented this quarter...the modifications impacted our financial statements...(giving us) very limited exposure to future write downs.”I agree that the future is brighter than the past for E*Trade. The hardest part is over; they are still standing after the crisis. Corporate cash is at $406 million and bank excess risk capital is at $451 million. Without the loan loss provision from the quarter, E*Trade would have earned $221 million. If they had marked to market in accordance with FAS 159 they would have generated additional income of $500 million. The brand is strong. The baby commercials have been a marketing hit and more importantly, they are driving new customers to the platform.Again, the most important question is whether or not E*Trade will have to file for bankruptcy. I see four probable alternatives that could help them to survive:It seems that last week's filing for a $150 million stock offering will giveE*Trade some time as they seek out the best strategy going forward. The key point being, there will be a strategy going forward and this company does have alternatives to bankruptcy. The fact that they have continued to grow their retail brokerage business in the midst of the financial crisis is a clear signal to me that the core of this company is worth investing in at these distressed levels.Economic conditions appear to be improving which makes this an opportune time to put some distressed capital to work in a company like E*Trade, which offers high risk but high reward.Disclosure: Author holds a long position in ETFC"

More upside is likely as investors are betting on two positive numbers to emerge this week :1) Brokerage numbers for May and2) Mortgage Loan performance numbers, which have been stabilizing.Investors have seen ETFC's cash position grow over the past few quarters while its debt is decreasing along with reduced delinquency rates in its higher risk home equity loans.Together, these two releases could very well propel the stock price. In addition to these numbers, investors anxiously await news regarding Citadel's talks with ETFC. ETFC largest shareholder Citadel Investment Corp invested $1.75 billion in ETFC for a 20% equity stake back in November, 2007. Citadel is more than likely to be positioning itself to invest more capital in ETFC. The appointment of Kenneth Griffin, Citadel's co-founder, to the board of ETFC is a very positive sign as Citadel knows ETFC's brokerage business is healthy and looks like Citadel believes ETFC is a good bet.A possible vehicle for such an investment would be the Public Private Investment Plan (PPIP), which would allow Citadel to leverage its investment with a 7 to 1 ratio of insured funds made available through the PPIP legislation. The chart technicals are now very bullish with not much upside resistance until the $2.52 area and then the $2.90 level which was last tested on the 17th of April this year.Disclosure: Long ETFC and buying more."

The article may (or may not, depending on if it's subscription-based) be seen here. Not only did trading volume stay steady, but more importantly, loan delinquencies among its portfolio are on the DECLINE.That is obviously wonderful news for ETFC. They have already provided loss provisions far beyond realized losses, so if things are bottoming (or improving) now, they might not have to increase provisions anymore, allowing them to return to profitability. This may sound a little crazy, but maybe write-ups are hiding in the not-too-distant future."
91744,20174,2008-08-20T05:56:46-04:00,,"E-Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) has had its share of problems. A few years back, E-Trade was the biggest competitor to TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) and the stock traded together with the brokerage stocks. Yet, since the mortgage headlines began to hit the wires last year, the stock has dropped from $23 to $3 today. In fact, the stock hit $2.25 back in January of this year. In other words, the stock has been hit like it were a Countrywide.What the market might have overlooked is that ETFC's primary line of business has been its trading business. In fact, the number of net new retail accounts in July totaled 19,583. Total number of accounts is now at over 4.4 million. Total retail customer assets are at $162 billion at the end of July.Having said that, the company did report a net loss of $94.6 million, or 19 cents per share, due to loan delinquencies. That compares with a profit of $159.1 million, or 37 cents per share a year earlier.Make no mistake, TD Ameritrade is a better run company, with good earnings, no mortgage or credit risk, and a lower amount of debt. But that is exactly the reason E-Trade is a more compelling stock. It has managed its business horribly by moving away from its core business of online trading and involving itself in mortgages and has been slow to react to the situation it has found itself in. With all the wrong moves, there is hardly anything else that it can do wrong.In terms of what E-Trade is doing to turn itself around - it is setting aside $100 million for mortgage losses, hax reduced the available credit lines on existing home equity lines of credit, shedding its investment in Fannie and Freddie, and focusing on growth in the online trading business.The company has some ways to go before the turn-around is complete. Meanwhile, the stock carries plenty of headline risk. However, I believe that among the financials, it carries one of the highest risk-reward. If you take out its mortgage-based business (losses), the stock deserves a higher price and patient investors will be rewarded sooner or later. Full Disclosure: I own ETFC but my position can change anytime without notice."
83141,20503,2008-06-29T11:37:59-04:00,,"Everyone’s favorite investor in diapers is back as the E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) Baby makes a new appearance promoting Mobile E*Trade Pro. By now I’m sure most of us have seen those popular E*TRADE Baby advertisements either on television or online. There are now three ads with the mobile variation joining the E*Trade Banking Baby and E*Trade Trading Baby. The previous versions have both gained over a million views on YouTube since the first release during this year’s Super Bowl.While airing a Super Bowl advertisement likely increases awareness for each advertiser, there is the inevitable debate over whether Super Bowl ads really pay off in terms of actual revenue. In the case of E*Trade, the question is whether the company managed to attract new customers post-airing of the Baby ads.We first looked into how E*Trade has performed in terms of site traffic to its home page since launching the Super Bowl ad. Although the advertisements received great reviews, the campaigns did not result in increased traffic to etrade.com. Below we see that in February and March of 2008, visitors to E*Trade actually decreased 10% compared to February 2008. What makes this decline even more interesting is the fact that in January traffic increased 4% over the previous month. The subsequent decline continued into April by a modest 3%.While on the surface it may look as if the ad campaign was not effective for E*Trade, one has to look deeper to see the real story. The idea of quality over quantity comes into play here. While monthly site traffic to etrade.com decreased after the E*Trade Baby made his first appearance, the quality of the traffic increased greatly. Below is a measure of velocity at etrade.com using the Super Bowl (February 3, 2008) as the starting point. Velocity measures the attention (or time spent on a site) and how it changes compared to one point in time. For example, during the first few days after the Super Bowl, attention increased nearly 200% at etrade.com. This shows that even though fewer people were going to etrade.com, those that did visit were spending more time engaging with the site than people that visited prior to the big game.In the modern era all too often we see trendy Super Bowl ads that might be a hit with the public, but do not generate results on the bottom line. If someone were to look just at the traffic for E*Trade they might think this is another example of such a flop. By looking at the bigger picture however, it is apparent that the campaign was successful when it came to getting people more engaged with the brand which is a win in my book. E*Trade certainly seems happy with the results since they are willing to invest more in having this wise cracking infant be their public face."
79303,21708,2008-05-29T06:25:39-04:00,,"On November 29, 2007 Citadel invested $2.5 billion of cash into E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC). Citadel had been “scrutinizing E*Trade’s balance sheet” since July 2007, when E*Trade first reported its mortgage market problems in a conference call. “So Citadel understood better than most—even E*Trade management—not only how serious its problems were but also the real value of E*Trade’s business” (source).With this transaction, Citadel also became E*Trade’s largest shareholder with 20% of E*Trade’s stock. At this time Citadel owns 89.53 million shares; and holds $1.75 billion of 10-year bonds at 12.5% interest. As E*Trade’s biggest shareholder and debtor, Citadel influenced the appointment of Donald Layton as CEO on March 3, 2008. Layton had worked for 29 years at JP Morgan Chase, but was at that time living leisurely as a retired banker and serving on E*Trades board of directors. Pulling E*Trade out of this mortgage mess was not the way Layton planned to spend his retirement years. Why did Layton come out of retirement and accept the position of CEO? When asked, Layton stated, “The board ask me if I would do it... I didn’t get to where I am without having a competitive side” (source).Mr. Layton’s commitment to E*Trade Stock and to Shareholders is demonstrated by the fact that all of his 2008 and 2009 incentive compensation is in the form of equity... “nearly 90 percent of his total compensation will be composed of restricted stock and stock options, with no cash bonus” (source).In just three months, Layton’s team has demonstrated commitment to E*Trade’s shareholders value through frugal cost cutting, non-core asset liquidation to increase cash, and creative and aggressive advertising to strengthen their brokerage activity. Layton’s competitive nature has moved E*Trade rapidly forward in its “turn around” plan as proven by the recently announced 10% cost cut, liquidation of India stake for $145 million and other monetization of non-core assets, and brokerage metrics for April that showed the best DART in the brokerage industry.But the Mortgage Portfolio continues to hamper E*Trade’s Brokerage Image and analyst ratings. Maybe the trigger is about to be pulled to remove this problem from E*Trade.This week, on May 27, 2008, it was announced that Senior JP Morgan executive Bill King would be joining Citadel (source). Since Layton came from JP Morgan, this move of talent into the Citadel/E*Trade circle makes sense. Mr. King was co-head of global securitized products at JP Morgan. At Citadel, King will be “head of securitized products—a newly created position—with responsibilities for mortgage securities, asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations and related products.”Citadel now has “a newly created position” and a specific department for handling complicated mortgage instruments; so Citadel and E*Trade will most likely “prudently manage the risk” of E*Trade’s Mortgage Portfolio by transferring it to Citadel’s Specialized Department. This is best for effectively managing the mortgage instruments, and is best for the future success of E*Trade to function as a global brokerage service. With 20% ownership, E*Trade’s success will mean millions of dollars of increased value for Citadel’s 89.53 million shares. Increased stock value will also mean that Mr. Layton will get appropriately compensated for his unprecedented efforts to help E*Trade turn around. Since both Mr. Layton and Citadel will gain tremendous and well-deserved benefits from this arrangement, Citadel may very well quickly pull the trigger on this one.But wait a minute … what about the other 22% of E*Trade’s Shareholders? The “111.4 million short side” shareholders that own 22 percent of E*Trade’s outstanding shares? With all of Layton’s “turn around,” and Citadel support, why does such a large “short position” exist? Here are three prevalent theories:Theory #1: The market is going to drop, and all stocks will drop as the market goes down. Rebuttal: Even if the market adjusts downward, a stock price that has been “beaten down” will recover quickly. Price drop will be small, volume will be low, and low price will not be sustainable.Theory #2: Short interest of 80 to 111 million shares has existed since December 2007 (source). Hedge funds have identified mortgage stocks as great “short position” stocks and have heavily shorted E*Trade because “everyone is doing it” after all it is a “mortgage stock.” Rebuttal: This is an example of Wall Street firms “not dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s when it comes to risk management” as was discussed by Kenneth Griffin (Citadel Investment Group founder) in the recent New York Times article entitled “A Wish List for Fixing Wall Street.” Firms that are blindly shorting without doing homework on business fundamentals will suffer the most from large short positions when a “short squeeze” occurs (source).Theory #3: Mr. Layton will dilute shareholders by issuing a large number of shares for cash since a large block of shares were authorized (600 million) in the Annual Shareholder Meeting on May 16, 2008. Rebuttal: This type of dilutive stock issuance is highly unlikely for the following reasons: a) cash has been obtained by liquidating non-core assets, and b) impact on stock price would negatively affect Mr. Layton’s compensation, but more importantly would affect Citadel’s Equity Value.The bottom line is that E*Trade and Citadel are operated by experienced and competitive executives. Donald Layton and Kenneth Griffin are men who have proven success records and great respect in the financial sector. In due time, they will make E*Trade a respected success.Disclosure: Long ETFC"
80821,21708,2008-06-11T02:13:37-04:00,,"Since Citadel’s cash infusion in late November 2007, E*Trade’s (NASDAQ:ETFC) share price has been range-bound: dropping as low as $2.08, rising as high as $5.48, and sitting at around $4 for the past two months. Illogically, this current $4 range was the exact low price range in November 2007 when no one was sure whether E*Trade would survive bankruptcy. In November 2007 E*Trades bankruptcy price per share ranged from $4 to $6. In 2008 the highest price has been just above $5 for a handful of days in February.Additionally, short interest positions continued to increase last month. Perhaps this is just a product of hedge funds playing games with the share price in a tight range or perhaps not. How long will it take to chase the 111 million shorts out of this stock? Especially when average daily volume is only 15 million shares.The main rationale for shorting E*Trade is the mortgage portfolio. The problem with this rationale is that E*Trade’s mortgage problems were fully disclosed on the table and the impact was inflicted in full back in November 2007—and E*Trade survived. After Citadel’s investment, a turnaround plan was established and many milestone markers of successful execution have been reported, especially in the last two months. The April quarterly report soundly established that bankruptcy was no longer a problem, April metrics were better than the industry averages, and as of May the loan portfolio was performing according to management expectations. Subsequent marketing strategies, innovative brokerage tools (BlackBerry), improved brokerage metrics, and stabilizing balance sheet transactions make the current “bankruptcy pricing $4 range” completely unfounded. Other lenders like Lehman (LEH), Merrill Lynch (MER), UBS AG (NYSE:UBS) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) have just started to reveal their problems, are questioned regarding whether they are revealing the true extent of their problems, and are still figuring out what they are going to do to survive. Along with LEH and MER, Cramer included JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Countrywide Financial (CFC), Wachovia Corp (NASDAQ:WB), and Washington Mutual (NYSE:WM) Monday morning in “Cramer on BloggingStocks: Questions swirl around Lehman’s capital raise.” Cramer points out the lack of transparency about what’s in their portfolios and the “soft denials,” about how bad it is. Notably, E*Trade was not listed nor included in Cramer’s discussion. E*Trade’s true position among them is more of a “First One In, First One Out” and moving on down the road. However, the market still perceives it to be related to the “bad news” banks; but E*Trade has been in a full disclosure position since the 4th quarter of 2007. The question is not if E*Trade will make a profit, it is a matter of “when,” and according to the words and actions of CEO Donald Layton it will happen soon.This begs the question, exactly when does a share price return to even a third ($6 to $8) of what was considered normal ($18 to $24 pre-July 2007)? When does a share price fully return to normal (a gain of 400 to 600 percent)? Book value/cash on hand is around $6.50/share.Let’s review in more detail what E*Trade has done these last seven months:Stable Customer Base and Customer Cash Levels E*Trade’s customer base is secure and is now growing again. E*Trade’s customer cash stabilized in December - after Citadel’s investment - at approximately $33B (see Q4 conference call transcript). After the first quarter, E*Trade’s customer cash equaled $35B – this level is far ahead of the company’s own projections for 2008 (see Q1 conference call transcript). To put this in context, before Prashant Bhatia’s November 12th article and the ensuing run on E*Trade’s bank, customer cash equaled $39B. E*Trade is well on its way to getting back to this level of cash deposits. E*Trade added 60,000 new customers in the first quarter of 2008 (see Q1 conference call transcript), which is the highest level of new customers since the 4th quarter of 2005. These business trends show that E*Trade’s brokerage business remains steady and strong. As Jim Cramer recently stated – the brokerage is “fantastic.” In summary, E*Trade’s customers base, in spite of a major bank run, is stable and growing. E*Trade’s competitors will no longer siphon customers from E*Trade that are worried about E*Trade’s mortgage issues. In fact, E*Trade is actually gaining customers at the expense of their competitors . This cannot be stressed enough. Everyone saw what happened with BSC – it was at the mercy of hedge funds that could withdraw $17B in cash a day, and did. That destroyed BSC. In contrast, E*Trade’s customers are comprised of millions of individuals, those who remained after November 2007 have remained strong with, and loyal to, the upstart brokerage; and many who left have obviously been returning . Customer cash levels show that E*Trade’s customers continue to believe in and trust E*Trade. Adding to customer confidence are the high levels of insurance E*Trade maintains for accounts, including $100K of coverage for the FDIC and $500K of coverage from SIPC. Aggressive and Superior Technology Trading Platform LeadershipLast week’s announcement of “E*Trade Mobile Pro” for BlackBerry is indicative of the market technology aggressiveness and leadership position E*Trade is establishing among brokerages. E*Trade is the first brokerage to offer this mobile platform and like recent PowerTrading upgrades and service enhancements, it is absolutely FREE. Technological aggressiveness and “early entry” into new brokerage services E*Trade will secure a dominant market share position in both the USA and in “world” brokerage markets. According to E*Trade, an “iPhone trading, ” “Palm trading,,” and Windows Mobile trading” platform is in line right behind the BlackBerry mobile platform. E*Trade’s superior and stable trading platform is a strong factor for customer retention and growth. For example, several times over the last few months and as recently as last week, TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) customers have experienced slow order execution, quote tracker problems, and slow or dropped streaming during critical trading times; resulting in extensive customer complaints. Problems at TD Ameritrade could very well be contributing to E*Trade’s success as customers that left E*Trade now return because of dissatisfaction with Ameritrade’s stability and platform.E*Trade’s continual “free upgrades and enhancements” to their powerful system tools, their “problem-free, high-powered” platform, with the opportunity to trade in 6 global markets, and sophisticated option trading tools provide for maximum customer satisfaction and new customer attraction. The E*Trade services are more global and comprehensive than TD Ameritrade (AMTD) or Schwab (NYSE:SCHW).Secure Capital Levels and Excess Cash ReservesE*Trade’s capital levels are stronger than most major banks. In addition to the “loss reserves” that E*Trade intends to set aside for its HELOC portfolio, E*Trade also intends to set its cash reserve level in excess of well-capitalized standards at $1B. At the end of the first quarter, E*Trade had about $700M of excess cash and a risk-based capital ratio of 12.4%. To put it in context, J.P. Mogan has a 12.4% capital ratio and WFC has a risk-based capital ratio in the range of 11%. E*Trade’s goal is to have a risk-based capital ratio at 13% by year-end 2008. Based on E*Trade having exited the mortgage business, wholesale and origination, with associated loan run offs, the addition of $300M more excess cash to the balance sheet, and the trend of increasing customer cash, E*Trade will almost certainly smash through its goal of a 13% risk-based capital ratio.Where is E*Trade getting all this cash? Let’s review. Non-core Asset Sales. E*Trade estimates that it will have at least $500M of cash coming from non-core asset sales (E*Trade already received approximately $150M from the sale of its Indian assets. That’s right, no share dilution for $500M needed. So, if $300M from these asset sales is used to reach E*Trade’s excess cash goal of $1B, which is all that is required, that means E*Trade will then have $200M of free cash to do whatever it wants with.Expense Reductions. On its 4th quarter conference call, E*Trade announced a $360M expense reduction and an additional $50M compensation cost reduction for a total of $410M of cost cutting. Subtracting $80M they stated would be dedicated to increased advertising, E*Trade will have net another $330M of excess cash from cost cutting initiatives. Summary. Let’s do a rough, back of the envelope calculation here. Due to all of the above-mentioned measures, E*Trade will likely have approximately $530M of excess cash to beneficially apply where appropriate by the end of this year. Strikingly important is that this will be accomplished with no additional share dilution and is in addition to the approximately $500M of excess cash E*Trade has at the brokerage (from E*Trade’s 10k) and the $1B of excess cash E*Trade will have at the bank. That’s a lot of cash on-hand. Improved Debt to Equity PositionE*Trade’s improvement in its debt to equity position is ahead of the 2008 recovery plan. The parent company of E*Trade has a lot of debt and Mr. Layton has already embarked on a plan to clean this up. He has planned $700M of debt for equity swaps. Now this does result in additional shares, but overall is very beneficial to current shareholders as it rids E*Trade of the onerous debt on its balance sheet.Mr. Layton has already accomplished approximately $184M of these debt for equity swaps, and still has a planned $450M at $18 per share for November 2008. Layton has only $66M of debt for equity swaps left to do/account for. As a lifelong banker with JPM, Mr. Layton’s dedication to cleaning up the balance sheet will greatly benefit E*Trade’s shareholders. Positive Effects of Citadel’s InvestmentFirst of all, the Citadel investment stabilized E*Trade at a critical juncture in time. Citadel did involve share dilution and E*Trade shouldering debt at a fairly high interest rate. But compared with the dilution that major financial institutions have had to deal with recently, E*Trade appears to have gotten an o.k. deal (for example, BSC, WM, NCC, and TMA). Indeed, on the November 29, 2007 conference call, E*Trade’s own accountants stated that the anticipated dilution would amount to something approximating 50 cents per share. In any event, the Citadel deal was necessary and accomplished the purpose of stabilizing E*Trade’s business.Also of interest is the fact that Citadel has continued to purchase E*Trade’s senior debt. From a recent SEC shelf filing, after the debt for equity swaps are considered, Citadel now holds about 75-80% of E*Trade’s outstanding senior debt. Even more interesting from the shelf filing, all of this debt and shares held by Citadel and Blackrock it appears can be sold to any party, even an E*Trade competitor. Moreover, the shelf filing reveals that all of these senior notes are not secured by the assets of the subsidiaries until 2011. This is important because the parent company of E*Trade does not have any real substantial assets to speak of; all of the business is conducted through the subsidiaries. Thus, if Citadel were really concerned that E*Trade could be in trouble, it would not make much sense to continue to accumulate E*Trade’s debt when said debt is not secured by any real assets.And another point according to the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Nicoll formerly of Instinet, LLC, was Citadel’s top choice for the CEO position, but declined to take the position when he found out E*Trade couldn’t be taken private. Thus, any nefarious conspiracy theories that Citadel is going to take E*Trade private for a dirt-cheap price doesn’t really make sense. In addition any such deal would be subject to incredible scrutiny not just by shareholders, but by the OTS since E*Trade is a federally regulated bank. Finally, the fact that a very powerful hedge fund has a vested interest in E*Trade’s success should be considered a good thing..Mortgage Portfolio Activity, Loss Provisions, and CompositionFinally, let’s talk mortgages. E*Trade has four categories of mortgages:Consumer loan delinquencies actually decreased from the 4th quarter 2007 to the 1st quarter 2008. Similarly, the “mortgage-backed securities” portfolio has shown stable performance. All but $1.1B of that portfolio is backed by FNM and FRE. And the $1.1B that is not backed by FNM and FRE is AAA or AA rated and has been appropriately written down assuming that the U.S. has entered a mild recession. In other words, this portfolio is a non-issue (see Q1 conference call transcript).The first-lien portfolio is performing worse than expected but this really has no effect on E*Trade’s capital position. E*Trade’s average position in these properties is about 70% LTV. Moreover, E*Trade has insurance on any property over 80% LTV and approximately $4B of this portfolio is covered by a credit default swap. In other words, while the first-lien portfolio may be a drag on earnings, it is not going to hurt E*Trade’s capital position due to E*Trade’s position in these properties.Finally let’s turn to the HELOC portfolio. To date, E*Trade has already charged off about $300M in losses on this portfolio, and has approximately $500M of reserves set aside for future charge offs--which E*Trade estimates will cover the next four quarters of chargeoffs. Even assuming a U.S. recession, E*Trade has affirmed its estimates of cumulative losses relating to this portfolio to be around $1B to $1.5B over a three year period—this total loss exposure was arrived at with third-party consultants. E*Trade affirmed this range on the 1st quarter conference call and again at the shareholders’ meeting in May.At the low end of $1B, E*Trade would have to provision for $200M more of losses. At the high end of $1.5B, E*Trade would have to provision for $700M more of losses. E*Trade stopped acquiring mortgage loans in early 2007, especially the high LTV% home equity loans. Thus, the mortgages that should never have been written and were destined to go bad, most likely have already gone bad. This would explain why new delinquencies actually DECREASED in the 1st quarter of 2008, a statistic so surprising that one analyst on the call inquired on this very fact since this is the exact opposite of what analysts are seeing in other financials. It is important to note that all of E*Trade’s loan reserves and performance projections are on the conservative side and assume a U.S. recession. Evaluating the current composition of E*Trade’s home equity portfolio shows additional positives. Of the approximate $11.5B loan portfolio, E*Trade has the second lien position for only $1.5B. The greatest danger is if the lender’s loan is in second position. This means that E*Trade has about $10B worth of pure home equity loans in its portfolio. Assuming a $1.5B total loss figure means that E*Trade is prepared to write off 15% of these pure home equity loans. Succinctly put, even assuming that the mortgage/housing market continues to deteriorate, E*Trade has been super-conservative in preparing for such an event and a recession is already priced in to the assumptions E*Trade has envisioned. Therefore, although one should always be aware of the current state of the market, E*Trade can handle the current housing market, and should have no problems handling a further deterioration as well.In conclusion, the mortgage performance reports from management in April and May establish that E*Trade’s home equity loans are showing stable and even improving results, while other lenders’--like Lehman (LEH) this week--will continue to struggle with home equity loans for some time to come. Insider Stock Purchasing and Management CompensationInsider stock purchasing in 2008 is very encouraging. Mr. Layton spent $1M of his own cash to purchase E*Trade shares at $4.07 and the entire Board of Directors recently purchased a substantial number of shares on January 29. Moreover, Mr. Layton has options for 235K shares in November of this year that are worthless unless E*Trade’s share price is above $5.26. That, plus the additions of Mr. Druskin and Mr. Kanner to the Board brings substantial experience, credibility, and know-how to the Board. Interestingly, Mr. Kanner purchased 50K shares or April 22, and just over a week ago purchased an additional 25K on May 30 at $4.03 making a total of $387K of personal funds invested in E*Trade stock. When Mr. Layton accepted the CEO position, his entire CEO compensation package was comprised solely of stock options. That’s correct, he doesn’t receive any cash for acting as CEO of E*Trade. The only cash payment he receives is from his duties as Chairman of the Board and that was fixed in late 2007. Clearly, Mr. Layton sees E*Trade stock as a good investment and has personal motivation for management decisions that will continue to increase shareholder value and be non-dilutive. His statements have stressed again and again that management actions will be shareholder friendly, and that E*Trade will only access capital markets on an opportunistic basis and in a shareholder friendly manner (see Q1 conference call transcript). But with all of the above discussion, it is obvious that E*Trade has no pressing need to raise more capital.Disclosure: Author has a long position in ETFCAuthor's note: I have been criticized for writing research on E*Trade while holding a long position. I respectfully submit that if I have spent the time to extensively research a stock, and then spent extended additional time to write up the research and share it with other investors, then I would be crazy not to hold a long position in the stock."
81062,21708,2008-06-12T07:13:14-04:00,,"Yesterday afternoon S&P Marketscope posted the following:This is the first upgrade that E*Trade has had since February 2007 (see Yahoo Finance), and comes at a time when many other financial institutions have revealed that they have not “been straightforward in their disclosures,” and are scrambling and “figuring out what they are going to do to survive.” Market reaction to these company’s disappointing announcements has been severe and unjustly penalizing across the broad financial sector, including E*Trade.The reputation that the S&P has for independence, objectivity, and overall conservative positioning in their analyses makes this upgrade and viewpoint more significant than other potentially biased opinions. The S&P’s conservative stance can be seen in their prior April 22, 2008 12-month Target Price of $3.50 (when the general market has already been trending to a price of around $4), and their current 12-month Target Price of only $4.00.The S&P conservative pricing is of course related to their concern with the future performance of E*Trade’s mortgage portfolio. Updated performance details in April (1st Quarter Conference Call) and May (Annual Shareholder’s Meeting) indicated acceptable and favorable performance within ranges previously estimated by management. In other words, what management had provisioned and booked as losses as of the 4th Quarter in January 2008 needed no additional adjustment as of April and May. Very significant results given the types of large negative adjustments other mortgage institutions are incurring. New updates on E*Trade’s mortgage portfolio performance will be a major point of interest during next month’s July 25th, 2nd Quarter Conference Call.I had no idea when I submitted my article “E*Trade’s ‘First In, First Out’ Position: Yes, 111M Shorts Can be Wrong” on Tuesday morning that the S&P would also come out with a Wednesday upgrade statement that has many similarities to my article. Obviously I find those similarities quite gratifying. I do need to make one correction to the information contained in my article regarding the 111M of short interest. After the market close on Tuesday, June 10, the Short Interest Position as of the end of May was reported at NASDAQTrader.com (enter symbol ETFC). Interestingly, E*Trade’s Short Interest has decrease from 111.4 million on May 15 to 105.8 million as of May 30. However, because of lower trading volume, “Days to Cover” has increased from 5.11 days to 6.78 days.E*Trade caught my eye back in April just prior to its 1st Quarter earnings report. It has been a very rewarding investment, but of course, you as the reader must research the facts and do your own due diligence. After weeks of continual investigation and many positive events (metrics, marketing, brokerage tools), it is nice to see the S&P lead in turning the tide in the right direction from the analyst arena.Disclosure: Long"

The catalyst(s): Simple, fundamental improvements in businesses (but before the 'magic moment' dawns on the stock price, invisible)So WHEN is the magic moment? Generally, it's when:A) the company reports a profit after losses, orB) the company's cash flows have improved so much that it finally can use its internal cash to pay down debt and/or buy back stocks, orC) the company's analysts support business actions and trends with positive commentary.If A), B), and C) -- it's the most powerful combination in the marketplace.With that in mind, when will the MAGIC moment occur for E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC)?E*Trade is well on its way to accumulating its year end target of $1 billion excess cash for a safety cushion (a key difference between Layton and the old CEO: in business, you just can't spend your last dollar on your greatest idea(s)). The environment is improving, that's good, but a safety net is called a safety net for a reason . . . so even though buying back stocks and bonds would be great right now the safety net is more critical.Recent reports on the liquidation of non-core assets and the execution of 10% cost savings would indicate this $1 billion target will be reached well ahead of schedule, almost certainly by October (Q3) and very likely by the end of July (Q2).Target cash achievements to date:i) They already accumulated $695m as of Q1  ii) The pool went up by $260m in one quarter  iii) Now E*Trade is accelerating its non-core assets sale program including selling, last week, its stake in the India venture to HSBC for $145m.After the $1 billion target is reached, any extra excess cash can be spent on debt/stock buybacks. Both will be accretive to shareholders, which should be the focus, depending on where the prices are by then. At current prices, both E*Trade Stock and Bonds are steals: bonds yielding some 11% and stocks at barely 2x normalized operating earnings. That’s right, barely 2x E*Trade's Online Brokerage arm's income.In May, The New York Times published an article entitled “A Wish List for Fixing Wall Street,” which highlights Kenneth Griffin’s (Citadel Investment Group founder) insights for Wall Street. It is easy to see that with Citadel and Mr. Griffin providing the financial foundation and direction for E*Trade’s progress, the timing for E*Trade’s MAGIC Moment will most likely be sooner instead of later.Note: Edited from materials written by Numbersssss Disclosure: Author has a long position in ETFC"
77548,21782,2008-05-16T05:18:48-04:00,,"E*Trade's (NASDAQ:ETFC) management is doing a superb job in correcting the errors of the past and bettering the firm's position for the future. Through of a series of brilliant marketing campaigns (i.e. funny baby commercial) and creative initiatives (global trading), the company has managed to retain its retail client base. The April activity report was surprisingly bullish, as average revenue trades were up 5.8% year over year while the stock was trading at 6 times its current value. While management has disclosed that further writedowns and capital dilution may quite possibly occur, these low expectations will play to ETFC's advantage rather than disadvantage from a trading perspective.Shorts have overstayed their welcome in this name, currently standing at ~23%. As evidenced by the price action in Fannie Mae (FNM) in the first week of May, namely when it announced a massive writedown followed by a significant pop, blindly shorting financials doesn't work anymore. The large short interest in this name should encourage, rather than discourage, investors as shorts naturally have short investment horizons and become increasingly impatient and distrustful of each other as their strategies don't work. The stock currently has resistance at the $6 level; look for it to get off to the races if it manages to break through as there will be a massive short covering induced rally that could easily send the stock back to its October-November level.So why am I so convinced that E-Trade, a firm that still holds some toxic paper, is primed for a major breakout? First of all, there has been very significant insider buying from various executives at an average weighted cost that equals or exceeds current trading prices; I like the fact that management outs their money where their mouth is.As evidenced by the April activity report, E-trade has been able to retain its retail base throughout this crisis and should be able to gradually regain some of the customers who defected to other brokerages. The company's global trading platform is truly revolutionary and unique as it allows customers to trade in a variety of global markets in local currencies. The firm has more financial flexibility due to the fact that is also operates as a quasi bank, although I do hope they have learned their lesson and will refrain from investing in risky assets from now on. Citadel's $2.5B cash infusion (at $4.78 per share), while being a bit dilutive, provides for a strong floor.By betting against a company with rapidly improving fundamentals, the shorts are in effect digging their own graves. Analysts have been known to be too late to the party, whether it be to the downside or the upside. 21 of 23 analysts who currently cover E*Trade have a negative or neutral rating on the stock; that is actually a positive rather than a negative, as I expect a wave of recommendation upgrades in this name that will send the shorts panicking for the exits.In conclusion, from a risk-reward perspective ETFC looks quite compelling and I look for the stock to break through its resistance at $6 and probably trade back in the mid teens by the end of the year.

And rightly so, its mortgage division has a large portion of problematic loans on the books even now.The next two quarters will show us if it can engineer a soft landing from the fallout of their bad mortgage debt. But the mortgage “mark of Cain” shouldn’t be reason alone to exclude it from our short list of investment opportunities.In the same way investors punished Altria Group (NYSE: MO) for its cigarettes and tobacco while ignoring the profitable aspects of the spun off Kraft Foods (NYSE: KFT) division, Wall Street seems to have forgotten that E*Trade has an enormously profitable brokerage business. No doubt there are challenges there – but these are market issues, not enterprise problems.E*Trade’s customer trading activity was down from last year, but higher than the previous month’s figures. It’s not rocket science that E*Trade only makes money when investors and traders make transactions. And with the poor market performance, it's no wonder their receipts are down.But a few trading days with massive volume could be all it takes to bring the good times back to E*Trade's bottom line.One of the really interesting things about this company’s situation is the amount of short interest in ETFC. Almost 74 million shares have been shorted. That’s almost 13% of the total shares outstanding. We pay close attention to large amounts of short interest because it tells us there are lots of investors speculating in one direction.

It is obvious that E*Trade has a cadre of fiercely loyal traders and investors who bristle at any suggestion that E*Trade might fail. After reading the comments following one recent article, I had the following thought:Naturally, I immediately opened a small position and then I decided to do a little research. I know, that is a little backwards but I was really caught up in the fervency of E*Trade’s supporters. After doing a little digging on their investor relations website, I came to a conclusion that surprised me. E*Trade is not a broker that got in to trouble by delving in to the mortgage business. E*Trade is now a mortgage business that happens to own a brokerage. In fact, the E*Trade brokerage franchise may exist for years merely to try to earn enough money fast enough to keep up with the losses generated by the mortgage and consumer loan book.I now believe that any discussion or analysis of E*Trade that does not look at its mortgage portfolio is simply pointless. If you do a search of E*Trade articles, however, you will notice that virtually none of the recent articles or comments discuss the mortgage portfolio at all, and instead simply focus on things such as E*Trade’s terrific trading platform. In fact, a couple of recent articles did not mention the word “mortgage” even once, yet pretended to offer solid advice on E*Trade’s future. So, since nobody else seems to be talking about “the problem” I thought I would shed some light. All of the information below comes directly from the E*Trade investor relations website.“The Problem” Portfolio $9.7 billion in agency CMOs $1.2 billion in “private label” CMO $2.6 billion in consumer loans (Primarily RV and boat) $15.5 billion in home loans $11.9 billion in home equity loans ----------------------------------------- $40.9 billion totalE*Trade also holds about $7 billion in margin loans and about $1 billion in corporate and municipal securities. Because I lack any loss estimates for those types of loans and figure they are fairly secure, I am going to leave them out of the discussion. As for the rest of the loan portfolio, I will take on each piece one at a time.$11.1 billion CMO portfolio This mortgage portfolio has two pieces, “agency” paper and “private label” paper. It is all rated AAA and AA. The “private label” securities give me concern because I simply do not know what “private label” means and I don’t trust ratings on any mortgage paper these days. Nevertheless, lacking any “who, what or where” on these securities, it is hard to say much else other than that they increase E*trade’s mortgage exposure.$2.6 billion Consumer Loan Portfolio Does it surprise you to know that E*Trade holds $2 billion in RV loans and $500 million in boat loans? They have a little over 1% of this total portfolio reserved for loan losses as of the end of 2007. Here is my question. How will a portfolio of RV and boat loans do in a recession? Could this portfolio be a little bigger problem in the future than just a 1% write-off? I will not pass judgment, but be sure to factor in Winnebago loans to any decision on whether to invest in E*Trade.$15.5 billion Home Loan Portfolio Houston we have a problem. The average LTV (loan to value) on these loans is listed as 69%, which is not to bad. The problem, however, is that I believe the “V” in LTV was calculated at the time the loan was written. If anybody wants to correct me on this, please do. So, it is important to look at the quality of this portfolio. First, about 85% of these loans were written at the peak of the housing bubble with the following vintages:20% 2005 vintage 38% 2006 vintage 26% 2007 vintageSecond, a large percentage was written for property squarely located in “bubble” areas:12% Los Angeles 11% San Francisco 9% New York 6% Washington D.C. 5% San Jose 2% Riverside 2% Phoenix 2% MiamiFinally, about half of the loans were written based on stated income. As you know, stated income loans are also known as “liar loans.”Despite the quality issues, E*Trade has just $19 million reserved against this $15.5 billion portfolio. Moreover, the 90-day delinquency rate on these loans more than doubled in the past 6 months and now stands at over 1% of the portfolio ($160 million in loans). The low loss reserve no doubt relates to the first lien position and an assumption that the LTV is high enough to allow for a substantial recovery on bad loans. This assumption, however, goes out the window in a 30% down market, which is predicted by many pundits.$11.9 billion Home Loan Portfolio (1-4 units) Ick, yuk, ugh! This is the UGLY stuff. These loans are mostly second liens, and the portfolio is going bad fast. The vintages are as follows:20% 2005 vintage 49% 2006 vintage 10% 2007 vintageThe geography of the loans is similar to the first lien portfolio. A substantial amount of the loans are located in the bubble areas of California, Arizona, Florida and New York. More than 40% of these loans were stated income and over half were made with a CLTV (Combined Loan to Value) of over 80%. Remember, this valuation was done at the height of the bubble. So, with falling real estate values you can guesstimate that a substantial amount of this portfolio is collateralized by “thin air” and a handshake.The portfolio seems to be performing accordingly. Close to 4% of loans are over 30 days delinquent and over 2% are 90 days past due. The company has already written off $91 million in losses, and it has reserved about $460 million for future losses. By its own estimate, losses will ultimately fall in the $1 to $1.5 billion range, which is 10%-15% of the entire portfolio. Again, you can decide if the losses will be higher, but keep the quality of the portfolio in mind when you make your calculation. Also, remember that E*Trade is a bank and must keep adequate reserves in order to forestall bankruptcy. If these loans go sour at a faster pace than E*Trade can replenish its reserves, it will mean big trouble. With this portfolio, E*Trade is by its own admission in a race against time.Conclusion In its best year (2006) E*Trade made about $650 million in net profits but the company has lost a substantial number of clients and deposits recently and it has greatly increased its debt burden. Also, in 2006 its mortgage business actually contributed to earnings. For the sake of argument, lets assume that the company can make an average $400 million in operating profits in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Virtually all of the profit will go just to cover losses in its home equity portfolio alone. A substantial amount will also be needed to address that puny reserve for the first lien mortgages, which Morningstar conservatively estimates will generate $145 million in eventual write-offs.The problem is not just the absolute amount of any losses. Given time (20 years or so), the brokerage could probably pay for the entire portfolio to go bad, but time is not on E*Trade’s side. The company recently took some drastic but positive steps through asset sales and an onerous and dilutive re-capitalization deal in order to alleviate immediate concerns over its regulatory capital requirements. Nevertheless, the company has just $500 million in excess capital on the books, which puts it precariously close to being pushed into bankruptcy should its loan portfolio deteriorate faster or further than anticipated. Needless to say, E*Trade has not been great at anticipating things lately.So, when considering an investment in E*Trade, keep in mind that what will eventually determine the fate of the company has relatively little to do with the quality of the brokerage service or trading platform, and everything to do with the housing market, the performance of liar loans in bubble areas, and the fate of RV and boat loans in a slowing economy. I know that a lot of readers won’t like me pointing out these facts, but this is unfortunately what this company has become and you should invest accordingly.Disclosure: long ETFC"

In an industry plagued with bad news and an asset portfolio heavy in mortgages, it has investors shaking in their boots. But as others are fearful, now is the time to get greedy. With a New CEO, a clear strategy to clean up the balance sheet, and below book value prices for shares of E*Trade, the upside is looking great.Non-executive chairman Donald Layton (former J.P. Morgan (NYSE:JPM) supervisor of investment-banking & retail operations) has been named CEO of E*Trade Financial. This is not surprising, considering that E*Trade's retail operation is extremely profitable and their investment-banking side is in need of serious help. Layton seems like a perfect fit to fix this company’s balance sheet.Now, I can’t not mention that E*Trade currently has about $12B in home equity loans, which will hurt in the upcoming quarters. Further significant write-downs could put a lot of pressure on the company’s earnings and on its liquidity. Investors don’t like this, and it’s currently reflected in the stock price.Because of this reflection, I’m very excited! Buying companies at roughly their book value in general gives you a good idea on how to justify your purchase, especially for a novice investor. As it stands right now, assuming E*Trade home equity loans hold up to $12B (which will probably drop in value), the book value is $6.12 / share. When the share price is at $4.02 (as of today), this tells me that the price of further write downs are already priced into the stock, giving you some buffer room when that news hits the fan.At the end of the day, E*Trade has one of the (if not the) strongest brands in the online discount broker space. On top of their strong brand is one of the best trading platforms available online. Behind the brand and the platform, is an extremely profitable retail business model, where E*Trade makes money in both bull and bear markets. Once the investment side is all cleaned up, it’s smooth sailing for E*Trade. All aboard!Disclosure: Author has a long position in ETFC"
64610,21411,2008-02-14T06:25:44-05:00,,"There I was, a few minutes into pre-market monitoring, when new E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) news arrived. I read the article, going slowly through one section and then smiled… another validation. Then, of course, came the permutations of the original story.The story that was actually released by E*Trade on Wednesday morning was fairly straightforward - the 21.5% year over year trading gain, 16,000 new accounts in January, a drop in value of client securities commensurate with the market performance at the end of January and stable customer cash assets. If you dig slightly into the story you realize it also gives a glimpse of preliminary February performance. Before I talk about that though, let me mention how news sources re-wrote the news.The first change to some subsequent stories was to drop any mention of the client securities drop that tracks January market performance; then “assets fall” shows up in the title, and next someone mentions that the 16,000 accounts represented just half (500) of the 1,000 accounts per day that E*Trade hoped to attain.OK, all very nice lessons on how to attempt to drive a herd, and possibly an unfortunate comment on the state of factual reporting. Here’s my take. I don’t believe it was clarified when E*Trade said they would open 1,000 accounts per day that they would be working weekends. In fact, I’m happy to give them the benefit of the doubt that, given their industry, they could have meant 1,000 accounts per business day (market trading day for them). January had about 20 trading days, so 16,000 new accounts is about 800 accounts per January day by this measure. Of interest in the story is that it also says that the week after the Super Bowl (February 3) showed a 32% gain in new accounts compared to last year’s game. I don’t actually know the number of accounts gained after last year's game, but I can make an assumption that it was probably a better than average week. An average day over the last 12 months, by the way, was already about 1,100 accounts per trading day, roughly (4,732,535 – 4,456,016)/12/21. Thus, for at least one week this month, they are already BACK OVER the 1,000 account per day mark. The more important thing to take away from this is that at the end of January they were within 10,000 accounts of their all time maximum; February will see them with a new all time high for total accounts, and trading volume is near an all-time high.What’s Next?The company has committed to setting aside one billion dollars in support of its banking and loan portfolio. Something over 40% of this was set aside last quarter, but the remaining 50 to 60% will be funded over the next two quarters. This will show as a paper loss, but the reality is that it is a company asset and market capitalization (share price) must rise in recognition of this. This additional security deposit, as it were, combined with more favorable banking conditions (Fed cuts) should start to be reflected in the bond and credit ratings at some time during the second quarter, and yes ETFC will show profit again by the 4th quarter of this year. Further, this accumulating billion is not totally stagnant; certainly it should generate some income of its own to help offset the Blackrock springing lien payments. Jim Cramer is a bit stubborn; he’ll wait to make one of his classic apologies until probably the third quarter, but that will be of little solace to those that listened to him and passed on over a 200% gain… but he is fun to watch. I would expect a revised price target from someone acting responsibly out there soon, but actual upgrades may still be another month out or they may even wait for next quarter. At some point before the end of the year the share price will break the $8.50 it was trading at before an analyst commented irresponsibly early last November that E*Trade could go bankrupt. That’s right - I’m predicting over a 66% gain from the current price of $5.12 at sometime before the end of this year. This is, of course, my opinion. I currently own shares of ETFC and I continue to accumulate more. Pick your Jim, go with it, and good luck. Disclosure: Author is a customer and shareholder of ETFC"
76521,21708,2008-05-09T06:15:57-04:00,,"On April 25, Dean Laster wrote an intriguing article regarding the fact that E*Trade’s (NASDAQ:ETFC) stock has short interest sitting at 20% of the stock’s float (see “Why the E*Trade Shorts Have It Wrong”). Mr. Laster pointed out that E*Trade has no “downside catalyst” and that all the the bad news is priced into the $4 existing stock price. In fact E*Trade’s April 17th Earnings Conference Call presented many positive upside trends for both the brokerage business and the mortgage portfolio performance, so “shorts are in effect digging their own graves.”This week, on Wednesday May 7, Nick Perry from Schaeffer’s Investment Research wrote an article entitled “Is E-Trade Financial Corp. Poised to Make Another Run?” In this article Mr. Perry affirms the unusual circumstances that the 20% short interest position sets up. He also indicates that the current “contraction in volatility can be a sign that ‘pressure’ is building.” He points out that “a contraction doesn’t suggest which way a stock will break.” However, the “stage” is set for a “pop above the front-month calls but we still need a catalyst to spark the buying.”What Mr. Perry doesn’t realize is that the catalyst is now here. This coming week, the Annual Shareholder’s Meeting will be held by E*Trade. Will this meeting provide the “Short Interest” holders with their negative price effect? The pressure is there, which way will E*Trade break this coming week, up or down?Other points of interest are as follows:1) A concern in April was that stock market and brokerage trading volume would decline because of recessionary trends, which would hamper E*Trade’s brokerage recovery. Since that time the DOW Jones Industrial Average surpassed 13,100 and many economic employment and production indicators have provided signs of positive economic trends.2) On April 22, 2008, Kanner Frederick Wilkinson, a Director at E*Trade purchased 50,000 shares of stock. Also, Donald H. Layton, CEO, has his compensation/bonus package directly linked to stock value.3) On January 29, 2008, nine E*Trade directors directly purchased significant blocks of E*Trade stock totaling close to $2 million.Disclosure: Long"
79254,21708,2008-05-29T03:43:53-04:00,,"If one only hears some pundits talk about E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) or looks to analyst opinions for investment guidance, one wouldn't know that E*Trade is this year's best brokerage stock, one of the very few financial stocks with a positive return, and one of the S&P 500 stocks that has double digit gains. Technically speaking, it also has another bullish component to support its positive price actions since January--volumes. E*Trade’s pattern of daily volume is high on rising days and low on consolidation days-–a classic bullish sign. To close watchers, E*Trade, as a company, has definitely, albeit not widely reported, been on a strong cause of turnaround:Just the other day, James Altucher from thestreet.com acknowledged the bullish trends affecting E*Trade and identified it as an “extreme stock” with a “Buy at $4, sell at $8” recommendation. In contrast, financial analysts have been so slow to respond to E*Trade’s “turn around.” A review of analyst upgrades and downgrades shows that the last activity was five months ago in December 2007. Quite the delay given recent developments. What IS fast becoming the new consensus is E*Trade’s robust recovery in the online brokerage business: old customers are returning, new customers are signing up at close to a record high pace, and assets are growing again and at a faster pace than both TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) and Schwab (NYSE:SCHW). To E*Trade customers, this is of course no surprise, given E*Trades cutting-edge online trading platform: fast, reliable, and sophisticated, unlike some of its competitors who just last week had slow and stalled trading. So, with these dramatic yet still little recognized fundamental developments, and with bullish volume and trading trends, WHO is going to trigger the ""Magic Moment?""Let's examine them one by one. (One word of caution, this is not a complete list and it can't be complete, for the Magic Moment, by definition, has an element of surprise.)Conventional Shorts: E*Trade has 111.4 million, which is over 22% of all outstanding shares, one of the top five most shorted Nasdaq stocks, in one word: HEAVY.Of these heavy and numerous shorts, any sizable one can trigger the magic moment if it decides to wise up to the fundamental developments at E*Trade or gets nervous about the bullish trends and begins covering the short position. With volume at only 9.9 million shares yesterday, it would take 11 days for the short interest to cover. By behavioral finance, the worry of ‘WHAT IF “they” move before “me?”’ has extensive repercussions as 111.4 million shorts start to worry about their buddies. Box Shorts: They are the special animal of shorts. There are no published data and none of the box shorts would do an ad for us telling us they have a box position. So we can only guess and estimate. By way of background, the 1997 Act has largely closed the DOMESTIC tax loophole in box shorting, but an overseas-based hedge fund can still use this technique, NOT for tax but for price manipulation.Yes, manipulation. Some will argue criminal but it's used. Why? In depressed stocks such as ETFC, shorts know fully well that many other operators can push the price and trigger a squeeze any time. So some shorts also build long positions, hence the name box short, either to use them to cover their short margin calls or to sell them in hope of keeping the price low. In other words, their long positions are fighting tools. Once their long position is used up, they must buy and cover their remaining short interest.Looking at Bloomberg mutual fund and hedge fund holders of ETFC, I noticed that one likely box short used to have over 20 million long shares but has cut half of them in the latest quarterly filing. What's left is only 10 million shares at their disposal in any potential future fight. Worth close watch indeed! If ETFC continues to warm up, those 10 million shares will NOT last very many DAYS, let alone weeks or months. Analyst Upgrade(s): Let's just say there is no more downside in ETFC as far as analysts are concerned. Only one analyst that has a “BUY” rating on E*Trade, all other analysts have E*Trade at SELL or the Wall Street equivalent of SELL [HOLD] and none of them has yet to come out of the herd recognizing the many recent progresses that ETRADE has made. So, by default, there is only an upside to the analyst(s) position. Also, remember, for stocks like E*Trade upgrade to SELL from STRONG SELL, or from SELL to HOLD can be powerful, let alone an upgrade from SELL straight to BUY. Fresh Buyer(s): If any of the first three types just discussed have an element of con and second guessing in them. In contrast, a “Fresh Buyer” is actually logical and easy to understand. As a company makes positive progress, has bullish indicators, and is yet still undervalued, some corners of the vast institutional world with assets under management in the trillions of dollars will start to give E*Trade some recognition by becoming a new large shareholder. According to Bloomberg data based on SEC filings, as of the latest quarter, Citadel has bought the most and is the largest holder. After Citadel, the heaviest buyers were names such as D E Shaw, Bridgewater, Davis Selected Advisers, Barclays Global, Deutsche Bank, and Vanguard.Which will it be? Conventional Shorts? Box Shorts?

74263,21799,2008-04-27T08:02:04-04:00,,"How can the act of one company cause the demise of a goliath (Bear Stearns (NYSE:BSC)) and an entire sector (financials) to lose billions?  It was some time in mid-November, when E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) was trading at about $20 per share (about 10 billion market cap), that an analyst from Citigroup (NYSE:C) (who needs not be mentioned) would be remembered infamously for his comments.But the true cost of his actions were like a row of dominoes falling - affecting not only the targeted company but the very firm he represented. ""E-Ttrade going Bankrupt"" was the comment, and the reasoning was irrational (as E*Trade stated later).The following weeks set in motion a domino effect that would cause Citigroup to lose half of its value and Bear Stearns to go out of business. E*Trade did something so massive it was considered taboo. Because of the actions and comments of the Citigroup analyst (and having subsequently lost nearly 90% of their market cap), E*Trade did what we are taught to do every time we fly on a commercial plane - they put the oxygen mask on themselves first before thinking of the other companies that would be hindered from their actions.E*Trade sold off their CDOs and Alt-As for .27 cents to the dollar to Citadel. Why is this significant? CDOs and Alt-As are priced based on the last sale price, not on what you or I claim they are worth, so in essence, E*Trade cutting off a pinky caused a massive hemorrhage to the other institutions that carried those instruments more extensively.E*Trade was and is now safe, plus 2.5 billion dollars stronger, but it does not end there. You see, almost 100 million shares short came on board at about $3 per share, and they were promised an execution. Many can argue that shorting a company at $25 for a jolt, making a point on the down side, is intelligent and opportunistic, but when you short so much with so few shares outstanding (at a level no short normally would not care to be left naked), it's hard to justify such a short under those circumstances.Well, not only is E*Trade not going bankrupt, nor intending to do so, but they sold off many non-core assets, such as their corporate jets, investments in India, and, if I'm not mistaken, E*Trade in Korea, Japan, Australia, and other locations have been sold off quietly. This is all being done, in my opinion, to fatten up their balance sheet and to trim the fat off of their expenditures.In addition, E*Trade has changed their CEO, COO and, more recently, their CFO. This is not the E*Trade of yesterday; this E*Trade is bigger, meaner and much more cash rich. But why the make over? I believe that analysts followed with their downgrades like lemmings (except for BMO Capital, which was more open to the true value and was steadfast), and now E*Trade needs to give those analysts a reason to re-recommend the company. An analyst could always report that E*Trade's rating has been increased due to a reduction of CDO and Alt-A exposure, increased cash reserves and client base, but the fact that the company has had a management facelift would be a more compelling reason to believe that a turnaround is in progress ahead of expectations.This is all being orchestrated like a great symphony with, I believe, Ken Griffen acting as not only the composer but also the maestro.E*Trade has been out of the woods for some time now and the institutions are slowly tip toeing back in, but they have to do it in without awakening anyone. E*Trade will most likely do one more sale of securities in exchange for getting rid of any remaining debt. Many have been awaiting the acquisition of E*Trade, but if their suitors don't act quickly, the share price, which will continue appreciating more every day, week and month, will make it more expensive to do so, and with more and more improvements, the shareholders would be less likely open to getting rid of their shares.Disclosure: Author holds a position in ETFC"
60673,21411,2008-01-18T04:42:31-05:00,,"E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) is both bank and brokerage; as such, it has at times enjoyed successes from both market trading volume and banking sector gains. It’s sad, as both a customer and sometime shareholder, to see it currently under attack from many sides. I was a customer before their IPO and before they added banking. I’ve been a shareholder since their market price seemed to have room to run -- near their IPO, again since, and now. The first couple attempts nearly doubled my money, and I think this time around has that same potential, if not more.Let me say that E*Trade has my checking, savings, margin, two IRA, and VISA accounts and they also wrote my home loan. Let me also say that having all my financial accounts under one roof initially seemed just a no-brain convenience, and is now something I never wish to give up.For one, there is security; they offer an RSA hardware dongle to generate a pseudo-random number once per minute to enhance my password security. You need to request it, but it’s worth it, and it may be free depending how much money you have across your accounts. There was a story released Wednesday stating customer accounts at E*Trade, Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) and elsewhere had been compromised for an options scam; I very much doubt the E*Trade customer(s?) that was compromised had this dongle. Let me digress and say that individuals frequently create passwords that are not secure; further, if they happen to mistype a password at a web site and get an error they often try a password that may belong to another institution before they get it correct -- at that point a password somewhere is compromised. With this dongle I have my base password plus 6 more digits of security. If the base password is compromised, they don’t have the physical dongle and if they’ve got the physical dongle they still shouldn’t have my base password. In either case, it is more difficult for someone else to get in. (I know there are some bright people out there; I acknowledge you – please don’t try to hack me.)I see one bank wants you to choose a picture to add “security” to your account login – cute, but it’s the equivalent of adding one extra fixed letter to your password. Apparently they include the picture if they ever email you – tip: don’t ever respond to an email correspondence from your bank unless it’s by calling the number on your account statement (not one contained in the email). Since the bank has a limited number of pictures to choose from and everyone chooses the cute picture that touches them, then someone just sends that cute picture to a few thousand addresses and a few of them will see their picture – not what I call secure.Everything under one roof at E*Trade means only one secure login to handle everything financial. I can receive a direct deposit in my checking account, perform an immediate transfer to my margin account and then invest it immediately. I can likewise perform a direct transfer from checking to pay my VISA bill, or use the free online bill pay to pay any other bill in moments. I can move non-invested cash from my margin account to my savings account and make over 5% APR interest. No other company or site ever has to have access to any of my financial accounts; I can link external accounts if I wish for direct transfer from or to them, but I’d initiate those transfers only from within E*Trade. I receive alerts to my phone when transactions are processed, so I know quickly if something odd is occurring. I also appreciate the unlimited reimbursement of ATM transaction fees; E*Trade did (and may still) have the 3rd largest ATM network in the U.S. which gives them bartering clout to do this and I doubt it incurs cost to them.For a time, due to my workplace’s SIMPLE IRA plan, I had to deal with another brokerage that was both unresponsive (when my funds were credited to someone else’s account) and quite happy to keep collecting my trading fees with no attempt to update the efficiency of their site (poor layout and slow access times) or the services they provided. Fortunately I was able encourage the implementation of changes and employees were allowed to choose their brokerage under the plan. I then transferred that account over to E*Trade with my others. I’m sure what’s left of TDW is better where it is now.What E*Trade did wrongE*Trade followed the herd of banks trading in CDO paper. Had E*Trade limited their mortgage exposure to their existing customer base, to whom they do offer a small discount in rate by the way, and had they then maintained servicing for those loans while only seeking a reasonable percentage of outside mortgages, there would be no problem whatsoever. They did, however, follow many other banks. That being said, I believe they saw what was happening and were already exploring ways to divest themselves of the CDO line when, in early November, an analyst from a competing company said they faced the possibility of bankruptcy; further, he suggested a percentage possibility, which at 15% was near the 16.7% probability of throwing a number or a six-sided die. I believe they were already investigating ways to rid themselves of CDO paper because of the timing of the Citadel “vote of confidence” deal; it was too soon after the bankruptcy comment. Not too soon to complete the negotiations which were probably then expedited, but too soon not to have been researching their potential options to begin with.The bankruptcy comment must have forced management to take quick action, and possibly not get as favorable an outcome as may have been possible otherwise. Still I don’t feel they did that bad. While Citigroup (NYSE:C) has announced layoffs of over 13,000 employees within a year's time, is cutting dividends, accepting foreign investments, offering excess tenders (hmm) and still holding CDOs, E*Trade has (so far) only cut one section which was underperforming and under review anyway affecting fewer than 100 employees, yet has fully divested itself of its primary CDO problem.I’ve heard an analyst recently reiterate his downgrade of E*Trade saying it was paying more in customer enticements and advertising to gain back customers. I can say they paid near 5% savings interest for nearly all of last year, so that hasn’t increased. I do see a lot of advertising, but that must be to counter some early defections after the bankruptcy comment. Strangely enough, I think it’s the same analyst, hmm… and he works for the competition and about the biggest losing financial services juggernaut to announce this quarter, hmm…I guess we’ll see what develops next week during E*Trade’s earnings announcement, but I believe they tried to do the right thing. They’d already announced expected write-downs and that should have been built into their price at mid $8s before the bankruptcy comment. Their price should have been considerably higher coming into earnings next week. The bankruptcy comment also had other results…I would like to congratulate Joe and Ameritrade on their stellar quarter; if I only required a broker, their's would be a company I would investigate further. I can’t, however, willingly go back to separate bank and brokerage providers having now experienced something better. I’ll also say that should a company try to take a portion of E*Trade and not the whole entity, thus removing my conveniences, I would not be happy and I would then take all of my accounts elsewhere. Not that my holdings would be of too much consequence, but I would bet a large number of E*Trade customers feel the same way. You choose your bank or broker based on your particular tastes and requirements; it does not choose you.It would be nice to say that buying a company’s stock shows support for that company, but since the shares you own can be borrowed and sold short, devaluing both your holdings and the company’s market capitalization, this is a fanciful illusion. Still, I love the company and have faith that it will find its way successfully through its troubles; it has often shown itself more nimble than its competition in the past, so when I realized where E*Trade was trading after the bankruptcy comment I bought in, mostly at mid fours. Before the projected annual earnings numbers were updated, the forward PE ratio was somewhere around 1.5; given that it is now trading closer to three (even if you do count a full 20% Citadel dilution)... well you figure it out. I’m pretty confident that I’ll get close to the returns I’ve made holding ETFC/ET/ETRD in the past, and probably at some point before the end of this year. I know people who are still opening accounts with them, and I know my trading volume was up last quarter and it will be increasing again this quarter. I have no affiliation with E*Trade other than being a loyal customer and holding a few shares, down and long.With the poor opening to the year, I wish all a healthy recovery.Disclosure: Author is a customer and shareholder of ETFC"

E*Trade’s shareholders clearly took this statement to heart as the company’s share price declined 59% in one day. Just as interesting however, is the question of whether E*Trade’s online depositors shared those fears.While not as well known as its brokerage business, E*Trade also has a significant deposits business with nearly $30 billion in consumer deposits. At Compete, we utilized our panel of two million users to investigate what impact, if any, this analyst report had on the behavior of E*Trade’s online high-yield savings [HYSA] shoppers. If E*Trade’s online consumers reacted in a similar manner as its shareholders, we would expect to see a comparable drop in new submitted online account applications after the report was released.Approximately one month before the Citi analyst report was released, E*Trade reduced its rate on high-yield savings from 5.05% to 4.70% APY. However, shortly after the report, E*Trade increased its rate back to 5.05% APY. This rate increase may have been an attempt by E*Trade to stem consumers’ fears about its financial condition. Did this rate increase successfully offset the negative news about E*Trade from the Citi analyst report?*Competitive set includes high yield savings products of E*Trade, HSBC Direct, ING Direct, Emigrant Direct, CapitalOne, & CountrywideThe chart above illustrates E*Trade’s weekly share of submitted online high-yield savings applications among its key competitors.

When E*Trade lowered its rate on October 12th, it experienced an immediate drop in account openings and a loss of 6 share points from 19% to 13%. E*Trade’s share of applications remained flat at 12% for the next four weeks. On the week of November 11th, when the analyst report about bankruptcy was published, E*Trade’s share of online submitted high-yield savings applications instantly dropped another 4 points. Shortly thereafter, E*Trade raised its interest rate back to competitive levels and within a week, its share of online high-yield savings applications increased 10 points!!Decreasing its high-yield interest rate, as well as the release of the analyst report, were both followed by losses in E*Trade’s application share. However, once E*Trade returned its rate to a level in line with key competitors, its share of applications went higher than ever, despite any fears of bankruptcy! This just goes to show that, like investors, consumers will take a risk for the right return. And apparently that there is still plenty of faith in the FDIC to bail us out if things go wrong."
56609,20862,2007-12-07T02:23:21-05:00,,"Last week I posted about Citadel's investment in E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC). Subsequent to the investment, ETFC has been rated a sell by BofA and the stock is currently trading below Citadel's buy price. Sort of.Something unmentioned in the news reports of the deal, but available here (Item 1.01, paragraph 7) is that 40% of ETFC's equity order flow and ""substantially all"" of its customer option order flow will go through Citadel's execution business (tip of the hat to hedgeworld.com). Now, Citadel is a very well known hedge fund, but less well known is its execution and market making business. Citadel's derivatives trading group is one of the largest option market making groups in the whole business, right up there with Goldman Sachs (naturally). Citadel will profit in at least three ways from the equity and option order flow:It's pretty easy to model the value of the first two, once you know average spreads and average volume. Absent knowledge of Citadel's strategies and processes, measuring the value of the third is impossible for an outsider. Suffice to say, it's huge.So, the $2.5B that Citadel is investing is hedged by the interest payment, the preferred claim on assets in bankruptcy, the fire sale purchase price of the ABS portfolio, the potential trading profits, the brokerage revenue, the market intelligence and a seat on the Board of Directors. Well done, Ken Griffin."
63096,21478,2008-02-05T04:47:15-05:00,,"E*Trade Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:ETFC) has taken a tremendous beating over the past year, even getting dubbed the worst performing stock in the S&P 500. The company has since unveiled their 'turn-around' plan, and it's being viewed with mixed opinions. Here is my view on the past week's news and where the stock is heading. E*Trade directors buy $1.9M worth of stock There is talk of this being purely a PR move, others think this is simply a way to manipulate the stock; however their justification is inadequate. Many believe that $1.9M is simply too small a number to be significant to these directors; however I would have to disagree. When you buy stocks - do you ever put your entire year’s salary on one stock? Probably not. Would you wager your own personal money in a PR move to your company? Probably not. They either believe in the company, just as we do, or they know something that we don’t, which could only be good. While I do believe that there is a PR piece to this event, I do believe fundamentally that these directors are very confident in their company and their stock. E*Trade airs two advertisements during the Super Bowl E*Trade has a long history of buying ads during the Super Bowl. This year was no different. It would be somewhat foolish to believe that the airing of this Super Bowl ad will have an immediate effect on the company’s stock; however had it not been run, it might have spooked some investors who are accustomed to seeing the ads every year. They do have a very bold statement this year; 1,000 new accounts daily. That kind of growth (if they hit the targets, of course) will be a major component to their growth and add significant value to their balance sheet. You can view the ads on my previous post E*Trade Stock InsightMaybach Financial adds E*Trade Financial Corporation to their Watch ListMaybach Financial is a syndicate of financial informants representing a true investing experience. Taking research from financial consultants, brokers, researchers, and conglomerates from around the world, they focus to give investors the financial advantage necessary to make money in all markets. As of Friday, February 1, 2008 they have added ETFC to their portfolio. I find what is common for these large institutions, is they all tend to mimic each other’s moves. It doesn’t take long before these institutions cause big momentum in a stock. It’s always good when people want to buy! Why we love this stock We are firm believers in Benjamin Graham’s teachings, and although the great Warren Buffett himself probably wouldn’t purchase ETFC (he’s just not into technology), the fundamental components of the company are there. Just look at it’s book value: $6.13 / share! It’s currently trading at roughly $5 / share. A reasonable, cheap price for this stock should be in the $8-$12 range, and that would still be “cheap”. This stock has a lot of room to grow with a great, extremely profitable and strong business behind it. Any drop in price in our opinion would simply bring a great buying opportunity in a great company. In addition to a profitable business model - they also happen to have the best trading platform available on the internet today.What to expect this weekThis is obviously an almost impossible section to fill out, as we are not equipped with crystal balls or time-warping machines (although we’re working on it). However, based on current trends, I’m confident that we will see a gain on this stock by the end of the week, anywhere from 3% to 18% depending on news and new institutional owners. There has been a tremendous amount of volume on this stock last week, reaching over 100M shares traded in a single day, which blows their average away of roughly 40M in volume. This is an indicator that there will be volatility as some investors will sell prematurely, causing dips in the share price. You should be alert this week for such drops as buying opportunities for the stock.Where there is much uncertainty is how these ads will affect investors. There are going to be strong opinions about how effective the ads will be - and in a market right now filled with fear, all it takes is a little bit of bad news to cause catastrophic effects on a stock price. Effective or not - on a long term horizon - you should definitely be taking advantage of this opportunity to own an industry leader in online trading / banking at such an undervalued price.

But maybe the deal was even better than that.Depending on how you do the math, Citadel may have paid as little as 60 cents on the dollar for prime mortgage-backed securities. Nice.Useful related chart (click to enlarge):[via NYT]"
55889,20212,2007-11-30T05:11:27-05:00,,"I've been spending some time today mulling the Citadel investment in E-Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC). I'll note some positive components first, and then some of the more worrisome aspects.On the one hand it is a savior, of sorts, for E-Trade, which had been wobbling badly because of the problems, real and perceived, in its portfolio of subprime/ABS assets. This Citadel deal helps solve some of those problems, first by taking those asset-backed securities off E-Trade's books, and second by putting some new cash onto E-Trade's balance sheet.Further, the investment - even more so than the Abu Dhabi deal at Citi - will mark in many people's minds a bottom for the struggling subprime mortgage sector. ""If Ken is willing to buy, so am I"" goes the logic. Granted, there is a half-trillion more of subprime resets to come in 2008, but there is a growing consensus out there that at 26 cents on the dollar - the effective valuation in the Citadel pricing for E-Trade - we are likely already valuing subprime assets at levels that more than reflect the likely default rates.With the preceding in mind, this is likely a great deal for Citadel. It gets asset-backed securities - read:subprime - at a low price, one that will likely turn out to be very smart a few years from now as default rates turn out to be considerably lower than most market nihilists expect today. At the same time, it gets paid for doing the deal by getting an attractive interest rate on an associated note.This will go a long way toward reassuring E-Trade investors and customers that the company isn't disappearing immediately. While Citadel has no real strategic interest in E-Trade as a business, it also likely doesn't want to see the company disappear into bankruptcy.Now some more critical commentary - as I listen, for the second time, to the E-Trade conference call.First things first: the price on E-Trade's ABS book. We just had a major mark-to-market event, in effect. As more than a few people have argued to me via email, if most of the industry had to mark their ABS books to 27 cents on the dollar, the U.S. banking business would be in deep, deep trouble.Second, there is a troubling absence of specifics about the E-Trade loan book, and about some of the more nitty-gritty specifics of the deal, like the loan loss provisions embedded in the portfolio. While the management team is ducking the question on the conference call, there were 60 Citadel staffers apparently pouring through E-Trade's books, so I have a hard time buying that they don't have a very specific view of what is going on among these troubled assets. (Relatedly, there is no Edgar filing yet on the deal. Why not?)Related to the preceding, why no info on the breakdown of the $1.6-billion infusion between equity and notes? That seems, you know, big and material, but I am old-fashioned that way.Next, E-Trade CEO Mitchell Caplan has made out nicely, which will piss off shareholders to no end. Not that he needed to be hung over a river for E-Trade's subprime misadventures, but it's deeply galling that he has been able to cash out so completely from a wobbling business.Finally, this deal is awfully dilutive to existing shareholders. The total dilution from the deal is something like $0.50, which, on top of lost customers (most of whom were more active and sophisticated) over the last few weeks, pretty much takes E-Trade's earnings power to zero.Overall, this deal shores up E-Trade, but it's tough to tell what more (or less) it currently does. We just don't have enough specifics, and management was light on facts in the conference call.In the absence of more data I'll call it mildly positive for E-Trade, great for Citadel, and near-term negative for the industry (if only because it will drive more mark-downs), but that's it - and, of course, subject to change as we see more specifics."
55864,20862,2007-11-30T03:30:50-05:00,,"Citadel Investment Group (""CIG"") is taking a big chunk of E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC). CIG is taking ETFC's ABS portfolio for about 25 cents on the mark-to-market dollar (I'm assuming the ETFC's ABS portfolio is marked-to-market, admittedly a big assumption). CIG is also getting 10-year notes at 12.5% and a board seat. Including CIG's current EFTC holdings, they'll end up with about 20% of the company.WSJ has a thorough synopsis of the deal, which WSJ.com subscribers can read here.Now, by no means do I disparage rich people getting richer. In fact, I aspire to be one of those who does. What caught my eye in the article was CIG founder Ken Griffin's comment that ""the time to be buying distressed securities was at the moment newspaper headlines were uniformly negative on the markets."" If you act on the press's hyperventilation, there's no question you'll buy highs and sell lows.I truly believe attempting to time the market is, except for only a highly select few, a fool's errand.

After falling 60% last week on an analyst comment that it might face bankruptcy, the company's stock rebounded on the next three trading days, taking it up more than 60%.This week, however, E*Trade stock has tumbled for two days straight, falling almost 20% today alone on massive volume (in part prodded by a Wall Street Journal ad telling customers not to fret). We're now back within spitting distance of last week's lows. In other words, an E*Trade bounce was a fun trade, but the market is back to worrying hard about E*Trade's future as a standalone company."
63063,20991,2008-02-05T02:05:26-05:00,,"When I saw that an ad for E*Trade Bank had made Jeff Bercovici's top six ads of the Superbowl, I thought I'd do a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation. The ad is for the E*Trade savings account, so I thought I'd take the cost of the ad and work out the number of extra accounts that E*Trade Bank would have to open in order for the ad to pay for itself, assuming that, if the bank couldn't open new savings accounts, it would have to borrow at Libor.But. Overnight Libor is at 3.24%, and the curve declines a little out to three months, where it's 3.14%. All of which is much cheaper funding than the E*Trade Bank savings account, which currently pays 4.31%. So why on earth would E*Trade Bank spend millions of dollars on a Superbowl ad for the privilege of borrowing money at 4.31%, when it can borrow in the interbank market instead at much lower rates?Well, maybe those fears of E*Trade Bank going bust haven't gone away, and it no longer has access to the interbank market. Or maybe the super-high-interest savings account is a marketing gimmick, and when the Superbowl rush is over, the interest rate on it will quietly fall to something below Libor. Either way, the ad hardly gives me much confidence in E*Trade Bank, or in its parent, E*Trade Financial Corp (NASDAQ:ETFC). Which fell 4% yesterday to $4.75 a share."

ETrade is selling Citadel their entire $3Bn portfolio of asset-backed securities for $800M and Citidel will give them a $1.75Bn, 10-year note at 12.5% interest. Citadel will then pick up 17% of ETrade’s stock and take a seat on the board, kicking CEO Mitch Caplan out the door as the company takes a $2.2Bn write-off in addition to the $400M they have already set aside for Q4 losses.Woo-hoo! Party time, excellent, woo-hoo!!! ARE YOU PEOPLE FREAKING NUTS?!?I was banging the table to buy ETrade at $4 and I’m sure glad we covered at $5 because THIS DEAL SUCKS! If ETrade’s portfolio was so worthless that they had to pay Citadel to take it off their hands with a 70% loss, then what the heck are the other financials hiding?This deal makes CitiBank’s (NYSE:C) 11% note look like a bargain but no one is projecting the kind of wholesale dumping of mortgage-backed securities. The big question that remains is: Did Citadel buy the worst or the best of ETFC’s $29.3Bn mortgage portfolio, $12.4Bn of which were mortgage-backed securities. Supposedly, these were the loans ETrade was worried about and the company believes it can work out the remainder on their own. Gee, I hope they’re not wrong!"
55792,20308,2007-11-29T11:12:11-05:00,,"Does Citadel’s Investment’s $2.5 billion infusion into E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) mean the company couldn’t find any buyers? Is $2.5 billion enough? Should investors read anything into Citadel getting a senior position to shareholders for most of its investment? Is there more bad stuff to come with the company’s mortgage business?Those were among a few of the questions I asked acting CEO Jarrett Lilien earlier this morning. Lilien, who has run the company’s brokerage business, has been tapped to replaced CEO Mitch Caplan.Lilien (inset) doesn’t buy the argument that the company couldn’t find any other buyers. “It was just the opposite,” he says. “There was so much interest that it led to a process that was so thorough to the point of being too thorough.” He says ETrade talked to 40 different parties about a combination of deals, including mergers, “But when you looked at it, the value to the shareholders just wasn’t there with those looking to take the whole company. And some looking to buy the whole company didn’t have the knowledge or expertise to take on asset-backed securities.”Indeed, the biggest winner in this deal would appear to be Citadel, which is getting $3 billion of securities that yield 12.5% “for 27 cents on the dollar,” says Bank of America Analyst Michael Hecht, who also figures that Citadel got most of its 19% stock stake for free. (It already owned a 2.5% position.) At the same time, he points out, as a result of the deal shareholders will suffer a 40% earnings per share dilution with a 100% dilution of tangible equity. “Xmas Comes Early for Citadel, Existing Shareholders Get a Lump of Coal,” was the headline of his report.He’s not the only critic. Sean Egan of Egan-Jones says that even with Citadel’s stake “a 10% haircut on the $47 billion portfolio” of mortgages and loan receivables “could wipe out” all of Erade’s equity.But Lilien is more sanguine. He says a $400 million provision for the company’s $12 billion home-equity loan portfolio should be adequate. “We now have the excess capital to work through this.” He adds that “what is baked into our numbers is that things will get worse on the home equity side and we have built up reserves that cover that.” But he acknowledges the total impairment could be greater over time, given the nature of delinquencies and possible work-outs, and that “it could be a problem that takes two to three years to work through. But that’s okay, because we can put the allowance where it needs to be. You don’t necessarily have to raise the allowance, but we could.”Furthermore, he insists that “we shouldn’t have much in the form of impairments going forward. Once we work through the home equity portfolio, we have a very high quality first lien portfolio.” He refers to the current situation as being “in the middle of the storm.”As for the brokerage side of the business, he says deposits have fallen in the wake “of the panic that swallowed us up in the past couple of weeks.” Things now, he says “are more back to normal. It interrupted a more positive trend.”“If we were a private company,” he adds, “with the capital we had we might have been able to work through this on our own.”But they’re not, and they couldn’t."

Some bank stocks are trading at or near book value. One can easily say drooling valuations. On top of that we had a nice rally last week. Even the Abu Dhabi sovereign government fund came in with an investment in Citi (NYSE:C) similar to Prince Alaweed in the early 1990s banking crisis. So why not join the fun and make some money? However, is one's memory really short enough to forget the September market rally, which was not sustained? 
No one has a crystal ball, and anything can happen. In past crises, as well in many bear markets (which we are not in yet), issues are not - as one hopes - resolved within a matter of weeks. In 1989, Japan’s stock market was at 39,000; today, in 2007, it is running at between 15,000 and 16,000. The true money is made when there are capitulations and the proverbial blood on the street. When Prince Alaweed came in to purchase Citigroup, he purchased shares at half of book value. The recent Abu Dhabi purchase was not anywhere near those valuations. The next issue seems to be: How does one value the types of paper these institutions are still holding? One needs to take into account that very little of this paper has been written off. One needs to ask: What has changed? 
Hedge-fund group Citadel might have called some kind of a bottom with its purchase last week of a $3 billion portfolio of asset-backed securities from E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) for just a little more than 25 cents on the dollar. However, if one is to consider this a bottom, a very major problem still exists. Many firms that own these assets are still carrying them at much higher valuations and have not yet written them down. What will happen to the shares of these companies when they eventually write down this paper? 
David Einhorn from Greenlight alluded to this in one of his writings. It is similar to homeowners who have not lowered the prices of their houses even though the market has changed dramatically. They still have not sold their houses either. Possibly, in the short term, one can witness a bounce in share prices of the financials, as nothing ever goes straight up or down. We simply might be witnessing a dead cat bounce. What surprises are on the horizon? Banks from Norway to Japan are the latest victims of the carnage. I find it very hard to see that we are at a bottom, with tremendous valuations that value investors drool for. What truly has changed? If you plan on bottom fishing, make sure you bring a change of clothes in case you get soaked."

After an initial positive reaction, shares fell after the Street digested the high-cost and dilutive terms of the deal, leading several brokerages to cut E*Trade earnings estimates Friday. Hecht called E*Trade's retail brokerage a ""dwindling asset,"" and says he expects the best-case scenario for E*Trade to be another $1 billion addition to its reserves to prop up its $12 billion home-equity portfolio, while the worst case could see the company forced to sell its entire home-equity portfolio. Hecht called the move ""odd,"" and said it raises the question of how much has really changed at the firm.

It was not difficult to find news reports in the last three years warning of the risk posed by easy mortgage lending. So why did these rocket scientist-Harvard MBAs do it? Why did they dive blindly and stupidly into their very own mortgage abyss?Not only banks, but Wall Street titans like Merrill Lynch and Citigroup. And, of course, E*Trade.Why do turkeys gobble? Why do sheep bleat?Not to add salt to the wound, but this is not the first time this has happened. It happens at least once or twice per decade. It will probably happen again many more times in our lifetime. It will happen here in the US and it will happen in other countries. Big banks and financial institutions making stupid loans or otherwise doing stupid things with their capital. It's part of their DNA.Just as a disclosure, I'm not really a financials guy - I have generally avoided financial stocks since I find that I can make money elsewhere. This might be a good time to look at them, though.I've worked at big banks, and I've worked around stocks for a long time. So I know enough about them to be dangerous.By the way, I do not own E*Trade stock. I have my accounts with them, though fortunately not my bank accounts. I do own stocks that have been affected tangentially by this mess, however. And it's not fun.I would like to cite Warren Buffett. He coined a phrase called the ""Institutional Imperative."" Put simply, this is the inherent propensity of any company (especially large companies) to do really dumb things. Companies are hardwired to squander capital. Banks have a lot of capital, so they have more opportunity to squander it.A few years ago, the hot market was real estate. Everybody was buying a new house, TV stations and shows on real estate proliferated, Home Depot and Lowes were enjoying big gains, lenders were tripping over themselves to extend mortgages, and investors were tripping over themselves to buy mortgages. Sound familiar?The details are different, but theme is the same. Bubble. Then bust. Then, whoa, banks were in on it, too. Who woulda thunk?You see, organizations are inevitably structured to reward activity by its employees that create value for the employee, but only sometimes create value for shareholders - and often destroy value for shareholders. The more powerful the employee, the more value he can create for himself.For example, the people who originate loans make money when the loan is originated (remember those fees when you took out your mortgage?). The have quotas to meet, market share goals to attain. If they don't meet their quota, they either get fired or they don't make much money. Management, of course, also makes money off of the originations. And they don't make money when they refuse to make loans.What about the risk? Don't these loans carry risks? Won't they lose money if the loan goes bad? Of course. But the originators and their bosses don't bear all of the risk. Investors are not going to dip into the employee's bank accounts and ask for the money back that gets lost. The worst that can happen to the employee is that he gets fired. And the top brass at the company will walk away with millions, so what does he care if he gets fired? And he was going to get fired anyway if he didn't make enough loans. There are other jobs out there. Remember, he has a Harvard MBA.The employees who were concerned about risk got weeded out years ago.Who carries the risk? The people who hold onto the loans carry the risk, and they are called ""shareholders.""Of course, in the latest debacle, loan origination and ownership was separated, adding more room for mischief.But don't companies put risk controls in place to make sure this doesn't happen? Sure. But people are creative - they find ways around the risk controls (hence the separation of origination and ownership). Beta and VAR (""value-at-risk"") are popular forms of risk control, and they work well ... except when they are needed most. And when the boss as well as the employee aren't really interested in controlling risk, then it is a pretty safe bet that the risk will not be controlled.Besides, everybody's doing it... safety in numbers ... who knew this would happen?Humans run in herds. The herd was chasing real estate and bad mortgages.Maybe the government should step in and fix things! Well, maybe not. You see, I'm a shareholder in the government - not because I want to be, but because I am required to be. As a taxpayer, I don't want to clean up somebody else's mess, and Uncle Sam will just make it worse. If you really enjoy watching the Institutional Imperative at work, then following our tax dollars will be great entertainment.Except, of course, the government is stepping in. It's called a bailout. And bailouts perpetuate the cycle.These aren't bad people. At least most aren't. They just have zero (actually negative) incentive to look at the big picture.So why do banks make bad loans? Why do turkeys gobble? Why do sheep bleat?Because it is the way of the world.The best way to approach this as investors is to assume that companies will do stupid things. Most of these behaviors are very predictable - they've happened before, and they will happen again. Thus, they can be built into a valuation estimate for the company, if your time horizon is long enough... It's not risk if you expect it. It's only qualifies as risk if it is unexpected. If one buys into something that is expected, that's called a mistake (we all make them, so don't feel bad). Bad loans are not unexpected.However, when these things do happen, stocks in unrelated industries get hit. But, if the fundamentals are still sound, then the intrinsic value will not be affected. That doesn't make the volatility any less painful, though.Type in ""Institutional Imperative"" and ""Buffett"" into your favorite search engine, and you will find many a fine article on the subject."

Granted, most of the current is on buyout interest, so if something doesn't appear soon, it's more likely that we see neutral/negative news first and the stock gets taken lower again, but for now it's been a fantastic trade for anyone who bought E-Trade at the close on Monday."
54013,21140,2007-11-13T07:30:17-05:00,,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:ETFC) has a great online brokerage franchise business. It has been improving its level of customer service, targeting a particularly attractive demographic, and increasing the profit level per customer within that demographic. An online brokerage business is great for several reasons- you generate a lot of cash through customer's brokerage accounts and the costs of being business are relatively fixed so if you can grow your business your profits will really grow. Contrary to popular belief, most of the money is not made through commissions but earning interest between what you charge people for margin loans and what you pay them for their cash and other fees.E*TRADE used a lot of the money it made as capital for its banking subsidiary. The banking subsidiary entered the mortgage business aggressively, almost certainly too aggressively. Their strategy was to be conservative and not get greedy. Unfortunately, unless you own mortgages for property on Mars, you are currently suffering losses on loans, and home equity loans in particular. They have a portfolio of $12 bn in home equity loans and $20 bn in first lien mortgages. A minuscule amount was in subprime but the bulk was originated in the last 2 years, at the top of the real estate market.They also owned a billion or so of asset backed securities collateralized by all sorts of residential mortgages on which they have already taken huge losses and they ""shockingly"" announced they will be taking further losses this quarter. Now if you had paid any attention to the index for such securities (ABX-HE-AA 06-2 is probably representative of their portfolio) this should be no surprise at all.They will bleed money every quarter out of their loan book. For accounting purposes, loans work differently than securities. With securities, you have to price them according to the market price, which incorporates expectations for all future losses. With loans, only actual losses and some level of reserves hit profits. And at this point, E*TRADE is dramatically under reserved against future losses. Its financials, released last Friday, showed loan loss reserves of 0.08% of its first lien mortgages, somewhat more for its home equity loans.E*TRADE's bank and brokerage divisions will be in a horse race- can the brokerage division make money fast enough to counter realized losses and additions to reserves over time in the banking division?I'm not sure - my guess is no. You might ask, if I think these guys could become under capitalized why on earth am I buying this stock?Because it is now cheap. Really cheap.E*TRADE's closest competitor, TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD), is currently valued at $11 billion. While TD has more customers at this point, I would argue that E*TRADE's execution is better and the franchise more valuable.It is so cheap at this point ($1.5 billion) that someone with a lot of money could buy it, throw in an extra $5 billion to cover future losses in the mortgage portfolio, and still be in the money. If I had $6.5 billion sitting around...The main spanner in the works will almost certainly be E*TRADE's willingness to sell out at these prices.Another spanner could be the feeding frenzy atmosphere around the company, largely created by panicked analyst reports authored by people who appear not to have been paying any attention until E*TRADE bonked them over the head with Friday's announcement. E*TRADE long ago made public all the information you would need to write the reports that only came out today.We shall see.Disclosure: 1) I bought some yesterday for my own personal account; 2) I am not advising anyone to do this for their own account. This is an extremely risky investment. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT RISK THAT YOU MAY LOSE ALL OF YOUR INVESTMENT."

If you do that, as Citigroup's Prashant Bhatia notoriously did in his report on E*Trade, you risk your report turning into a self-fulfilling prophecy. After all, no bank is immune to a bank run.At the same time, however, I think it's rash to simply blame Bhatia and call him ""irresponsible"" for publishing what was actually a pretty sober piece of analysis. The key datapoint: half of E*Trade’s deposits, or $15 billion, are in accounts that contain more than $100,000, and are therefore not insured by the FDIC. If I was an E*Trade depositor, and I had more than $100,000 in the bank, and I saw that E*Trade was announcing subprime write-downs of unknown size, then I wouldn't need Prashant Bhatia to tell me to move my money somewhere a little bit safer.If I were E*Trade, then, I wouldn't be running around shooting the messenger, I would be running around spending as much money as it took to buy private insurance on all of my deposits over and above the FDIC cap. Either that, or I would be simply trying to sell myself to someone rather better-capitalized.As for Bhatia, he called it right. There are a million different things which can cause a bank run, and analysts' reports are hardly top of the list. What's more, for the time being there's still no evidence of any bank run at all - though that might change tomorrow, when depositors start seeing the headlines.Even then, however, the proximate cause of the bank run would be the drop in the share price, not Bhatia's report per se. As we've seen with shares from Crocs to Sotheby's, there's no shortage of stocks which turn out to be just waiting for an excuse to crater. E*Trade turned out to be one of them, and that's not Bhatia's fault."
54021,21193,2007-11-13T07:50:57-05:00,,"A topic that we've been addressing over the past several months, and more frequently over the past several weeks, is financial institutions unveiling mortgage related losses.The latest financial institution to make this announcement is E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC), but this one hit the company hard on Monday November 12, 2007. The stock sliced off over fifty percent of its market value as they announced that their earnings will not meet the expectations of Wall Street due to write downs.These write-downs come from bigger than expected losses as it relates to mortgage backed securities; same as Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), but the difference is that E*Trade is relatively a peanut of a company compared to such giants. So their capability to absorb massive losses may be the concern that is looming.The company stated that they are setting aside approximately $500 Million to offset potential bad loans and write downs; this was all that it took for analyst to jump on the bandwagon.Citigroup Analyst Prashant Bhatia took it a step further and titled his report ""Bankruptcy Risk Cannot be Ruled Out."" Granted, Chief Executive Officer Mitchell Caplan took a risk, just as every financial institution did in the industry, although the dim outlook of analysts such as Bhatia have tickled the selling trigger finger of not only institutions but of small individual investors globally. In my opinion this slide has just put E*Trade Financial at a deep discount.The stock seems to be oversold and once the dust settles the possibility of the stock climbing, at least to the high single digits, is there. As I always say, buy into weakness and sell into strength, and this is a definite weak point for E*Trade. Disclosure: none"

Based on accounting convention, E*Trade is not required to mark-to-market certain loans and securities. However, in the event that it has to sell these assets as a result of losing its funding sources (e.g. deposits & repo lines), losses could be realized. Citi's haircuts to arrive at the $5b loss estimate include 10% on 1st lien loans, 20% on HELOCs, and 25% on its ABS portfolio.They are lowering 07/08/09 earnings estimates to $0.31, $0.90, $0.90. the tgt of $7.50, includes a 15% probability of bankruptcy.Notablecalls: Citigroup's call is titled ""Bankruptcy Risk Cannot Be Ruled Out"". That's why we have the stock down 30% in pre-market and not 10% like it should be following Friday's news. And it would still be a bounce candidate!This stuff sounds like '00-'02 when Guy Moszkowski was covering ETFC for Citi (then Salomon). I think he downgraded the stock to Sell at around $4. Man, this is clueless stuff. Prashant, you should have seen this coming and should now be looking for reasons to UPGRADE this stock, not downgrade. Phew!It's a buy around $6. Even if the mortgage positions end up worthless, ETFC is worth a lot more than what it is selling for right now."
53744,21196,2007-11-11T11:40:33-05:00,,"On Friday, investors became aware of yet another victim of subprime fallout when E*TRADE Financial said in a SEC filing that deterioration in the residential mortgage market will likely result in writedowns that exceed previous expectations included in the company’s Oct. 17 earnings report.

E*Trade told investors it would write off approximately $450 million of its $3 billion asset-backed securities portfolio, consisting mainly of CDOs (collateralized debt obligations) and second-lien securities, but also including $50 million in AAA-rated debt.

54319,21620,2007-11-15T06:13:14-05:00,,"We had a small position in E*Trade which we initiated last week, in part due to agreeing with some of the long-term conclusions put forth by Bill Miller at Legg Mason in his 3Q letter to shareholders (.pdf).E*Trade was doing what many were doing in the mortgage business. Based on a credit score alone you could easily get a mortgage with no documentation, no appraisal (other than a supposed ""drive by"") and very low fees.E*Trade has been in crisis mode before and one of our larger clients bought a huge position. His analysis suggested that the replacement value alone for their technology platform was close to the total market capitalization at the time.The problem now is that it is impossible to know to what extent the value of E*Trade could be impaired by the risk in the banking business. When Enron collapsed, a day of research would show that the company actually had no real assets to use to support a stock price. In our view, E*Trade has clear value in their platform, their customers and capabilities. In fact, we don’t think there is any way E*Trade is going to disappear but there could well be a re-capitalization and/or merger with another player.On the question of customer panic and business impact, we think there will be some. Trolling the online reactions, there are clearly many individual investors who will switch their accounts to other brokers like TD Ameritrade and possibly shift their banking to places like ING or even regular full service banks. This is true even though there really isn’t any risk for most account holders but many people get emotional about what they read in the newspaper. Unfortunately having ""possible bankruptcy"" all over the news and watching the stock plummet to $3 creates alarm and concern that will probably cause customer and asset shrinkage in the short term.Research 2.0 acquired a substantial position in E*Trade stock on Tuesday. It’s probably not going to go up in a straight line and the immediate 40% rise will certainly lead to some near-term profit taking. However, it’s likely that we will continue to own some position in ETFC even after today. If the company can get through the crisis as an independent the stock could certainly be worth $10 to $15. If the problems are not surmountable the company will be absorbed but equity holders can’t be certain to profit from these levels due to the fact that additional capital infusions might be needed.Disclosure: Long ETFC~ Kris Tuttle for Research 2.0"

Today, in the wake of a disclosures of an SEC investigation into its mortgage trading and a further slide in the value of its mortgage portfolio, the company stopped offering guidance for the rest of the year.The latest news caused longtime critic Egan-Jones Ratings Co., an independent ratings agency, to downgrade E-Trade’s debt; the action comes a month after a ratings affirmation with a positive bent by Moody’s. In its downgrade, Egan-Jones wrote that the most recent disclosures is confirms its original concerns regarding the valuation of $47 billion in mortgages and loan receivables. According to Egan-Jones:Even more problematic, and perhaps getting more to the heart of the problem, is that E-Trade has steadfastly believed the quality of its mortgage portfolio is better than most.

48322,20149,2007-09-26T09:02:49-04:00,,"I have been looking at E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) in recent days. This is exactly the kind of contrarian play that I think value investors should be looking at within the financial services sector. It falls into the category of being beaten down due to mortgage market issues, but I do think there is a lot of long-term value here, given that mortgages are not a core focus for E*Trade. Let's take a look at why the stock has fallen so much. The shares are down a stunning 54% since June to $12 each. In recent years E*Trade has started offering its core retail brokerage customers a wider array of financial products, including bank accounts, certificates of deposit, mortgages, and home equity loans. Not surprisingly, they are not immune to the mortgage market meltdown. Earlier this month, the company announced it was joining the ranks of those firms moving to shut down their wholesale mortgage business due to market conditions. That, along with a higher than expected provision for loan losses and some institutional brokerage restructuring costs will result in dramatically lower earnings for 2007. E*Trade now expect full year GAAP earnings per share of $1.10, down from their prior target of $1.60 per share. Does ETFC represent a good contrarian value play? To me it appears that it does. With any contrarian investment idea, you will have to be patient, but buying a premier franchise for what could very well turn out to be less than 11 times trough earnings per share looks like a very attractive valuation.  There have been rumors of a merger with Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD), but I would not expect a deal in the short term as E*Trade gets their house in order. Ameritrade CEO Joe Moglia would love to do a deal, I'm sure, but at these prices, E*Trade is better suited fixing their issues and waiting for a more normalized profit picture before entertaining offers that maximize shareholder value. A deal does make sense at some point though, as online brokerage mergers have a ton of synergies that can be realized. You may be curious if I have bought any ETFC shares yet. The answer is no, but not because I don't find it an attractive option. It is simply impossible to buy each and every attractive stock when managing fairly concentrated portfolios. There are a lot of financial stocks I think are too cheap, and I own some and don't own others. It's just a numbers game really. If you are looking for portfolio additions in that space, E*Trade is definitely one worth considering. Full Disclosure: No positions in ETFC or AMTD at the time of writing"

""While we are extremely pleased with the continued growth trends we are generating throughout the retail business, we are clearly disappointed with the overall Company performance as a result of the severe volatility in the credit markets,"" CEO Mitchell Caplan said. The net loss included a $0.30/share writedown charge on asset-backed securities. Net revenue fell heavily, to $321 million, from $582 million a year ago.

In today's earnings release, E*Trade again guided down; it now forecasts earnings of $0.85-0.90/share, assuming no further securities writedowns, and said it is prudent to account for another $0.10 in its forecast due to its difficulty in assessing the effect the current environment will have on its earnings (full earnings call transcript later today).

Furthermore, many financial institutions are losing/lost money as a result of buying bad mortgages and/or investing in debt securities. Perhaps a better question at this point is: “Are there ANY financial institutions with significant mortgage operations, which don’t have any problems right now?”Q3 earnings season is going to be really interesting; as I doubt this is going to be the last “surprise” we’ll see before all the financial firms finishing reporting Q3 results.

Back in February when I first heard that E-Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) is going to introduce a global trading service to allow investors to trade stocks listed in other markets directly, I signed up to receive notification when it becomes available. Yesterday, the email came, announcing that the new E-Trade Global Trading is up and running.
Of the six markets (Canada, Hong Kong, France, Germany, Japan, and UK) currently included in the Global Trading, I am mainly interested in Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which gets the most listings of companies from mainland China. The main reason, of course, is the tremendous growth of Chinese stocks. It’s very tempting. Also I know many of the companies choosing to list their shares on HKSE, instead of NYSE or NASDAQ. I know their businesses and their positions in their industries in China. In fact I wish the service were available sooner so I could buy stocks from companies such as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China [ICBC], which is now the world’s largest bank by market capital, surpassing Citi Bank last month thanks to the booming Chinese stock market.
While the service seems to be exciting, the reality can cool off any idea of active trading as investing in any of these markets with E-Trade’s global trading platform isn’t cheap, though E-Trade claims it’s a “low-cost” service. According to the fee schedule, the cost per trade for stocks listed on HKSE is HK$299.00. At the current exchange rate of $1 = HK$7.82, the commission itself will cost investors nearly $40. Plus, E-Trade also charges a whole range of fees, including:
Since all transactions are made in local currencies, US investors will have to convert dollars into local money before trading any stocks. There’s another cost of $15 to $20 for each currency conversion.
Though I like the idea, the cost of trading is just too high. It’s impossible to trade in the same way as with US discount brokerages when each trading could cost me as much as $60. I have to think it through whether I want to get an account or not."

The reorganization also will include a restructuring of its balance sheet so the company is more reliant on cash and assets. Charge-offs of $95M for loan losses and an increased provision expense of $245M are expected in the second half, as well as an estimated $32M in restructuring-related charges. Against that backdrop, E*Trade said it now sees 2008 earnings of $1.05-$1.15/share, down from its previous outlook for earnings of between $1.53 and $1.67/share. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial had expected earnings of $1.60/share, on average. ""We want to get this issue behind us and put the focus solely back on our core retail customer,"" said E*Trade CEO Mitch Caplan. Rival Ameritrade, with whom E*Trade reportedly has held merger talks, has expressed concerns about E*Trade's reliance on the mortgage business. As of the end of August, E*Trade said 2% of its $17B mortgage portfolio was composed of delinquent loans, while 2.8% of its $12.6B home-equity portfolio was at increased risk. E*Trade said its funding sources were ""sound"" and that it was ""well capitalized.""

We're initiating coverage on the online brokerage, which reports earnings later today, with a strong buy rating.
Our investment thesis is based on three upside drivers.
One, E*Trade is rapidly gaining market share. We believe that this is resulting from a confluence of sound acquisition initiatives and increased advertising for its rapid execution trades.
Two, given its operating synergies, we believe that E*Trade is itself a viable acquisition target. The overriding trend in online brokerage points to consolidation, and E*Trade's competitive position is certainly strong, arguably second to that of Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD).
Lastly, on a valuation basis, E*Trade is not expensive.
It is not unreasonable to think that the company could fetch 22 - 25 X forward results given its earnings growth, expanding market influence, and diversified business model (brokerage, lending, and banking).
In short, a valuable franchise like E*Trade could see $25 before it sees $20.

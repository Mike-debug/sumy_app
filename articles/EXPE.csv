4356990,102875,2020-07-05T13:28:58-04:00,"While Expedia didn’t offer its guidance for the full fiscal year, analysts expect Expedia’s EPS to be -$5.70 per share.The rise of Airbnb and increased competition from Google are making it hard to justify buying Expedia’s shares even at the current price.We think that it’s better to avoid Expedia’s stock and look for other companies that were not affected so much by the virus and have better growth prospects.","As a major online travel agency, Expedia (EXPE) has been steadily growing its earnings in recent years, as the travel industry was booming. However, the spread of COVID-19 all around the world disrupted the company’s operations. While Expedia’s stock has recovered from its 5-year lows, it’s still down more than 30% YTD. As airlines, hotel chains and rental companies try to minimize expenses and offer the lowest possible prices to attract new customers, Expedia’s days of charging 15% to 20% for its services by acting as a middle man are about to end. In addition, the rise of Airbnb (AIRB), which charges mainly 3% for its services, and the increased competition from Google (GOOG)(GOOGL), which is slowly disrupting the OTA field, are making it hard to justify buying Expedia’s shares at the current price. While the company didn’t offer its guidance for the full fiscal year, analysts expect Expedia’s EPS to be -$5.70 per share. Considering this, we believe that it’s better to avoid Expedia’s stock and look for other companies that were not affected so much by the virus.Expedia’s portfolio consists of platforms like Expedia.com, VRBO, HomeAway, trivago, Travelocity, and others, which help users book hotel rooms and flights in any country of the world. The company’s services help customers to find the cheapest and best deals that the market has and often Expedia offers them rebates and percentage discounts, which ensures that users will continue to use its services in the future. In exchange for its services, Expedia takes on average 15% to 20% from hotel chains, airlines, and other providers.As COVID-19 started to spread outside of China in late February, international travel began to decline. As a result, in Q1, Expedia’s revenues declined by 15.7% Y/Y to $2.2 billion, while its non-GAAP EPS were -$1.83, below the analysts' estimates by $0.46. At the same time, the hotel room nights, which account for the large chunk of Expedia’s revenues, were also down 14% Y/Y.Like the majority of other companies from the OTA field, Expedia has greatly suffered from the virus, as its margins deteriorated and profitability disappeared. Currently, Expedia trades at an EV/EBITDA of 15x, which is above the industry’s average, while its margins are below the margins of its competitors.As the travel industry was booming in the last decade, Expedia was able to drive growth, generate positive free cash flow from time to time, and create shareholder value. It was spending cash to repurchase its stock, and in the last three years, the company bought back nearly 8% of its outstanding shares. However, the pandemic changed everything.In the first half of the year, the company quickly stopped its buyback program and hired a new CEO to tackle the crisis. At the end of April, Expedia had $6.5 billion in cash, which is an increase from around $4 billion in March, as the company was able to get additional financing, which will help it to stay afloat. Expedia also promised to cut $300 million to $500 million in spending, but that hasn't happened yet. Despite all of this, the problem is that at the end of Q1, Expedia had $7.38 billion in debt, and in the current environment with negative net margins, it will have a hard time recovering even when the virus is contained.While Expedia will be able to weather the current crisis, its business model in a post-pandemic world needs to be revised. Paying 15% to 20% in fees to Expedia is no longer feasible for hotel chains and airlines in the current environment. We believe that the rise of the competition will force Expedia to decrease its fees in order for it to stay relevant in the OTA industry. Currently, we see two major companies that pose the biggest threat to Expedia’s business. The first company is Airbnb, which recently announced that its bookings in May surged after a steady decline in March and April. There’s a chance that Airbnb will be able to raise additional capital and become public by the end of the year, which will help it to more efficiently compete with major OTAs like Expedia and Booking (BKNG). The major advantage of Airbnb in comparison to Expedia is its low fee structure. When hosts add their listings to Airbnb, most of the time they use the shared host and guest fee structure, which charges only 3% commission from each reservation. This makes it more attractive to property owners and hotel chains to use Airbnb and not Expedia or Booking to attract customers. While Expedia recently decided to focus its attention on expanding its own property-listing platform VRBO to better compete with Airbnb, the platform accounted only for 11% of the overall revenues at the end of 2019. While it has shown impressive growth in the last couple of months, it will not be able to offset the losses of all the other platforms in which Expedia has a stake.Google, on the other hand, poses an existential threat to Expedia’s current business model. As a monopoly in online search, in the last few years, Google has been aggressive in maximizing its revenue per visitor. As a result, it now promotes more paid ads on its search pages, making it hard for companies like Expedia to promote its services via the free content, as it’s being shown much lower on a search page than it was before. This means that OTAs need to spend even more money on ads to attract more users, as free content is not as efficient as it was before. In addition, last year Google launched Google Travel, an online service similar to Expedia and Booking, which helps travelers to plan their trips and book flights directly with vendors. With more than $100 billion in cash reserves, Google’s parent Alphabet poses an existential threat to Expedia and others, as it has all the resources it needs to dominate the OTA field if it decides to expand even further.Without proper guidance for the whole year, we believe that it’s better to avoid Expedia’s stock. Recently, Wedbush said that the company will be able to return to its 2019 profitability levels only after 2022, and we believe that that assumption is accurate, considering that in Q2 alone Expedia’s revenues are expected to be down 58% Y/Y. For the full fiscal year, analysts expect Expedia’s EPS to be -$5.70. Considering all of this, we think that it’s better to avoid Expedia’s stock and look for other companies that were not affected so much by the virus and have better growth prospects."
4364208,103480,2020-08-04T13:16:24-04:00,"Shares of Expedia have skidded slightly downward after the company reported second-quarter results.
        The extension of U.S. lockdowns and the rising number of cases both domestically and in Latin America and South Asia are causing muddled visibility into the travel calendar.
        Estimates for the recovery year, FY21, have come down materially to reflect this extended normalization timeline.
        Bookings in Q2 were down -90% y/y and offer no clue into stabilization, though Expedia hinted at slightly stronger June/July bookings trends.","Despite being one of the most impacted stocks by the coronavirus, Expedia (EXPE) - the second-place OTA leader behind Booking Holdings (BKNG), has only seen a ~25% reduction in its share price since the start of the year, despite a continued muddled picture into when fundamentals will recover. Struggling with expected bookings slowdowns in each of its key segments (particularly hotel stays, but also for air tickets as well), Expedia has responded to the coronavirus by rolling out a plan to deeply cut costs (up to $500 million, or ~4% of normalized annual revenue). But with the release of Expedia's second-quarter results, we're still very much in the dark as to when Expedia can and will rebound. Bookings remain at historically low levels as most around the globe continue to fear traveling, and as many major markets including the U.S. are dealing with a rising amount of coronavirus cases. Following the Q2 earnings release, shares of Expedia have lost about ~5%.Consistent with the update I provided in June on Expedia, shares have traded downward even as the S&P 500 soared nearly 10% (boosted by large-cap tech earnings), underperforming the market by about fifteen points in that timeframe. The best move for investors is to remain on the sidelines. Longer term, Expedia is attractive thanks to its dominant position in travel, and its duopoly over the travel market and consumer traffic alongside Booking Holdings effective acts as a second ""tax"" on hotel operators that they've been forced to get used to. In the near term, however, two obvious indicators prevent the stock from a near-term rebound:Of course, Expedia is very headline-sensitive. But outside of a chance gamble on a slowdown in cases or a near-term vaccine, there are no fundamental catalysts that can meaningfully lift Expedia's share prices from current levels - especially considering that at a ~25% loss for the year, Expedia's year-to-date losses are far more mild than many banks, energy, and retail stocks (despite what I believe for Expedia to be an equal or even greater negative impact from the coronavirus versus all these other sectors).Be patient here and don't immediately buy on the dip. I had previously gauged my entry points on Expedia based on a normalized FCF multiple. Using Expedia's latest FY21 revenue estimate of $8.8 billion versus its historical FCF margin of 13.3%, Expedia's estimated FY21 FCF is $1.17 billion. I'd shoot to buy the stock at no more than an 9x EV/FY21 FCF multiple, implying a $64 price target and 20% downside from current levels, roughly where Expedia was trading in early May (and considering the fundamental picture hasn't really improved since then, I think a reversion to that price is highly appropriate).Let's now briefly review Expedia's latest quarterly results - which, given the magnitude of the coronavirus impact, can't tell us that much about underlying business trends. Take a look at the bookings trends in the chart below:Figure 1. Expedia 2Q20 bookings trendsSource: Expedia Q2 earnings releaseThis second quarter, covering the period through June, is the first quarter for which we've seen a full three months of coronavirus impact on Expedia, and the result isn't pretty. The company's bookings fell -90% y/y to a history low $2.71 billion, versus a -39% y/y decline for Q1. Because Expedia's revenue is more or less proportional to its bookings (with only the ""take rate"" varying in between the two), total revenue also fell by -82% y/y to just $566 million, falling sharply lower than Wall Street's consensus of $671.7 million (-79% y/y) - it's actually a small wonder that shares of Expedia didn't sink lower than they did, except for the fact that investors have already put Q2 in the past and are only looking at the recovery period ahead.Unfortunately, however, Expedia's latest results give us no greater clarity on when the business will recover. We note particularly weak trends in hotels. Airfare was ""only"" down -35% y/y in the quarter, but down -81% y/y in terms of room nights (whereas last year, growth trends in these two segments moved fairly in-line). At a high level, this makes sense - many of us are still traveling out of necessity, perhaps to visit family or to attend events - but vacation travel and business travel are sharply down, which means hotel demand is significantly lower. Given the fact that the lion's share of Expedia's bookings and revenue come from hotels, there needs to be greater clarity on when hotels recover for Expedia's stock to recover as well. Management spent the Q2 earnings call telling investors not to dissect the Q2 numbers for fear of being meaningless, which I'd tend to agree with. However, Expedia's CEO Peter Kern also commented on his expectation of a non-linear recovery, muddling the picture of Expedia's future. Per his prepared remarks on the earnings call:The company noted that by the time it got to June, bookings were only down by 70% y/y, and that July was also relatively in-line with that - implying some movement away from the nadir of the pandemic impact, but still no line of sight to true normalization.The bottom line here: if Expedia's leadership isn't too optimistic or clearer on the timing of a recovery for Expedia, investors shouldn't get ahead of themselves either. The highlight, however, is that Expedia's focus has turned to its cost reductions, and of the promised $500 million in cost cuts by 2021, the company has achieved a run-rate of $400 million in savings and noted that ""we expect to do much better than our targets.""While there's not much of true value in pulling apart Expedia's latest quarterly update, some key highlights I would summarize for investors are:Investors shouldn't rush into this stock at current levels, seeing as there are few fundamental catalysts that can truly change Expedia's current situation. Watch this one from the sidelines."
4369656,102875,2020-08-19T07:49:27-04:00,"Since Expedia is exposed to things that are outside of its control, we don’t see any catalysts that will help the company to recover to its pre-COVID-19 levels anytime soon.While the cost-cutting program so far has been impressive, the company still estimates that it will burn around $275 million per month in the foreseeable future.Disastrous results in Q2 along with the painful recovery ahead make Expedia’s stock uninvestable at this stage, especially at the current price.","Expedia (EXPE) continues to suffer from the sharp decline in travel, which was caused by the pandemic. Disastrous results in Q2 along with the painful recovery ahead make the stock uninvestable at this stage, especially at the current price. Going forward, COVID-19 will continue to have a negative effect on the company’s business, while Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Airbnb (AIRB) will make it hard for Expedia to thrive in a post-pandemic world, as it did in previous years. Since Expedia is exposed to things that are outside of its control, we don’t see any catalysts that will help the company to recover to its pre-COVID-19 levels in the near-term. While the cost-cutting program so far has been impressive, the company still estimates that it will burn around $275 million per month in the foreseeable future. For that reason, we stick to our opinion that it’s better to avoid Expedia’s stock.Before the pandemic, Expedia has been able to grow its revenues and actively repurchase its shares, while at the same time it was barely making a profit. However, as COVID-19 started to spread around the globe earlier this year, the company’s revenue quickly declined; its business is expected to be unprofitable in the next couple of years and investors should forget about any buybacks happening in the foreseeable future. In order to preserve cash, Expedia’s management recently sold the company’s stake in bodybuilding.com, closed ApartmentJet, and shut down HomeAway by transferring all the traffic from the website to its vacation rental platform VRBO. Despite all of this, a bulk of Expedia’s revenue will continue to come from the hotel industry, which will not recover in the near-term, as borders around the globe are closed, business and travel activities are at all-time lows and the pandemic is far from being over. Considering this, Expedia might be even forced to cut its 15% to 20% commissions, which it charges for bookings and reservations, in order to make its platforms attractive for hotel providers in the current environment.Earlier in August, Expedia reported Q2 earnings results which disappointed lots of investors. Its revenues during the period were $566 million, down 82% year-over-year. Total bookings were also down 90% year-over-year and the business generated a negative free cash flow of -$2.2 billion. The period from April to June was undoubtedly one of the worst in Expedia’s history since the losses in Q1 were not as big in comparison to the latest results.Currently, Expedia’s balance sheet shows that the company has $5.48 billion in cash and investments, while its long-term debt stands at $8.80 billion. While the company is on track to achieve $500 million in savings, it will continue to burn over $200 million per month to stay alive and is likely to raise even more debt along the way, which will only increase its debt burden.In addition to the pandemic, which will keep the demand for travel at distressed levels and hurt Expedia’s bottom line, Google presents an existential threat to the company. With over $100 billion in cash reserves, the company could easily expand its presence in the online travel niche and disrupt the traditional OTA business. In addition to the metasearch business, Google now allows users to directly book hotel rooms on its Google Travel platform, making the use of services like Expedia and Booking (BKNG) less relevant.Airbnb, on the other hand, is a major threat to the growth of Expedia’s vacation rental VRBO service. Unlike its core business, VRBO showed growth in Q2, but currently, it accounts only for ~10% of its revenues and is unable to offset the losses of the overall business. As a major vacation rental platform itself, Airbnb plans to become public this year and the company is currently valued at $18 billion. With an influx of additional capital and an already established foothold in the business, Airbnb has all the chances to accelerate its growth in a post-pandemic world and prevent services like VRBO from expanding further.Considering all of this, Expedia’s recovery will take a long time and it’s unlikely that it will be able to keep its competitive advantages in the future. Also, until COVID-19 is fully contained, travel will not be able to recover to its 2019 levels and Expedia’s bottom line will continue to suffer. Without any catalysts for growth, Expedia has no other choice but to continue to cut down its costs, raise debt, and hope for the travel activity to return to normalcy, which is not happening anytime soon.With negative P/E and EV/EBITDA ratios, Expedia’s stock managed to return to its early March levels, but there’s a limited upside from now on. The company also has one of the worst margins among its peers and Seeking Alpha’s quant rating has a negative stance on Expedia, which makes us stick to our opinion that it’s better to avoid its stock as no shareholder value will be created in the near-term.Source: Capital IQOn September 1, Bears of Wall Street will launch a new Marketplace service: Best Short Ideas.The goal of the service is to provide you with actionable short ideas from which you can profit by betting against the companies that trade at irrational exuberance levels and have limited upside.

4338521,103480,2020-04-20T10:03:14-04:00,"Expedia has climbed more than 30% from multi-year lows in March, with optimism of a coronavirus cure buoying markets.Investors are also cheering the prospects of major markets re-opening. Germany is planning a slow re-opening of its economy, while the U.S. has initiated a state-by-state process to re-opening.Expedia is trading at less than half of its former value, though the company's long-term trajectory remains unchanged. Alongside Booking.com, Expedia exerts tremendous power over the travel industry.Expedia is currently trading at less than ~6x 2019 cash flows, despite typically trading at multiples in the low teens.","Very few investors have wanted to touch travel stocks in the midst of the global coronavirus pandemic. Airlines have seen a near-grounding of virtually all of their routes, sinking their stocks by two-thirds of their prior value. Cruise lines are even harder-hit, as cruise ships were among the first carriers of the virus and public appetite for taking a cruise will likely remain down for years to come.But these travel and transportation companies are very asset-heavy, so it makes sense for investors to punish their debt-laden balance sheets while their operations ground to a halt. Expedia (EXPE), in my view, doesn't deserve the same treatment. To be fair, Expedia isn't exactly in the best of times right now - but when the dust settles, we have to ask ourselves, how permanently damaged will this company be? My take is very little, if at all.Data by YChartsSentiment has been improving as of late. As seen in the chart above, Expedia has climbed up more than 30% from multi-year lows seen in March, when the market (especially travel stocks) hit its nadir. Slow steps toward re-opening major economies such as Germany have rekindled hopes that the impact of the coronavirus, though sharp, will be short. In my view, investors have a well-timed opportunity to buy a heavily profitable business at a still-sweet discount - after all, Expedia still remains well below half of its prior all-time highs, and is down 43% year-to-date (versus just about 12% losses in the S&P 500).Keep on the lookout for an entry point in this stock.Investors need to look beyond the current year for Expedia. Yes, the impact of the coronavirus is going to be bad. In mid-March, around the time when the stock hit its multi-year lows, Expedia (unsurprisingly) put out a press release withdrawing its fiscal 2020 guidance, citing that the revenue impact to Q1 would exceed the $30-$40 million range that Expedia initially expected. For reference, Expedia generates about $12 billion revenue a year (and over $100 billion in gross bookings), so it would be a sheer understatement to say the company's original impact expectation was merely optimistic.Figure 1. Expedia guidance withdrawal Source: Expedia investor relationsWith major economies exploring a near-term re-opening, however, the future and 2021 look much brighter. Carnival's CEO (CCL), in fact, recently put out a statement noting that cruise bookings for 2021 were strong. Will Expedia's power over the industry change dramatically when global travel resumes?Expedia and Booking.com are infamous in the lodging industry for the fees that they charge, charging around a 15-20% commission on bookings made through the platform (actual rates are negotiated by partner, with bigger chains scoring lower rates). And despite hotels' recent efforts to convince their customers to book directly with big ""Lowest Price Guaranteed"" promises, the two big OTAs still remain critical marketing channels for hotel chains.The reason is simple. If I'm planning to travel to, say, Madrid in a particular week, it's cumbersome to search individual hotel chains' websites for availability and room rates when I can compare my full slate of options on Expedia.com. If hotels choose to yank their listings from the OTAs to protect their gross margins, they'll under-expose their assets and run the even larger risk of pushing down occupancy and RevPAR (revenue per available room, one of the most-watched metrics in the lodging industry). And once I've found the hotel I want, while I could always switch over to the hotel's website and book directly, it's both more convenient to book via Expedia thanks to the fact that some of the company's subsidiaries, such as Hotels.com, often offers rebates or percentage discounts. Expedia also offers price matching.So yes, while the coronavirus and shelter-in-place orders will temporarily choke off travel bookings, the real question we have to ask is: will consumers change their booking behavior post-coronavirus? We have no reason to believe that consumers will suddenly change their booking behavior after the pandemic ends and suddenly book directly with hotels. The role of Expedia and Booking.com as highly-compensated middlemen, to the chagrin of hoteliers, is here to stay.To look to Expedia's future, we first look at its very recent past. Prior to the coronavirus hitting, Expedia was growing its business to record heights. Expedia was growing in every segment, in every geography, and across platforms in 2019, as the chart below shows:Figure 2. Expedia FY19 results by segmentSource: Expedia Q4 earnings releaseNow, we know that 2020 will be an outlier; with some industry observers thinking 2020 travel demand will fall by 25%.But even if travel remains slightly depressed in 2021, it's hard to imagine Expedia not returning to levels that are at least close to what we saw in 2019. The real question we should be asking is if Expedia has enough financial resources to survive through the current crisis.Unlike its asset-heavy partners who run the actual planes, hotels, and ships in the travel industry, Expedia as an internet business is unsurprisingly nimble and well-capitalized. The company's most recent balance sheet, shown below, has $4.64 billion of cash and investments on the books, against $4.94 billion in long-term debt, giving the company an approximately cash-neutral position.Figure 3. Expedia balance sheetSource: Expedia Q4 earnings releaseWe recognize as well that Expedia's 10-K notes that the company has a $2 billion line of credit that is ""essentially untapped"", which would raise Expedia's total liquidity (cash plus credit capacity) to roughly $6.6 billion. For reference, Expedia's cash operating expenses in 2019 (operating expenses, less depreciation, amortization, and stock-based comp) was $7.9 billion, but more than two-thirds of that owed to selling and marketing expenses, which are easily expendable in a period when Expedia expects bookings to lag. Expedia's guidance withdrawal update to investors also assured that the company is still planning on executing $300-$500 million of operating cost cuts by year-end, which will make Expedia a leaner and more profitable company even when the coronavirus abates. As such, we find Expedia to be sufficiently well-capitalized to survive even an extended downturn.Again, we turn back to Expedia's strengths in FY19 as a baseline marker for the company's valuation.Figure 4. Expedia FCFSource: Expedia Q4 earnings releaseIn FY19, Expedia generated a staggering $1.61 billion in free cash flow, up 46% y/y and achieving a respectable 13.3% FCF margin, up 360bps from 9.8% in the prior year. The company even managed to hit breakeven cash flows in a typically cash flow negative Q4, even though the prior year had produced -$389 million in cash burn.One way many airline and travel analysts in Wall Street are building forecasts and models is to express 2021 demand as a percentage of 2019. Let's conservatively assume, then, that 2021 travel demand is still down 20% and Expedia suffers the same rate of revenue decline while holding free cash flow margins constant (there's a chance that Expedia's FCF margins will rise thanks to its cost-cutting initiatives, but we'll leave that out for now). That would yield FY21 cash flows of $1.29 billion.At present share prices near $63, Expedia trades at a market cap of $8.85 billion. After netting out the $4.64 billion of cash and $4.94 billion of debt on Expedia's balance sheet, its enterprise value is $9.15 billion. This gives Expedia a bargain-basement multiple of just 7.1x EV/FY21 expected FCF. Still pessimistic on global travel demand? Let's say travel demand remains depressed at a 30% rate through FY21, cutting Expedia's revenue and cash flow by the same percentage relative to FY19. That would give Expedia a valuation of 8.2x EV/FY21 FCF. Each 10% reduction is roughly worth one turn - but no matter how you slice it, Expedia still remains vastly undervalued compared to the rest of the market, especially for a business that is highly likely to return to full productivity - if not by 2021, then at least by 2022. A full return to FY19 free cash flow levels, by the way, puts Expedia's cash flow multiple at an unheard-of 5.7x EV/FY21 FCF, indicating an FCF yield of 18%. Historically, Expedia's stock has traded at a low-teens multiple of FCF, suggesting that it's presently ~40-50% undervalued.I remain confident in Expedia's unchanged, critical role in the travel industry and its ability to return to pre-crisis revenue and cash flows relatively soon. Expedia's ~50% fall from heights creates a great opportunity to buy a strong, well-capitalized company at a steep discount while the rest of the market remains scared of travel stocks."
4356806,75025,2020-07-02T15:02:45-04:00,"Both Booking and Expedia are in the middle of their toughest macro environment yet.Many people have changed or cancelled their holiday plans for 2020.In many cases, people now prefer apartments and small-scale B&Bs in the countryside over large hotels, which helps Airbnb.The first quarter gave a taste of the issues both companies face: both working capital and earnings are hurting.Neither Booking nor Expedia is worth buying but Expedia is surprisingly expensive compared to a reasonable '19 P/E of 15.","The pandemic has been on the minds of investors for four months now and the consensus is that travel-related companies are at particular risk. It's a relatively quiet summer, with much less international tourism. In a similar fashion, stock markets have also been surprisingly quiet with stocks of Booking (BKNG) and Expedia (EXPE) having recovered most of their losses already.YTD stock chart of Expedia and Booking. Source: Seeking Alpha.This recovery happens in their worst year yet, as the companies both communicated that they had more cancellations in March than new bookings. While the outlook isn't much better, it seems that both names have plenty of downside as international travel remains low and Airbnb gains market share.In this article, I will highlight some of the challenges that the companies will face, the slow path to recovery, and the financials of the companies. Overall, it looks like Expedia is most exposed to any downturn due to its low margins. When taking into account the long-term prospects, I find Expedia to be overvalued, while Booking is valued fairly but definitely not worth buying.Travel and international tourism are collapsing. This is unfortunate for Booking and Expedia because both are very exposed to international tourism, in my view, more so than domestic tourism as people who stay in their own country or region have a better idea of where they can find an accommodation and have less need for an online travel agency or OTA.Americans are getting more pessimistic about the pandemic, Gallup finds. This is partially fuelled by social distancing fatigue, shown by the chart below.Source: Gallup June 29 article.The more people go back to their old pre-pandemic behaviour, the easier the virus will spread. Rising infections can still make sense if one-third of the people do not practice social distancing, while the other two-thirds get more concerned about the spread of the virus. The situation in Europe is better for now, but facial mask acceptance in Northern Europe is far lower than it is in the US. In the Netherlands, for example, it is hard to find someone wearing a facial mask, and the same is true for Scandinavian countries, according to this recent WSJ article.As the coronavirus seems to stay with us for a while, half of Germans have decided not to go on a holiday this year and most that do plan to stay close to home. But Germans are not alone in their change of plans. This article by CNBC highlights how US tourism has changed: fewer trips, a shift away from international trips, more driving, and less flying. The type of trips that people take is also different, with probably fewer city trips, which was an important revenue source for Expedia and Booking. A WSJ article shows the impact on New York City's hotels with fewer hotel bookings and lower fees (which also hurts the OTAs).Another big problem could be a new wave of infections in the US that has been widely covered by the media. Recently, municipalities such as San Francisco and states like New Jersey have suspended or postponed reopening steps to name a few. Meanwhile, the American public has also become more reluctant to go on a vacation, or even to a shopping mall, according to survey data shown below.Source: Morning Consult.Expedia and Booking are best known for being convenient websites to book hotels. As a holiday accommodation, hotels are quite crowded and not very virus proof, at least in the minds of most people. Estimates by STR (a data and benchmarking company for the tourism industry) say that US hotel demand is not expected to fully recover until 2023. In addition, revenue per available room is forecasted to be down by over 50% for the year. US hotel demand is for a large part driven by domestic travellers. It is not unreasonable to assume that the numbers will be worse for countries that depend more on international tourism, such as Spain, or the Philippines.Rental apartments, bed & breakfasts, and other smaller accommodations are a relatively small part of the business of Expedia and Booking, but these may seem like safer accommodations in COVID-19 times. These smaller scale accommodations also happen to be the strong suit of a major competitor, Airbnb.For my previous Expedia-Booking article, I gathered website visitor data for both companies and Airbnb. We can now compare this to recent website visitor data to cross check the belief that hotels are losing some popularity compared to apartments.When interpreting the data below, the US visitor statistics are most helpful because it eliminates geographic usage bias. People from some countries may face more travel restrictions than others, which may affect the international portion of users different from US users. It also helps make the comparison cleaner regarding seasonal travel fluctuations for different countries.*Total for websites owned by Booking and Expedia.

Due to its low EBITDA margin, Expedia is more vulnerable to a downturn than Booking. Please have a look at the EBITDA margins below.Source: author's own calculations. The numerator used for the margin is company-reported adjusted EBITDA minus stock-based compensation.Expedia's adjusted EBITDA was negative in Q1 with only one full month of impact from the pandemic. Booking remained positive but also took a nosedive compared to last year. The adjusted EBITDA margin gap between the companies held quite steady at ~18% versus ~20% in Q1 2019. It is also noticeable how the gap increased in the summer peak season. This last part could be related to the fact that Expedia is more direct marketing intensive. For example, in the five years up to 2019, Booking spent $0.36 in direct marketing and selling expenses for every $1 of gross profit gained while Expedia spent $0.52 in direct sales and marketing for the same $1 gross profit gain since 2014. Over that period, the EBITDA margin of Expedia fell from 15.4% to 14.1%, while Booking's remained roughly stable, moving from 38.9% to 38.6%.The advantage for Expedia is that the reliance on direct marketing also cushions the EBITDA hit on the way down. On the other hand, it was less profitable to begin with.The impact on cash flow is relatively worse for Expedia due to its deeply negative working capital stemming from its higher reliance on the merchant booking model. In that model, the OTA collects payment directly from the customer, rather than billing the accommodation owner for services provided. Expedia had a negative operating cash flow of $784m in Q1 versus a negative $380m for Booking. Excluding working capital movements that would be $519m positive for Booking and $37m for Expedia. The small table below shows the differences between Q1 of this year and last year.Source: author's own calculations.Especially, Expedia's $2.8bn difference in working capital expansion/contraction is staggering, considering its market cap of $12bn and that its working capital is still more than $6bn negative on March 31st. Bookings working capital is a negative $1.1bn. To put that into perspective, Booking's cash balance is over $7bn and its market cap is about $68bn.I think it is fair to believe that the companies will face severe revenue hits in 2020. It is equally sensible to expect that Airbnb will take market share from them and that there will be some lasting effects in travel habits that will linger for several years as people try alternatives to the usual city trip or hotel and could like that alternative. The pressure from Airbnb is not only supported by the website visitor data but also by recent news that Airbnb increased its bookings YoY in the second half of May (Bloomberg). Or in the words of Booking Holdings Chief Marketing Officer Arjan Dijk:A mitigating factor for Expedia and Booking will likely be that the tough environment for hotels will stimulate accommodation owners to sign up at an OTA or to increase room availability to OTAs. This will also improve the pricing leverage that Booking and Expedia have over hotel chains. I think that this may help the OTAs to outperform their hotel client base, but the demand drop will hurt nevertheless.The chart below shows the operating profits over the past 11 years for both companies as well as my own estimates for the next 5 years. I tried to be optimistic within the bounds of what is reasonable.Source: author's own calculations. EBIT in the chart excludes goodwill impairments.Clearly, the growth trajectory of both companies is broken and the estimates above don't even take into account very big effects from the pandemic in 2021. Most of the negative forecasts in 2021 are based on the poor economic environment and revenue impact estimates on hotels that were cited earlier in this article.I modelled Expedia and Booking to be back at the 2019 revenue level in 2022, thereafter growing sales towards a level that reflects a 3% CAGR by 2024 since 2019. EBITDA margins are forecasted to recover fully by 2023. Even with those bullish inputs, I see Booking as valued fairly and 40% downside for Expedia in a DCF model when using 7.8% discount rates for both.One of the issues I encounter is that taxes are likely to be raised, which hurts fair value. Regardless of the outcome of the upcoming US presidential election, fighting the economic fallout of COVID-19 has cost governments worldwide a lot of money they didn't have and somebody will have pay back the debt. Raising corporate taxes is a logical step in that respect because many policies were aimed at saving businesses. Booking Holdings itself even profited from a payroll protection programme in the Netherlands.Apart from discounted cash flow model, multiples are always a good tool to sense check valuations. The chart below shows the EV/EBIT valuations of Expedia and Booking over time. A price/earnings chart wouldn't look pretty as Expedia has a negative P/E now. Either way, the chart shows that the valuation for Expedia is perhaps average and that of Booking is not extraordinarily low either.Source: Seeking Alpha.I think the companies share enough similarities to value them at the same P/E multiple. In that case, an earnings multiple of 15 on peak earnings is generous for a high quality low-mid single digit growth business at the start of a recession. Using 2019 EPS, a multiple of 15 implies a fair value of $56.5 for Expedia (35% downside) and $1677 for Booking (1% downside).The market seems to put some faith back into the two hotel-exposed OTAs. Both Expedia and Booking are in the middle of the most challenging environment they have ever faced, yet their valuations are still full at best. It is unlikely that they will completely recover anytime soon and the hits to profitability will most likely cause losses at Expedia, which already faced a low EBITDA margin. A troubling factor is that Airbnb seems to be gaining market share from both.Investors would be wise to take advantage of the sanguine stock market this summer to trim their positions in both Booking and Expedia as neither are worth buying at this point."
4325326,65113,2020-02-19T14:19:19-05:00,"Expedia has come under a lot of pressure as a result of competition from Google.However, I take the view that the long-term outlook for this stock remains solid.Expedia benefits from a strong partner network that is difficult for newer entrants to replicate.","Investment Thesis: While the short-term outlook for Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) could be to the downside, I see this company as thriving in its industry over the longer term.Expedia is a stock that I argued last July to have significant potential upside, should we see significant cost reductions going forward. However, I also cautioned that competition from the likes of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could pose a significant risk.Indeed, the threat of competition has been hitting this company hard - with Expedia having plunged by over 27% in November as a result of growing competition from Google in this space.Source: investing.comWhile the stock has since been seeing somewhat of a recovery, the ongoing coronavirus crisis could see a significant drop in travel demand for this quarter, which would significantly impact Expedia going forward.In this regard, I would like to address 1) the issue of competition with Google and Amazon and whether Expedia can ultimately do so effectively, and 2) Expedia's valuation after the price plunge and whether long-term upside can be justified from here.To the first point, there is little doubt that the dynamics of online travel are changing. No longer do companies such as Expedia and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) have a monopoly on this market, and Google reportedly is continuing to increase search traffic to its own travel businesses - essentially meaning that Google search results for the likes of Expedia and TripAdvisor will appear lower on the list, which is clearly to the detriment of the more traditional players in this space.Indeed, several prominent travel companies (including Expedia) have been lobbying the EU Competition Commissioner to investigate how Google is prioritising its own services in search results at the expense of other companies. While it remains to be seen whether any action will be taken in this regard, the fact that concerns are being raised regarding Google's unfair advantage in this industry merely underscores how swiftly the company is beginning to succeed in this regard.The main issue with travel websites is that customers do not have a particular reason to be loyal to any one provider. Should a customer be planning a trip, they are in large part interested in the best price for the trip they intend to take. Should Google provide such a facility without the customer having to go elsewhere, then this makes offerings from traditional travel websites increasingly redundant. However, this assumes that online search is the only factor that determines success in this industry, which is a short-sighted view.Let's take a look at Expedia's financial performance in the most recent quarter. The figures tell somewhat of a different story to the concerns being raised by the market of late.Source: Expedia Group Fourth Quarter 2019 ResultsWe can see that revenue is up 9% from last year, and room night growth is up by 11%, down slightly from the 13% achieved last year. That said, adjusted EPS saw a modest growth of 2%.However, gross bookings are up by 8% for the full year 2019, and this was in large part driven by growth in Expedia Partner Solutions, which specialises in partnerships with major airline and hotel companies to offer attractive travel deals to customers.This remains an important competitive advantage for Expedia. While Google may be able to outperform the company in terms of search results, Expedia has built up a strong partnership with major companies in the industry that allows it to provide travel deals that would otherwise be unprofitable. It is yet to be seen whether Google can achieve this in the way that Expedia has already done, and online search is by no means the ultimate contributing factor to success in this industry.Addressing my second point, let's take a look at Expedia on an EV/EBITDA basis.Source: ycharts.comWe can see that, on a three-year basis, the stock's EV to EBITDA has continued to descend, while EBITDA itself has continued to rise.In the short term, the stock may struggle to make further gains as a result of the coronavirus. Indeed, Expedia is now suspending its 2020 forecast based on the uncertainty surrounding this event.That said, should the travel industry see a drop in demand more generally for the next quarter, then this will also impact companies such as Google. Therefore, my view is that, while the stock could come under pressure in the next few months, Expedia remains a solid business.The market is concerned about this stock at the moment, given that Google is outcompeting Expedia in terms of online search and, therefore, is probably not a buy at this time. However, Expedia has built up a significant network with major airlines and hotels, which has allowed it to thrive. It is not a given that Google will be able to ultimately compete on price in this regard, and for this reason, I remain optimistic on Expedia and foresee that the long-term prospects for this company remain solid."
4329818,22717,2020-03-05T07:57:05-05:00,"Expedia is on an accelerated buyback program, buying up to 29 million of its shares, or 20.7% or so of its total 140 million outstanding.I estimate the company's value is at least $115.22, an upside of 22%. On the upside, it could be worth as much $130.52, or 38%, higher.All of this is fueled by its huge free cash flow. The company's recent restructuring, losing 3,000 workers, will help towards the growth in free cash flow.This an update of my previous article three months arguing that the stock is severely undervalued.","I argued in my article on December 3, 2019, that Expedia (EXPE) stock is very undervalued. The company had just fired its CEO and CFO and announced a new 20 million share buyback program. I believe that EXPE stock is now worth between $115.22 and $134.50 per share, or an upside of 22.4-38.4%. This article updates my previous analysis.This was on top of the 9 million share buyback program. Keep in mind that this is one of the few stocks that actually targets the number of shares to be repurchased. As a result, we can monitor the buybacks carefully.At the end of Q3 2019, there were 145.5 million shares outstanding. On balance sheet date of 12/31/19, there were 142.999 million shares outstanding. On the filing date of 2/13/20, there were 139.989 million shares outstanding.(Source: Hake calculations)So, in the space of fewer than 3 months, Expedia has bought back 5.5 million shares, or 3.8% of its shares outstanding.The company is well on its way to completing the buyback program. In fact, at this rate of roughly 5.5-6 million shares over 3 months, the 29 million shares program could be completed in around 4 more quarters.You can see in the chart I put together below that Expedia has been accelerating its buybacks in the past year.(Source: Hake, using Seeking Alpha data)This shows that the company has bought back almost 8% of its shares in the past three years. But most of that was in the past year.In fact, you can see this in the chart below:(Source: Hake, using Seeking Alpha data)And why shouldn't it do so? EXPE generates sufficient free cash flow to pay for these buybacks. You can see this in the table below, which shows a rolling last 12 months (""LTM"") measure of FCF and buybacks:(Source: Hake)So, on average, about 52% of the FCF generated on an LTM basis is used for buybacks. And there is plenty of FCF to pay both the dividends and the buybacks. You can see this in the table below:(Source: Hake)This shows that in each year, there is enough FCF to pay for both the dividends and the buybacks.Do I even need to say any more? This is a very interesting value play. Yes, the coronavirus will lower the company's FCF. But will the dampening effect of the epidemic really last the whole year? I doubt it. There is plenty of room in the company's FCF cash flow to pay for the buybacks and dividends.For example, let's say there is a 10% hit to FCF for the year 2020. That would put FCF at $1,446 million for the year. Let's say buybacks continue at $350 million or so per quarter. That would cost $1,400 million. The dividends would cost $200 million or so.So, Expedia would have an FCF deficit of just $150 million or so. But would that matter? The company has $3.84 billion in cash and securities on its balance sheet.Using the same model as in my previous article, I estimate that the stock is worth between $115.22 and $134.50 per share, or an upside of 22.4-38.4%. You can see this in the table below:(Source: Hake)The way to understand this is as follows: In the first column, it assumes that 50% of the 29 million in buybacks are completed. That would bring the shares outstanding to 125.5 million.The expected dividends of $208.8 million include a 4.4% dividend rate increase. This is the average of the dividend increase per year for the past three years.So, taking $208.8 million and dividing it by 125.5 million shares results in a $1.66 dividend per share annually. Then, dividing $1.66 by 1.44% results in a stock price of $115.42 per share. This represents upside of 22.4%.Now this figure assumes that 29 million shares are bought back and 50% are completed within one year or so. That seems doable, since, as I have shown above, the company has already bought back almost 6 million shares in the past six months. Half of 29 million shares is 14.5 million. That implies that it might reach the stock valuation after one year. And if the whole 29 million shares are bought back, it might take more than two years.One risk with this valuation analysis is whether the dividend yield stays at the present level of 1.44%. If the yield rises, the valuation will be lower. But I don't believe this will happen. You can see why in the chart below:(Source: Hake, using Seeking Alpha data)This shows that the median dividend yield in the past 9 years is well below the present average yield for 2020 of 1.21%. But the yield today is even higher at 1.44%.So, if you believe in the reversion to the mean, the likely result is that EXPE stock will move to a lower yield. That is good, since it increases the probability of the valuation I estimated above coming true.Expedia stock is very undervalued. I estimate that it has a total yield of 13.3%:(Source: Hake estimates)The 1.44% dividend yield plus the buyback yield of 11.85% brings about a 13.3% total yield. Based on my estimates, the stock is worth between $115.42 per share and $134.50 per share over the next two years. The large share buybacks, fueled by the company's ample free cash flow, will push the stock to those target levels.If you liked this article, hit the ""Follow"" button at the top of the article, and also the pop-up real-time alert for my articles.

4314617,102107,2020-01-03T07:00:00-05:00,"We conclude our year-end Roundtable series with a two-part look at value investing in the year to come.Our panel shares where they are focused - free cash flow and under-favored sectors, for example, and what they are discarding.They also share a wide variety of top picks, showing the many ways one can define a value investing play.","2019 finishes with an extra kick for investors. Part of that is the continued strong run of the market, erasing memories of last year's near bear market and extending the decade-long bull. There also are plenty of market headlines and events that have sprung over the end of the year, from Phase 1 trade deals to M&A to political whirlwinds and more.More trivially, the 2010s are ending and the 2020s begin. It's been quite a decade for equity investors, with the S&P 500 returning more than 250% in that time. Even underperformance could leave a portfolio in good shape, and any alpha that was found would really leave investors well off.Where does that leave investors and the markets for 2020, at the start of a new decade? That's what we try to answer in our annual Marketplace Roundtable series. We are publishing roundtable discussions featuring more than 80 authors from across the spectrum of investing styles and focuses you find on Seeking Alpha: Macro to value investing, small cap to energy, gold to quant and alternative strategies, and more.Today's discussion is the first part of a two-part focus on value investing, our most popular category for this year-end series, perhaps due to the wide definition the style can cover. We're featuring the following panel:Bill Zettler: The economy continues to grow modestly, unless there's a war in the Middle East or Korea.Howard Jay Klein: I remain bullish. The GDP growth is not overheated, jobs growth is strong, consumer spending is not wildly draining savings, home equity loans are tracking fairly constant. Overall, I think the economy will turn in a reasonably stable performance in 2020.Mark Hake, CFA: Corporate profits are growing nicely, inflation is low, interest rates are low, and most importantly, cash flow is increasing in most major companies. This is a formula for an even higher stock market index price. That also could mean that the market becomes a bit overvalued, but that's not unprecedented.Grant Gigliotti: I look at total market cap to GDP to see how overpriced the market is, and if there's quick movement downward, I will likely exit investments that I'm less confident about. Currently, total market cap to GDP is around 147%, which indicates that the market is significantly overpriced.Mark Bern, CFA: Neutral for 6-12 months until we see how the trade deal with China turns out. Bearish for the intermediate term of 13-36 months, but bullish beyond that for the longer term.Value Digger: This time is not different. Most sectors are very expensive, and perception will catch up with reality sooner or later, as always.Chris Lau: As a value investor, I get it. FOMO, or fear of missing out, is a sentiment we are used to feeling. And right now, the relentless market rise is rewarding everyone who is bullish. Yet, the tide will eventually turn, and markets sell stocks. Stay disciplined and true to buying stocks at a discount and selling them when they reach full value.David Krejca: Over the last two years, I have honestly not paid close attention to the broader indices, but I noticed that many companies' earnings have slightly decelerated. However, I have no idea how this can evolve in the future - earnings trends and share prices can be disconnected for a long time. Nevertheless, equities as an asset class became quite expensive in relative comparison with commodities, so I wonder whether there will be some kind of pivot.Dining Stocks Online: We don't see much concern out there as evidenced by low volatility and mostly bullish market outlooks for 2020 (mid to high single-digit gains) by most market strategists. We see political risks depending on who the 2020 nominees are and what the polling looks like in the first half of next year, but at this stage, there's little reason to think the fundamentals are set to change soon.J Mintzmyer: I've been skeptical about broad market valuations for the last few years, but if we peel back the highest performing 20-30 names, most of the core valuations aren't very high compared to historical levels, especially when considering the interest rates are low and globally likely going lower. Furthermore, there was a report issued by Barron's in October (""Big Money Poll"") which logged the lowest percentage of bulls (27% overall) in more than 20 years. Major stock market collapses almost never happen when everyone says ""there's about to be a crash,"" so this was an incredibly bullish headline to me.Bill Zettler: Be patient.Howard Jay Klein: Headline events seem to trigger more knee-jerk reactions in the market than they seemed to produce in past years. The massive expansion of media is both a blessing and a curse to stock market valuations based on fundamentals.Mark Hake, CFA: Stocks that bought back their shares on a consistent basis tend to do quite well, as opposed to those that try to time the market.Grant Gigliotti: Tariffs, combined with an irrational and unpredictable president, can cause all kinds of instability in the stock market and individual stocks. It also can provide opportunities for value investors to acquire mispriced stocks.Mark Bern, CFA: High-frequency trading and corporate buybacks have ruled the market. Headlines have driven market action in 2019 more than fundamentals to an extent I have not seen before for such an extended period.Chris Lau: Betting that the Fed would not raise interest rates and, in fact, cut it paid off. DIY Value Investors learned that the market will reward investors for betting that a sector will outperform and will provide a positive return. Dividend-growth income stocks did well. Sure, technology stocks did better, but some investors preparing for retirement prefer steady dividend income.David Krejca: Know the difference between ""money"" and ""currency"" and be aware of what it means and how it feels in context of investing and trading. Also, recognize and differentiate between a speculation (successful) and an investment, the latter usually requires more work, whereas the first luck.Dining Stocks Online: Even more than 10 years into an economic cycle, with negative to flat earnings growth, valuation multiples for equities can still expand when investors have minimal better options.J Mintzmyer: Don't over-complicate a thesis. I made a lot of money in 2019 with shipping stocks (my two model portfolios are up an average of 61% YTD), but where I did the best was with super simple plays: Good management, good balance sheets, and good market exposure. The most complex stuff I picked, which required multiple catalysts to occur, all lagged considerably.Bill Zettler: NoHoward Jay Klein: Value is constantly held hostage by overreaction to headlines, as noted before.Mark Hake, CFA: Value stocks, especially with catalysts like large buyback programs, will always do well over time. I'm not so much concerned about short-term fluctuations.Grant Gigliotti: In my mind, value investing is not a fad that goes out of style or makes a comeback. It will always be a wise choice to buy quality products that are selling at a discount. In the same way, it will always be wise to buy quality stocks selling at bargain prices.Mark Bern, CFA: We focus on free cash flow generation and the long-term prospects for growth on individual stocks, so overall market trends are less relevant to our strategy. We do monitor major macro indicators, trends and events to keep from being on the wrong side of a major move. Significant potential events such as the US-China trade negotiations, Brexit and impeachment are on our radar and keeping us cautious until resolved one way or the other.Value Digger: We would call it ""selective rotation."" Some investors dump their grossly overvalued names in this expensive stock market to lock in profits and buy selectively some overlooked and grossly undervalued companies, primarily small caps and micro caps. We expect this to continue in 2020, and we do have in our list obscure, grossly undervalued companies that have strong catalysts ahead.Chris Lau: Markets recognized value in the sectors the DIY Marketplace service specializes in: Biotechnology. Year to date, biotech only broke even after the monster comeback in September and October. Regeneron (REGN) and Bausch Health (BHC) did well, as did AbbVie (ABBV). Ignore trends and momentum: Pick undervalued stocks and markets will eventually reward you for waiting.David Krejca: I believe value provides one with a certain degree of safety, although growth is a lot more seductive.Dining Stocks Online: Stocks will still move on individual fundamentals, but as value-oriented investors, we are glad to see that some of the money-losing growth stocks are stagnating or even falling materially. When those areas are red hot, value will be ignored. When they begin to fade, we think investors will look more broadly for market opportunities outside of the flashy, momentum-based names.J Mintzmyer: 2019 has been incredibly profitable despite still almost fully allocated to value names because we had the benefit of being in the right sector (shipping) at nearly the perfect time. If you can find expert sector coverage and make wise risk-adjusted allocations, it doesn't matter how ""value"" is performing against ""growth."" That's really more of an issue for someone who's simply buying an ETF or two. Yes, the past decade has been brutal for ""value,"" but there have been dozens, if not hundreds, of massive value winners during this time.Bill Zettler: Selling calls.Howard Jay Klein: I'm not a fan of hedging as I believe the skill set and resources required to make smart hedging positions are not readily available to the mass of investors. It's fine for institutions.Mark Hake, CFA: Not very interested in that. I recommend sticking with long-term investments and average cost investing when they fall below your original investment cost.Grant Gigliotti: Benjamin Graham said something along the lines of diversifying among good investments can provide protection, but diversifying among so-so investments can add more risk to your portfolio. I believe in buying good companies at bargain prices. I thoroughly review the companies that I invest in. This is how I hedge my risk, by buying more than one quality company that I'm confident about. If you're spreading your money into multiple investments just for the sake of diversifying or hedging your risk, but you don't understand these investments and aren't confident about them, then you are actually increasing your risk.Mark Bern, CFA: We offer subscribers some potential short candidates to consider, and I personally like using out-of-the-money put options to hedge risk when the market is facing potentially higher volatility. We look for companies that, because of negative free cash flows and high debt, are likely to come under stress (usually due to overpaying for acquisitions) and for cyclical companies that tend to fall faster than the overall market during periods of economic contraction.Value Digger: Hedging is a key success factor in the stock market. This is why we have been providing our subscribers with long ideas and short ideas from a wide variety of sectors (i.e. healthcare, technology, industrial, mining, energy, consumer goods).Chris Lau: DIY Value Investing is long-only and does not hedge. I show my subscribers that holding cash is the easiest, least expensive way to hedge. Raise cash and hold bond ETFs and then wait for opportunities when risks rise. Then, buy more stocks and average down when appropriate.David Krejca: Do not depend on a single company, build a portfolio so that idiosyncratic risks reduce the overall risk exposureDining Stocks Online: Each investor's portfolio should be constructed based on their return goals and stomach for volatility. If that's the case, there's no need for hedging. If it's not, we would prefer to change the portfolio construction rather than panic and hedge just to feel more comfortable.J Mintzmyer: I personally don't do a lot of ""active"" hedging, but I play a good amount of portfolio defense by limiting my allocation to speculative investments to around 30% of my net assets, keeping significant dry powder available, and using margin judiciously. When markets are crashing (Q4-2018 comes to mind), my speculative names are painful, but if I picked good names to begin with, those values will rebound (as they did for 90-95% of my names in 2019), then it's a matter of cutting out the losers and mistakes and moving on.Bill Zettler: Free cash flow.Howard Jay Klein: EV/EBITDA: In my sector, it's the closest to a golden metric that reveals true value.Mark Hake, CFA: I always look to see if the company has a history of generating free cash flow, pays a dividend, and buys back its own shares. In addition, if the company has net cash on its balance sheet or at least only a small amount of net debt in relation to its cash flow, that's also attractive. I turn away from companies with the opposite of these metrics.Grant Gigliotti: I want to see that the company has been around for at least 10 years and has had at least five years of consistent and upward growth in earnings.Mark Bern, CFA: One factor that's a must is consistently strong free cash flow generation with a high return on free cash flow invested capital. The major factors that turn us away include negative free cash flow combined with excessive goodwill and debt.Value Digger: Actually, our checklist is long, and a company has to tick all the boxes before we buy it. One factor is never enough. But since we have to start with one factor, we will look for the cash flow report. We want the company to have positive operating cash flow and free cash flow or to be close to generating positive OCF and FCF when it comes to our bullish ideas. High leverage and/or hype will always turn us away when we are looking for bullish ideas. But high leverage and/or hype will always attract our interest when we are looking for bearish ideas, so we will continue our due diligence because this highly leveraged or overhyped company could be an excellent short candidate.Chris Lau: Look at how management treats its investors. If insiders are both buying company stock and maximizing shareholder returns whenever possible, then consider investing in them. Empty promises from CEOs are one factor DIY value investors should watch out for. Avoid those stocks.David Krejca: Valuation - how much does the company trade with respect to its future expected cash flow, historical fundamental multiples and peers?Dining Stocks Online: Capital allocation. First, you have to earn free cash flow, then you need to spend it wisely. Companies that create shareholder value consistently tend to excel at capital allocation, or at least avoid material mistakes.J Mintzmyer: I always look to a management's capital allocation priorities, history of performance in their segment/niche, and overall accessibility. Are these teams growing to grow, or are they focused on maximizing per-share valuations? Are they generally the sharpest pencils or the dimmest light bulbs? Are there any related-party conflicts or weird compensation structures to worry about? Is management accessible and transparent or do they hide behind weak IR or multiple layers of bureaucracy? Those questions need to be addressed before moving forward into further layers of coverage.Mark Hake, CFA: I have made some adjustments to my measurement of free cash flow. Some companies are not using ""adjusted FCF"" by also deducting required pension or lease obligations from FCF (i.e. operating cash flow less capex). Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is doing this. I'm also using TTM FCF much more, on a quarterly basis, to project out future increases in FCF. Lastly, I'm more and more focused only on companies that have large buyback programs (net of employee share issuance) in relation to their market value. These stocks tend to do well over time.Grant Gigliotti: Since I feel that the market is significantly overpriced, I have added a step of seeing how the stock has typically performed during times of recession. I also think about whether customers will continue buying the same amount or more of this company's product or service during times of recession. Because a significant market correction is inevitable, I'm trying to only buy the companies that have a better likelihood of performing well during market recessions and downturns.Mark Bern, CFA: Not really. We continue to look for consistently superior execution by quality management of companies that have strong, sustainable business models.Chris Lau: The DIY Value Investing service proactively encouraged members to submit their stock ideas and then I would research them. Some of the very best picks came from DIYers. Okta (OKTA), Zuora (ZUO), and XBiotech (XBIT) are a few examples of stocks that benefited the other subscribers.David Krejca: Think of investments more from sustainability, longevity, accounting and tax perspectives.Dining Stocks Online: As computers take over more of the daily trading volume, we are seeing ever widening gaps between fundamental valuation analysis and daily stock price quotations. Markets are in a way becoming more inefficient due to algorithms because they tend to consider factors that are irrelevant to the present value of future cash flows (the heart of stock prices). As such, we are quicker to see near fair value than in prior years. If something gets to within 10% of our fair value estimate, and we don't see the security as a long-term buy and hold situation, we strongly consider selling and not holding out for that last 10%.J Mintzmyer: As I mentioned in the broad overview, my biggest lesson learned in 2019 is that the investment thesis has to be very simple, and the catalysts have to be smooth. The complex theses with multiple potential points of failure have rarely worked out for me, but most of my sector coverage has done exceptionally well. It really is that simple, and yes, I'm disappointed it took me over a decade of active investing and trading to come to this conclusion!I used to give myself about one or perhaps two minutes to explain an investment thesis to others to determine if it was a good idea or not. If I can't explain the idea or company in 20-30 seconds, the stock isn't making my cut for 2020. It doesn't mean the research behind the idea is basic, but the actual core idea has to be very straightforward.Bill Zettler: Oil.Howard Jay Klein: Three areas: Mergers and consolidation in US gaming, recovery in Asia gaming, and sports betting pure plays emerging.Mark Hake, CFA: I'm more focused on total yield growth stocks than ever before (i.e., those that have growth in both their dividends and buybacks as a percent of the market value). Interestingly, I have found that those companies that specify the number of shares they are going to repurchase, rather than a dollar amount, over a specified period of time (and thus are really tied into a commitment) tend to have stock price rises over time, despite short-term fluctuations in their underlying financials.Grant Gigliotti: I will continue to be focused on value investing - buying good companies at bargain prices.Mark Bern, CFA: We will look for undervalued companies with strong potential revenue and cash flow growth well into the future. Those are the factors that generally lead to an expanding bottom line and the stock price eventually follows earnings.Value Digger: We focus on a bunch of things in this very expensive stock market. For instance, we focus on the U.S.-China trade war, the political uncertainty in the U.S. due to the upcoming elections, Brexit, updates from U.S.-Iran, marijuana developments, etc. We have experienced 100% success with our bearish ideas since December 2015 when we launched our value research, and we want this success to continue with excellent short ideas in 2020 too.Chris Lau: In 2020, the service will provide more repeat coverage on core top DIY stock idea holdings. Just because the stock keeps going up, it does not imply that detailed coverage should be put on pause. For example, BP plc (BP) is a long-time dividend income play. And with energy out of favor for so long, it's time for this sector to sustain a rebound this time.Dining Stocks Online: Finding values in the marketplace, as always!J Mintzmyer: My research platform, Value Investor's Edge, is focused on the shipping sector and that is my ""lane."" One of the biggest previous lessons I've learned (thankfully early) is that I absolutely have to stay in my lane, especially if I'm writing reports. However, what we do is hire consultants or partner with others who are experts in other areas. I'm very bullish on shipping still, but as of mid-December, my model portfolios are up an average of 61%.I believe selective energy plays have similar, or perhaps even greater, return potential for 2020, but I'm not the expert in energy. Therefore, I'm working closely with Michael Boyd, of Energy Income Authority, to determine which of these companies are worth allocating speculative funds into.Bill Zettler: Oil will go up as OPEC cuts and shale capex shrinks.Howard Jay Klein: Consolidation in the US gaming space will create multiple opportunities for investors.Mark Hake, CFA: My favorite idea is Expedia (EXPE). Barry Diller has retaken the reins of the company and ousted the non-performing CEO and CFO. Moreover, EXPE announced a 20 million share repurchase program on top of their existing 9 million share buyback program. This represents 20-22% of the stock's market value, depending on how fast the stock rises. In addition, Barry Diller is also committing to buy more shares for his own account, even though he controls 49% of the voting power of the company. This will have a secondary effect of reducing float just like a buyback. The company consistently makes $1.1 billion to over $1.4 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow. The dividend (yield is 1.3%) costs $200 million. So, EXPE could afford to do the whole 29 million shares, which would cost $3.67 billion or more in 2.5 to 3 years, since it would have $1.2 billion excess FCF to spend on buybacks. That gives the stock a total yield of over 12% (dividend yield plus buyback yield) annually. The buybacks alone will push the stock higher just from the buying pressure and the reduced float.Grant Gigliotti: I've been strong on Big Lots (BIG) and buying around $20, when possible. I've felt that it's very undervalued and see the real valuation of around $30-plus. The market is beginning to realize it, and the stock is starting to climb.Mark Bern, CFA: We are being cautious at Friedrich Global Research and focusing on companies that are less dependent upon the global market growth. Ryman Hospitality (RHP) is a recent addition based upon strong free cash flow, falling future capital expenditures, and expected revenue growth. A nice, 4% rising dividend doesn't hurt, either.Value Digger: My favorite idea for 2020 is bearish. I'm very bearish on CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) at the current price of $50 per share. CRWD is massively overvalued at $50 per share due to a combination of company-specific and sector-specific reasons. You will find more key information about this bearish call in my article that's expected to be out by the end of 2019.Chris Lau: The election year will not bring more volatility and uncertainty as markets expect. The US-China relations will not change, either. So, avoid macro investing and hone in on strong segments of the market.David Krejca: Delek Drilling (OTC:DKDRF) - energy oil and gas company - developing a major natural gas field reservoir in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The company has built critical infrastructure and intends to start commissioning first gas. There are great differences between the prices of natural gas in Europe, the U.S. and Asia, so the only question that remains is the pricing.Dining Stocks Online: We really like Jack in the Box (JACK) as a value-based restaurant play in 2020. The stock is sitting near its lows, but a strong buyback is in place, and management is focused on growing traffic and new units after spending years trying to grow Qdoba (now sold) and running a distracting strategic review process. We see free cash flow per share surging over the next 1-3 years, and the stock trades for less than 10 times our estimate of free cash flow a few years out. Other franchised businesses trade for 2x-3x that valuation.J Mintzmyer: One of my favorite ideas for 2020 is an extension of one of my favorite ideas in 2019, which has been wildly profitable, nearly a three bagger: Dorian LPG (LPG). The lowest hanging fruit has been obviously plucked, but the rates are still enormous, and the stock still trades below its net asset value (""NAV""). Most importantly, the VLGC trade routes are growing between the US and Asia, and the recent US-China Trade Deal should be very beneficial to further shipping demand growth. They don't pay a dividend yet, but once they've fully stabilized the balance sheet, I expect we'll see impressive returns, which should drive further valuation premiums. I don't expect a repeat of the 2019 performance (nearly 3x!), but this one is very simple and clear to follow.***Thanks to our panel for sharing their views on the state of value heading into 2020.

4327692,104952,2020-02-27T09:20:56-05:00,"Booking (BKNG) and Expedia (EXPE) remain the only two OTA players with the scale and capacity to get the most out of the $1.9 trillion global travel market opportunity.
        The change of leadership to Barry Diller following the $634 million buyback is positive news. Diller knows the company inside and out, having spent 20+ years as Expedia Chairman.
        Expedia will undergo operational efficiency improvements under the new leadership to achieve a $300 million to $500 million incremental cost savings.
        Integration of brands and shift from SEM to direct traffic marketing as the company reduces its dependency on Google will also drive margin expansion and double-digit growth in EBITDA.
        The recent short-term pressures due to management shakeup, SEO disruption, political turbulence in HK, and Coronavirus have created an excellent entry point.","Expedia Group (EXPE) is an online travel services provider that controls various bookings and travel metasearch websites such as Orbitz, Expedia.com, Trivago, Vrbo, and Hotels.com. Founded in 1996, the company was fully acquired by IAC in 2003 before being spun off in 2005. Throughout the 20+ years under IAC’s control and Dara Khosrowshahi’s management, Expedia has emerged as one of the largest players in the global online travel agent (OTA) market. Gross bookings more than quadrupled and pre-tax earnings more than doubled. However, since Khosrowshahi left for Uber in August 2017 to be replaced by Mark Okerstrom, margins and growth have been stagnant while the stock has not been able to recover to its all-time high of $159 in July 2017. Very recently, Google SEO disruption, management shakeup that resulted in CEO Mark Okerstrom and CFO Alan Pickerill leaving the company, turbulence in Hong Kong, and Coronavirus has put the stock under further pressure. However, we believe these issues to be temporary and therefore create an excellent entry point, given the growing $1.9 trillion global travel market opportunity and a major operational efficiency plan under a new and promising leadership. Under Barry Diller, who has experience being the chairman of Expedia for over 20 years, the company expects to achieve $300 million to $500 million incremental cost savings and a double-digit EBITDA growth. Integration of brands and shift from low margin online search to direct traffic marketing as the company increases focus on better customer experience will also drive margin expansions.Global travel is a $1.9 trillion market that ranges from airlines, alternative accommodations, hotels, cruises, to car rentals. As online booking exponentially rose in trends, Expedia Group and Priceline Group (which later renamed itself to Booking Holdings), have grown to become giants of the industry over the last two decades. Both companies record a combined ~$200 billion of gross bookings (~10% of the market) and keep an almost equal market share. Expedia is slightly ahead in terms of gross bookings, while Booking Holdings (BKNG) has a slightly higher revenue. Given the strong balance sheet and global brand power, we believe that Expedia and Bookings are the only companies in the world with the best position to expand its presence across geographies through either brand extensions or acquisitions. Founded as an OTA (Online Travel Agent) that makes money through booking commissions, both companies have also acquired other travel companies with varying business models. Both companies use Agency and Merchant business models. Expedia generates more than 50% of its booking commission revenue through the Merchant model, while Booking does the same but through the Agency model. Through KAYAK and Trivago, Booking and Expedia also make money through Advertising business model. Both companies’ brands have a strong global presence. As of 2019, international revenue made up ~89% of Booking Holding’s revenue. Expedia’s international revenue, on the other hand, was just under half of its total revenue.(source: Google/Temasek report)Given the already dominant presence in most major markets such as the US and Europe, Southeast Asia/SEA will serve as the next frontier for both companies. The market is attractive due to its massive growth and untapped consumer potential. Based on the research done by Google and Temasek, online travel is the only market in SEA that can maintain a stable 15% CAGR for 10 years. In 2025, the market will represent a $78 billion opportunity. In our view, Expedia has a more relevant growth strategy and business model expertise (Merchant model) than Booking in the SEA market. Booking’s growth strategy in SEA includes its acquisition of Agoda in 2007, while Expedia’s includes a Joint Venture (JV) with Air Asia in 2011 and a $350 million minority investment in Traveloka in Southeast Asia in 2017. Expedia’s strategy appears more conservative, though we think it is a smarter move. SEA consumers are hard to serve primarily due to things like low credit card penetration and extreme preference towards low prices. As such, any OTA players in the region accept alternative payment methods such as bank electronic transfers or increasingly popular mobile payment apps that regularly provide cashbacks and promotions. As of today, the majority of ~655 million SEA consumers still do not use credit cards. Booking’s Agoda, however, only accepts credit card payments. Expedia’s Traveloka, on the other hand, provides various alternative local-friendly payment methods given its focus on Indonesia, where the majority of SEA underserved travelers are based in. Accepting alternative payment methods requires an additional layer of cost management and operational complexity due to potential fraud, refunds, or chargebacks from customers, which is what Merchant model sets out to do. Therefore, aside from Agoda's weaker positioning, we consider Expedia’s stronger experience in the Merchant model than Booking as an advantage in the region.Since early November 2019, the stock has been under short-term pressures due to Google SEO traffic disruption, below-par performance leading to management shakeup, turbulence in Hong Kong, and also coronavirus in China. The stock even plummeted 42% to reach its lowest point in over three years and trade at ~8 times EV/EBITDA after a downgrade by Mizuho on Google SEO traffic disruption. With Google placing its new travel planning feature around the top of the search results page, Expedia’s organic links that essentially allow free traffic generations were pushed further down and received fewer views and clicks. As a result, the business will have to incur additional marketing expenses to maintain its traffic by purchasing more keyword advertising links at the top of the search results page. In less than a month later, the company saw a management shakeup that resulted in CEO Mark Okerstrom and CFO Alan Pickerill leaving the company. Based on the most recent conference call, the company will also expect $30 million to $40 million negative impact on its adjusted EBITDA due to coronavirus in Q1. Furthermore, coronavirus will likely impact the business beyond Q1 and possibly 2020. The stock slightly recovered in February 2020, though still down by ~14% from its highest point in November 2019. We believe much of that was due to the repurchase of 5.8 million shares buyback in addition to the authorization of a new 20 million shares buyback program announced by Chairman Barry Diller following a management shakeup.However, we do not think the market is fully pricing in Expedia’s operational efficiency potential under the new leadership among the other catalysts outside of the share buyback events at this point. To put it in perspective, the post-buyback market cap of ~$16.3 billion - $16.9 billion is approximately ~$700 million higher than the December 2019 level of ~$15.6 billion. Given the magnitude of the recovery, we believe the market is only pricing in the $634 million share repurchases since December 2019 and the 20 million buyback program announced in February 2020.There are two main catalysts driving our bullish view on the stock. The first one is the major operational efficiency plan that targets a $300 million to $500 million cost savings as well as a double-digit EBITDA growth. The plan includes integration of common functions or operations that allows cost-sharing opportunities across brands, cloud spending optimization, and a shift away from search to direct channel as the main traffic source.  In particular, we view Expedia’s plan to focus on the direct channel as a critical driver for margin expansion that leads to EBITDA growth. Due to Google pushing its travel listing feature into the search results page in recent times, Expedia’s top-ranked organic links that essentially generate free traffic are pushed down the page further. As a result, Expedia will now need to spend more marketing dollars on advertising links to replace its top-ranked organic links to maintain the same level of views and conversions. The shift to the direct channel allows Expedia to not only avoid additional search engine marketing (SEM) spending, but also eventually reduces its dependency on the search channel.(source: google.com)(source: google.com)There is also a growingly popular view that Google will launch its travel products to compete with Expedia or Booking. We think it is unlikely to happen given its counterproductive effect on Google’s main advertising business in the long run. As of today, all online travel players are among the top advertisers on Google. Besides, Expedia’s mobile app downloads that still grows 40% YoY despite having reached ~400 million shows that the company's brand awareness is strong enough to make the major shift into direct channel.(Traffic generation channels for EXPE vs BKNG. Source: author’s compilation using similarweb’s data)In the medium term, we predict that as Expedia shifts its focus away from SEM to direct customer experience that drives brand awareness and eventually repeat bookings, its traffic generation mix will be more dominated by the direct channel as in the case for Booking.(EBIT margin, EXPE vs BKNG, trailing annual. Source: stockrow)While search channel is still largely important, Booking’s overall direct-dominated traffic mix allows the company to spend less than Expedia on marketing spending, which expands its operating margin over time. Booking’s superior profitability outlook serves as a target model for Expedia as its margin expansion benchmark. Given the historical 900 bps - 2,700 bps operating margin gap, we believe that this is an area with the best improvement upside at Expedia.The second key catalyst we see is the fact that its Chairman for over 20 years, Barry Diller, will be overseeing the day-to-day operations. Diller’s experience as the largest shareholder and chairman of Expedia in most of its lifetime is unparalleled. In critical times such as the management shakeup, we think that Diller’s experience and decisiveness really shows. When Khosrowshahi left, Diller replaced him with Okerstrom almost instantly. However, under Okerstrom’s time as CEO, Expedia’s growth and margin expansions have been stagnant, with the company missing revenue estimates almost every quarter. We believe that such a past experience influenced Diller’s recent decision to not rush the CEO search as we learned in the most recent earnings call:We believe that Diller’s decision underlines the company’s priority to simplify its large and complex structure due to a decade of acquisitions under one CEO before onboarding a new one. While there lies some uncertainty on how well Diller can translate his operational efficiency plan into results, the company’s exceptionally deep executive leadership team reduces execution risk to a large extent.(EV/EBITDA comparison - Expedia, Trip, TripAdvisor, Booking. Source: stockrow)Players like TripAdvisor (TRIP), MakeMyTrip (MMYT), and Trip International (TCOM) make up the online global travel space along with the two giants, Expedia and Booking. Expedia trades at a less premium multiple to Booking, which is more profitable due to its Agency-dominated revenue mix. As we have discussed, Expedia’s Merchant-dominated business model means the company needs to add an additional layer of operational complexity that puts more pressure on its operating margin.(EBITDA margin comparison - Expedia, Booking, Trip, TripAdvisor, MakeMyTrip. source: stockrow)However, in the cohort of OTA players that includes MakeMyTrip (India-focused), Booking, Trip International (China-focused), but excludes TripAdvisor (due to its less relevant Advertising-only business model), Expedia is still the second-most profitable company in terms of EBITDA margin. While Booking currently holds the status as the most profitable OTA, its highly increasing Merchant-based activities due to its growing Agoda business in recent times can potentially change its profitability outlook. In the nine months ended September 2019, Booking’s merchant-based revenue made up almost ~36% of its revenue and was the fastest-growing segment with ~26% growth. In 2018, we also saw Booking’s merchant-based revenue grew as much as ~63% YoY. (Revenue growth comparison - Expedia, Booking, Trip, TripAdvisor, MakeMyTrip. source: stockrow)With an ~8x EV/EBITDA multiple, Expedia comes across as the cheapest stock despite being the fastest-growing player in terms of revenue and the largest player in terms of gross bookings. Considering these comparisons, Expedia looks the most compelling opportunity in the market. What surprised us even more is that Expedia achieved all these while facing the aforementioned challenges in the last two years post-Khosrowshahi leadership.We also view the fear of coronavirus in China and Asia that triggered sell-offs in the travel sector as an entry point opportunity. Much of Expedia's businesses are concentrated in regions that are less affected by the outbreak and have more developed public health policies. The US makes up over 60% of Expedia's gross bookings, while the majority of its international bookings come from Germany, UK, Canada, and Australia. Booking, on the other hand, will likely absorb a greater impact from coronavirus. International bookings make up approximately 89% of Booking's business. Based on the SimilarWeb data, we found Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines to be in the top five countries that drive its Agoda, Momondo, and KAYAK businesses. Those are also the countries most affected by the coronavirus so far. Expedia stock has received short-term pressures since Q4 2019 due to various reasons such as Coronavirus, Google SEO disruption, political turbulence in HK, and management shakeup. On the other hand, there are multiple catalysts that will drive future growth and margin expansion, such as Chairman Barry Diller’s takeover of the CEO position, authorization of new 20 million of shares repurchase, $300 million to $500 million cost-saving program, and a shift of focus away from search engine to direct traffic marketing that will reduce the company’s dependency on Google. At ~8x EV/EBITDA multiple, Expedia currently trades at a discount to its peers while it is off over ~32% from all-time highs in 2017. Since Dara Khosrowshahi left in the same year, Expedia’s growth and margin expansions have also been stagnant, with the company missing revenue estimates almost every quarter. Thus far, we found it surprising that Expedia remains the fastest-growing and largest OTA player in the last two years despite all the setbacks. With a 2019 gross booking of ~$107 billion and ~$12 billion revenue that grows at ~7% - ~8% on a TTM basis, we view Expedia as the most attractive opportunity among the other OTA players in the market."
4310769,22717,2019-12-05T12:00:49-05:00,"Expedia's announcement of a 29 million share repurchase program conservatively represents over 22% of its market cap assuming a 10% price rise.Expedia is a bargain given its buybacks, prospective 7.4% cash flow yield, and its total yield of over 12% (dividend yield plus annual buyback yield).My base estimate is that Expedia is worth at least $124.32, up 17.8%, if only one-half of the buybacks are completed in one year, based on its present dividend yield.If all the buybacks are completed, Expedia is worth $139.88, an upside of 32.5%.","Expedia's (EXPE) announcement on Dec. 4, 2019, that a management shuffle had led to a massive new buyback program is really good news for prospective and existing shareholders. This article will explain the simple math of what the buyback program will mean for investors.Here is what happened. Barry Diller, who controls about 49.3% of the voting power of the stock fired the CEO and CFO. Essentially, the company expects to produce better earnings under new management that Diller will install. To underscore the point, EXPE said it is going to add 20 million more shares to the 9 million shares in the buyback program. In addition, Diller expects to buy back shares himself. (By the way, both of these moves will take his stake well over 50% of voting control.)You can tell that I don't really care what will happen to sales, earnings and to some extent cash flow. The truth is that Expedia has on average produced about $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in free cash flow (""FCF"") on a last 12 month (""LTM"") basis each quarter. In addition, the company has consistently been using about 52% or so of FCF for buybacks. You can see this in the following table I put together:Source: HakeThe quarterly buybacks have been seasonal based on the FCF available each quarter, but the annual LTM buybacks have been consistent.Source: Hake estimatesThis is important since it has affected dividend per share growth. Look at the following table. This shows that the number of shares outstanding has fallen 4.5% over the past two years:Source: HakeThe reason this drop in shares outstanding is important is that the dividend per share is now higher than it would otherwise be.You can see this effect in the following table I have prepared:Source: HakeThis table shows that quarterly dividend payments to shareholders have increased by 19% from $42 million in Q1 2017 to $50 million in Q3 and Q4 2019. But the dividend per share has increased at a higher rate: 21.4%. This is 100% due to the lower number of shares outstanding (i.e. 4.5%). You can also see that the quarterly increase in dividends per share is even much greater than the quarterly increase in dividend payments.So you can probably see where I am heading with this analysis. With the new 29 million buyback program, the increase in dividend per share should go into high gear. Let's do some dreaming.First, what if the 29 million in buybacks took place over 2 years, and let's also assume that the stock price would at least climb 10% just from the buyback pressure on the stock. What is the effect on the stock?Source: HakeThis table shows that 29 million shares represent 20% of the existing number of shares outstanding (144.886 million as of November 19, 2019, when the latest 10-Q was filed). But if the stock rises 10% over the period when 29 million shares are being bought back, the total amount of purchases would be $3.367 billion. This represents 22% of EXPE's stock market value. It would also represent a quarterly buyback yield of 2.75%.In fact, Expedia stock's total yield, (dividend yield and buyback yield) would be about 12%. This can be seen in the following table:Source: HakeSo, using these figures what is the likely value of EXPE stock assuming (1) all the buybacks occur, which reduces the shares outstanding, increases the dividends per share higher than would otherwise occur, (2) regular dividend payment increases, and (3) with the same dividend yield. Here is a table that shows my estimates of EXPE's true value:Source: HakeHere is how to read that table. In the first column assume only 50% of the buybacks occur in the first year or so. That would reduce the total number of shares outstanding to 130.4 million. Now assume that the annual dividend increases 4.4% (see the table above which shows that average quarterly dividend payment increases have been 4.4%).This brings the annual dividend payments to $208.84 million, up from $200 million. Now since there are only 130.4 million shares outstanding, the new dividend per share will be $1.60 per share in one year. And using today's dividend yield (i.e. take $1.60 and divide it by 1.29%), you can derive the value per share of $124.32 per share for EXPE.The same methodology brings the value to $139.88 per share if 100% of the buybacks occur over one year.But can EXPE really spend $3.4 billion or more on buybacks in one year? Probably not. It produces $1.4 billion in free cash flow on average (see the table above). The company would have to borrow money to do all of the buybacks in one year. Here is EXPE's capitalization:Source: HakeThis shows that EXPE has net debt of $1.78 billion. So, since the excess of $3.4 billion over $1.4 billion or so in free cash flow (less $200 million-plus for dividends), means EXPE would have to borrow $2.2 billion if it wanted to complete the buyback program in one year.I doubt EXPE will increase its net debt over a one-year period to complete the 29 million buyback program.Therefore, my best estimate is that Expedia's stock is worth $124.32 per share, or 18% more than today's price.Expedia stock has a 1.29% dividend yield, and with the new buyback program executed over 2 years, the buyback yield is 11.01%. Therefore, the total yield to shareholders is 12.3%.This makes sense since we estimated that Expedia stock is worth at least $124.32 per share in one year or so, or 18% higher than today. The difference between the two (i.e., 12% total yield and 18% upside) is due to (1) an expected increase in dividends over the next year, and (2) the compounding effect that lowering shares outstanding has on the dividend per share increase. In addition, we estimate that the normal upward pressure of the buyback activity will have at least a 10% upward bias on the stock price.Lastly, if Barry Diller buys more shares as he says he will, this will also have the same effect as a buyback. His purchase of shares will effectively reduce the supply and float of shares outstanding on a real basis. This is a sort of hidden catalyst for the stock as well."

The company recently reported Q3 2019 earnings and the stock had the single worst one-day drop in its history of about 27% decline. The drop got my interest since the company also pays a growing dividend. In fact, Expedia is a Dividend Challenger having raised the dividend for nine consecutive years. But despite the large drop in stock price the yield is still low, the company is facing increasing competition, and operating and net margins have declined substantially in the past 10-years. For these reasons, I view Expedia as a sell.Source: Expedia GroupExpedia Group traces its history to 1996 and is now the world’s largest online travel agency. The company offers services for business travelers, recreational travelers, tour operators, and travel agents. Expedia’s major brands and online sites include Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Travelocity, Orbitz, Wotif, AirAsia, Engencia, HomeAway, Classic Vacations, Hotwire.com, CheapTIckets, VacationRentals.com, ebookers, Trivago, and Vrbo. In 2018, the company had about $99.7B in gross bookings leading to $11,223M in revenue of which the great majority was for lodging (69%). The remainder of revenue was air tickets (8%); rental cars, cruises, and other (14%), and advertising revenue (9%). Expedia has three operating segments that are: Core OTA, Vrbo, Egencia, and Trivago for financial reporting purposes. Note that Trivago is an independent company that is majority owned by Expedia. Notably, the Chairman, Barry Diller, owns 28.5% of the Class A stock and 100% of the Class B stock effectively giving him control of the company.Expedia’s Major BrandsSource: Expedia 2018 Annual ReportExpedia derives its revenue primarily from fees from online bookings. The company has about 5.9% total travel booking making it the market leader ahead of competitors Booking Holdings Inc (BKNG), TripAdvisor Inc (TRIP), and private Airbnb Inc (AIRB). The company’s business model is simple. In order to grow revenue, the company must grow the number of bookings since Expedia receives a fee from each booking. From this perspective, the company has been wildly successful. Revenue has increased more than fourfold driven by organic growth and acquisitions. Organic growth was driven by adding booking sites to now over 200 in 70+ countries, and also adding to supply. At end of 2018, Expedia had 1M+ properties, 500+ airlines, 35+ activities, 175+ rental car companies, dozens of cruise lines, and 1.8M+ HomeAway Online bookable listings. In addition, Expedia is an acquisitive company and has completed acquisitions of Orbitz (2015), HomeAway (2015), and Liberty Expedia Holdings (2019) adding to its bookings.Expedia’s Revenue and MarginsSource: Dividend Power based on data from MorningstarBut the difficulty for Expedia is that it has become less profitable with time. Revenue is increasing and gross margins have trended up, but operating margins and net margins have trended down. In fact, operating margins are now ranging from 6.3% to 7.5% or about one-third of 10-years ago. Similarly, net profit margins are now about 3.0% - 3.7% or about one-third of 10-years ago. I do not foresee margins recovering to the levels of 10-years or even 5-years ago. Some investors have attributed a narrow or even possibly a wide moat to Expedia. This may have been true 10-years ago when the two major competitors in online travel bookings were Expedia and Booking Holdings. The large number of online sites owned by Expedia combined with the large and growing inventory of lodging resulted in a network effect. But since then, the online travel industry has become more competitive and barriers to entry are low. In 2008, privately held Airbnb was founded and has grown rapidly. Airbnb is a direct competitor to Expedia’s Vrbo segment. Another major competitor now includes Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST), which offers discounted travel through its warehouses. Costco is a direct competitor to Expedia’s Core OTA segment. In addition, most airlines, such as United Airlines Holdings (UAL), and hotel chains, such as Marriott International Inc (MAR), offer direct online travel bookings. This now often includes offerings that are not only their own services and products, but those of other companies.Alphabet Inc (GOOG) is reportedly making changes that impacts search engine optimization or ‘SEO’ as Google deemphasizes free links. Google is now favoring its own HotelFinder platform and paid links. This will have a real impact in two ways. First, Expedia will need to pay more in advertising fees to Google for its websites to rank higher in searches. Second, Google is now in effect a direct competitor to Expedia. During the recent Q3 2019 earnings call, the CEO of Expedia has highlighted the changes and impacts:Google continues to experiment with new products related to SEO as it seeks to get more revenue per visitor. This will have a direct impact on Expedia and other online travel agencies. Google is at top of pyramid and online travel agencies are dependent on search to direct traffic to their websites. The possibility exists that Google will make further changes that would negatively affect Expedia’s top line.Competition is not limited to Google. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) and Facebook Inc (FB) also have the potential to be direct competitors. They both have large captive audiences and are seeking to monetize these audiences further. I believe that it is only a matter of time before these two companies enter the online travel agency market.Expedia initiated a dividend in 2010 and has grown it for nine consecutive years. The current yield is about 1.4% after the steep decline in stock price. Dividend growth was at a healthy double-digit pace. Recently, the growth rate has slowed to about 6.5%. The lack of meaningful bottom line growth due to declining margins and rising payout ratio will likely limit dividend growth in the near future. The payout ratio in 2018 was 46.8% based on a dividend of $1.24 and diluted 2018 EPS of $2.65. This is below my threshold of 65% so it is a good value in my opinion. The dividend is also well covered by free cash flow. In 2018, the dividend required about $0.19B in cash and FCF was $1.10B giving a dividend-to-FCF ratio of 17.3%. This is an excellent value and well under my criteria of 70%. This low value is prudent since Expedia does not operate in a recession resistant industry. Travel is largely discretionary and during recessions it is likely that bookings would decline.Despite being an acquisitive company, Expedia makes fairly conservative use of debt. In addition, the debt metrics are decent from the perspective of the company paying its obligations and dividend safety. Short-term debt is $749M and long-term debt is $4,170M offset by cash and securities of $4,455M. Interest coverage is strong at over 22X due to healthy EBIT relative to interest expense. Debt seemingly does not place the dividend at risk.Expedia Group Balance Sheet and Debt MetricsSource: Dividend Power based on data from Expedia Q3 2019 earnings releaseNow let’s examine Expedia’s valuation. Expedia’s stock price had the largest one-day decline in the company’s history after the Q3 2019 earnings release. However, the stock is likely now trading near fair value after adjusting for the prospect of slower growth and increased competition.The forward P/E ratio based on consensus 2019 EPS of $6.11 is now about 15.8. Applying a sensitivity analysis using P/E ratios between 15.0 and 17.0, I obtain a fair value range from $91.65 to $103.87. The current stock price is ~93% to ~105% of my estimated of fair value. The current stock price is ~$96.63 suggesting that the stock is trading near fair value.Estimated Current Valuation Based On P/E RatioSource: dividendpower.org CalculationsHow does this compare to other valuation models? We next apply the Gordon Growth Model. We make the assumption that the dividend will grow at 6.5% rate and that we want an 8% return. This gives a fair value estimate of $90.67. In another method, Morningstar is known to use a fairly conservative discounted cash low model and provides a fair value of $170, which is very high. But an average of these three models is ~$119.48. Seemingly, Expedia is very undervalued at the current price. But with that said, there is a lot of uncertainty with Expedia from the context of SEO and new competition, which makes me think that a 30% discount is warranted. This suggests that a price below $84 is prudent.Expedia is a major player and currently the leader in online travel agencies. But the company is very dependent on SEO and Google to drive traffic to its websites. Furthermore, competition is increasing. I do not believe that the company has a significant moat despite the possibility of a narrow one from the network effect. The barriers to entry for online travel agencies are seemingly not that high especially for large tech companies that can easily spend on capital investments. Expedia has become less profitable with lower margins despite increasing revenue and scale in the past 10-years. These are not good combinations. Hence, I am not a buyer and view Expedia as a sell.If you would like notifications as to when my new articles are published, please click the orange button at the top of the page to ""Follow"" me."
4305618,95006,2019-11-12T00:29:24-05:00,"In July of this year I wrote an article with a 'sell' rating on Expedia.This article revisits that idea, and explains my larger rotational strategy.I re-examine Expedia stock after the recent price drop to see if it is time to rotate back into the stock for investors who may have sold.","SourceIn April of this year, I started writing sell articles on the stocks of many high-quality businesses that I thought were overvalued. In all, since April, I have written 29 of these 'sell' articles, and on 7/31/19 I published one about Expedia (EXPE). Starting about three months ago I decided to write a new series of articles using the 29 stocks I had written bearish articles on this year as an example of how to gain free shares in high-quality businesses by selling them when they become overvalued, and rotating into more defensive positions until the price of the target stocks (in this case Expedia) comes down to more reasonable levels.This is a strategy I have been writing about since January of 2018 when I started my long-running ""How far could they fall?"" series. The basic strategy for both series is fairly simple. When the stock of a high-quality business becomes overvalued or is near a cyclical peak, you sell it and rotate into what I call ""default positions"" instead of cash. Then you wait in those default positions until the price of the target stock comes down to a reasonable level, at which point you then rotate back into the target stock.At the time I wrote my Expedia article, the two default positions were Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV) and Invesco S&P 500 and Invesco S&P MidCap Low Volatility ETF (XMLV). Let's take a look at the performance of the default positions compared to Expedia and SPY since the 7/31/19 'sell' article.Data by YChartsSPLV, XMLV, SPY, and cash have all significantly outperformed Expedia since my July sell article. In this article, I want to examine Expedia in order to see if one had rotated out in July and into the two default positions of SPLV and XMLV, whether now is a good time to rotate back into the stock.In my article ""Sentiment Cycles: When to Sell and When to Buy Back Again,"" I explain several different approaches an investor can take for how to judge when to rotate back into a high-quality business whose stock they sold because it became overvalued. For the sentiment cycle series, I have chosen to use what I call a ""simple mixed approach."" This approach takes half of the money rotated out of the stock and waits for the opportunity of a 20-25% 'free share gain' before rotating back in.For example, let's say one owns the stock of company XYZ and it trades at $100. The business is a great business, but the price has become so expensive that the implied future returns if someone bought the stock at that price are so low that it makes sense to sell it. Now let's say there is a defensive ETF like Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF SPLV which also trades at $100, but is likely to trade with much less volatility than the market, and unlikely to fall as far and as fast as an overpriced stock. Let's say someone sells XYZ and rotates into SPLV while both are priced at $100. Then, over the course of the next several months, the price of XYZ comes down to earth and falls to $80, while SPLV stays at $100. If one owned 100 shares of XYZ initially, they can now sell their SPLV shares and buy 125 shares of XYZ because the price is cheaper. This results in a 25% 'free share gain' compared to if one had just held the stock of their great business throughout this entire period. That's how free share gains and a long-only rotational strategy work.So, a 20-25% free share gain is the goal for half of the money that was rotated out. For the other half, we will use a more fundamental analysis that estimates the likely future returns of the target stock. I call these ""10-year, Full-Cycle Analyses,"" and it's the same analysis I originally performed on Expedia when I said it was a 'sell' back in July. In order for Expedia to have become a 'sell,' it would have had an expected 10-year CAGR of less than 4%. In order to rotate back in, I am looking for a 10-year CAGR of 8% for those who already really like the business and are just trying to avoid some losses and gain some free shares. For investors on the sidelines, like me, I'm looking for an expected 10-year CAGR greater than 12% before I buy because I want a margin of safety not just fair value.If an investor who rotated into the SPLV/XMLV mix back in July were to now rotate the SPLV portion of the money back into Expedia, they could now buy +34.38% more shares than they had in July without spending any extra money. Since that meets our 20-25% free share gain goal, I'm going to mark this down as a winning rotation, and Expedia joins five other stocks for which we've gained shares using this method so far.This idea was successful using these simple free share gain goals. Now let's examine the other half of the investment using fundamental analysis.So far, of the 29 stocks we are currently tracking in the sentiment cycle series, only one, Union Pacific (UNP) has met the 10-year CAGR expectation of 8% and completed the second half of the rotation.Now let's examine Expedia at its current price to see what sort of 10-year forward returns we might expect and whether it has crossed that 8% threshold we are looking for, so we can rotate the XMLV portion of the rotation back into Expedia.Data by YChartsCurrently, Expedia's forward earnings yield is +6.12%. The way I like to think about this is that if I bought Expedia's business for $100, I would make $6.12 on that investment the first year. I calculate that, since 2007, Expedia's earnings growth rate is about +6.65% if we include the earnings decline during the recession and we remove the effect of stock buybacks. So I will assume that the $6.12 per year will grow at +6.65% on average for the next 10 years. What I want to know is what will my $100 investment grow to in 10 years, and what sort of CAGR does that translate to. When I run the numbers on that I estimate that the $100 would grow to $188.67 and that translates to about a +6.55% CAGR for the business earnings. So, that is what I think the business can return each year on average over this time period if the next economic cycle is similar to the current one and we bought at today's prices.Additionally, since 2007, Expedia has on average traded at about a 17.34 P/E ratio, and currently, Expedia is trading at a 16.69 P/E. If the current P/E of 16.69 were to revert to the average of 17.34 over the course of 10 years it would produce a CAGR of +0.38%.If we put the expected return from the business of +6.55% together with the expected return from the sentiment reverting to the long-term mean, which would produce a return of +0.38%, we would get an expected 10-year CAGR of +6.93%. This does not meet the 8% expected 10-year CAGR we are looking for, so we will not rotate the second half of the rotation yet, and will instead continue to track Expedia each month until we get past that 8% threshold. If the stock has another downward move, it shouldn't take too much for us to get to that threshold.Half of our goal for Expedia is now complete with about a +34% free share gain. I will continue to monitor Expedia for when we have achieved our goal with the second half of the rotation.

4353938,103480,2020-06-15T15:16:32-04:00,"Shares of Expedia have already risen nearly ~2x from their March lows, and is now down only 25% for the year.
        Considering the massive hit to Expedia's business, and the fact that the company may need multiple years to recover to 2019 levels, Expedia is likely fully priced for now.
        Expedia's valuation of ~10x forward FCF likely captures the company's risks.
        Despite a promise to cut $300-$500 million out of annual operating expenses (2-4% of FY19 revenues), Expedia's most recent Q1 results haven't shown any progress yet.","Right now, the markets are wobbly and trying to decide whether to believe in the recovery or not. Since the market hit its lows in March, the S&P 500 (and especially, stocks in the hardest-hit industries like energy, retail, and travel) has enjoyed a fairly uninterrupted recovery rally until the early part of June - when re-openings in several states were accompanied by an immediate spike in COVID-19 infection cases. This, plus uncertainty over a vaccine timeline and whether the coronavirus can be transmitted twice, have fed into renewed volatility.Expedia (EXPE) is holding up alright, though. Shares have recovered nearly ~2x from their March lows and are down just 25% for the year, as if the company isn't currently facing the threat of near-zero bookings for the foreseeable future:In April, when Expedia was trading in the high $50s and low $60s, I made a bullish call on Expedia and encouraged investors to ""look at the future."" But the main premise of that call was valuation - and now, with Expedia trading ~40% higher (and beating a ~10% gain in the S&P 500 over the same time period), that thesis needs to be refreshed. In my view, markets will see choppy trading through the U.S. presidential elections, and continued haziness on the health of Expedia's fundamentals may threaten to claw back some of its April/May rally - which, by the way, happened on little news.Let's quickly update on Expedia's valuation first. Originally I recommended looking at Expedia's valuation from a cash flow perspective, an approach I still find valid. In FY19, Expedia generated a 13.3% FCF margin. I believe it's reasonable to use this margin against an FY21 revenue forecast, because although Expedia will likely be operating at a smaller scale and will likely suffer a point or two of gross margin contraction, the company's promise to cut $300-$500 million of operating expenses (worth 2-3 points of revenue) will likely be an offset.Wall Street analysts, per Yahoo Finance, expect Expedia to generate $9.47 billion in revenue in FY21. That's about 22% down from FY19 revenues of $12.07 billion. Applying Expedia's FY19 FCF margin yields an FY21 FCF forecast of $1.26 billion. At present share prices near $83, Expedia trades at a market cap of $11.63 billion. After netting off the $5.52 billion of cash and $6.83 billion of debt on Expedia's balance sheet (the company has levered up significantly to build up cash reserves since the coronavirus began), its enterprise value is $12.94 billion. This gives the company a valuation of 10.3x EV/FY21 FCF.I recommended Expedia at a valuation of ~7.2x FY21 FCF. That single-digit free cash flow multiple provided a wide enough margin of error, in my view, but now trading at ~10x FCF I think Expedia's valuation fairly factors in both the stock's risk and opportunity. Having reached what I believe to be an appropriate price target, I've sold off my stake in Expedia and moving to neutral on the company. Should shares dive again to the ~$60s without any negative changes to Expedia's fundamental landscape, I'm in, but otherwise I think it's more appropriate to concentrate on Expedia's risks at current prices.The biggest risk to Expedia now, of course, is bookings. As expected, Q1 bookings were terrible. The company's revenue fell -15% y/y, while hotel room nights (the largest piece of Expedia's business) fell -14% y/y.Figure 1. Expedia key bookings metricsSource: Expedia 1Q20 earnings resultsBut of course, Q1 included two ""normal"" months of January and February, and only one pandemic impacted March. Wall Street consensus is calling for things to get much worse in the year to go. Estimates for the June quarter call for revenue to be down -81% y/y, while full-year consensus has revenues down -49% y/y. For what it's worth, rival Airbnb's CEO Brian Chesky also noted he expects Airbnb's revenue for the full year 2020 to be down -50%. What is mildly frustrating about Expedia is that the company has not given any data on the monthly linearity of bookings, nor offered a timeline to recovery. Other hard-hit companies like Yelp (YELP), for example, have given traffic and advertiser budget spend data in each month through April, giving us a sense of how deep the valley was and how quickly the company was able to climb out. Expedia's CEO Peter Kern, unfortunately, offered only hazy commentary during the Q&A portion of the most recent earnings call: The gist of this message: the results are so bad that they're not worth reporting. The other smaller concern I have is that the coronavirus will ultimately accelerate the transition away from traditional hotels to home-sharing platforms. Since some lockdowns started lifting, Airbnb has reported a ""surge in demand"". Vacation rental homes are great options during the pandemic because they tend to be more removed from urban centers, offer complete privacy and have less density. The fact that pandemic struggles threaten to put many independent hotels out of business will also hurt the supply side of Expedia's business.Of course, Expedia has exposure to vacation rentals through Vrbo. But in 2019, Vrbo only generated $11.9 billion, or 11%, of Expedia's overall bookings. Gains in a one-tenth fraction of Expedia's business is not nearly large enough to offset a broad decline in traditional hotels. The biggest bull message driving Expedia stock upward during April and May was the idea that the company's planned cost cuts would allow Expedia to wring more profits and cash flow out of a lower absolute amount of gross bookings. Of course, these cost cuts were only meant to be gradual, and Expedia said that it would achieve $300-$500 million of cost savings on an annualized run rate basis by the end of 2020 - but not immediately. Still, to justify shares rising back to pre-crisis levels (which at this point is only ~30% away), we should be able to see some progress toward this goal. So far, we haven't. Take a look at Expedia's cost breakdown in the first quarter:Figure 2. Expedia cost breakdownSource: Expedia 1Q20 earnings resultsIgnore the ten-point jump in Expedia's cost of revenue; this is related to a one-time bad debt adjustment related to the coronavirus that isn't likely to recur in future periods. What we're more concerned about is that despite a ""significant reduction in direct marketing spend in March"", selling/general/administrative expenses only fell 363bps as a percentage of revenues. This cost reduction, in turn, was fully washed out by increases in technology and content costs (which the company attributed to higher software license and cloud hosting costs) and a bump in general and administrative expenses, driven by an increase in business taxes. If these types of increases are sustained, it may fully wash out Expedia's planned $300-$500 million of cost savings (worth 2-4 points of FY19 revenue). With shares of Expedia now trading above 10x FY21 free cash flows, I believe the company needs to offer a better turnaround story on both bookings and margin improvements to move materially higher. With such lack of clarity on both topics at the moment, investors are taking a big leap of faith for Expedia to recover to pre-crisis levels fairly quickly. Wait for shares to unwind some of their gains before diving back in.I'm launching The Daily Tech Download, a Seeking Alpha Marketplace service, on June 22.

4279374,95006,2019-07-31T04:06:07-04:00,"This analysis of Expedia stock uses a 10-year time frame and assumes a recession will occur at some point over that period.It analyzes expected returns from sentiment reversion-to-mean, earnings growth, and business returns that weight returns to shareholders more heavily.The article examines the potential opportunity cost of selling Expedia stock at today's prices if we were to have a recession three years from now.","SourceTraditionally, most of my analysis on Seeking Alpha has focused on how to avoid losses and how to profit from the price cycles of highly cyclical stocks. There is another group of stocks, however, whose stock prices and earnings fluctuate far less than the classic cyclical stocks I have traditionally written about. While these stocks aren't as cyclical as a ""classic cyclical,"" they are still usually subject to the short-term debt cycle (or business cycle) and to changes in sentiment (which can sometimes also have a cyclical quality about it). Recently, I have been adopting some of the techniques I've used with ""classic cyclicals"" and applying them to less-cyclical stocks. And, today's stock is one of those.One of the major assumptions I make for both approaches is that history is the most reliable guide to the future. My experience has been that 80% of the time, even if we looked at nothing else, a stock will behave in a similar manner as it did the previous cycle or two unless there is a disruption to its core business. For this reason, I don't rely much on predictions of future earnings or sentiment that aren't supported by their existence during past cycles. That doesn't mean that ""this time is different"" isn't true sometimes. It just means that my analysis isn't counting on this time being much different. That said, if I think a stock is currently a ""buy"" based on my 10-year, full-cycle analysis, before I invest, I will examine the forward-looking trends and narratives more carefully to make sure there aren't major changes in the works that could affect the business.The main difference you'll find between my analysis and others' is that: 1) I focus on a clear 10-year time frame and the compound annual growth rate (aka CAGR) one might expect over that period of time, 2) I assume we will experience a recession during that time period, and I build that into the expected returns, 3) I try to calculate the expected returns based on a full business cycle, 4) I share both a basic shareholder return estimate and a more conservative shareholder return estimate where I lower expected returns for companies with higher debt levels and raise them for companies with higher cash levels, and 5) I usually provide an ""opportunity risk/reward analysis"" if a stock is not currently a ""buy"" so that we can get an idea of how likely it is the stock will trade low enough to become a ""buy"" over the next 4-5 years if we have a recession.As part of the analysis, I calculate what I consider to be the three main drivers of future total returns: 1) Market Sentiment Returns, 2) Full-Cycle Organic Earnings Growth Returns, and 3) Shareholder-Weighted Business Returns. Then, I combine all three of those CAGR estimates together to get an expected 10-year, full-cycle CAGR estimate. Currently, I consider an expected CAGR > 15% a ""buy,"" 12-15% an ""outperform,"" 8-12% a ""market perform,"" 4-8% an ""underperform"" and < 4% a ""sell.""With that, let's get into the analysis.Since I use different approaches for analyzing a stock based on how cyclical earnings are, historical earnings cyclicality is the first thing I like to examine. Let's take a look at Expedia's (EXPE) historical earnings using a F.A.S.T. Graph, which is a great tool for this sort of analysis:I break down earnings cyclicality into five basic categories. The first category I call ""secular growth."" This category describes earnings that continue to rise every year even during economic recessions. The next three categories are ""low,"" ""moderate,"" and ""deep."" ""Low"" is usually for businesses which have earnings that have a history of declining in the single digits percentage-wise during downturns but not much further than that. ""Deep"" I consider earnings that fall more than -50%, and ""moderate"" somewhere in between low and deep. And, last but not least are businesses whose earnings go negative during cyclical downturns but recover soon after that, which I call ""highly cyclical."" For businesses that have earnings in the deep or highly cyclical categories, I use an entirely different type of analysis, so it's important to determine at the outset which category a stock falls into.Expedia experienced a pretty big EPS decline of -42% just after the 2008 recession, and it also experienced several single-digit declines of -8%, -7% and -4% in 2006, 2015 and 2017, respectively. Expedia only has data going back to 2005 so we don't know how earnings would have performed during the 2001 recession. Given the number of small declines along with the bigger recessionary decline, I would place Expedia's earnings cyclicality in the ""moderate"" category, and on a scale of 1-8 I would rate it a '4.'For stocks in this category, it can be useful to examine them both using a full-cycle 10-year analysis, and also a medium-term strategic cyclical analysis that focuses on historic price cycles. However, for the medium-term strategic analyses, I require that a stock has experienced at least two recessions so that there is sufficient data to gauge future potential price swings, and Expedia hasn't been publicly traded long enough to include two business cycles. That leaves us with the longer-term full-cycle analysis I'm going to perform in this article.In order to estimate what sort of returns we might expect over the next 10 years, let's begin by examining what return I could expect 10 years from now if the P/E multiple were to revert to its mean from the previous economic cycle. In order to estimate that, I'm going to shorten the time frame of the F.A.S.T. Graph so it starts about 2007, a little before the last cyclical peak.Expedia's current blended P/E is 21.52 while its normal P/E this past cycle has been 17.34. If, over the course of the next 10 years, the P/E were to revert to 17.34 and everything else was held equal, it would produce a 10-year CAGR of about -2.14%.If we begin our measurement around the same point we were at last cycle, which I estimate to be about 2007, and we adjust the annually compounded EPS growth for the amount of stock that was repurchased over this time period, we can estimate how much CAGR from organic earnings growth we can expect over the next 10 years if the next cycle is similar to the previous one.Data by YChartsOver the course of the full-cycle since 2007, Expedia has bought back about 10% of the company. I'll back those buybacks out and also assume we experience a recession at some point over the next ten years.When I do the math on that, I get a 10-year, full-cycle, organic earnings growth CAGR estimate of -1.63%. This is an interesting result because it is negative. The main reason why it's negative is because of how badly the business did during the Great Recession. If you scroll back up to F.A.S.T. Graph, you'll notice the small 1:2 flag at the bottom of the chart near the year 2011. That was a reverse stock split the company performed, which had the effect of doubling EPS in the years after that. So the reality was that the price decline post the 2008 recession was much deeper than the -42% displayed on the F.A.S.T. Graph. It was actually more like -50% and took Expedia about 9 years, until 2018, to recover its previous cyclical EPS peak of 2009. The long period the stock spent below its 2007 earnings, which is when I started my estimate from, is why its expected organic earnings rate is so low.Data by YChartsI'm not sure exactly what was going on here in 2009, and if there was something other than the recession that caused this, but we can see the incredibly steep net income losses in 2009. It takes a lot of future earnings to make up for losses that big.If we use GAAP earnings on the F.A.S.T. Graph the recession downturn is more pronounced, as are other earnings swings this cycle.These return estimates are more complicated than the first two, but the idea behind this is to figure out how much the company is making in cash and/or earnings per share while taking into account debt and cash levels, how much of a dividend yield it is paying to shareholders, what percentage of shares it is buying back annually, and how much cash the company is keeping for itself, all on a per-share basis. Once that is complete, I assume any money the business keeps for itself will accrue over a 10-year time period, but I don't assume that it will compound (since I estimated the earnings growth in the last section).For buybacks, if the company is buying back shares when sentiment is below average, I will assume the value of the buybacks will compound over time. If they are buying back when sentiment is higher than average, I will assume the buybacks accrue but do not compound value over the 10-year time period. (This is just a way to weight the value of buybacks over time for the estimate, it isn't intended to be mathematically precise - which is fine for me, because we never know exactly what price the buybacks will be made over time anyway, so there's no sense in pretending we do.) I will assume that dividends paid to shareholders compound their value over time, because shareholders can immediately reinvest the dividends in the best investment available.As I noted, this process is intended to estimate how much money the business is likely to make and how much of that money will likely be returned to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. I limit the expectation of shareholder returns by how much cash is currently being generated and the company's apparent intention of investing that cash itself or returning it to shareholders. If buybacks and dividends are consistently greater than cash flows and earnings, I will assume they are unsustainable through a full cycle that includes a recession, and I limit the shareholder return expectations to actual cash flows and/or earnings estimates I think are reasonable.First, let's revisit those buybacks and see what sort of returns we might expect from them in the future. I'll look at both 1-year and 3-year time frames.Data by YChartsData by YChartsExpedia doesn't have much in the way of a buyback yield. Its dividend yield at current prices is 0.92%.Let's see if the current earnings yield is enough to cover that.Data by YChartsThe forward earnings yield looks pretty good. If I assume the dividend compounds over time and the rest of the money Expedia keeps for itself accrues but doesn't compound, I get an expected 10-year shareholder/business yield of +4.30%.Personally, I like to use a more conservative estimate for long-term shareholder/business returns that raises expected returns for companies with higher cash and lower debt levels and lowers expectations for companies with higher debt levels and lower cash levels. For this, I use a free-cash-flow-to-equity/enterprise value yield.Data by YChartsSince Expedia is sitting on a lot of cash and has good free-cash-flow, the FCFE/EV yield is very good at +11.30%. That gives Expedia a lot of flexibility during the next downturn when it occurs. I'll include this as part of the shareholder/business return range.Putting all three - market sentiment returns (-2.14%), earnings growth returns (-1.63%) and business/shareholder returns (+4.30% to +11.30%) - together, I estimate a full-cycle 10-year CAGR return of +0.53% to +7.30%. This estimate covers a fairly wide range from ""Sell"" to ""Underperform.""If I were an Expedia shareholder right now, given where we are in the business cycle, I would be looking to sell. It's possible there might be 20% more upside left in this stock, but the problem is that if we indeed have a recession, this stock is likely going to get hammered hard.Data by YChartsThis stock lost -80% of its value during the last recession. Granted, the last recession was a bad one, and Expedia is a larger and stronger business now than it was then, but this isn't a stock you want to own late in the cycle.Using F.A.S.T. Graphs forecasting tool and using a 22.5 P/E for Expedia going out to 2022 and including analysts' estimates for earnings growth, including dividends, we should expect an $84.93 gain for the stock price. That would give us a stock price estimate of $223.64 in 2022. That's a really solid gain between now and then. But if we then had a recession, even if the stock were to only fall -60% and not -80% as it did in 2008/9, that would give us a trough price of $89.46. (A future -50% decline would give us a price of $111.82.) So, assuming we experience a recession in the next 3 years or so, Expedia stock seems like a pretty safe ""Sell"" here, and I don't think there is much opportunity risk in doing so."
4302137,75025,2019-11-04T08:43:46-05:00,"The companies are quite similar and their gross booking volumes are quite comparable.Over time, Booking has shown a much better revenue growth than Expedia.Booking is also much more profitable than Expedia, which barely increased earnings over the past 10 years.One area in which Expedia has outperformed Booking is the valuation (not totalreturn) of its stock.Thestock markets sets the bar low for Booking Holdings which is a better buy thanExpedia.","Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) are the top companies in their field with similar well-known challenges. In fact, they are so similar that the company description tables on Seeking Alpha are almost identical. Can you tell which one is which?Source: Expedia, Booking.If it weren't for the fact that Expedia was founded in 1996 and Booking in 1997, no one could tell. The core OTA (Online Travel Agency) product is also quite similar. An important difference is that Booking is much more international than Expedia, which has a stronger presence in the US. There are also some differences in the product mix, such as Expedia leaning more towards package deals, and Booking on just accommodation.To properly get a grasp of how the companies compare, I start with a review of revenue and continue from there to margins and valuation. Closely looking at bookings and users is a good start.At Booking, gross bookings in 2018 were about 10 times what they were 10 years ago. At Expedia, bookings are about 4 times what they were in 2009.Data source: respective company filings. For Expedia, core OTA was used.Gross bookings are important, but give an incomplete view of underlying developments. In addition there are users, number of accommodations, and revenue margin to take into account.Revenue margin is an especially important metric, as capturing a higher revenue from gross bookings shows competitive strength. Lowering revenue margin is essentially lowering prices to attract suppliers (accommodations) which, in turn, drives revenue growth. I have gathered revenue margin data for Booking and Expedia below.Margin on gross bookings. Source: author's own calculations and company reports.As the chart shows, Expedia has seen revenue margin decline over the past 10 years, while Booking has saw it increase. The picture could be partially affected by mix effects but this doesn't seem the case, certainly in the case of Expedia. Expedia's HomeAway division, for example, reported a revenue margin decrease from 11.5% in 2015 to 10.2% in 2018 and the share of hotel bookings (usually higher margin) within Expedia's gross bookings has remained quite stable over the years. It looks like this decreasing margin over time is a conscious strategy to attract business (suppliers) at the expense of margins, as it communicated in 2015 when it lowered revenue margin to attract more business.Expedia tries to attract more business from hotels and other accommodation providers by undercutting Booking. This makes sense from a long-term strategic perspective as its edge is not in attracting higher gross bookings, as it seems.While Expedia's strategy has been to attract business customers with low pricing, it has been Booking's strategy to attract users towards its platform. Getting users in turn helps to attract hotels, as Booking's huge traffic is hard to ignore for hotels that want to fill their rooms.Another structural reason that explains at least part of the margin difference is the relative popularity of each in the US. In the US, a few large hotel chains are very dominant, while in Europe and Asia, the hotel market is extremely fragmented. In Europe, many hotels are family-owned. In Italy, for example, only 5% of hotels in Italy are chain-owned according to Horwath HTL. For comparison websites, that is great as smaller hotels have less brand power and are more reliant on (online) travel agencies for traffic. The table below shows cumulative monthly visitors for the major websites of BKNG and EXPE both in the US an internationally.* Total for Booking websites Booking.com, Priceline.com, and Agoda.com. Expedia websites represented are Expedia.com, Hotels.com, HomeAway.com and .co.uk, .ca, .jp, .de, .it, .fr, .es extensions for the main Expedia website. Source: author's own calculations. Data source is SimilarWeb (August).Though Expedia uses many country extensions that are not accounted for in the table above, the difference in the number of visitors is striking. The visitor trend is at least as interesting as the number of visitors. Google Trends can give us a fair insights into the relative popularity of search terms or websites. For this analysis I picked Hotels.com and Booking.com in the US, the home market of Expedia and its hotels.com subsidiary.Data source: Google Trends. Website (rather than search) trend data was used.As it looks, Booking.com has overtaken Expedia's Hotels.com brand on its home turf. At the same time, Booking is dominating internationally. This global prominence has made Booking an unbeatable powerhouse when it comes to booking hotel accommodation online. Consumers from all around the world use Booking, while supply is also global. This is a virtuous cycle. As an OTA gets larger, it is increasingly harder to ignore for accommodation providers and in turn for consumers looking for the best comparison.The trends described above impact profitability. The chart below shows the EBIT margins of Booking and Expedia. We can see that while Booking's EBIT margin increased sharply in the earlier years in this chart before stabilizing, Expedia's EBIT margin has done de opposite. This is somewhat inline with the revenue margin pattern we have observed earlier on.Source: author's own calculations using EBIT divided by revenue as compiled by Seeking Alpha.EBIT margin is just a part of the story; by itself it's not necessarily an informative financial metric. What is most important is the return on capital or return on equity. That reveals the true value of a business and its competitive power versus peers.Source: author's own calculations.Booking has seen a consistently superior ROE to Expedia over the past 10 years. Combined with the fast growth of both companies, we can guess which company has seen the best free cash flow development: Booking Holdings.Adjusted FCF is defined as Operating Cash Flow - Stock-based compensation - CapEx. Source: author's own calculations.To Expedia, it's quite disappointing that over the 10 years, Booking has enjoyed both superior revenue growth and superior returns. Unsurprisingly, this has left Booking with a huge and fairly constant cash flow growth of close to $0.5bn annually. Expedia's cash flow has not grown materially. One thing that has grown materially is the valuation of Expedia. This is shown by the two charts below.FCF is adjusted FCF as defined above, FCF yield is FCF per share in a given year, divided by average stock price of that year. Source: author's own calculations.The valuation of Expedia is expressed in its FCF yield. From 2009 to 2012, Expedia was relatively cheap and traded at an (adjusted) FCF yield of about 8% to 12% (this can be somewhat distorted by the spin off of TripAdvisor in 2011). Booking, shown below, was more expensive and traded at a yield close to 5% ever since 2010. Remarkably, the market has started to value Expedia at more expensive (lower) FCF yield than Booking from 2014 onwards. The reason may well be that Expedia's revenue CAGR has been slightly better from 2014 to 2018. However, Expedia's EBIT and EBITDA already smaller margins have contracted since 2013 while the margins of Booking have remained stable.FCF is adjusted FCF as defined above, FCF yield is FCF per share in a given year, divided by average stock price of that year. Source: author's own calculations.Analysts sometimes say that Expedia has a hidden strength, in that it overspends on marketing (51% of 2018 revenue) versus Booking (34% of 2018 revenue). The idea is that when Expedia drops its marketing spend, margins will increase. I think that the example of what happened at meta search website provider Trivago (TRVG) is telling enough. Trivago did manage to increase margins by reducing advertising spend, but at a great cost. Trivago's TTM revenue is now 23% below its peak of Q1 2018 (in USD) and the stock fell over 50% in the past twelve months. It seems that you can't have your cake (revenue growth) and eat it too (healthy margins). The exception is Booking, which has grown spectacularly while increasing margins over the past 10 years.The last section touched upon FCF yield, but there are various multiples that can add more color to the picture. Booking's EV/EBIT and EV/EBITDA multiples started at a more expensive point in 2009/2010 but Expedia's multiples have expanded more. The most stable multiple for Expedia is P/Sales.Price or EV is of the reported year, as are the financials. FCF yield uses the adjusted FCF as defined earlier in this article. Source: author's own calculations. Underlying data was sourced from Seeking Alpha.The story that is told by the tables above is that expectations for Expedia started out low, but are not higher than for Booking. The table below includes forward looking P/E multiples for Expedia, Booking and some peers. On forward GAAP P/E, Expedia is still materially more expensive than Booking, which is the cheapest of the peer group. Apparently, investors rather dream about a turnaround story than betting on a company that has proven itself already.Source: Seeking Alpha.Both Expedia and Booking have stakes other major public companies. Expedia has a stake in Trivago, a metasearch website, which it spun off in 2016. Booking has an investment in Ctrip (CTRP), a leading Chinese OTA. In both cases, there is a strategic advantage involved. For Booking, having equity in a partner in the opaque but fast-growing Chinese market is of great value. In the case of Expedia, Trivago is a tool to attract European travelers.Expedia owns 59.5% of Trivago which hasn't had a great three years since the IPO.Trivago stock price chart. Source: Seeking Alpha.The holding of Booking, Ctrip, has done better, but like EXPE and BKNG, CTRP has been moving sideways, mostly. The more important difference is the underlying fundamentals. Ctrip has seen revenue increase at a CAGR of 40% over the past 5 years (SA data) and it is profitable. Trivago has seen a sales CAGR of 31% (in EUR) over the past four years but a decline in YTD sales in an (admittedly successful) effort to produce a small profit. This has not pleased its shareholders as they now realize that the combined growth and profit potential of Trivago is not what they thought it was.Some think that Google's foray into online hotel bookings is a threat to Booking and Expedia. I think that Google will limit its efforts as it is at risk from an antitrust point of view. This also limits synergies between Google Search and Google Travel. We have seen fines for Google abusing its power as a search engine with Google Shopping. Apart from that, not everything that Google tries is bound to be a success. Despite the fact that every Gmail user was signed up for Google+, it failed and Google pulled the plug after 7-8 years. Another reason for Google not to pursue travel too aggressively is that Expedia and Booking alone pay Google Search billions a year for ads. Expedia and Booking each spend over $4bn on direct marketing and performance marketing, respectively. Much of that is online ads, and much of that goes to Google. Meanwhile, the net profits of the OTAs are relatively modest compared to their marketing spend. Expedia made $400m in 2018, while booking had a net income of $4bn in that year.Last but not least, we must reflect on how these companies are developing. Clearly, Booking has shown an amazing performance over the past 10 years and is valued at a FCF yield of 5%. Given that investors desire a cash return of 8%, the company has the straight forward task of growing FCF by ~3% per year in order to justify its current valuation. The global economy is growing at a clip of 3%-3.5% according to the latest projections by the IMF. In a growing global economy, the global travel market logically outperforms global GDP growth as (international) travel is a luxury product and increasing wealth per capita means more spending on luxury products. Also, online bookings as a percentage of total bookings will most likely keep increasing. This dynamic has driven revenue at Expedia and Booking in the past, and it will keep doing that in the future. The chart below illustrates how online booking gained share in the accommodations market during 2004-2015.Source: Booking Holdings Investor Presentation.Another thing we observe in the chart is that the market is cyclical but so far this cyclicality has been assuaged for OTAs due to a rapid gain of online bookings. We must beware that in future downturns online bookings (in USD terms) are more likely to decline because the relative online share gain will sooner be offset by an overall bookings market decline.Circling back to the topic of desired growth rates: if Booking needs a 3% growth based solely upon stock valuation, Expedia has growth targets that are double that of Booking. Given that FCF yield is at around 2%, Expedia must grow by 6% per year to provide investors with an 8% total return. Of course, Expedia can't - and shouldn't want to try to grow at twice the speed of Booking. The most important revenue driver, room night growth, has been 11% YoY for both companies in H1 2019. It is not completely unlikely that at some point, Expedia will want to show its shareholders what kind of margins it is able to produce. If it does so, that will be beneficial to Booking.Over the past 10 years we have seen an extraordinarily strong Booking Holdings outperform Expedia on just about every important business and financial metric. Oddly, the one field in which Expedia has overtaken Booking, is the P/E of its stock. The strength and profitability of Bookings business is very attractive and it makes the stock a better buy than Expedia, in my opinion, regardless of valuation. The fact that Booking is valued more cheaply by the market confirms that it is a better buy than Expedia."

        Should costs decrease from here, then there could be significant upside for the stock.
        However, competition from the likes of Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) pose a significant risk.","Expedia (EXPE) is a major name in the online travel industry, and the company has seen very strong growth over the past decade.Particularly, we can see that Expedia has shown much more growth than that of rival TripAdvisor (TRIP).Source: investing.comHowever, the online travel industry is significantly more mature at this point, and we can see that returns for both companies have shown more or less stationary movement since 2017.Source: investing.comIn this regard, it is hard to argue that one could potentially see such high levels of growth into the future. That said, the industry itself still remains very strong. Given the stationary trend we have been seeing in growth since 2016, could we expect further upside for the stock from here?When looking at EBITDA trends for both Expedia and TripAdvisor, we can see that Expedia’s EV to EBITDA has been lower than that of its competitor over the past five years:Source: ycharts.comThat said, when taking a deeper look at earnings, it is clear that this company incurs significant costs in terms of doing businessFor instance, when we look at performance over the previous year, we can see that while the company saw modest revenue growth of 4%, Expedia in fact saw an operating loss of $131 million due to costs and expenses.Source: Expedia Group First Quarter 2019With this being said, less than 20% of costs and expenses came from the cost of revenue itself - the majority of costs for the business are related to overhead and fixed costs. In this regard, the company still remains significantly profitable in terms of its core offering, and a reduction in fixed costs would significantly boost Expedia’s profitability.Moreover, the net loss from last year did in fact decrease by 25%, while the adjusted EBITDA grew by 42% on a year-on-year basis. Moreover, room night growth was up by 9% while gross bookings were up by 8%:Source: Expedia Group First Quarter 2019Looking forward, the online travel industry is set to continue growing significantly. That said, the industry is still competitive in spite of consolidation, and there is always the threat of competition from other large players. For instance, Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) have been touted as players that could eventually come to dominate this industry. For instance, Google ranked second to Expedia last year in terms of consumer interest, while Expedia saw a dip in preference down to 64% in 2018 from 67% a year prior.In particular, where Google and Amazon could be particularly effective as a competitor in this space is the fact that these two companies are, in essence, two of the largest advertising companies in the world. As such, these companies hold vast amounts of information on potential customers, and could well have the capability of better targeting customer needs than current platforms such as Booking.com or TripAdvisor.In this sense, we could see a situation emerge where online travel vendors start increasingly competing on price, and this would significantly reduce the profitability of the industry.From a financial standpoint, I see Expedia as being reasonably valued on an EV/EBITDA basis, and should we see significant cost reductions going forward, then the stock could appreciate quite nicely. That said, growing competition from the likes of Amazon and Google could pose a significant threat to the industry, and this is a key risk that potential investors should bear in mind.Additional disclosure: This article is written on an ""as is"" basis and without warranty.

4307523,59101,2019-11-18T13:56:00-05:00,"Expedia has real headwinds, and they are likely long term.The company suffered the largest one day sell-off in its history.Is this an over reaction or should investors jettison their shares?The company has a narrow moat and is still trading below fair value. The headwinds are not to be ignored, but they are manageable.","Following the most recent quarterly results, investors in Expedia (EXPE) suffered through the worst one day share loss in the company's history, roughly $40 representing a 27% decline. However, I contend that the company has a narrow moat, and despite numerous analyst downgrades, the stock is still considered to be trading well below fair value. The headwinds, while not to be ignored, appear to be manageable.Just how bad are things over in Exepdia land? Is the sharp sell off a harbinger of things to come, or does it represent a manic-market buying opportunity? In this article, I endeavor to present the pros and cons of a prospective investment in Expedia, concluding that the long argument holds more water.The cause of Expedia’s misfortune was twofold: First, the quarterly earnings report missed on revenues, the $3.56 billion estimate fell short by $10 million, and EPS missed by $0.43 cents. EBITDA was flat versus a year ago. There were quite a few other metrics that looked less than stellar.Perhaps of greater concern, and I would argue it’s the real cause of the precipitous decline, was the move by Google (GOOG) to give its own vacation rental and apartments business preference in Google search.During Expedia’s earnings call, management cited “weakness in SEO volumes and a related shift to high-cost marketing channels.” For those unfamiliar with the parlance, the executive was speaking of Search Engine Optimization. More specifically, Google is highlighting their own offerings at the expense of firms like Expedia. This, of course, results in less business heading Expedia’s way and translates into poorer results in the most recent, and potentially, in future quarters. Furthermore, to make up for the lost clicks, Expedia must spend more on marketing with the consequent negative effect on the company’s bottom line.Kevin Kopelman, managing director and analyst for Cowen, notes online-travel companies provide poor disclosure on their SEO exposures. Kopelman calculated that should SEO revenue fall to zero (zero being the operative word), Expedia would lose 50% of Ebitda.Look no further than Vrbo for a possible example of how weak SEO volumes drove Expedia’s poor results. That segment saw net income growth slow to 3 percent to $215 million. That doesn’t sound too bad until one learns that’s compared with a 66% increase the year prior.Following the poor quarterly results and the discovery of the root cause, the dominoes began to fall. Analysts downgraded Expedia by significant margins:Piper Jaffray’s Michael Olson lowered his price target to $124 from $160.D.A. Davidson analyst Tom White price target dropped to $130 from $162.Wells Fargo’s Brian Fitzgerald lowered the price target to $125 from $160.Aside from the very real Sturm und Drang, with discussions of inverted yield curves, trade wars, and Brexit, prospective investors in Expedia must consider the cyclical nature of the company in the event of a slowing economy.Amidst all the bad, I think investors lost sight of the positives: Expedia grew EPS by 16% last year. Although Expedia adjusted the company’s Ebitda forecast markedly downward, the company is still modeling an increase of 5% to 8% for 2019.Despite the aforementioned slowdown in Vrbo, that segment still experienced revenue growth of 14%. Vrbo, far from a failure, provides Expedia the leading share in the fast-growing online vacation rental market.Morningstar predicts Expedia's global share of the total travel booking market will climb to 6.8% in 2023 from 5.9% today. Argus projects Expedia's share of the global travel bookings will increase form 25% in 2016 to roughly 33% in 2020.Expedia reported solid 9% third-quarter bookings growth in the face of a travel industry demand slowdown.The firm is steadily gaining market share in the US. Expedia now garners approximately 60% of bookings, representing a two-year booking increase of 23%.The aforementioned is not indicative of a moribund company.Morningstar analyst Dan Wasiolek estimates the company will have to raise the company's marketing budget by a sum equal to 2% of sales to combat the SEO loses. While 2% is small as percentages go, it represents a large sum in terms of real dollars. Nonetheless, it is not indicative of company in crisis.Gazing into the not too distant future, the International Air Travelers Association forecasts an annual passenger growth rate of 3.5%, which will lead to a doubling in passenger numbers by 2037. At the same time, Skift forecasts International travel will increase by 500 million trips in the next decade. Ironically, the aging population and millennials may present a sort of tag team for Expedia. Baby boomers will create a boom in traveling while millennials will lead the trend in booking travel online.Global travel is the seventh largest industry and second fastest growing behind banking.Expedia is not a one trick pony. The firm has 19 online travel sites. Expedia has a presence in 30 countries. Hotels.com boasts 90 websites in 41 languages while the company now possesses the largest stock of rentable homes on the globe. And that’s just the highlights.I’d add that instead of looking at the drop in target prices presented by the analysts listed above, one should look at the actual price targets. The average of the three represents an approximate 33% gain from today’s closing price.Expedia trades today at roughly 14 times forward earnings. Should the stock regain half the ground toward its historical multiple of 20, let’s say a multiple of 17, investors would be looking at a significant gain.EXPE has a secure dividend with a (TTM) payout ratio of roughly 38% and a dividend coverage ratio of approximately262%. The current yield is approximately 1.4%.The three, and five-year dividend growth rates stand at roughly 14% and 17% respectively.(All dividend metrics gleaned from Schwab)Expedia has a narrow moat derived from the company’s large footprint in the online travel industry. Examples of the firm’s strong presence are the fact that the company garners at least 35% of the global online travel agency booking market, Expedia’s ranking as the top-10 travel iOS mobile application in 19 countries, and the core Expedia platform boasting over 1 million properties.Expedia has a solid management team. The company’s history of acquisitions served the company well and are testimony to management’s expertise. However, the spin-off of leading metasearch platform TripAdvisor followed by the acquisition of Trivago appears to have been a misstep.Morningstar and Argus rate the company’s financial health as moderate.The company increased cash and cash equivalents markedly over the last few quarters.As I compose this article, EXPE trades for $95.01 a share.Morningstar has a FV for the company at $170, CFRA values the shares at $99.72, Argus has a target price of $160 and Credit Suisse has a target price of $159.00.I should add that Argus set the price target in July of this year. It is unknown as to whether the analyst’s opinion differs now that the 3Q results have been released. I suspect to see a modest downgrade of the price target from that source in the future.My rating system provides a score of 30/46. For an overview of my rating system, see the section near the end of the article.I consider EXPE a Buy. Perhaps I should exercise more caution, but my experience with companies that were pronounced dead due to supposed threats by Amazon (AMZN) only to have the shares bounce back big has me seeing this as a similar scenario. For me, this is an opportunistic move, and I will likely treat this as a trade rather than a long-term investment. I recognize the company must overcome a serious hurdle in terms of the Google issue, but I do not see that as an existential threat. From my perspective, the company is simply undervalued by a wide margin. I had no investment in Expedia and only entered the trade after investigating the company for this article. I believe we are witnessing a manic-market over reaction.I rate EXPE at 30/46, a high score for valuation and a solid score for the overall quality of the company. The first number represents the FV of the company and measures six valuation metrics. The highest FV score possible is a 30.The second number represents the overall score of the company. This takes into account the moat, management, past and projected growth rates, financial strength, historic ROIC, and valuation of the company. The highest score possible is a 65. A score in the 50s is rare.The rating system is far from foolproof; however, my initial testing (it has been in use for a year) indicates a combined score of 25/41 provides investment targets that often outperform the market.The overwhelming majority of companies score far below 25/41.I hope to continue providing my articles without cost to SA readers.

(NASDAQ:EXPE) is a company with solid revenue growth, but its earnings have been volatile over the last decade. While the analysts are expecting future earnings growth, the stock is priced for a lot more growth than what the analysts are expecting. I think the stock is overpriced and vulnerable to a correction if investors lose confidence in the company’s ability, so I’m on the sidelines.Expedia has generated solid revenue growth over the last decade, but its earnings have been volatile. The company operates profitably with its profit margin varying from 3% to 14% over the last decade. Over the same period, Expedia’s return on equity has ranged from 7% to 21%.The balance sheet shows that the company’s debt levels are on the higher side. The long-term debt is currently $10.7 billion, representing 50% of its total asset value. The company’s total liabilities represent 69% of its total asset value. These debt levels are a little on the high side for my liking. The reason I don’t like high debt levels is that companies find it more difficult to secure additional financing if needed. There’s also an increased risk of bankruptcy.Expedia operates with a minimal amount of working capital (with a current ratio of 0.7), meaning that its short-term assets (such as cash and deposits) do not cover its short-term liabilities (bills the company has to pay). I personally prefer current ratios above 1.0, so that the company’s bills can be paid with cash rather than having to dip into its long-term finances.Based on earnings from net income (rather than operational), Expedia’s forward PE multiple is 36x with a stock price of $116. The company’s trailing PE multiple is 43x, and its book value multiple is 4.2x. These multiples imply that Expedia is expensive. The company pays a dividend with a forward yield of 1.0% and a trailing yield of 1.1%. The dividend payout ratio is 47%.Expedia has a history of revenue growth with its revenue increasing 16% per year over the last decade. The chart below visually shows Expedia’s revenue and earnings trend over the last decade along with the next two years of consensus forecasts. The earnings per share used are net income (they are not operational earnings which some forecasts state).Expedia data by ADVFNAs the above chart shows, Expedia’s revenue has consistently increased over the last decade, and the forecasts show this trend continuing into 2020. The earnings tend to be volatile without any directional trend. The company has, however, produced a profit every year. The analysts are expecting Expedia’s earnings to increase over the next few years at the rate of 10% for 2020.Expedia is one of the largest online travel companies in the world. Its popular brands include Expedia.com, Hotels.com, TripAdvisor.com, and Vrbo.comManagement is putting a lot of effort in its Vrbo brand as they see this as a strong growth driver, with Expedia’s CFO, Alan Pickerill, stating in the company’s latest earnings call.Vrbo was acquired by HomeAway in 2006, and HomeAway was acquired by Expedia in 2015. Vrbo is short for Vacation Rental By Owner, and as the name implies, it specializes in vacation rentals, such as houses, apartments, condos, and villas. The Vrbo brand has outperformed the HomeAway brand and as such Expedia has rebranded HomeAway into Vrbo as its primary website for the alternative short-term rentals market.Mark Okerstrom - President and CEO stated,The Vrbo brand was used within the United States, and management plans to use this brand globally. For example, at present, Expedia uses website brands such as Stayz.com.au in Australia and Abritel.fr in France.Management is putting their efforts into the alternative accommodation bookings segment as they see growth potential. In an attempt to further boost growth, Expedia has taken a majority stake in SilverRail, a London-based vendor of passenger rail booking service. Expedia now has rail booking services in UK and Germany. In the future, Expedia intends to make its passenger train booking service available globally.I like that management is proactive with improving their services. The company needs to do so as it faces plenty of competition from priceline.com, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is making doing business online more difficult as it has ventured into the online travel market with the ITA acquisition. Also, smartphones allow people to search for travel information using Apps as an alternative to browsing websites. The end result is that it reduces the number of people using search engines. The company’s CFO has acknowledged this by stating,The SEO refers to Search Engine Optimization for Google searches, and Expedia relies quite heavily on these Google searches as they are free advertising. But, as search results decline, Expedia is forced to rely more heavily on paid ads, which increases operating costs.Expedia is working on improving their search results to maximize their free Google search results, with the CFO stating,While web search results are an issue for Expedia, the company has also focused on the App market with its revamped App available for Apple devices and Android devices. The App allows users to book hotels, flights and car hire.Management has done a good job increasing the company’s revenue at 16% per year over the last decade. I think that Expedia has more growth potential, but the company is facing a variety of issues that affect its bottom line, and as such, its earnings growth will continue to be an issue.Expedia has a history of revenue growth. While the earnings have been volatile, the company has made a profit every year over the last decade, and the earnings are expected to increase 10% heading into 2020. The PEG (PE divided by the earnings growth rate) can be used to arrive at a valuation based on its expected earnings growth.Using the forecast earnings growth rate of 10% gives a forward PEG of around 3.6 with a 2020 PE multiple of 36x.It’s commonly accepted that a stock is fairly valued when its forward PEG is 1.0, which means that Expedia is overvalued with a stock price of $116. Its fair value would be around $32.Most good growth stocks usually have forward PEG’s in the 1.5 to 2.5 range, but Expedia’s forward PEG of 3.6 is expensive. This is even more so as the company doesn’t have a proven history of reliable earnings growth.As an active investor, I personally like to determine some likely price targets. This gives me a feel for how high the stock price could go in the short term and how soon it could get there.Expedia chart by StockCharts.comOver the last decade, Expedia’s stock price has worked its way higher to peak in 2017. The stock pulled back to bottom in early 2018 and has traded sideways since. The more technically-orientated investors may see a symmetrical triangle chart pattern forming since the 2017 high and 2018 low, which has a height of around $60.In the short term, if the stock breaks out of the triangular pattern to the upside, then the stock could rally $60 to reach a target of around $180 within a year or so.Expedia has a history of strong revenue growth, which is expected to continue. As earnings have been volatile, and the stock is expensive based on forecast earnings, there is a risk that the triangular breakout could be to the downside.Expedia is placing a lot of emphasis on its Vrbo brand to drive growth. The company now has passenger rail booking services in the UK and Germany, with the intention of making these services available globally. Expedia is facing pressure from Apps used on mobile devices reducing the search traffic on Google. This is reducing the amount of free advertising, which means that the company must spend more on paid ads, thereby increasing operating costs. To compete with the App market, Expedia has revamped its own App.Expedia has produced solid revenue growth of 16% per year over the last decade, but the company has struggled with its earnings growth. Last fiscal year's earnings were strong, and the analysts are expecting more earnings growth going forward.The stock is quite expensive with a 2020 forward PE of 36x (based on net income). The forward PEG is 3.6, which is more than most growth stocks, and most of these have a history of earnings growth. The valuations are too high for my liking, and I think that the stock is vulnerable to a significant correction if investors lose confidence in the company."
4269999,101900,2019-06-13T00:25:56-04:00,"Tech stocks are a great source of strong returns over time as they tend to ride strong secular economic trends that can persist for decades.Dividend paying blue-chips Intel, Skyworks Solutions, and Expedia have all been beaten down in recent weeks and months over market fears related to disruption risk and the US/China trade war.This is a good time for contrarian dividend investors to buy these three quality companies at 12% to 34% discounts to fair value.Over the next five to 10 years, I expect INTC, SWKS, and EXPE to deliver strong double-digit total returns as well as safe and steadily rising dividends.Just remember that all investing is probabilistic, so never forget to use good risk management and proper asset allocation in your portfolio.","(Source: imgflip)There's nothing quite like high flying tech stocks to get investor blood flowing and boost portfolio returns. Over the last decade, the tech-dominated Nasdaq has handily outperformed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average. (Source: Ycharts)And over the longer-term as well tech stocks have proven themselves to be exceptional wealth compounders. Of course, the downside to such long periods of outperformance is valuations on many of the most popular tech stocks, including dividend payers, have gotten stretched. But fortunately, recent trade war fears have caused many tech stocks to sell off, including three blue-chip dividend growth names that I consider potentially excellent long-term buys today. These would be Intel (INTC), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), and Expedia (EXPE), all of which I've been considering for addition to my retirement portfolio (where I keep 100% of my life savings). So let's take a look at just why Wall Street is currently down on these three tech blue-chips, why those fears are likely overblown, and why these three former Wall Street darlings are now so attractively priced they are likely to deliver not just safe and growing dividends over time, but double-digit and market-beating returns in the coming years. Intel recently cut its 2019 guidance by $2.5 billion meaning it expects revenue to decline 3% this year due to losing market share in PC and X86 server chips to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). That's partially due to a multi-year delay in launching its 10nm PC and server chips, which rivals like AMD have taken advantage of by releasing 7nm chips (smaller chips are both faster and more energy efficient). Not only does this imply Intel is losing market share to a smaller but apparently more nimble rival, but its historical cash cow, PCs, is in secular decline. Analyst firm Research And Markets expects global PC sales (where Intel has historically enjoyed 80+% market share, including 85% today according to Mercury research) to drop from 325 million in 2017 to 308 million four years from now. What's more, major tech giants like Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOG) and now Amazon (AMZN) which have been a huge growth driver for the company's data center chip business, have announced plans to develop their own AI chips in-house, to help drive their advanced data center needs. And as if all that wasn't bad enough, the company recently concluded its CEO search by naming Bob Swan (interim CEO since June 2018) as its permanent CEO. Mr. Swan, the former CFO of eBay (EBAY) and Intel itself under its former CEO, is one of the few non-engineer CEOs in the semiconductor industry. Thus Wall Street may be skeptical of his abilities to adapt to the rapid pace of change the company faces. But those risks are hardly the cause of the stock's horrible recent plunge. (Source: Ycharts)In May Intel, the world's largest chip maker plunged almost twice as much as the Nasdaq. That was largely over trade war concerns. According to UBS and Lipper Financial, Intel is the 10th most China trade war sensitive company, with the top 24 names on the list dominated by tech stocks, particularly semiconductor firms. This is due to the deeply integrated supply chains which result in a high percentage of revenue coming from China (at least as far as tariffs would be concerned). (Sources: UBS, Lipper Financial)So with Intel facing so many potential short and medium-term headwinds, which have cratered the stock, why am I recommending it and considering adding it to my retirement portfolio? I am only interested in high-quality dividend stocks, meaning 8 or higher on my 11 point quality score which is heavily focused on dividend safety. After all, the glorious thing about dividend growth investing is you get paid exponentially more to own a company and let management work hard for you, so you don't have to (the essence of passive income investing). (Sources: Simply Safe Dividends)Unquestionably Intel offers a very safe dividend, courtesy of its modest FCF payout ratio, as well as a very strong balance sheet. (Sources: Simply Safe Dividends, F.A.S.T Graphs, Gurufocus, Morningstar)The company's net leverage ratio is super low, even by the standards of chip makers, and its interest coverage ratio is sky-high. Thus it's not surprising that it enjoys an A+ credit rating, which when combined with overseas borrowing (where rates are near zero) means borrowing costs of just 2%. For context the US Treasury borrows at an average interest rate of 2.6%. That's 11 times below its returns on invested capital, which are both a proxy for quality management and a source of organic earnings and cash flow growth. (Source: Simply Safe Dividends)While Intel may not be a dividend achiever, due to several years of frozen payouts, in 21 years of paying a dividend it's never been cut and the company has a generally impressive track record of steady growth over time. For most of its life since its 1968 founding, Intel was known for its computer centered microprocessors. However, the company has worked hard to diversify into faster-growing markets, including flash memory, and chips used in data centers and advanced technology such as driverless cars and other IOT industries. In 2018 47% of its sales were from this future tech segment which saw revenue growth of 21% last year, driven mostly by data center chips. (Source: investor presentation)That's a big increase from the 70% cash flow concentration the company's PC focused businesses delivered in 2013 and in the coming years Intel expects that data center focused units will grow to represent 70% of cash flow. (Source: investor presentation)That's because Intel's focus is on the future, where data centers and the internet of things, plus the 5G transition are expected to drive 7% growth in data-centric's addressable market share.(Source: investor presentation)That market size growth is expected to be powered by the rise of 5G which will enable up to 100 times faster downloads, and thus drive 20% to 35% CAGR growth in overall data usage (depending on industry). That means that by 2023, Intel estimates its most profitable and fastest growing business lines will represent an addressable market that's more than triple the size of the gradually declining PC and server market. And in AI chips, (43% market share in 2018), Intel expects the market size to grow over 20% CAGR through 2023, increasing 150% to $10 billion over the next five years.Better yet, this faster-growing part of its business is also more profitable, resulting in most of its profits (53%) already coming from the thriving data-centric business segment. Intel's big competitive advantage is size and access to a mountain of low-cost capital, both low-cost borrowing, and its own retained free cash flow ($8.8 billion in 2018). This allows it to invest in state of the art chip-making plants (which can take several years and $5 to $8 billion to construct), as well as make acquisitions both big and small. For example, in 2015 it paid $16.7 billion for Altera (which ultimately gave it its booming data center chip business) and then in 2017, it bought Mobileye for $15.3 billion. Mobileye is a leader in driverless car tech that Intel estimates will represent a $100 billion addressable market for its chips by 2030. (Source: investor presentation)Mobileye's driverless car tech is now in over 24 million cars worldwide its sales growth remains over 40% annually. That's courtesy of signing up over 70 global automakers in the last three years to use its platform. (Source: Investor presentation)But the vast majority of the company's recent M&A activity is focused on smaller tuck-in acquisitions to boost its data analytics/software security applications. That's a good thing since the Harvard Business Review estimates that about 80% of large-scale M&A fails to deliver shareholder value. And while its PC and X86 server chips may not be a source of significant future growth they remain high margin cash cows for now. Intel (and analysts) are confident that EUV lithography tech will allow it to succeed in delivering its 7nm chips with far less difficulty than its 10nm ones, by 2021. Management is confident that its long-term plans will deliver about 5.4% CAGR revenue growth between 2019 and 2023 ($69 billion to $85 billion). The company plans to increase margins by cutting capex as a percentage of revenue from 36% in 2015 to 25% by 2021. (Source: investor presentation)The company has actually been able to deliver such efficiency savings over the past few years, while not sacrificing where it counts (R&D). That's what's allowed its businesses to thrive, delivering impressive sales growth. (Source: investor presentation)Over the next five years, Intel expects that 5.4% sales growth to translate into 5.6% to 7% EPS growth, and FCF/share growth slightly above that due to higher FCF/earnings conversion rates. Buybacks at low prices could help the company exceed those modest expectations. Intel has repurchased 4.7% of its shares over the past year, taking advantage of its weak stock price. It has another $14.9 billion left under its current authorization which could potentially buyback about 7.5% of outstanding shares at current prices. Aggressive buybacks during a period of share price weakness is a major advantage companies with strong free cash flow and A rated balance sheets enjoy. (Source: Ycharts)Over the past three decades, Intel has delivered about 15.5% CAGR total returns, crushing both the Nasdaq and S&P 500. And given the super low PE right now, it may be able to deliver similar or even better returns over the next five to ten years. (Source: F.A.S.T Graphs)Analysts currently expect management to exceed its roughly 6.5% growth guidance, with Factset Research reporting the analyst consensus at 10% EPS growth over the next five years. Historically Intel trades at 19.1 times earnings, but today just 10.5. Even assuming a more conservative 15.0 PE by the end of 2024, that still delivers over 20% annualized total returns. For context private equity and venture capital funds strive to achieve 20% CAGR returns, due to the high-risk and illiquid nature of their investing strategies.Intel offers conservative income investors the potential for private equity/venture capital returns, but in a low-risk, and perfectly liquid dividend growth blue-chip. That's the power of opportunistic, deep value blue-chip investing. But even if you take management at its word and assume much more modest growth estimates, then as I show in the valuation/total return section, Intel still makes for an attractive dividend growth stock from today's valuations.Skyworks is primarily a maker of radio frequency chips for smartphones with just over 70% of revenue derived from smartphone chips. With 4G based handsets now appearing to be saturated, global smartphone sales have stalled. No significant increase in handsets is expected until 5G rolls out, which is still a few years away.Wall Street is notorious for its 12-month price target and next quarter's focus, and so naturally this medium-term secular trend would be expected to create negative sentiment for the stock.  Global Smartphone Sales (Source: Statista)And as far as US/China trade war sensitive companies go, according to UBS's research, Skyworks is the most at risk with 80% of revenue coming from the middle kingdom (it was also the most exposed to a Mexican trade war with 39% of assets in Mexico according to Goldman Sachs). Huawei made up 12% of the company's sales in the first half of fiscal 2019. According to a recent report in the Nikkei Asian review, Huawei is expected to cut its phone shipments in the second half of this year about 25%.Due to the current inclusion of Huawei on America's Entity list, the company had to recently issue a downward revision in guidance, which the short-term focused market absolutely hates. Here are the specific revisions to fiscal Q3 guidance.The market's doomsday fears include the trade war lasting long enough to potentially bankrupt Huawei which would mean that the temporary 12% hit to revenue would become permanent. (Source: Motley Fool)And the Huawei ban came after the company was already suffering a weak first half to fiscal 2019, and is now almost certain to face a double-digit decline in revenue and adjusted earnings. What's more, about 40% of 2018 sales came from Apple (AAPL) a company that has also been rocked by trade war fears and a lot of uncertainty (including an estimated 30% decline in phone shipments in Q1). In essence, when it comes to short-term risk, Skyworks is one of the most at risk of short-term market volatility, driven by hyper-bearish sentiment and wild speculation about the potential death of a major client (Huawei). (Source: Ycharts)Which is why Skyworks was one of the most hammered stocks in May's decline, itself the second worst May for the market since the 1960s. However, as long-time readers know I consider myself a time arbitrageur, meaning I buy what the market hates today, over fears for a rough tomorrow, because my focus is always on the long-term future. And I still believe Skyworks has an excellent long-term growth runway that should result in great dividend growth and strong capital gains in the coming years and decades. (Source: Ycharts)Chipmakers are usually some of the most volatile tech stocks, which is itself generally a high beta sector. And Skyworks, over time, has averaged a beta (volatility relative to S&P 500) of about 1.8, making it one of the most volatile blue-chips you can own. (Source: Ycharts)It's a proven market smasher, BUT that outperformance comes at the expense of gut-wrenching volatility, courtesy of the cyclical and economically sensitive nature of its business model.That includes the April 2018 15% crash, when the stock plummeted on news of the US ZTE parts ban which threatened to bankrupt that phone maker (President Trump eventually intervened as part of trade negotiations and saved that Chinese company).Of course, the same volatility that scares off less risk tolerant investors also creates precisely the opportunity for large profits for those who don't mind ""being greedy when others are fearful"" and buying quality companies like this at March 2009 style valuations. I recently bought an opening position in Skyworks at $70.89 (10.7X forward EPS vs 10.3 S&P 500 PE in March 2009). I moved up my weekly stock buy to Monday after positive China trade news broke and the US/Mexican trade war was called off. While I'm not a market timer, it seems logical that a company as undervalued as Skyworks could rapidly soar given even modest improvement in its short-term risk profile. But personally, I make my investing decisions based on the long-term dividend risk profile, which accounts for 45% of my 11 point quality score (what determines blue-chip and SWAN status of my watchlist companies). (Sources: Simply Safe Dividends)Skyworks offers a safe dividend, that's slightly above the market's average yield. That's both courtesy of a low FCF payout ratio, but also one of the strongest balance sheets on Wall Street. (Sources: Simply Safe Dividends, F.A.S.T Graphs, Gurufocus, Morningstar)Few companies have net cash positive balance sheets (more cash than debt) and even fewer have no debt at all. Skyworks is one of those companies and also sports $957 million in cash to support the dividend, opportunistic buybacks, and to reinvest in the company including $417 million in R&D over the past 12 months (11% of revenue). Smart and focused R&D spending is why the company has 2,600 patents on its portfolio of 2,500 analog chips. (Source: Simply Safe Dividends)And while Skyworks' dividend track record may be short (why it's not a 5/5 safety score), it shows impressive growth of that safe payout. What about the market worry that Skyworks' high revenue concentration in troubled phone makers like Apple and Huawei could doom it? While the risk of that isn't zero, I consider it a low probability event, and I'm not the only one. Here's Morningstar's take on the company's short and long-term prospects. Remember that the key to doing well in chip makers is to buy when they are most undervalued, i.e. when the market is most fearful about short-term results. Skyworks' bullish thesis isn't based on a strong 2019 or 2020 but on great sales, earnings and cash flow growth in 2021 and beyond, courtesy of the 5G transition (that will make possible the Internet of Things or IOT). 4G phones are using an increasing number of frequencies, and 5G chips are expected to be even more complex, creating big opportunities for chip makers with strong expertise in quality RF chips that switch, amplify and filter wireless signals.According to Mordor Intelligence, 5G chips are expected to grow 75% CAGR in the coming years. And according to management Skyworks expects to earn 40% more per 5G phone than it does for 4G ones ($25 vs $18). (Source: investor presentation)Over the years Skyworks has been able to pack ever more of its components into telecom equipment, meaning steadily higher monetization with each new generation of smartphone tech. That trend is expected to continue with 5G and 6G after that (the Fin's are already planning for that). 6G is expected to offer about 100 Gbps download speeds (roughly 800 times faster than 4G) with even lower latency than 5G and start rolling out commercially in the late 2020s. (Source: investor presentation)Skyworks' goal is to continue integrating various chip parts, so it can provide global leaders in technology with every standard they set, from LTE to WiFi, to Bluetooth. And small cell 5G solutions are expected to grow from a $12.5 billion annual market to $58 billion by 2024, providing the company with a great opportunity to diversify away from handsets. Then there are IOT chips, which management plans to cash in on (75 billion connected devices by 2025). IOT opportunities include driverless cars, which are expected to grow to 60 million sales per year by 2030. (Source: Ptolemus Consulting Group)Skyworks is already working with most leading automakers on 5G chips that will enable autonomous cars, which by 2020 alone management expects will represent a $17.5 billion annual addressable market. (Source: investor presentation)And driverless cars are just the most headline-grabbing use of the IOT. As Morningstar's Brian Colello explains, Skyworks' decades of R&D give it the potential to become a ""leading RF supplier into a wider array of other industries, such as industrial, medical, and networking and wireless infrastructure equipment.""Does that mean Skyworks is going to dominate the future of chips? No, plenty of large rivals such as Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), another chip maker I plan to buy eventually, are also working on competing solutions. But Skyworks thesis isn't about become the sole winner in 5G chips, just one industry leader among several. Basically, Skyworks is hard at work focused on increasing its growth catalysts beyond mere smartphones, and the company's growth runway appears both large and long. M&A is a final way to accelerate its diversification and the company has a good track record on that front. In 2011 it acquired SiGe Semi for $210 million, and Advanced Analogic Tech for $263 million. Both purchases helped to broaden its product portfolio, which has helped drive its impressive growth over the years. (Source: investor presentation)And let's not forget the benefit of a pristine balance sheet loaded with almost $1 billion in cash. The company can and often does take advantage of its sky-high volatility to make opportunistic share repurchases, including $142 million in fiscal Q2 buybacks that reduced the share count 5% over the past year. (Source: Simply Safe Dividends)Over the past 3.25 years, the company has been reducing its share count at 2.6% CAGR and the current share price is allowing it to double that rate. Every share repurchased below intrinsic value benefits existing investors and helps grow FCF/share faster, allowing the company to maintain its short but impressive track record of rapid dividend growth. (Source: investor presentation)Management's long-term goal is to outgrow its overall industry (gain market share) and use ever greater economies of scale to boost operating margins to 40% (up from 32% in 2018). FCF margins, which ultimately funds the dividend, are eventually expected to triple to 30%, which would mean fantastic long-term payout growth potential. That's because management expects to return about 67% of free cash flow over time via dividends and buybacks. Even if Skyworks doesn't achieve those ambitious profitability targets (Morningstar expects peak operating margins of just 38%) the company is still likely to grow FCF/share at close to double-digits. (Source: F.A.S.T Graphs)According to Factset Research, analysts expect the company to deliver 9.5% CAGR EPS and FCF/share growth over the next five years, even with all the trade war (and potential recession) headwinds. If the PE ratio were to rise to Chuck Carnevale's 15.0 rule of thumb (far below the SWKS's 20.4 historical PE) then investors could see 20.5% CAGR total returns in the coming five years. Basically, Skyworks is a leading RF chip maker whose long-term thesis is based on 5G and the IOT, not 2019 or 2020 results. Those are likely to be negatively impacted by the US/China trade war which will eventually end and thus doesn't represent a thesis breaking event. The fortress-like balance sheet (nearly $1 billion in cash with no debt) not just makes for a safe dividend, but also allows the company to repurchase significant amounts of deeply undervalued stock, as it's been doing. In essence, I see little reason to believe this company's long-term dividend growth thesis is broken and thus the recent crash likely represents an excellent buying opportunity for volatility tolerant income investors. (Source: Ycharts)Unlike chipmakers, who are staring down the barrel of direct US/China trade disruption, Expedia merely had a very bad May, rather than a horrendous one. But it still declined by nearly 10%. That's due to secular macroeconomic fears as well as some concerns over its business model. One long-term risk the market may be worried about is disruption by the likes of Airbnb, which is a threat to its VRBO (formerly HomeAway) vacation home rental business. In Q1 VRBO (which makes up 10% of the company's revenue) reported 5% gross bookings growth and 14% revenue growth.Wall Street was disappointed, however, with Susquehanna analyst Shyam Patil believing that Airbnb is winning market share and thus downgraded the stock. I'm not nearly as concerned given that the slowdown in the growth of vacation home bookings was due to an advertising shift away from some of the company's alternative home booking sites towards VRBO, which management said temporarily hurt SEO (search engine optimization) results. The company remains confident its more streamlined approach is the right call for stronger future growth. That's because management wants to launch the new streamlined VRBO site internationally, which is what it's been working towards over the last few months. Besides, Expedia's most recent results, which got Wall Street all riled up, actually showed good growth of 7% in revenue, 9% in gross bookings and adjusted EBITDA that rose 42% YOY. And for the full year, the company expects adjusted EBITDA to grow 10% to 15%, which is in-line with long-term analyst growth estimates. 12.5% adjusted EBITDA growth is also very good considering the increased growth spending this year. There is also disruption risk from the likes of Amazon (AMZN) which recently announced it would start selling discounted plane tickets in India. While Amazon has given no indication that it is considering directly competing with Expedia's online travel agency business model, the market can be highly irrational in the short-term and whenever Bezos announces he's entering a new industry shares of major industry players often take a tumble. It's important to remember that Amazon has tried its hand at travel before, including limited hotel bookings in 2014 (an actual competitor to Expedia). That venture failed and was shut down in 2015. A more plausible threat to Expedia is rate parity regulation, which prevents hotels from offering rooms cheaper on their own websites than on sites like Expedia's. Such regulations benefit Expedia and might eventually be removed in the US as they have been in Europe (where Expedia is still growing steadily). However, it's important to remember that as a dominant player in this space, Expedia might actually benefit, since it has far more scale to undercut weaker rivals on price. In other words, any significant negative impact to its business model would bankrupt smaller peers and allow Expedia to potentially consolidate the industry and actually gain market share. But one risk the market is worried about is rational, the rising threat of recession. Travel is a luxury and during economic downturns travel sites like Expedia suffer. During the Great RecessionThe trade war escalating in May caused many to worry that a recession might be coming soon. That's not a crazy fear given that many leading economists and analysts are warning about the highest recession risk in a decade. For example, Morgan Stanley put the US on ""recession watch"" in late May, citing April economic data that it says indicates that even before China tariffs were raised on May 10th, the US was at high risk of a recession in 2020. Similarly, the Cleveland Fed (which the New York Fed's model agrees with) estimates that the average 12-month recession risk in May was about 35%. That's the highest level in 10 years, and at a level that is consistent with a recession potentially beginning by mid-2020. However, while there are certainly real risks to worry about with Expedia (like all companies) ultimately that's why you want to buy undervalued companies, with high margins of safety (and safe dividends) that have the financial fortitude to ride out such inevitable downturns and come out the other side stronger than ever. Again, my analysis of any company begins with the dividend safety, because I'm only interested in buying or recommending companies who are likely to maintain or even continue growing their payouts throughout a full economic cycle. (Sources: Simply Safe Dividends)I consider Expedia's dividend very safe, courtesy of an extremely low FCF payout ratio and a great balance sheet. (Sources: Simply Safe Dividends, F.A.S.T Graphs, Gurufocus, Morningstar)The company's net leverage ratio is very low and its operating cash flow covers its interest costs nicely. It also enjoys a good BBB rated investment grade credit rating allowing it to borrow at about half its returns on invested capital. (Source: Ycharts)But like Intel and Skyworks, this tech stock, while a proven market beater over time, can be highly volatile, especially when market volatility rises due to macroeconomic concerns. This is where it's important to take a long-term view and remember that how a company does this year or the next is far less important than its long-term earnings, cash flow, and dividend growth potential. (Source: Simply Safe Dividends)As you can see Expedia is another young dividend-paying tech stock. The apparent 2012 dividend cut was actually the result of a reverse split, related to the spin-off of Tripadvisor (TRIP). That ""cut"" is actually the reason Simply Safe Dividends (where I'm an analyst) rates the stock safe (above average safety compared to the average US corporation) rather than very safe. Given that the company isn't likely to make large scale spinoffs in the future, I consider the current fundamentals supportive of a very safe dividend score. However, I will admit that the TRIP spinoff was a questionable call by management, and would have preferred they not make such a move so soon after initiating a dividend. Furthermore, it seems a bit questionable that Expedia spun off the largest metasearch platform at the time, just to buy a smaller and less impressive one (acquiring the majority of Trivago in 2012 for $632 million). That's one of the reasons I don't rate the company higher on management quality. That being said most of management's capital allocation decisions have been far more satisfactory. That includes acquiring Travelocity, Wotif Group, Orbitz Worldwide (Orbitz, CheapTickets, and ebookers) and HomeAway (now VRBO) since 2015 and Egencia in 2016. Expedia is led by CEO Mark Okerstrom, who has been in the top job two years but is a 13 year veteran of the company. He's helped to build Expedia (as vice president of corporate development and CFO) into one of the largest online travel sites in the world, with 5.9% of global market share in 2018, which analysts expect to rise to about 7.7% within five years. In terms of online travel sites Expedia and Booking Holdings (BKNG, formerly Priceline), both command about 35% market share. 6% global market share might not sound like much but keep in mind that, according to Oxford Economics, the global travel industry is about $2.4 trillion in size (3% of the global economy) making it the 7th largest industry on earth. (Source: Oxford Economics)It also happens to be the second fast growing behind banking, meaning that Expedia has a lot of growth runway ahead of it courtesy of steadily gaining market share in such a highly fragmented industry. (Source: Oxford Economics)Expedia's massive industry lead is due to steadily building up a collection of 19 online travel sites including Expedia actually has the world's largest collection of rentable homes (1.8 million, 1.1 million on its core Expedia platform) located in over 200 countries and territories. Its sites also offer over 500 airlines, packages, rental cars, cruises, insurance, as well as destination services and activities for vacationers to enjoy. Expedia has been aggressive in shifting with the growth of mobile, and in 2018 1/3 of their bookings are done though mobile apps. Its core Expedia mobile app is among the #10 travel apps in 21 countries around the world, according to App Annie. Expedia's main competitive advantage, and what it plans to use to compete with Booking and metasearch sites like Kayak.com, Tripadvisor, Skyscanner and Qunar (subsidiaries of Chinese rival Ctrip) is leveraging its strong network effects and massive financial advantage. The network effect Expedia enjoys is the fact that it has collected so many top tier travel locations, airlines, hotels, cruise lines, on its platform, in nearly every country on earth. Rivals, of which there are hundreds, are smaller and lack the connections or deep pockets to build up a database that's anywhere close to what it and Booking offer.Maintaining dominance in the online travel agency industry doesn't just require listing popular locations, hotels/rental homes, etc. It also requires extensive IT, data center, and 24/7 customer support infrastructure that is costly to build. And let's not forget the importance of advertising. Expedia spent $4.7 billion in 2018 on marketing which only Booking can match ($4.9 billion). And of course, there's the fact that converting online visitors into customers gets a lot easier the more data you have to analyze, via AI-driven algorithms. While it's true that companies like Alphabet are potential rivals Expedia will have to deal with (that have it beat on data and understanding customers) the company has a pretty good first mover advantage built up over the past 20 years. In the coming years, Expedia's plan is to invest most aggressively in international operations (32% of its business right now), as well as home rentals (via VRBO). It plans to slightly increase marketing as part of this growth initiative, and those costs it hopes to offset via increased efficiency in data analytics and higher conversion rates from its current user base. Morningstar, one of the most conservative analyst firms covering Wall Street, expects operating margins to double over the next five years. Combine rising margins with revenue growth of roughly 8% to 9% generated by the fact that just 45% of the global travel market is currently online, and it's easy to see why Expedia has huge long-term growth potential. That's not to say you can expect early dot com growth rates. But the 12% to 13% long-term EPS and FCF/share growth rates that most analysts expect (according to FactSet Research) seems reasonable to me given management' track record, the company's large financial advantages, and the growth runway before it. Dividends should ultimately grow in line with free cash flow, though the low payout ratio might allow payout growth to outpace them (payout ratio expansion). Ultimately all my stock recommendations (and retirement portfolio buys) are driven by the desire for safe dividends. Combined with good long-term growth and valuations returning to fair value, these are likely to generate market-beating and preferably double-digit total returns over time. (Source: Simply Safe Dividends, management guidance, F.A.S.T Graphs, Morningstar, management guidance, Yardeni Research, Yahoo Finance, Multipl.com, Gordon Dividend Growth Model, Dividend Yield Theory, Moneychimp, analyst estimates)While tech stocks aren't known for their generous yields, I consider Intel, Skyworks, and Expedia to offer a good mix of yield, growth and potential valuation boost that can likely make income growth investors pleased in the coming years. Even assuming no valuation improvement all three should outperform the S&P 500 over the coming five to 10 years. But since valuation always matters I also adjust for that (more on this in a second) which is where these three really shine. Intel, for example, should be capable of close to double-digit total returns even assuming the low end of management's long-term guidance. To adjust for historical valuations, I turn to my favorite blue-chip valuation method, dividend yield theory or DYT. This has been the only approach used by asset manager/newsletter publisher Investment Quality Trends since 1966. DYT, which compares a stock's yield to its historical norm, has been the only approach IQT has used for 53 years, and only on blue-chips, to deliver market-beating returns with 10% lower volatility to boot.(Source: Investment Quality Trends)According to Hulbert Financial Digest, IQT's 30-year risk-adjusted total returns are the best of any US investing newsletter. Basically, DYT is the most effective long-term valuation approach I've yet found, which is why it's at the heart of my retirement portfolio's strategy and drives many of my article recommendations.DYT merely compares a company's yield to its historical norm because, assuming the business model remains relatively stable over time, yields, like most valuation metrics, tend to revert to historical levels that approximate fair value.(Sources: Simply Safe Dividends, Dividend Yield Theory, Gordon Dividend Growth Model, F.A.S.T Graphs, management guidance, Moneychimp)DYT says that Skyworks and Expedia are highly attractive buys at the moment, while Intel looks close to fair value. However, remember the tech sector is higher risk in terms of more rapid change. Which is why I also like to confirm my valuations with Morningstar's industry experts, who use very conservative growth estimates in their long-term discounted cash flow fair value models. I use DYT as one end of my valuation range, and Morningstar's intrinsic value estimates as the other, to minimize the chance of a thesis breaking event causing me to incorrectly recommend putting money (including my own) into a value trap. (Source: Morningstar)You'll note that uncertainty surrounding fair value estimates is higher in the tech sector than it is in most others (due to higher disruption risk). However, all three of these tech blue-chips are extremely undervalued according to Morningstar, even factoring in more conservative growth than most analysts. For example, even though Morningstar expects management to miss its long-term operating margin target by 2%, it still considers Skyworks undervalued by 30%. Such high margins of safety (i.e. low market expectations) are always a smart strategy when dealing with an uncertain future. For my official valuation estimates, I average DYT and Morningstar's fair value estimates (the mid-point of the valuation range) Dividend Sensei Blue-Chip Valuation ScaleUnder my personal valuation scale, Intel is a strong buy, Expedia is a very strong buy, and Skyworks (the company I just bought for my portfolio) is an ultra-strong buy.Just remember that all investing is probabilistic (as Peter Lynch said, ""in this business, if you're good you're right six times out of ten."") so always use good risk management and the proper asset allocation for your needs. The most important risk management rules are asset allocation (93.6% of volatility is determined by your mix of stocks/bonds/cash) and individual holding sizes. While my risk tolerance is higher than most people's (thus why I'm 100% in stocks) I am keeping my position sizing to 5% or less for new money to avoid any individual company failures from blowing up my portfolio. Don't get me wrong, the nature of technology is rapid change which always comes with disruption risk. Add to that the current US/China trade war, which threatens to potentially devastate chip makers (under an unlikely but possible worst case scenario) and it's easy to understand why Intel and Skyworks have been so badly mauled in the last few weeks. However, such periods of fear, uncertainty, and doubt are precisely the kind of long-term buying opportunities value-focused dividend investors such as myself look for. After all, you don't get to buy an industry leading blue-chip like Skyworks (as I recently did) for 10.7 times forward earnings and a 30+% discount to fair value without the market being hyper-focused on all that might go wrong to derail the bullish thesis. For volatility tolerant investors who don't mind headline risk, and who own any tech company as part of a well-diversified and constructed portfolio (proper asset allocation and risk management), I consider Intel, Skyworks, and Expedia to be some of the dividend growth blue-chips you can buy today. Each offers a safe and steadily growing dividend, backed up by strong balance sheets, good management, and attractive long-term growth prospects. The combination of all three makes these blue-chips likely market-beaters in the coming five to 10 years, as well as good sources of safe and growing income, which is the primary goal of myself and most of my followers."
4269431,104847,2019-06-10T11:56:36-04:00,"Growth of HomeAway sector will provide significant revenue moving forward and competition to AirBnB.
        Present value of future cash flows and multiple comparisons with other companies in industry prove that Expedia is undervalued at $120.
        Expedia can increase cash to spend on marketing of higher margin segments by conducting a sale of Egencia department.","The travel agency industry is a quality investment route as it has proven to be recession resistant. During a recession consumers are even more desperate to find the bargains on travel so a travel agent is the perfect place to search for all accommodations for their trip. After performing a Discounted Cash Flow valuation model, comparable company analysis, and a deep dive into what sectors of the business generate the greatest margins I believe that Expedia (EXPE) is undervalued and can generate even greater returns by selling their Egencia segment.One of the largest growing competitors to travel agencies today is AirBnB as people are preferring to stay at residences as opposed to hotels. In 2015 Expedia acquired HomeAway as an adaptation to this trend and it has paid off significantly. HomeAway is a rapidly growing alternative accommodations company and it has helped Expedia diversify their system of services as they can now provide the local residence vacations that many travelers are looking for. As you can see from the excerpt of Expedia’s FY2018 10K below, the majority of revenue is still driven by the “Merchant” business model but the HomeAway business model has experienced the most rapid revenue growth with a 32% bump in 2017 and an increase of 29% in 2018. The merchant business model provides hotel bookings for customers and it is no surprise that this sector has experienced slower growth. I believe that HomeAway will become a more and more important source of revenue for Expedia over the next 2-3 years.Expedia is broken up into four main sectors: Core Online Travel Agency, Trivago, HomeAway, and Egencia. The Core Online Travel Agency is the largest segment and it provides a variety of travel and advertising services through a portfolio of brands. Trivago represents the media and advertising expertise of Expedia. HomeAway is the second largest segment of Expedia and it provides alternative accommodations. Egencia provides the exact same services as the Core Online Travel Agency except it is more focused on the corporate traveler. I believe that Expedia can increase value moving forward by conducting a spin-off of their Egencia segment. Egencia is facing many competitors in the corporate travel agency space such as Trip Actions, Travel Perk, and Travel Store. This segment of Expedia has also produced the smallest revenue margins over the years hovering around just 7.5% while Core OTA and HomeAway are at around 10.5%. The sale of Egencia could decrease the costs of Expedia and increase their efficiency in generating revenue. It would also decrease the cost of Selling and Marketing which has been the greatest expense for Expedia in the last three years. Creating a relationship with an investment bank who can find a buyer for the Egencia segment would rid Expedia of their lowest revenue generator on margin and provide the company with cash that can be spent towards marketing their more valuable sectors such as the Core OTA and HomeAway.Expedia currently trades at $120 but I believe that with the company’s strong ability to generate cash it should be trading higher. I have attached an image of my Discounted Cash Flow model below and I believe that I made some conservative assumptions to come to my valuation. I used the same WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) across all five years in my forecast and I believe that the low cost of debt caused by today’s incredibly low risk-free rate (2.13% on 10-Year Treasury Bill) leads to an unreasonably low discount rate. The current state of the economy that features an inversion in the yield curve makes the longer-term debt cheaper. I do not expect the cost of debt to be this low for Expedia moving forward and I believe that this led to a higher than realistic valuation of the company. However, I believe I mitigated for this optimistic WACC by using a Free Cash Flow growth rate of 6% for the next five years as opposed to the analyst expected growth rate of 9%. This led to a more conservative valuation that I believe helped mitigate for the unusually low discount rate. I used this growth rate of 6% for the next five years.I believe that in approximately five years’ time Expedia’s run of steady growth will slow as companies such as AirBnB grow to a size in which it significantly damages Expedia’s hotel booking segment. At this point in time I decreased the growth rate down to 1% (which I believe is once again a conservative assumption). As a result I realize a valuation of $300 per share which I believe is high given the low input of cost of debt into the WACC but I believe it is very telling as to this stock being severely undervalued. Although I do not believe this stock is worth $300 I feel that when we compare this valuation with the multiple analysis I will dive into below this company is one of the best value plays in its industry.Expedia also appeared to be very attractive when lined up with its comparable companies. I performed a brief comparable company analysis of a few of its relevant multiples in comparison to Booking Holdings (BKNG), TripAdvisor (TRIP), and Ctrip.com International (CTRP). Expedia has a smaller Enterprise Value (EV) than Ctrip.com yet boasts greater EBITDA. Expedia also has the lowest Price/FCF of the four companies at 13.35 as well as the lowest EV/EBITDA at 10.07. These lower than industry average multiples further prove that the company is undervalued from a Free Cash Flow perspective and generates earnings more efficiently than its competitors.Although I believe that my DCF overstates the per share value of Expedia given the low WACC caused by the current state of risk-free rates it is still very telling as to just how undervalued Expedia is. I took a conservative approach to the current and future growth rate which decreased my valuation and helped balance out the low discount rate. My main reason for the low growth rates moving forward was the threat of AirBnB leading to a different preference in traveling but I believe that if Expedia can put more investment into marketing their HomeAway segment they can compete with the alternative accommodation companies. I believe that the best way to do this is by spinning off the inefficient Egencia segment and using the cash gained to better market the higher revenue generating departments at Expedia. When compared with its peers in already recession resistant industry, Expedia is a great value and I believe that its current market price of $120 is well below the value that its future cash flows suggest."
4243395,105007,2019-02-22T14:20:03-05:00,"Expedia has stamped out consistent year-over-year organic growth in excess of 10% and generates significant unlevered free cash flow.
        The global travel services industry is largely recession resistant and Expedia performed well during the last recession.
        Despite an unlevered free cash flow yield that is materially higher than that of the S&P 500 Index, Expedia’s shares need to be ~40% lower before initiating a new position.","Expedia (EXPE) appeared on my screen that narrows the list of possible companies to invest in from nearly 65,000 to 68. While EPXE was one of the final 68 companies that appeared on the screen and despite a significant correction in its share price, it is not yet ready for initiating a new investment position. However, I would recommend putting it on your watch list in the event share prices fall further.I am a proponent of utilizing a screening process as it removes personal bias from the investment process. The screen does not take into account news headlines, talking heads on TV, or tips from your brother in law.The key components to the screen are its two quantitative metrics: 1) unlevered free cash flow (UFCF) yield and 2) revenue growth rate.UFCF yield is calculated as the average of the last five years’ cash unlevered free cash flows divided by the current enterprise value. In words, this metric shows the yield (think bond yield) an investor would receive if he / she bought the entire company and put its cash flows into his / her pocket (think clipping coupons).But unlike a bond, companies have the opportunity to grow, which is why revenue growth is the second part of the screen. I use revenue growth in the screen as a proxy for growth in UFCF and then, through fundamental analysis, validate the stability and growth of UFCF.The chart below shows how the screen works at each step in the process.The global travel market is estimated at $1.7 trillion and is growing at an annual rate of 4.6%. EXPE currently has approximately 5.5% market share of the global market and is growing faster than the overall market, which is driven by 1) general adoption of online travel agencies (OTAs), which are growing faster than the overall market, 2) the rapidly expanding home rental market, and 3) EXPE completing strategic add-on acquisitions.OTAs have been consistently taking market share away from brick and mortar travel agents for years. In the mid-1990s, there were 34,000 travel agencies in the United States, in 2013 there were just 13,000. The online travel market is forecasted to grow 12% per year until 2023, driven largely by increased internet penetration, more disposable income in emerging markets, and extra convenience compared to brick and mortar agencies.The burgeoning home rental market is experiencing explosive growth as individual homeowners seek to generate ancillary income and monetize their investments in their homes. The number of properties available in EXPE’s alternative accommodations segment (which includes HomeAway, VRBO, among others) grew at a breakneck pace of 40% in 2018. There are now more than one million properties available on EXPE’s platform, which will likely increase customer loyalty and attract a broader composition of customers.Expedia’s HomeAway business recently acquired Pillow and ApartmentJet to expand its offerings in alternative accommodations. The two companies will provide property owners with transparency and control over their rental contracts and assist them in finding tenants. EXPE’s management continues to search for other add-on acquisition targets that provide strategic value to the overall company.Analyst consensus estimates forecast EXPE’s annual revenue growth at ~10% for each of the next three years, well in excess of the overall market’s growth. Additionally, consensus estimates are for EBITDA margins over the next three years to improve from 2018’s levels. Investments in technology are increasing EXPE’s operating efficiencies and are enabling the aforementioned improvement in profitability.Source: Company 2018 earnings slidesThe OTA and home rental markets are actively growing and are dominated by large players, EXPE being one of them. Players compete vigorously for share of the existing market as well as for the consumers that are trying OTAs for the first time. There is little functionality differentiation between the major platforms, so competition is largely based on breadth of service offerings and marketing strategies.Consolidation of the OTA sector has created an effective duopoly with EXPE between Booking Holdings (BKNG). BKNG owns priceline.com, booking.com, KAYAK, among other popular websites. EXPE and BKNG compete head-to-head with each other in many respects, but also have their own many points of differentiation. Some highlights below:EXPE and BKNG are similar in size, but EXPE has a more entrenched footprint in the US while BKNG is a more dominant player in Europe. EXPE has a more diversified product offering than BKNG, but that comes with sacrificing margin as hotel bookings are more profitable than air.OTAs are also beginning to compete with Google, who has long served as a meta search engine (searches results from bookings providers like EXPE and makes money from selling advertisements) and competes with other meta search engines like TripAdvisor (TRIP). Recently, however, Google has made inroads to allowing users to book travel directly with Google, which makes it a competitive threat and a possible third major competitor to OTAs.In the home rental market, EXPE’s HomeAway division competes with Airbnb. Airbnb is the leading player in this segment with an estimated $2.6 billion in revenue in 2017, which is 2.9x larger than HomeAway’s revenue for the same year.EXPE generates revenue based on commissions from travel spend. In 2018, EXPE’s gross bookings (i.e. the total amount EXPE’s customers spent on travel) were $99.7 billion. EXPE’s revenue margin (i.e. commission on total spend) was 11.3%, which drove EXPE’s 2018 revenue of $11.2 billion. Net margin is consistent year over year, which means EXPE’s total revenue is driven off of its customers’ aggregate travel spend.EXPE has a highly diverse set of global brands touching all aspects of travel: car, air, hotel, rail, consumer and corporate. A summary of EXPE’s brands and business units are highlighted in the charts below.Source: Company 2018 10-KSource: S&P Capital IQEXPE has generated impressive historical growth rates on both a total revenue basis and an organic basis. EXPE routinely makes acquisitions, so it is important to analyze organic growth. The company’s largest recent acquisitions were of HomeAway in December 2015 and Orbitz in September 2015.HomeAway’s total purchase price was $4.2 billion, which represented a whopping 6.8x LTM revenue and 54.1x LTM EBITDA. However, the company’s EBITDA was on pace to more than double the year following the acquisition, which brought the NTM EBITDA multiple down to 24.2x. HomeAway has continued to grow into its purchase price. Purchase price as a multiple of LTM EBITDA for the period ending 9/30/18 has fallen to 14.2x (EBITDA was $297 million), in line with EXPE’s long-term average.Orbitz’s total purchase price was $1.9 billion, which represented 1.8x LTM revenue and 12.0x LTM EBITDA.The estimated effect of these acquisitions and other acquisitions have been removed from the organic growth calculations below. EXPE’s organic annual growth has been consistently strong and in excess of 10%.Source Data: S&P Capital IQSource Data: S&P Capital IQEXPE’s gross margins have remained consistent over the past 10 years. EBITDA margins have declined due to an increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenue, which was driven mostly from an increase and selling and marketing expenses.As a percentage of revenue, selling and marketing expenses increased from 43% in 2012 to 51% in 2018, due mostly to increases for trivago, Brand Expedia, Expedia Affiliate Network, and Hotels.com.Heath Terry, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, is not concerned with Expedia’s increase in advertising. “We believe TripAdvisor and Booking’s recent ad spend rationalization puts Expedia in a better relative position. We believe we have seen evidence of this during recent periods where Expedia was able to drive bookings growth acceleration alongside leverage in ad spend.” Expedia has to increase ad spend in order to remain competitive, but it sets itself apart from the rest by simultaneously accelerating bookings growth. Since TripAdvisor and Booking’s are focusing more on margins rather than growth, Expedia’s long-term thinking could prove to sting competitors in the future.Accordingly, I would expect to see a slowdown of the growth of selling and marketing expenses and an increase in profit margins.Source Data: S&P Capital IQSource Data: S&P Capital IQEXPE’s return on invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) and return on equity (ROE) are not particularly compelling on a headline basis. From 2014 to 2018, ROIC has declined from 9.2% to 4.9% and ROE has declined from 10.6% to 6.9%. Neither of these trends concern me, however.Both ROIC and ROE are depressed by 1) the large amount of goodwill on the balance sheet ($8.1 billion as of 12/31/18) and 2) the large amount of cash on the balance sheet ($2.5 billion as of 12/31/18), which should be excluded when evaluating returns on the capital used by the company’s operations.Source Data: S&P Capital IQSource Data: S&P Capital IQEXPE generates a lot of cash flow. The strong UFCF profile is driven by the company’s strong profit margin profile and low capital intensiveness, which were both discussed earlier in this article. UFCF margin has averaged in the mid teens over the last five years, which is actually higher than the company’s EBITDA margin.The UFCF margin is higher than the EBITDA margin because net working capital is negative and serves as a source of cash flow each year.As the company reaches maturity and growth slows, so too will this source of cash flow from net working capital. Offsetting this negative impact on UFCF margin is my expectation that profit margins will increase as a result of a decline in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue.Source Data: S&P Capital IQSource Data: S&P Capital IQWhen assessing a company’s resiliency, I like to look at 1) the company’s current leverage profile and 2) the company’s performance through the last economic downturn.The leverage profile is important to understand the company’s ability to continue servicing its debt should its financial performance falter.While the last downturn was quite some time ago and businesses have changed since then, looking at financial performance from 2007 to 2011 is a useful data point to see how the company may perform during the next downturn. EXPE ranks about as high as you can get in these two resiliency tests.The balance sheet is pristine with minimal debt and an adequate fixed charge coverage (FCC) ratio. The company holds a substantial amount of cash on the balance sheet, which is close to offsetting the debt balance so net debt is only 1.0x 2018 EBITDA.The company’s FCC ratio is 0.5x, which is lower than one might expect for an asset-light business like this. The FCC ratio is weighed down by the company’s investment in capital expenditures, which is inflated due to one-time projects connected with 1) the company’s transition to a cloud computing environment and 2) buildout of the company’s new headquarters.With net debt at essentially zero, a positive FCC ratio, and UFCF well in excess of EBITDA, one can conclude that EXPE’s balance sheet and liquidity position are essentially bullet proof.EXPE’s performance through the last economic downturn was outstanding as the company faced only a mild revenue decline in 2009 of -6.6%. I estimate the organic revenue decline in 2009 was -7.0%.Revenue rebounded strongly in 2010 with total and organic revenue growth of 10.6% and 9.7%, respectively. Growth continued thereafter.This growth is a testament to the overall revenue diversification EXPE has on a global basis and the resiliency of the travel services industry in general. The chart below shows that global air travel only declined by 1.2% in 2009 and resumed growth in 2010.Source Data: S&P Capital IQAnnual Growth in Global Air Traffic Passenger DemandSource Data: StatistaEXPE pays an annual dividend and repurchases equity. Of the ~$1 billion of unlevered free cash flow generated each year, $500-600 million is typically used by returning cash to shareholders.Both the aggregate dividend payments and the per-share dividends have increased rapidly each year (5-year CAGR is +20%).Equity repurchases were ramped up during 2018, which is great to see because 2018’s valuation levels were lower than in each of the prior three years. I strongly prefer to see management time their equity repurchases when valuations are low, as this can create significant value for shareholders.Unfortunately, EXPE issues more equity than usual to its employees, which dilutes existing shareholders. Its stock-based compensation is higher than average for the S&P 500 and for the Consumer Discretionary sector.EXPE’s overall share count generally declines each year as EXPE repurchases more stock than it issues to management. The large increase in the number of shares during 2015 was due to the HomeAway acquisition, which was acquired partially with newly issued stock.Insiders own 4.3% of the company’s common stock, which is worth $830 million at the company’s current valuation. This ownership percentage is above average for companies in the S&P 500 Index, indicating strong alignment with outside shareholders. EXPE’s chairman of the board, Barry Diller, owns the vast majority of the stock held by insiders.The company is effectively controlled by Barry Diller. EXPE has two classes of shares: 1) common stock and 2) Class B common stock.  The two classes of stock have equal economics, but Class B shares have 10 votes per share vs 1 vote per share for the common shares. Class B common stock is entirely owned by Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc, and Barry Diller has proxy to vote these shares.Source Data: S&P Capital IQSource Data: S&P Capital IQAfter having corrected in November and December, EXPE’s stock has traded higher in January and its current trading multiples are above their long-run valuation averages. The company’s UFCF yield is 5.2%, which is below its long-run average of 8.8%, but materially better than the S&P 500 Index of 3.4%. Note that I calculate the UFCF yield based on the average UFCF over the last five years. This is a conservative view of UFCF for growing companies like EXPE.With the recent advances in the stock price, I do not see EXPE’s current valuations as compelling enough to initiate a new position at the current levels. Instead, a more attractive entry point would be at an EV / EBITDA multiple of < 12.0x and an UFCF yield of > 9.0%. That implies a share price that is approximately 40% below its current levels.It may make sense to initiate a position at higher valuations, but the targeted valuations mentioned above should provide investors an adequate margin of safety.Source Data: S&P Capital IQSource Data: S&P Capital IQCompetitive Global EnvironmentEXPE competes in a highly competitive global industry with both established and emerging online and traditional sellers of travel-related services, including companies that are larger and have greater access to greater financial resources. Additionally, the company faces increasing competition from internet search engines and online portals.Mitigating Factors: The company enjoys significant brand equity and consumer awareness with each of its brands, which provides insulation from competition. Additionally, the company’s ability to continue generating +10% annual organic growth is a testament to its commanding market position. Changing TechnologyEXPE must consistently deliver its services with current technology demanded from consumers.Mitigating Factors: This is where size and scale matters. EXPE generates +$11 billion in revenue, which gives it significant financial resources to be able to organically develop or acquire new technology. Already included in the company’s cost structure is ~$1.4 billion of annual spend on Technology and Content. Additionally, EXPE has a history of acquiring small companies that have technology it wants. Additionally, EXPE makes minority investments in emerging companies that gives it visibility to new technology and an effective call option on acquiring the technology in the future, if so desired.

Even though this has hurt the company's efficiency, it's important that Expedia maintains an edge in a highly competitive industry.The stock is reasonably priced for long-term investors when you consider its growth prospects and solid cash flow streams.","An ""industry disruptor"" can completely change an industry. Like Amazon (AMZN) has done to e-commerce, or ride-sharing has done to personal transportation, once innovation occurs - industries are never the same again. We see a similar event in companies such as Expedia Group (EXPE), whose online suite of travel booking services have brought convenience, technology, and savings to the travel industry for consumers. The company has heavily pursued acquisitions to gobble up market share and has become a one-stop shop for consumer travel needs.Despite this, there is an extensive growth runway available to Expedia Group that should provide steady upside for long-term investors. Investors should keep in mind however, that competition is putting pressure on profits and that strong execution by management will be key to successful long-term out-performance.Expedia Group owns various online travel booking services that effectively replace ""old school"" travel agents. Through Expedia Group and its subsidiaries, you can book vacations, flights, hotels, and rental vehicles. The company has aggressively expanded over the past several years, and now generates more than $11 billion in annual revenues.The ability for consumers to easily book travel plans is a game-changer for the travel industry. Not only are the digital channels easier and more convenient, but they allow travelers to shop between hotels and airlines with ease, and can accumulate rewards through loyalty programs without having to associate with a specific brand or chain of hotel or airline.Source: YchartsExpedia has spent much of the past decade expanding, which is why earnings have been so choppy. The growth has been more reflected in the top line which has expanded at a CAGR of 14.35%. More than $6 billion has been spent on acquisitions over the past few years. As the company continues to build itself up and organic growth takes over, Expedia's bottom line with smooth out.We begin our analysis by evaluating Expedia's operational performance. We gauge this by using a series of metrics. We review operating margins to make sure the company is consistently profitable. We also want to invest in companies with strong cash flow streams, so we look at the conversion rate of revenue to free cash flow. Lastly, we want to see that management is effectively deploying the company's financial resources so we review the cash rate of return on invested capital (CROCI). We will do all of these using three benchmarks:Source: YchartsWe see a clear downtrend in all three metrics over the past 10 years. While Expedia remains a solid FCF generator, the clear downtrend is not what we want to see. Though it's possible (and likely) that a combination of competition from rivals such as Booking Holdings (BKNG) and Airbnb (AIRB), and premiums paid for strategic acquisitions have slowly impacted the company. The metrics have largely stabilized since 2016, so investors should continue to monitor them and be sure that performance doesn't continue to slip.The fortunate part of this, is that Expedia remains in solid financial shape despite aggressive spending on acquisitions. It's important for a company to maintain financial discipline. A company with too much debt can face liquidity issues, or a cash flow squeeze if the company suffers an unexpected downturn. While Expedia's leverage ratio of 2.41X EBITDA is only just under our ""warning sign"" threshold of 2.5X, the company's strong cash balance of $2.44 billion against $3.7 billion in total debt makes the leverage ratio less worrisome.Source: YchartsExpedia Group is just getting its ""training wheels"" off in the dividend growth space. The company has raised its dividend each of the past seven years. The current payout totals $1.28 annually. The dividend's current yield of 1.06% is well below the 2.51% available to income seekers via 10-year US treasuries.Source: YchartsThe dividend has grown at a 5-year CAGR of 17.2%, but that has settled down recently. The past four years have featured increases between 7-8% annually. The company's strong revenue growth means that cash flows will continue to grow, leaving plenty of room for dividend growth in the years to come. As it is, the dividend payout consumes less than 20% of cash flow.Expedia has recently upped its stock buybacks, spending $892 million over the past 12 months. Outstanding shares have dropped over the past decade from 153 million, to 146 million.Despite increasing competition in the digital travel booking space, Expedia has a remarkably large growth runway ahead of it. The company's overall market penetration is quite small, with just low single-digit penetration across the world (aside from the US and Canada). As the years go by, Expedia can continue to grow by grabbing market share both organically and through M&A.Source: Expedia GroupAcquisitions will likely continue to play a role in future growth. The company's extensive acquisition history includes a total of 23 transactions over the years. Expedia can expand its services into new applications via M&A. Examples include its acquisition of Pillow.com (short-term rental for multi-family properties) and HomeAway (Expedia's answer to Airbnb).Lastly, the company's growth requires that it remains invested in innovating and integrating digital components of the travel booking experience. As we can see in the graphic below, there is a large portion of customers that book via Expedia's mobile app. Maintaining a smooth digital experience can provide differentiation from competition, as well as further drive loyalty.Source: Expedia GroupExpedia does come with some risks that investors should keep in mind. Obviously, the health of the travel industry is crucial to Expedia. While a recessionary environment can impact the rate at which people travel, there is a pretty consistent ""base"" built in of people who travel for business, etc.Perhaps the most underrated risk is whether management can execute a growth strategy efficiently. We have seen performance metrics erode some over the years. If acquisitions continue to come into play, it's important for management to execute them (pay the right price, save on synergies, etc.) in a way that adds value to Expedia over the long term.At $122 per share, Expedia Group currently trades near the midpoint of its 52-week range. The stock is up approximately $12 since the market corrected over the winter.Source: YchartsAnalysts are currently projecting earnings per share for the full fiscal year of $6.92. Based on the current share price, Expedia is trading at an earnings multiple of 17.63X. While this is substantially lower than Expedia's 10-year median PE ratio of 28.62X, we have to account for how inconsistent Expedia's EPS has been throughout the decade. An extremely volatile EPS will skew the PE ratio.For example, looking at value from a cash flow perspective reveals that the stock isn't quite as cheap as the PE ratio may indicate. The current FCF yield of 5.90% is middling between its highs coming out of the recession, and lows in recent years.Source: YchartsWith analyst consensus estimating earnings growth in the 14% range per annum over the next 5 years, a case for value can be made for long-term investors. We find it to be very reasonable to pay 17X earnings and a 5.9% FCF yield for a stock that is growing at a double-digit rate.Expedia has been part of a movement that has revolutionized the global travel industry. The company has expanded aggressively, although that has cost it some efficiency in the process. Still, we like the strong balance sheet, cash flow stream, and room for future growth. We don't mind the current valuation for a long-term holding, making Expedia a stock worth investigating further.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."

(Source: VentureDeal Database)According to a market research report by Phocuswright, the U.S. private accommodation market is projected to reach $36.6 billion in 2018. The industry marked an 11% increase in 2016.According to Phocuswright's VP of Research, Douglas Quinby, ""The segment's shift online, the expansion of the concept to include private homes in urban markets, the entrance of OTAs, and numerous innovative startups have all contributed to powering a period of tremendous growth.""Moreover, despite the backdrop of strong performance for the US travel industry, the private accommodation segment has grown much faster than travel overall.Expedia didn’t disclose the acquisition price or terms and didn’t file an 8-K or disclose a change in financial guidance, so the deals were likely for a financially non-material amount.A review of the firm’s most recent 10-Q filing indicates that as of September 30, 2018, Expedia had $3.4 billion in cash and short-term investments and long-term debt of $3.7 billion.Free cash flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was $1.5 billion.EXPE acquired both Pillow and ApartmentJet to fold their capabilities into its HomeAway business unit.As Expedia stated in the deal announcement,In the past 12 months, EXPE’s stock price has risen 3.3% vs. the S&P 500 Index rise of 3.5%, as the chart below indicates:(Source: Seeking Alpha)Expedia acquired HomeAway for $3.9 billion in late 2015. HomeAway was a public company at the time that was undergoing a shift from a classified marketplace for home rentals to a more transactional business model via a fully online bookable marketplace.This business model shift was more in line with Expedia’s family of brands and business approach.With the deal for Pillow and ApartmentJet, Expedia and HomeAway are signaling an interest in expanding the addressable market into the multi-family industry and product type.Multi-family properties within the U.S. have dramatically grown in number since the financial crisis of 2008 - 2009, as consumers either couldn’t qualify for home mortgage credit, were evicted from their homes, or chose to rent instead of own.Of late, the multi-family rental market in many major markets in the U.S. has cooled as younger, Millennials have been leaving to start families, and the after-effects of the financial crisis continue to wear off.So, these deals could represent excellent timing for Expedia/HomeAway to employ their ample distribution and technology capabilities to provide much larger reach as it pushes into the multi-family market at a time when apartment owners are looking for additional ways to maximize rental income across their portfolios.While the deals won’t directly hit the top or bottom lines for Expedia in the near term, over the medium-term as the technologies are integrated, and marketing turns up the visibility within HomeAway and beyond, this move is a great way for HomeAway to expand its addressable market."
4216732,103480,2018-10-31T19:54:27-04:00,"Shares of Expedia soared on strong EPS in Q3, as well as a favorable EBITDA guidance for the remainder of FY18.Expedia, however, is still struggling with a slowdown in gross bookings, which is affecting the whole industry.Revenue growth of 10% y/y missed Wall Street's expectations, while gross bookings growth decelerated to 11% y/y, down two points from last quarter.HomeAway is a bright spot, with the vacation rental site achieving 24% y/y growth in bookings. Still, this decelerated nine points from last quarter.Overall, investors should be more concerned with the multi-quarter bookings slowdown. EBITDA growth can't be sustained if bookings continue to deteriorate.","Over the back half of the year, Expedia (EXPE) has done a great job of convincing investors that its slowdown in bookings growth is only a minor concern. In its first quarterly release this year, Expedia suffered its largest-ever one-day drop after it reported a massive deceleration in total bookings (in particular, hotel nights). To date, Expedia still hasn't fixed that - it's a problem plaguing every player in the industry, including Booking Holdings (BKNG) and Trivago (TRVG), as well as international competitors like Ctrip (CTRP). But, much like Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Expedia has been able to convince its investor base that its profit growth is of higher importance.Shares of Expedia have rallied nearly 10% since reporting Q3 results. While it's still down through the October correction (as are most internet stocks), Expedia has recovered rapidly from its February lows. The outlook on global travel is rather mixed. Higher fuel prices have greatly increased air carriers' costs, with many warning of a near-term increase in fares. Fed rate increases have pushed up the dollar vs. other global currencies - which is great for U.S. travelers, but is a problem for travelers abroad. It's not difficult to understand why the forecast on global travel is cautious.Investors should take a defensive stance on Expedia and stay on the sidelines. Though the company's profit growth in recent quarters has been impressive, it will be short lived if it can't find a way to re-invigorate bookings growth. Amid choppy market conditions for tech stocks as a whole, I'm much more inclined to invest in more downtrodden Internet names such as Alphabet (GOOG), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).Here's a more detailed look at Expedia's bookings results in the third quarter:Figure 1. Expedia 3Q18 bookingsSource: Expedia investor relationsTotal gross bookings grew just 11% y/y to $24.7 billion in the quarter, This is down two points from 13% y/y growth in Q2, which in turn decelerated two points from the Q1 bookings growth rate of 15% y/y. In fact, when Expedia last reported 11% y/y bookings growth in Q4 (released in February), the stock crashed 20%. The overall dynamics seem not to have changed. Domestic growth is overpowering international growth at 13% y/y, while a stronger dollar is hampering travel from international customers. Also concerning are the trends at HomeAway. The vacation rental site has quickly proven to be one of Expedia's key acquisitions, but over the past year, it has slowed down tremendously in its bookings rates. Last quarter, HomeAway had seen a 33% y/y increase in gross bookings - this quarter, this slowed down to just 24% y/y. Whether this is reflective of an overall slowdown in vacation rentals or a loss of market share against the ubiquitous Airbnb (AIRB) is unclear, but neither scenario is particularly appealing to Expedia investors. Looking at the bookings data by type also reveals some pain points:Figure 2. Expedia 3Q18 bookings by typeSource: Expedia investor relationsLodging revenues - which make up the lion's share of Expedia's revenues - decelerated two points to 12% y/y growth. Though room nights sold held relatively flat at 13% y/y, a drop in revenue per room night soured the company's growth in this segment. Expedia also is far from reclaiming the ~20% growth rate it enjoyed in FY17 and FY16. On the airfare side, tickets sold came down two points from an unusually strong Q2, somewhat counterbalanced by higher revenues per ticket.To Expedia's credit, however, the company is making efforts to re-invigorate its growth, especially in its all-important lodging segment. Mark Okerstrom, Expedia's CEO, noted the following on Expedia's lodging strategy on the earnings call:Here's a look at Expedia's full results in the third quarter:Figure 3. Expedia 3Q18 financialsSource: Expedia investor relationsRevenues grew just 10% y/y to $3.28 billion, decelerating one point from last quarter's 11% y/y revenue growth rate - in general, Expedia's revenue growth fell in line with its bookings growth. Expedia missed Wall Street's expectations of $3.30 billion, or +11% y/y growth, by a small 70bps spread.The excitement this quarter came from the company's bottom line. It's a similar theme across the industry - last week, Trivago (TRVG) also reported a bookings slowdown but a huge profit beat, thanks to a ""rationalization"" of advertising spend. Expedia is a large stakeholder in Trivago, so it makes sense that the two companies are adopting a similar strategy. Sales and marketing expenses remained relatively flat this quarter at $1.5 billion, or 45.8% of revenues. This is down 350bps from 49.3% of revenues in the year-ago quarter. Expedia management also noted that, having now mostly completed a back-end migration to the cloud, the company also is enjoying operational and cost benefits. Some further comments from Expedia's CFO on expense controls this quarter:As a result of this laser focus on cost downs, Expedia grew its GAAP operating income by 40% y/y to $672 million, representing an operating margin of 20.5% - 430bps better than 16.2% in the year-ago quarter. Pro forma EPS of $3.65 also smashed Wall Street's expectations of $3.12 with an impressive 17% upside surprise. In addition, Expedia's preferred profitability metric, adjusted EBITDA, grew 29% y/y to $912 million and hit an EBITDA margin of 27.8%, up sharply from 23.9% in 3Q17:Figure 4. Expedia adjusted EBITDASource: Expedia investor relationsInvestor enthusiasm for Expedia following the Q3 release also was driven in large part by the company forecasting 10%-12% y/y EBITDA growth for the full year, vs. a prior range of 7-12%. Still, however, it's not enough to make me bullish on Expedia stock without seeing a lift in bookings rates.There's no doubt that Expedia has achieved a massive profit expansion this quarter, which to some degree came at the expense of bookings growth. While stronger EBITDA margins and a raised bottom-line forecast are important signals for the stock, I'd be more keen to see room nights return to mid-teens growth. Note also that Expedia's valuation and a forward P/E basis is now richer than Booking Holdings:Staying on the sidelines until Expedia stock cools off again or until confidence returns to the travel industry is likely your best bet."
4167436,103480,2018-04-30T06:02:29-04:00,"Strong bookings in Expedia's first-quarter results helped lift the stock out of the doldrums it entered since last quarter.Gross bookings grew 15% y/y in Q1, primarily driven by strength in lodging, but that's only 1 point better than the 14% growth Expedia saw in Q4.Marketing expenses still weigh on the company's profits, and EPS missed by 2 cents in the quarter.Adjusted EBITDA declined 40% y/y, calling into question the company's guidance of achieving 6-11% growth for the full year.","Expedia (EXPE) investors are in relief rally mode. After Expedia shares saw their biggest one-day decline after last quarter's earnings, with shares off more than 20% after Expedia guided soft on the bottom line due to increased marketing expenses, it seems this quarter that bad news equals good news. A volley of price target updates and renewed investor confidence in the stock has Expedia up more than 8% after releasing Q1 results:EXPE data by YChartsYear to date, of course, Expedia is still in the red. Online travel stocks in general haven't seen their heyday levels since last July, when shares of Expedia changed hands for as much as $160 per share. Investors are probably hoping that with Expedia finding some bullish momentum at ~30% below its previous highs, the company can stage a quick rebound rally into the summer - typically a strong time for online travel stocks.But lurking ahead, there are still some problems with the Expedia story. It's true that after Expedia's correction, it's now the cheapest of the large online travel stocks (the other two being Booking Holdings/Priceline (BKNG) and Ctrip (CTRP) on both a P/E and revenue multiple basis, despite having long traded at a premium to Priceline.EXPE PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsBut I still prefer the latter two over Expedia. Booking Holdings has a reliable history of outperforming against expectations; last quarter, it was the only OTA to post an earnings beat. That, as well as its slight growth premium to Expedia, is worth the slight P/E premium. Ctrip, on the other hand, is a much faster-growing company with unique exposure to the world's most important market, and the fastest-growing middle class: China.In my opinion, a decent showing in first-quarter earnings is no reason to suddenly be bullish on Expedia again. The company hasn't lifted its guidance for the year, indicating that its visibility into FY18 is still murky. Expedia isn't out of the woods yet, and shares shouldn't be bought unless they dip to the low $100s again.Online travel stocks hit all-time highs last summer, in particular, because of a strong summer travel season. Trivago (TRVG), at the time, was trading 4x higher than where the stock is today and was posting >50% y/y revenue growth (it has since fallen to the single digits).But can the good times continue to roll as we head into Expedia's most important season? The global, synchronized growth narrative has shown some cracks this year as the U.S. and China lock horns over trade tariffs. The rise of treasury yields over 300 bps - signaling a sharp increase in rates - may hearken a nasty cutback in consumer spending.Global stock markets, too, have been routed in recent months. Indonesian markets, in particular, have sunk to multi-month lows as the country's central bank prepares to raise rates. It's important to note that international travelers are the backbone of Expedia's growth, with international bookings growing 25% y/y versus domestic bookings at 10% y/y growth. Though domestic bookings still form more than one-half of Expedia's total bookings, the mix is gradually tilting more and more in favor of Expedia's international clientele.Softening in any of the above factors - international economies, overall travel demand, or broader consumer spending - could pose a huge threat to Expedia. As the company has previously noted, it's expecting marketing expenses to swell this year - so if Expedia's advertising efforts fail to produce the kind of growth it's hoping for, the company could be seeing a lot more red ink.For now, however, it seems investors are squarely focused on the present, where Expedia's 15% y/y bookings growth is, at the very least, a minor improvement over the 14% bookings growth Expedia saw in its ill-fated Q4 earnings.See Expedia's first-quarter results summary below:Figure 1. Expedia Q1 earnings resultsSource: Expedia investor relationsRight in line with 15% bookings growth, Expedia also grew revenues 15% y/y to $2.51 billion, ahead of consensus expectations of $2.24 billion (+12% y/y). This also marks a strong acceleration from the 11% revenue growth Expedia saw in Q4, so investors do have some justification in bidding the shares up.It's important to note, however, that Trivago could be a major headwind to Expedia - and indeed, Expedia's CFO mentioned on the Q1 earnings call that Trivago's poor results will be a drag on Expedia's adjusted EBITDA growth guidance. Per Trivago's latest annual report, Expedia is the company's majority shareholder with about 60% of the outstanding shares. Though Trivago's ~$1 billion in annual revenues is a small portion of Expedia's business, its growing losses (the company reported a surprise swing to negative EBITDA of -$21.9 million in the most recent quarter) might cause Expedia to miss its guidance of 6 to 11% adjusted EBITDA growth, which the company re-affirmed on the earnings call. And not only is Expedia a passive shareholder in Trivago, it also derives a substantial amount of its bookings traffic from Trivago, which has seen its traffic and referral numbers come down dramatically over the past two quarters.Let's put Trivago aside for a moment and concentrate on how Expedia performed in each of its major segments:Figure 2. Expedia key metricsSource: Expedia investor relationsAs seen above, the majority of Expedia's bookings growth came from its lodging segment, which generated $1.61 billion of revenues in the quarter and 64% of Expedia's total revenue pool. Room nights grew 15% y/y, led by 21% growth in international room growth (domestic room growth was just 10% y/y). Lodging revenues were further helped by the fact that average daily rates (ADR) ticked up by 7%, producing 15% growth in the lodging segment overall.As previously mentioned, any slowdown in the global economy could pose a threat to Expedia's critical international lodging revenues. Growth in Airbnb is another mounting issue, as more and more travelers turn to alternative lodging instead of traditional hotels. Expedia's purchase of HomeAway is in part an answer to Airbnb, and HomeAway bookings and revenue grew 46% y/y and 26% y/y, respectively. But again, with travel trends generally so fickle, it's unclear whether Expedia will be able to sustain this growth.On the airfare side, Expedia primarily drove revenue growth through an increase in per-booking revenues, while tickets sold remained roughly flat. It's useful to note that American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) recently sounded off a warning along with its Q1 guidance. It's true that higher fuel prices eating into American Airlines' profits may not affect Expedia all that much, but if ticket prices do rise high enough such that it stems travel demand from cost-conscious travelers, Expedia could be exposed to another macro risk.Let's turn this all back to Expedia's bottom line - as a mature internet company, most investors value Expedia based on its EBITDA and cash flow, not its revenues. As seen in the company's earnings summary, GAAP operating losses widened to -$165 million, representing a -7% operating margin - worse than the -3% margin Expedia posted in 1Q17. Again, Trivago was another instigator of Expedia's worsening profits.Adjusted EBITDA - perhaps Expedia's most important investor metric - sank 40% y/y to $124 million. Even excluding the effects of Trivago, Expedia still saw a 19% decrease in Adjusted EBITDA. Most of this decay is due to the company's deliberate strategy to boost its marketing budget, which ticked up 241 bps as a percentage of revenues in the quarter. If this advertising boost fails to produce the growth it promised, however, Expedia could see even deeper declines into the red. It's true that Expedia will typically show better EBITDA during the hot travel months (of which Q1 is not), but even so, the -40% EBITDA results in Q1 make the company's guidance of +6-11% y/y EBITDA growth look questionable.Pro forma EPS of -$0.46, too, missed analyst expectations of -$0.44, and free cash flow declined -2% y/y to $1.48 billion. It seems, however, that investors were too busy cheering the company's bookings growth to notice the deterioration on the bottom line.Despite what looked to be a strong Q1, it's still premature to be relief-buying Expedia shares. It's important to note that even Alan Pickerill, Expedia's CEO, noted the following warning after touting the company's strong results in the first quarter:The company is banking on the second half of the year to provide more than 100% of its adjusted EBITDA growth - a scenario that may not play out if lodging demand softens, a situation that even Expedia's management expects to be in.At the moment, there are just too many unknowns for investors to get truly comfortable. The post-earnings rally in Expedia shares have essentially taken away the margin of safety that investors had in the low $100s. Until Expedia can show consistent performance in the next few quarters and clear up its demand outlook for the year, shares remain too risky."
4191656,103480,2018-07-29T03:55:07-04:00,"Expedia shares rallied sharply after the company's bottom-line results highlighted its Q2 earnings release.On the top line, however, Expedia's 11% revenue growth was only in-line with analyst expectations and represented four points of deceleration from Q1.The company's 13% y/y growth in bookings growth also decelerated two points from last quarter and implies worrying conditions in the travel industry.Profit gains in a single quarter can be short-lived if top line strength does not materialize.","It's been a whirlwind of a year for Expedia (EXPE), the second-largest online travel stock whose stock has veered in both sharp ups and downs on completely conflicting earnings results. Two quarters ago, a slowdown in bookings growth was the centerpiece of the Expedia story, and analysts worried that slowing air ticket growth alongside competition from the likes of Airbnb would eat into Expedia's dominant lodging business (of course, Expedia also has HomeAway and VRBO to answer to these threats). Yet beginning in Q1 and now continuing into Q2, Expedia reversed course, and this quarter, shares are up more than 10% after the company posted a huge beat to Wall Street's EPS numbers:YChartsShares of Expedia have now turned positive for the year, with a 15% gain for investors who held Expedia through the Q4 crunch. Yet I find it difficult to believe that Expedia is truly back on a recovery path toward its summer highs in the ~$160 range from last year. Q2 results, I think, were a momentary respite from a longer-term issue with Expedia as well as the wider travel industry - competition is getting stiff, and OTAs aren't garnering as much of a share of the growth in online bookings as in the past.In my view, the earnings growth that Expedia managed to post in Q2 is of lesser importance next to the deceleration in both revenue and bookings metrics, which we'll discuss in further detail shortly. The business isn't staging a true turnaround and convincing travel bookers back into its corner - it's just managing to squeeze more profits out of a decelerating user base, which is an important secondary achievement, but not the biggest cause for celebration.We already knew from Trivago's recent losing streak that the major OTAs like Expedia and Priceline (BKNG) are backing away from third party-sourced traffic (aka, Trivago) in favor for their own homegrown traffic. This does imply that margins on travel bookings will be higher if Expedia pays less in third-party fees to the likes of Trivago, but is it worth the slowdown in bookings? With the Expedia travel brands locked in a constant battle for dominance against Booking Holdings' (the new parent name for Priceline) own portfolio of brands, I'd be slightly more concerned about the lack of growth seen in this quarter.Note that with Expedia's recent recovery, it's also no longer the best deal among OTA stocks. Its 26x forward P/E ratio looks steep compared to Booking's 24x, especially when Expedia's growth seems to be plateauing (over the past several quarters, Booking Holdings has also always managed a slightly better growth rate than Expedia, despite being the larger company).EXPE PE Ratio (Forward)YChartsI'm more in favor of Booking Holdings' consistency and would rather stay on the sidelines for Expedia, whose track record over the past year is spotty at best.More so than the bottom line, I'm more interested in tracking Expedia's key bookings metrics performance from quarter over quarter. Take a look at the Q2 results below:Figure 1. Expedia bookings metricsSource: Expedia investor relationsTotal gross bookings grew 13% y/y, decelerating two points from last quarter's 15% y/y bookings growth and the weakest performance since Expedia's ill-fated Q4 earnings, where bookings also grew by just 11% y/y.At a top line, one of the major drivers behind the slowdown was actually a deceleration in HomeAway, which is Expedia's biggest bulwark against Airbnb. Last quarter, HomeAway grew bookings by 46% y/y; this quarter, bookings growth slowed down to a mere 33% y/y. Especially as we head deeper into the critical summer season, a major pullback in Expedia's homesharing growth engine could be more problematic than investors are currently budgetingfor.Geographically, another trend is clear - international bookings are down, and sharply. This has been a trend for the past several quarters, with Q4's international bookings growth of 26% y/y dipping to 25% in Q1 and now 19% in Q2. International's $20.3 billion of bookings this year represents about 40% of total bookings, so if this deceleration continues, Expedia could also be in big trouble.In terms of category performance, room night growth also took a beating in Q2 - decelerating from 15% y/y growth in Q1 to 12% y/y in Q2, as seen in the chart below. Here, both domestic and international room nights showed a slowdown, leading to a 1-point deceleration in lodging revenue growth to 14% y/y.Figure 2. Expedia lodging and air performanceSource: Expedia investor relationsMeanwhile, though the volume of air tickets saw a refreshing bump from flat performance in Q1 as well as FY17, it's still a far cry from the 32% y/y growth in air ticket growth that Expedia enjoyed in FY16. In addition, a tapering off of revenue per ticket actually caused a one-point deceleration in air revenues as well.What investors are treating as a quarterly beat, in my view, is more of a mixed bag. As discussed above, bookings metrics showed some considerable pockets of weakness across multiple dimensions, with HomeAway, international, and hotel rooms all being key pieces to watch for.The unimpressive bookings results, of course, translated into so-so revenues. Revenues grew just 11% y/y to $2.88 billion, on par with Wall Street's expectations and showing a worrying four-point deceleration from Q1's growth rate of 15% y/y.Figure 3. Expedia earnings highlightsSource: Expedia investor relationsIt was the bottom line that stole the show. Despite just an 8% y/y increase in operating income, the company's adjusted EPS of $1.38 grew 55% y/y and blew away analyst expectations of $0.89. The primary driver behind the earnings growth was an increase in sales and marketing leverage. The company's sales and marketing expenses grew just 7% y/y to $1.54 billion to support an 11% y/y jump in revenues, falling 229bps as a percentage of revenues to 53.5%. As the largest expense category at Expedia, this shift had a marked impact on the bottom line.But this cutback in marketing spend will have longer-term impacts, specifically on the already-weakening bookings metrics. Businesses like Expedia live and breathe on their ability to constantly get in front of customers with ads and persuade them to book their next vacation through one of the Expedia brands.Expedia management commented as follows on the earnings call:But no matter how much the company has stressed an ""optimization"" of direct marketing expenses, a cutback in ads is still likely to produce less traffic, and thus fewer bookings.The bottom line on Expedia: in my view, Expedia executives traded top-line growth for bottom-line outperformance, but in the longer term, this doesn't make Expedia a stronger company - it will just make it a slightly higher-margin, lower-traffic one. The slowdown in bookings growth to levels seen in Expedia's disastrous Q4 results is a major red flag that at least nullifies the benefits of the EPS beat. Especially with shares rocketing in the past month and exceeding Booking Holdings' valuation, I'm more inclined to stay on the sidelines."
4205655,101693,2018-09-11T17:02:11-04:00,"Expedia operates in a growing OTA market. This market is highly fragmented. I believe this gives Expedia ample room for growth through acquisitions.However, Expedia seems to have also crippling flaws. It has terrible customer reviews and competitive disadvantages versus Google. I believe that in the long term, this will hamper Expedia's growth.My valuation of Expedia implies a discount of approximately 15%. However, I don't think this adequately compensate the investor for taking on Expedia's risks.","Expedia (EXPE) has been trading in a range for almost three years now. The global travel market continues to grow, and it's forecasted to reach a whopping $1.3 trillion. However, EXPE's shares haven't seen a comparable upside. Here I'll provide investors with some analysis regarding EXPE's business prospects. Expedia is an exciting business because it has many opportunities which it can profitably exploit, but at the same time, it appears to have some fundamental flaws. My valuation of Expedia indicates that it's slightly undervalued, but its risks are still difficult to ignore.Image: Expedia's logo.Expedia's business model hinges on four main activities: merchant, agency, advertising, and subscription. These are aspects of the same overarching business, which is online travel. The core demand for these services is people looking online for travel alternatives for vacation, business, flight seats, hotel rooms, and car rentals, among others. Also, HomeAway is Expedia's fastest growing segment. HomeAway is a vacation listing rental service, and its potential market size is $100 billion. Overall, Expedia is pursuing many market opportunities.However, it's not as easy to profit as one might initially expect. It's necessary to have a global operation to satisfy this demand. This requires logistics, communication, and payment processing systems. Moreover, this market has very low barriers to entry by nature. Thus, it's hard for any single company to achieve a significant market share.Expedia is the second biggest OTA in the world after Booking Holdings (BKNG). These two companies have a duopoly of the OTA market. Still, neither of them commands a significant market share overall (due to the reasons I previously explained). BKNG has 10%, while EXPE has 7% of the total OTA market. This leaves ample room for expansion for both companies. The third significant player in the market is Airbnb (AIRB). This is a disrupting company and not an OTA by definition, but it still competes with BKNG and EXPE for people's travel alternatives. These three companies are the biggest in the OTA market.Source: Credit Suisse.Expedia is in an exciting position because it also has business arrangements with foreign OTAs. These relationships help Expedia penetrate the emerging markets in a cost-efficient way. Furthermore, it sets the groundwork for eventual mergers/buyouts of other OTA players. For example, Expedia has business cooperation agreements with Ctrip.com International (CTRP) and Despegar.com (DESP). In Despegar's case, the relationship is through Decolar.com, which is DESP's Brazilian property.Source: Expedia's 2017 annual report.Both of these are small foreign OTAs. Hence, it's possible that Expedia might eventually buy them out. I've written articles on CTRP and DESP if you're interested in more detailed information about them. When I last looked at CTRP, it seemed rather expensive. However, DESP has sold off and it's starting to look appealing.As a side note, you could purchase EXPE along with DESP and CTRP to gain worldwide exposure to the OTA market and diversify your holdings.Expedia's relationships with its travel partners are vital. As I previously mentioned, the OTA market is a highly fragmented one. There are countless smaller agencies around the world. Due to its size, Expedia differentiates itself by being an excellent aggregator of supply. EXPE can do this by building long-term relationships with hotels, airlines, car rental companies, cruise lines, etc. Expedia has a platform designed for its suppliers so that they can list their inventory (rooms, cars, etc.) and availability (capacity and dates) in real time. This helps Expedia offer the best travel alternatives at reasonable pricing. EXPE's HomeAway is a success because it provides a set of tools for property owners and managers, which facilitates transactions.However, as good as Expedia sounds on paper, its customer reviews are terrible. It's hard to pinpoint exactly why, but the recurring theme is EXPE's customer service. If there's any mix up in the services EXPE provides, then the result is that clients won't be able to contact an Expedia representative to fix it. This will inevitably lead to errors in flight, hotel, car, or other types of reservations. Hence, the client will likely want a refund, but again, without reliable customer service, the client won't be able to collect its refund. Thus, leaving terrible reviews of Expedia is understandably the customer's last resort.Source: Trustpilot, quote Expedia.It's worrying to see that Expedia's negative reviews are almost a daily occurrence. As I've previously mentioned, the OTA market is very dynamic and has little barriers to entry. This is why differentiation is challenging here. Thus, Expedia's complacency of increasing bad reviews is concerning. It's hard to quantify exactly how many potential clients were discouraged from traveling with Expedia due to these negative reviews. However, in the long run, negative reviews erode the Expedia's profits and in the end, might cause its eventual downfall.Source: Trustpilot, quote HomeAway.On the other hand, HomeAway is Expedia's fastest growing site. It's no wonder that it also has very positive reviews. After all, if clients are satisfied, they'll become repeat customers and refer additional business. This results in growth and profits. Sadly, HomeAway is still a tiny fraction of Expedia's total revenues.Nevertheless, it sheds light on the potential areas of improvement for Expedia. Investors will do well in paying close attention to customer reviews of OTAs. Profitability usually follows client satisfaction.Client satisfaction results in loyalty. Loyalty will be the best defense against competitors. Competition in the OTA space is intense, but arguably the most dangerous player is Google (GOOG/GOOGL). Since OTAs operate through online searches, then data becomes of vital importance. This is why Google naturally gravitates to these types of businesses. Google Flights is already operational and a seamless experience for users. It aggregates all the available flights according to search parameters and links directly to the airline for booking.Source: Forbes, Google Flights.TripAdvisor's (TRIP) reviews of Google Flights are generally positive. Most people use it to find the best flight alternatives and then book directly with the airline. As you might expect, this Google application renders Expedia's flight services practically useless. Google simply has more data, resources, better brand recognition, and a larger (maybe even better) team. Moreover, nothing is stopping Google from launching a similar application for hotel reservations or car rentals. I'd argue that in all of these niches Google has the advantage due to the previously mentioned competitive advantages. Hence, Expedia (and almost every other OTA) has to compensate in different ways to compete adequately with Google.Other ways in which Expedia can compensate to achieve growth is through acquisitions. This is why Expedia has a wide range of brands in its portfolio. Since the OTA market is highly fragmented, then it's relatively easy to consolidate it through acquisitions and then drive away other competitors through synergies. These synergies usually stem from a bigger network of suppliers or increased traffic to Expedia's websites.Expedia's growth has to come through acquisitions or additional traffic. Its business model depends on fees paid by hotels, airlines, car rentals, etc. For this reason, travel suppliers have to fit into their pricing Expedia's fees, plus their cost structures. Since this cost structure (including marketing costs, customer service, employees, rent, etc.) is more or less fixed, then Expedia's fee is by extension set as well. This implies that Expedia's growth isn't likely to come from margin expansion, but rather from additional clients or acquisitions. Luckily for investors, EXPE has more than $3 billion in cash that it could use to that end.In the end, I don't think that Expedia can beat Google. As I've previously mentioned, Google has many competitive advantages over Expedia. Nevertheless, this doesn't mean that Expedia's downfall is near. I'd say that there are still many years (maybe even decades) ahead until the global travel market consolidates into fewer worldwide players. Expedia has the resources to keep growing either organically or through acquisitions until then. Ultimately, Google might rise to the top, but Expedia could also carve up a place for itself as a more personalized experience rather than just a search engine. This is all speculation at this point, but it's essential to have a long-term perspective before pricing Expedia.From a valuation perspective, Expedia appears fairly valued. Based on my 2018 forecast, it currently trades at a PE of 40.18 and a PS of 1.65. Its PB ratio is also high at 2.45. These indicate that Expedia is expensive, but its growth (and low-interest rates) compensate for these high ratios.For my valuation, I'll discount Expedia's owner earnings. Warren Buffett came up with this concept. It's an approximation to what the owners of a company would receive, after expenses and needed maintenance CAPEX. Owner earnings are useful for our valuation because they represent EXPE's profitability better than earnings, EBITDA, or FCF.Expedia appears to trade below its fair value. I arrived at this conclusion after discounting its estimated owner earnings at a rate suggested by the CAPM (the RRR). My two-stage model indicates that the potential upside for EXPE is approximately 15.31%. This indicates that Expedia is in the ""undervalued to fairly valued"" range.However, it's impossible to ignore Expedia's fundamental flaws. Its 15% discount doesn't justify the terrible customer reviews and critical competitive disadvantages versus Google. Every investor has his/her risk tolerance, but for me, Expedia should be trading at a steeper discount to warrant an investment. Even then, shareholder value is eroding daily with every negative review and Google's increasing data trove. Investors should be careful with expensive OTAs in general, and Expedia is no exception.Thank you for reading and good luck."
4148059,20149,2018-02-19T06:01:44-05:00,Profit growth is projected to slow to 6-11% in 2018 due to sales and marketing investments.Free cash flow also depressed due to buildout of huge new corporate headquarters in Seattle.Recent sell-off is a gift for long-term investors.,"Shares of leading online travel agent Expedia (EXPE) have been taking a beating in recent months after the company surprised investors with its 2018 spending plans. With a string of acquisitions behind them, EXPE is now focused on driving more customers to their leading array of travel booking websites, as well as increasing their supply to satisfy as many of those customers' needs as possible. As a result, margins are going to come down in the short term, leading to profit growth that will lag revenue growth in 2018.Adding to the cash flow headwinds is the fact that Expedia is in the process of building a new corporate headquarters in downtown Seattle, which will ultimately cost more than $750 million by the time construction is completed in late 2019. In the meantime, they are paying rent on their existing office space while simultaneously building the new campus.Given Wall Street's extreme focus on short-term financial results, perhaps it is not surprising that Expedia shares have been pummeled:As is always the case for long term, contrarian investors, the Street's focus on lower-than-expected profit growth this year (guidance for high single-digit growth during an investment cycle is still pretty darn good) has provided a strong investment opportunity. Expedia has built up a massively impressive roster of travel sites in recent years:(Source: 2016 Corporate Slide Deck)To get an idea of how much cash flow has been generated by these sites, below are historical free cash flow figures, according to company filings:(Source: Company SEC filings)The company has grown nicely, both organically and via acquisition, while keeping share count fairly flat:(Source: Company SEC filings)Given the capital expenditures required for their new corporate campus, it is helpful to view free cash flow excluding the one-time construction costs. Keep in mind that rent payments will further impact free cash flow once Expedia is no longer an office tenant. Below is an illustration of exactly what kind of free cash flow growth the company could generate between 2018 and 2020, once they are moved into their new, fully owned, offices:(Source: 2016-2017 Corporate filings, 2018-2020 - Peridot Capital estimates)With Expedia's stock price hovering just above $100 per share, coupled with an impressively strong balance sheet (net debt of less than $1 billion, roughly 0.5 times annual EBITDA), the shares appear dramatically undervalued if they can approach $1.6 billion of normalized free cash flow by 2020. Assuming a market multiple of roughly 20x free cash flow, it seems possible that EXPE stock could trade above $200 per share over the next few years. In addition, the downside risk appears limited given that the stock currently fetches just 15 times 2017 GAAP free cash flow."
4119619,22445,2017-11-02T12:39:01-04:00,"Expedia is a great company, but its stock has an overextended valuation.Overextended stocks go up until they drop, the catalyst being a whole host of reasons.Expedia in my opinion is still not investable.","Expedia (EXPE) got marked down by 16% last Friday, after the company's Q3'17 report missed on top-line growth and bottom line EPS. The EPS miss was only $0.11, and the revenue miss a minuscule $10M.However the big shock came when EXPE said in the conference call that adjusted EBITDA for the full year would be in the ""mid-to-high-single digit range,"" a drop from the 10% to 15% previously forecasted. Furthermore, the company also said 2018 profitability would also be impacted due to cloud expenses.However the reason for the big fall of the stock has little to do with the miss or the cautious guidance. There are many stocks that miss on guidance and do not get clobbered. The problem with EXPE is that it was a very expensive stock.Please note the above chart. You will see that profitability has been in the range between $250M and $450M over the past decade (ballpark). This despite the fact that its revenue has been increasing over the years (chart above).So even as revenue increased dramatically over the years (with a very complicated balance sheet I may add), gross profit is essentially about flat (chart below). And the reason is, while revenue has been increasing at very healthy rates, so has SG&A.However, EXPE's stock has been going up and up, and the P/E getting bigger and bigger (chart below).And the problem with very expensive stocks is, when they deviate from analyst expectations (AKA market expectations), they usually crash. Because unless everything goes perfect and according to plan, then the price targets that analysts come up with can't compute.Now before I tell you why I think EPXE might go even lower, let's take a look at another stock in the same space that is as expensive as EXPE. And that stock is TripAdvisor (TRIP).Please note TRIP also was a high-flying stock. The market for some reason bid this stock up all the way to a 75 multiple. Why? I have no idea. Now please also note what has happened to TRIP's stock over the past three years in the chart below.TRIP shares have been falling since 2014, even as revenue has been going up. In fact, TRIP has fallen by about 66% from its highs. Let me repeat that, 66% (AKA 66 percent). Why has this happened? Because many times investors get overexcited about growth companies, but fail to notice what they are paying for them. And then when growth stalls - or things turn out different from original assumptions - then an investment will under perform, in many instances for many years.As always, something happens in order for the investment public to change its stance on a very expensive stock. Many times it's not just that growth has stalled, but also because of a change of perception.In the case of EXPE, its stock has returned to where it was in the middle of 2015. that's about 2.5 years ago. So the investment public was hesitant to bid up EXPE's stock any further over the past two years. In my opinion, because it had such a rich valuation. So the question is, what might be the catalyst that might change the market's stance on EXPE, and knock the stock down even lower?To begin with, management said in the conference call that profitability will be impacted in 2018 because of cloud infrastructure costs. The market does not like it when a very high multiple stock says profitability will be impacted. No guidance was given, but the company said it will provide 2018 guidance in Q4.The second reason might be that there is a lot of competition in the space. For example Canadian startup Hooper might change the way the hospitality industry works.Hopper's success has more to do with telling you when not to book flights than what platform to book with. The user enters a preferred date to travel, and the company's mobile only app then notifies users when prices approach their lowest points. Hopper claims a 95% accuracy rate with its predictions, and is a huge hit with millennials.JetBlue (JBLU) recently stopped selling tickets on several small travel websites, with the intention of driving customers to the airline's own site to reduce costs.Many airlines want customers to use their sites directly to save on commissions, but also to be able to sell extras like preferred seating. While I do not think airlines will be able to sell 100% directly without the help of sites like EXPE, nevertheless the fact that there is a conflict between airlines and travel sites might become something to worry about in the future.We all know Airbnb (AIRB) as a vacation lodging solution. However that in itself has always been competitive and disruptive to the online hotel booking industry by default. Now Airbnb is trying to compete with giants EXPE and Priceline Group (PCLN) with Trips. Yes, it will not be easy, and Airbnb will sweat it out in order to make a claim in the online booking space. However, this nevertheless adds competitive margin pressure to the industry as a whole.EPXE is a great company, however great companies don't always make you money. Money is made when you buy at a reasonable valuation, and not at a high-sky multiple.However besides the rich valuation - which I think is the main reason for the big correction in the stock-- there are other reasons why investors need to worry. The big drop in EBITDA for the full year and the fact that cloud related expenses that will eat into 2018's profitability are two.In my book EXPE is not investable even after the correction, and even after the stock has returned to where it was two years ago. The stock is still very expensive, with a P/E still hovering over 40. And with profitability under pressure in the future, the very rich multiple might increase even more.As the chart of TRIP above showed, even with revenue growth, it is possible for a stock to correct by 66% as a result of being too rich. Personally, I think EXPE is the same boat."
4118339,102639,2017-10-31T01:18:11-04:00,"The share price of Expedia plunged almost 20% intra-day before closing 16% down, after the company announced its third-quarter 2017 results.I highlighted several key disappointment that should have already been priced in prior to the 3Q earnings announcement.With the steep fall, Expedia is now attractively priced based on historical multiples.","The share price of Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) plunged almost 20% intra-day before closing 16% down, after the company announced its third-quarter 2017 results. Based on the price chart, the price has breached the multi-year uptrend price channel. At this point, it is still difficult to say there is no chance of the share price snapping back to the support line, as it was not yet a convincing break. Furthermore, there have been several episodes of steep falls in the history of the uptrend, and Expedia still managed to rebound thereafter. There are intriguing points regarding the price action and the earnings, which I would elaborate subsequently.If there’s any selling based on Expedia missing its 3Q EPS consensus estimate, that would be most unfortunate, as it’s not as though it’s the first time the company has done so recently. In fact, Expedia has missed the EPS estimate for the fifth consecutive quarter. Sure, the company missed the revenue estimate for the first time since a year ago. However, it was just off by a mere 0.3%. Hardly a cause for alarm.(Source: Seeking Alpha)It would also be puzzling if the concern was over Trivago’s (NASDAQ:TRVG) disappointing results. Trivago saw its revenue growth on a standalone basis slowing to 22% year on year, and the company also guided for a “very difficult revenue comps” for the first half of 2018. However, the share price of Trivago has already been punished two days earlier on Wednesday, as it reported its own third-quarter report before the market opened that day. Hence, the share price of Expedia should already have been “priced in” the negative impact from Trivago, if we are to believe the market is efficient. Nevertheless, I can appreciate there could be some investors in Expedia who do not track Trivago actively and only came to realize the company’s woes from Expedia’s earnings announcement, resulting in the tepid results of Trivago still playing a part in those investors’ decision to sell on Friday.The hurricanes that battered Texas and Florida had also negatively impacted business. Nevertheless, again, this should have been factored in the share price prior to the earnings release, as obviously, the hurricanes disrupted travel arrangements.There could be some short-term headwinds facing the company. However, thanks to the sell-down, the stock metrics are now at levels not seen since mid-2016. Although not exactly an apples to apples comparison, the relative discount to Priceline (PCLN) has also widened considerably. The EV-to-EBITDA ratio of Expedia at 14x presently is almost half that of Priceline's 27x.EXPE EV to EBITDA (TTM) data by YChartsFor fast-growing companies, the price-to-sales ratio is also relevant as a valuation metric. Expedia has a P/S ratio of 1.85, a far cry from Priceline's 7.99. More importantly, Expedia's P/S ratio is now near the lows in the period 2014-2017 YTD. The ratio has tended to rebound off such levels in the past few years.EXPE PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsThe share price of Expedia is now trading below the fair value based on the average of its P/E Value and P/S Value. The P/E Value is calculated by multiplying the trailing twelve-month (""TTM"") EPS with the annual median price of each of the past five years and dividing it by EPS for the corresponding year. The P/S Value is calculated by multiplying the TTM sales per share figure with the 3-year historical average of the annual median Price/Sales ratios. Historically, Expedia has been able to surpass its fair value (presently at $135.41) over time.EXPE data by YChartsGiven that management of Expedia intends to keep the company in an acquisitive mode, a healthy free cash flow would surely be helpful. In terms of price-to-FCF, it is now at an attractive 15x. In contrast, Priceline has a P/FCF at 24x, though for much of 2016, it actually has a lower P/FCF than Expedia.EXPE Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsWhile the company's quick ratio is just one-third that of Priceline, it has been on an uptrend since the third quarter of 2016. This is an indication of Expedia's balance sheet getting stronger.EXPE Quick Ratio (Quarterly) data by YChartsIn my previous article on Expedia, I referenced a McKinsey article, noting that having the CEO with CFO background is favorable for companies implementing mergers & acquisitions. In the earnings call, the CEO reiterated that the company would continue to grow through M&A, even as he aimed to extract greater returns through “solid organic execution”.The share price has been punished over a cloudy outlook. However, with the steep fall, Expedia is now attractively priced based on historical multiples. As such, there is a good chance that the shares could eventually rebound back into the uptrending price channel and gradually recover to hit the upper end of the channel at $155 in a couple of months' time. Otherwise, if sentiment fails to return to positive, the price could fall to $100, back to the mid-2016 level.Do you agree?

4134890,104093,2018-01-02T15:50:50-05:00,"We estimate a $125 price target for Expedia using a basic discounted cash flow model with a 10% discount rate and a 2% terminal growth rate.Hotel Bookings make up the bulk the firm's value at 78%, followed by Car Rental, Cruises and Others at 8% and Advertisement revenue at 7%.Our key assumptions include a decline in revenue margins on hotel bookings offset by increases in the Average Daily Rate per hotel room and total rooms available.A more aggressive terminal growth rate of 3% will increase the target price to $134.","Expedia (EXPE) is the world's largest online travel booking service by gross bookings and second-largest by revenue, behind competitor Priceline (PCLN).It owns and operates several key online travel properties such as expedia.com, hotels.com and homeaway.com. These online platforms connect travellers to travel suppliers of hotels rooms, airline tickets, cruises, vacation homes, car rentals etc. In this report, we aim to present a reasonable, bottom-up analysis of the company. We will examine the key drivers of the business and make explicit our assumptions used to derive our price target so that we can create a meaningful discussion on the company and stock.Source: Expedia Presents At EyeforTravel NORTH AMERICA 2017 - SlideshowIn a recent company presentation, Expedia estimates the total value of the global travel market at $1.3 trillion, 50% of which can be categorized as online travel. What is interesting is the comparison between Expedia's strongest region, United States and Canada (USC), and the rest of the world. While the USC is the most advanced travel market with 67% categorized as belonging to the online travel segment (vs. 50% for Europe, 37% for Asia Pacific and 34% for Latin America), it is only the third biggest region at $383B, trailing Europe $456B and Asia Pacific $392B.This is a big positive for Expedia (and its competitors) with fully online business models as the other markets catch-up to USC levels of adoption of the internet in the travel market.As consumers shift away from less efficient means of making travel bookings through traditional travel agents and other intermediaries (i.e. phone, brick-and-martar shops, travel fairs) to an online desktop or mobile transaction, Expedia will be able to capture the growth via its existing online properties. Source: Expedia Presents At EyeforTravel NORTH AMERICA 2017 - SlideshowUsing a basic discounted cash flow model (available at trefis.com) combined with our own assumptions, we estimate that Hotel Bookings make up the vast majority of the firm's value. The main reason for this is because the commission which Expedia and its competitors can charge for a hotel booking (mid-teen percentage) is significantly higher than the equivalent fee for airline ticket bookings (low single digit percentage).Digger deeper, here are the key drivers within the Hotel Bookings segment:We expect the total number of hotel rooms, occupancy rate and Average Daily Rate to increase modestly by 2%, 1% and 3% CAGR from 2016 to 2023. However, there are two more drivers which are more tenuous. First, we believe the most crucial assumption is the revenue margin per hotel booking. This is the commission or fee which Expedia is able to charge its hotel suppliers/partners per booking.We model a decline in the revenue margin to 14% in 2023 from 17% in 2016. This number will likely decline faster if competition intensifies, or more likely if a new technology emerges to compete against Expedia's current search algorithms and booking processes. Second, we model in a 9% CAGR in Expedia's market share of the global hotel rooms to 11% in 2023 from 6.4% in 2016. This growth will be driven primarily by expansion in markets outside of USC as Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America turn to online means of booking hotel rooms. Herein lies execution risks as Expedia has to export its core USC business model into more fragmented regions.We also assume that there is room for more than one winner in the travel booking space as online companies take share from less nimble peers with legacy business models.Assuming a discount rate of 10% and a terminal growth rate of 2%, we estimate that Expedia is worth $19.5B or $125 per share. A more aggressive terminal growth rate of 3%, given its fully online business model as well as its position in the consumer discretionary spend category, will yield a target price of $134 per share.At the end of the day, Expedia is a technology company in the travel booking space. Since its founding as a division within Microsoft, its core expertise is to develop technological tools to make travel bookings easier, faster and cheaper. With over five thousand employees on its product and technology payroll, we believe Expedia will be able to innovate its way to survival and success in the travel booking space.

4145518,103480,2018-02-12T01:55:14-05:00,"Expedia tanked to the tune of 20% intraday at its lowest point on a huge earnings miss.The company's weak guidance for 2018 points to a ramp-up in sales and marketing spend and a huge slowdown in EBITDA growth.Return on advertising spend has been noticeably down across the industry, with Trivago reporting a similar story.With major headwinds in the OTA industry, Expedia's stock has corrected to an appropriate level and should not be bought in the hopes of a near-term rebound.","While it hasn't been a pretty week for any stock in the global markets, there's one stock that's had it worse than most: Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE), the huge online travel franchise that operates its eponymous brand as well as other large sites including HomeAway, Orbitz, and Travelocity. For reference, here is an infographic showing the company's broad portfolio of travel assets:Figure 1. Expedia brandsSource: Expedia investor relationsThe company reported its worst earnings quarter in recent memory, with a modest miss to revenues eclipsed by a massive miss to earnings projections. In addition, the company's commentary on increased sales and marketing spend, which will continue to ramp in 2018, without any evidence of associated growth, weighed heavily on the stock and caused a double-digit selloff.Now, for some context: Expedia had been on a downtrend for the past several months, after former CEO Dara Khosrowshahi announced he was leaving to take the top job at Uber. Since then, the new CEO Mark Overstrom has inherited a slew of ongoing issues, which seemingly climaxed at Expedia's fourth quarter release. Shares have given up all of their recent gains and are down -16% in the past twelve months:EXPE data by YChartsBut through this all, Expedia has always - and still does, even after its selloff - retain a valuation premium relative to its closest comp, Priceline (NASDAQ: PCLN) - when in fact, the two companies couldn't possibly be more similar. Like Expedia, Priceline operates a group of brands - most notable of which are Priceline.com, Kayak.com, Booking.com, and OpenTable. Yet despite Priceline's larger scale, its growth rate in bookings and revenue has a slight advantage over Expedia's (Priceline grew revenue and bookings by 20% and 18% in its most recent quarter (Q3), versus 11% and 14% at Expedia - though we'll see if Priceline also exhibits the same Q4 weakness when it reports at the end of February).Expedia's ~15% one-day drop is only closing the valuation gap between it and Priceline, nothing more. After all, there's no reason for Expedia to trade at a premium if it can't deliver premium revenue or earnings growth. So by this measure, it's hard for investors to cry out that Expedia's selloff has been overdone - it's just bringing the valuation back down to earth. And for a company that's projecting margin contractions and a massive deceleration of revenue and EBITDA growth in 2018, Expedia's ~22x forward P/E can still be considered expensive.PCLN PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsI wrote recently that Priceline was approaching a buy point and that it could hit $2,000 by year-end (it's currently trading under $1,800, thanks to the fallout effects from Expedia). Within the OTA space, I like Priceline (as well as Chinese competitor Ctrip (NASDAQ: CTRP)) the best, and am looking for clarity around earnings as they report later in the month. While both Expedia and Trivago have both reported headwinds to the business in 2018, Priceline could be able to get by without a scratch - though until this is confirmed, volatility will be high across all OTA stocks. Unless Expedia drops meaningfully more, it's still a stock to be avoided in favor of Priceline and Ctrip.Here's the summary view of Expedia's gruesome fourth quarter:Figure 2. Expedia Q4 earningsSource: Expedia investor relationsAs seen from the above, deceleration was the name of the game across the board. While gross bookings still grew 14% y/y, it has meaningfully slowed down relative to prior quarter; and room night growth, in particular, has slowed down by 757bps of growth to just 15% growth.Accordingly, revenue of $2.32 billion (+11% y/y) missed analyst targets for $2.36 billion (+13% y/y) by two points. That might have been forgiven, if not for the fact that adjusted EPS of $0.84 crashed -28% y/y and missed analyst expectations for $1.15 by a wide mile. All of Expedia's profitability metrics splashed red across the board, with adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, and operating income tumbling from last year.So what's the cause behind the bloodbath? Looking at the company's revenue growth via channel helps us a bit:Figure 3. Expedia Q4 segment resultsSource: Expedia investor relationsIt's particularly instructive to look at fourth-quarter results in comparison to full-year results. While Expedia's core (owned) OTA platforms are doing okay, holding a 10% growth rate, revenue derived from Trivago (decelerating from 40% to 18%) and HomeAway (deceleration from 32% to 16%) are particularly troublesome.Trivago (NASDAQ: TRVG), of course, is a separate company that is having its own problems - but those problems are spilling over into Expedia, who relies upon the Trivago channel for ~10% of its revenue base. Trivago is experimenting with a new booking system that, in the company's estimation, will derive ""higher-quality"" referrals to partner sites like Expedia - but in the near term, referrals will take a hit. (Referral growth at Trivago slipped to 14% in Q4, down from 20% in its prior quarter). With referrals from Trivago slowing down drastically, Expedia's second-largest revenue channel (after its own sites) is causing Expedia to suffer.HomeAway is owned by Expedia, and the story there is that HomeAway is moving away from subscription-based revenues (in which listers pay an annual subscription to have their home on the platform) to a transactional model, more akin to Airbnb. Expedia expects the transition to have a near-term impact on bookings and revenue (as seen in the deceleration above), and though it's optimistic for HomeAway's future, it's unclear whether the current situation can rebound.If top-line troubles were the full extent of the story, investors might not have been so harsh with Expedia. But the problem is that the company has ramped up its sales and marketing spend this quarter, with seemingly no positive results. Rapid expense growth combined with decelerating revenues ate up a large portion of Expedia's margin:Figure 4. Expedia expense growthSource: Expedia investor relationsSelling and marketing costs jumped 16% (after than revenues) and consumed 214bps more of Expedia's revenues than in 4Q16. All told, total expenses as a percentage of revenues increased 408bps (leading to a corresponding -4.08% decline in Expedia's operating margin).Now, a caveat here: Expedia does caution investors that the sales and marketing expenses it invests in today won't fully become productive until 2-3 quarters out. So it may be the case that Expedia's above-expected marketing expenses borne this quarter will correspondingly produce above-expected bookings and revenue growth in Q2 or Q3 of this year. But without solid evidence to back this claim, investors have to take management's word on faith - which is something the market doesn't have too much of right now.Expedia added insult to injury by hinting that FY18 would be ""more of the same"" of what investors saw in Q4. A single quarter's miss can be forgiven if the future looks bright, but in Expedia's case, it looks like the trouble is just beginning to brew.Expedia gives away much less detail in its guidance than most companies, but what investors heard immediately turned them off, with the company's CFO guiding to 6-11% Adjusted EBITDA growth.There are two issues with this right off the bat. First of all, Expedia's adjusted EBITDA had been growing at an 18% CAGR from 2013 - present. This implies that the era of profit expansion for Expedia is coming to its end, with the company delivering average revenue growth that is increasingly consuming more and more ad dollars. Trivago, which explicitly gives a ""return on advertising spend"" (ROAS) metric, has already hinted to the market that marketing efficiency would be down across the board, and Expedia's guidance confirms the same. And second - with Adjusted EBITDA contracting by -9% in Q4, can even this weak guidance be achieved? If slowdowns in Trivago and HomeAway persist for more than a few quarters of 2018 (Trivago's own guidance for 5-10% revenue growth in FY18 certainly isn't bright), Expedia could see flat or negative Adjusted EBITDA again in 2018.There are a lot of leaking holes to fix aboard Expedia's ship. While its rocky results don't make the coast clear for investing in its rivals Priceline and Ctrip, they certainly make better alternatives than Expedia, whose murky guidance still has plenty of room to the downside. Until fundamentals can start showing a recovery story, Expedia stock will likely trade sideways or accumulate to its heavy losses in February."
4109185,102639,2017-09-25T10:20:59-04:00,"Following the former CEO Dara Khosrowshahi's move to Uber to serve as its CEO, Expedia announced the appointment of Mark Okerstrom as its new President and CEO.McKinsey noted that ""CFOs perform well as CEOs when companies are going through situations that require financial discipline and focus.""In this article, I elaborate on the aptness of Mark's promotion and the positives from the recent senior note issuance as well as Dara's options forfeiture.","Following the former CEO Dara Khosrowshahi's move to Uber (UBER) to serve as its CEO, Expedia (EXPE) announced the appointment of Mark Okerstrom, then Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Operations, to succeed Khosrowshahi as President and CEO of Expedia. McKinsey, in an article published November 2006, noted:This appears apt for Expedia which has been in an acquisitive mode. Over the years, it has acquired or made significant investments in several companies as it seeks to hold its own against Priceline (PCLN), TripAdvisor (TRIP), etc. Just a few months ago, Expedia announced an investment in Indonesia's leading online travel agency, Traveloka. In June, it completed the acquisition of a majority stake in SilverRail Technologies, a London-based company that focuses on selling train tickets online. The company is set to benefit from its new CEO with his strong finance background in a new era for Expedia.On September 18, Expedia announced the sale of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.800% senior unsecured notes due 2028 in a private offering. Among the stated purposes of this senior notes offering, Expedia would be using the proceeds to redeem the 7.456% senior notes due 2018. The interest savings from the switch of this $500 million 7.456% senior notes alone would be $18 million annually. The remaining $500 million would ensure the company reduces its reliance on higher interest rate short-term revolving debt facilities for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, etc. In explaining its rationale for assigning a rating of Ba1 to this senior notes offering, Moodys' expects:This statement rather succinctly reiterated Moody's optimism over the prospects of Expedia's HomeAway acquisition and its investments in cloud technologies. The expectation of an improvement in the operating margins also bodes well for the company, with the pace of investments in the promotional efforts to build scale slowing down in the coming months and years as the business stabilizes. Similarly, Fitch is confident of Expedia keeping its balance sheet strong. It noted that the company ""has an established record"" of de-levering back below 2.0x within ""a reasonable time period"" even if at times, the leverage went above 2.0x. As of June 30, 2017, the pro forma leverage stood at around 1.9x. With the new CEO's background in finance and the support from the highly qualified and experienced CFO Alan Pickerill, there would be heightened scrutiny on the balance sheet and cash flows. The combined financial expertise should ensure greater prudence than ever on expenses. The resultant improvement in its financials would position itself for acquisitions or enable further investments in its existing businesses. This new senior notes offering is likely to be the beginning of a series of refinancing to reduce interest costs.Former CEO Dara Khosrowshahi made the headlines last year as the highest-paid U.S. CEO in 2015. His compensation came up to be worth nearly $95 million at the time of award. The majority of that amount (1.6 million shares) would have been in Khosrowshahi's hands in the form of stocks if he had remained employed with Expedia five years from the award. The rest (1.1 million shares), excluding about $4 million in the form of salary and cash bonus, was subjected to the stock price reaching at least $170 per share by September 30, 2020.According to company filings, the exercise price for these stock option awards is $95.00. At last Friday's closing price ($145.77), the 1.6 million shares for loyalty employment would have netted (ignoring fees and other charges) Khosrowshahi $81.2 million. Assuming the sale of the 1.1 million shares at $170 per share, that would have netted him another $82.5 million. There's another $20-30 million worth of options from his previous awards that have yet to vest and which he would have to forfeit after his departure. In total, Expedia is now pocketing back the around $200 million forfeited from the former CEO. While that is just one-quarter of the Free Cash Flow, it is a significant sum considering the 2016 net income was $282 million.It is unlikely that the board at Expedia would pay the newly appointed CEO, Mark Okerstrom, close to what it did for Khosrowshahi given the different stature between the two. In addition, Okerstrom is already well-compensated and was reportedly the company's highest-paid employee last year, even ahead of the former CEO and Expedia Chairman Barry Diller.Expedia's seven-year price uptrend still looks intact despite the recent corrections taking the price to the bottom of the channel. If the price breaks below the channel convincingly and is unable to re-enter promptly, that would be very bearish. The $140 level would serve as a strong ceiling for the mid-term and the price could even fall below $100. Fundamentally, if the competitive landscape intensifies further, exemplified by the scare from Trivago's (TRVG) lowered guidance early this month, that would be the trigger for further downside in the share price. With investors' optimism over Expedia partly pinning on the continued success of the HomeAway business, a heightened aggressiveness by Airbnb (AIRB) to capture market share could also precipitate a steeper correction.Nevertheless, the bulls appear likely to have the upper hand with 29 analysts offering one-year price targets ranging from a low of $153 to a high $190 according to a compilation by Yahoo Finance. A large majority of the analysts are calling for at least a ""Buy,"" with none calling for a sell/strong sell. As illustrated above, the newly appointed CEO would be seeing an improvement in its cash flow position thanks to the replacement of higher-interest-rate senior notes and the forfeiture of options from the former CEO. He can put those cash to good use during his term as CEO to propel Expedia and its share price higher.Author's Note: Thank you for reading.

4087297,69905,2017-07-12T13:59:56-04:00,"Management is driven and focused and has acquired a great group of companies.Its financials are very volatile, but it has a strong balance sheet.At the heart of it, it is already fairly to overvalued already.","IntroductionWhile Expedia (EXPE) currently is the number two company in its sector, it is not happy to settle for second place. Expedia’s management certainly deserves a lot of credit for growing its revenues aggressively through its portfolio of companies, with its HomeAway business decidedly taking on Airbnb’s business model.The article that follows contains recent business highlights, financials and a balance sheet appraisal, followed by valuation work and finishes by discussing its investment risks.Recent Business HighlightsExpedia got off to a great start in 2017 Q1, its revenue was up 15% and its EBITDA did particularly well and was up 18% YoY. Its Core OTA segment, which consists of a variety of brands, including Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Orbitz.com, Expedia Affiliates and other, accounts for roughly 75% of consolidated revenue as of 2017 Q1 and was up by 10% YoY. However, the segment which really stood out in Expedia's results was its recently acquired (December 2015) HomeAway business which was up 30% YoY.In spite of its HomeAway business generating less than 10% of its consolidated revenue, management has invested great hopes that this business will be able to encroach on Airbnb's market share. Expedia continues investing in its HomeAway business to ensure that homeowners and property managers find the platform seamless and efficient. However, management is not resting as it continues to seek out top-tier products and managerial talent so that all users on its platform find it a rewarding experience.Its Egencia segment, which offers managed travel services to corporate customers worldwide, accounted for just over 10% of consolidated revenue as of the end of fiscal 2014. However, by the end of 2017 Q1, this business had significantly underperformed Expedia's Core segment and accounted for less than 6% of Expedia's consolidated revenue. However, Expedia's management's drive and passion delivered resounding EBITDA growth in the quarter of 76% YoY to $27 million.Expedia's most recent quarterly results (2017 Q1) confirmed a trend which has transpired through the industry and that is to adopt a strategy where Online Travel Agencies increase their marketing spend in an effort to better match their increased bookable listing supply with further demand. Expedia, just like its biggest competitor Priceline (PCLN), is investing in strengthening its brand not only online but offline also. Expedia, in particular, saw a 25% increase in its direct selling and marketing expenses YoY, which was allocated to traffic generation costs from search engines and internet portals as well as to television. While Priceline, on the other hand, chooses to invest significantly more online via search engine keyword purchases and referrals from meta-search and travel research websites. Reinforcing this view is Priceline's CFO, Danial Finnegan, who commented on Priceline's most recent earnings call that it had seen advertising as a source of margin pressure throughout its peer group.FinancialsSource: morningstar.com; author's calculationsExpedia's financials have a history of being highly volatile, as its EPS number went from $3 in fiscal 2014, to $5.70 a year later and then back to $1.8 by the end of fiscal 2016. This volatility makes the business difficult to forecast with a greater margin of safety required from enterprising investors before committing funds.Valuation Relative to Peer GroupSource: morningstar.com; author's calculationsWhen comparing Expedia's relative pricing to itself, it appears that there is little to no margin of safety as it trades in line with its 5-year trailing average, both on a P/S ratios and a P/Cash Flow ratio, frequently implying that it already trades very close to its fair value. However, when compared with its peer group, it appears that there could be a discount in its pricing. However, I remain unconvinced that this is actually the case with findings that echoed this in my DCF analysis below.DCF AnalysisI performed a back-of-the-envelope DCF analysis with $812 million of FCF (normalized for the last three fiscal years), with 10% growth over the next five years (which is high compared with most companies) before leveling off at 5% (which is I consider to be modest and a sensible growth rate for Expedia). I then discounted this FCF back at 10%. I used 10%, which is a standard equity discount rate and realistic for a company with some financial flexibility as well as net debt position of $0.6 billion.This brings the DCF to approximately $20 billion, which is near to what it currently trades for, reinforcing my conclusion above in the relative pricing section.Investment RisksEXPE is currently priced as if it has very few competitors and that its market share is stable, as if it has some kind of competitive advantage, which, sadly, is very far from the truth. The number of online competitors reaching for the same global marketplace is increasing at a fast pace, both large and small. And some of its smaller competitors are not only some unknown and inexperienced companies; for instance, Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Hotel Ads platform while still in very embryonic stages certainly has the resources should it wish to encroach on Expedia's market. Google is a global trustworthy brand with unrivaled search and meta-search capabilities. The very same meta-search capabilities which Expedia relies on to collect and display related links to property rentals depending on consumers' desired criteria.Another obvious risk comes from its main competitor Priceline. As consumers demand bookable supply, in particular during peak seasons, it's reasonable to suspect that Priceline's larger supply could offer it a small competitive advantage over Expedia. Expedia finished fiscal 2016 with 269 million room nights whereas the Priceline Group finished fiscal 2016 with 557 million, more than double the amount Expedia's. Obviously, Priceline is not solely relying on greater supply for its competitive advantage, it is also doing a terrific job, demonstrated by its continuous improvements in innovation and creativity which should not be taken lightly. While the Online Travel Agency sector is not a winner-takes-all sector, one should not assume that Priceline will not strive to win a greater percentage of international market share from Expedia.ConclusionEXPE is priced very roughly at fair value. I could argue that it might actually be slightly overpriced, as its financials are very volatile and investors should demand great protection with a higher discount rate. Having compared Priceline’s business model, I found that one to be far superior and more robust with better margins, although Expedia is not priced materially cheaper to reflect its number two position in its industry.Additionally, while Expedia does offer a dividend whereas Priceline does not, the dividend offers such a small yield that Expedia should just scrap it altogether and use that capital to invest in its business. The opportunity facing its HomeAway business, in particular, is very significant, but management must be quick and effective to truly capitalize on it.Please do your own due diligence to reach your own conclusions.

4102473,22148,2017-08-28T17:22:51-04:00,"Long-time CEO is reportedly leaving for Uber.
        The success turning his term at Expedia was easily surpassed by the industry leader.
        A shift in the industry remains a bigger concern.","Before the open, the news reports is that long-time Expedia (EXPE) CEO Dara Khosrowshahi is leaving to take the job at Uber (UBER). The general thought is that the CEO has had an exceptional run since taking over in August 2005. The stock has had a strong run recently, but the history suggests a different level of success. Should one worry about the exit of the CEO?Looking at stock returns doesn't always tell the full story though a 12-year history in the top position leaves little question regarding the results. The initial view is that Khosrowshahi has had an exceptional term at the helm of Expedia with a gain in excess of 200%. After all, the stock has doubled the return of the S&P 500 during that period. Throwing Priceline (PCLN) into the equation though changes the view of the performance. Expedia has consistently lagged the gains of the now dominate player in the industry. This view suggests that Expedia benefitted from a secular trend and rode the tails of the industry leaders as much as strong execution from the CEO. Benzinga states that the departure is a ""major loss"" while Cowen maintains a $170 target on the stock with an Outperform rating. Expedia ended the day down nearly 5% to $142.50 suggesting nearly 20% upside on the price target. The real issue is that the CEO is departing the traditional online travel booking industry for a position in the sharing economy. Expedia has seen a decade of massive growth with revenues now approaching the $10 billion mark. The shift in positions could suggest that the sharing economy in the form of Airbnb (AIRB) for hotels and Uber (UBER) for car rentals is set to take market share away and cause growth to stall at Expedia. After all, the new CEO will use his extensive experience in the travel industry to help Uber further take share from the likes of Expedia and Priceline. While nothing fundamentally suggests that Expedia won't continue achieving the set financial targets, this move could be the tip of the iceberg. Expedia has already seen EPS estimates for next year trimmed significantly and the forward PE ratio rise. The key investor takeaway is that the exiting CEO didn't do an exceptional job as much as ride a wave in the sector. The data points including his shift towards a CEO position in the sharing economy suggests investors should exercise caution for a stock where expectations continue to decline."
4091383,101421,2017-07-27T14:29:08-04:00,Expedia is apparently investing $350 million in Indonesia-based Traveloka.Traveloka has developed a large online flight and hotel booking service focused on Southeast Asia.The deal represents a continued Expedia strategy of investing large amounts in relatively few industry leaders.,"Quick TakeExpedia (EXPE) is investing $350 million in Traveloka, an Indonesian online travel site, according to a report in The Information.Traveloka is one of the largest online travel booking sites in Southeast Asia and operates mostly domestically, but also serves five other countries.Expedia’s investment in Traveloka is a continuation of a bold strategy that makes fewer but larger investments and acquisitions as management focuses its efforts on larger opportunities.Investee CompanyJakarta, Indonesia-based Traveloka was founded in 2012 to aggregate flight and hotel availability for users to book their vacations.Management is headed by co-founder and CEO Ferry Unardi, who founded the site while finishing his Harvard MBA.Below is a brief promo video showing Traveloka’s focus on younger users:(Source: Traveloka Malaysia)Traveloka claims to service ‘more than 50 domestic and international airlines, serving more than 100,000 different routes throughout Asia Pacific and Europe…more than 70,000 hotels all over Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and Australia.’Investment Terms and RationaleThe current financing round is reported to reach a total of $400 million at a valuation of more than $2 billion.Traveloka previously raised a Series A round in 2012-2013 from Tokyo-based East Ventures and European investor Global Founders Capital.Notably, Expedia has made very few investments in recent years, as the Excel sheet below indicates,Expedia Investments: Expedia_Investments.xlsx(Source: VentureDeal)However, a feature of Expedia’s approach appears to be that it makes very large investments in companies that have already achieved scale in their particular region or industry.So, the lack of investment quantity does not seem to represent a low interest in investing; rather it shows an approach that is focused more on later stage companies that can benefit from Expedia’s scale or contribute scale of their own as part of a partnership.The online travel booking industry continues to grow, with Asia Pacific as the largest and fastest growing region, according to a 2015 Euromonitor International estimate shown below,(Source: Euromonitor International)According to the report, ‘Asia Pacific is expected to be the main driver of this performance [12% worldwide CAGR reaching $434 billion sales in 2020].’Furthermore, Expedia has been an active acquirer in the past three years, having acquired seven companies including HomeAway and Orbitz Worldwide as the table below indicates,(Source:Crunchbase)So, Expedia’s strategy of remaining focused on fewer later stage investments and larger acquisitions appears to be paying off for investors, as the five-year chart below shows a stock that has risen from $58.00 to nearly $160.00 in that time period,(Source: Seeking Alpha)With Expedia management delivering such generally steady and substantial returns to investors, it’s hard to find fault with their investment, M&A, and operating strategy.I expect and hope for more of the same, as Expedia continues to dominate the online booking and travel industry via smart and bold moves.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, and IPOs.

The time has come to go back to the well on this one and talk about why investors should avoid the name like the plague.There are a host of problems with the name, many of which I'll enunciate here. I'll highlight some of the problems associated with the firm's financial history, including the seeming disconnect between revenue and net income, various problems with the capital structure, and I'll then model my expectations for price based on a dividend forecast. I'll conclude by reviewing some of the assumptions embedded in the current price.Financial HistoryA few problems leap off the page when I review the financial history of Expedia. The most egregious of these in my view is the disconnect between revenue and net income. Since 2011, revenue has grown at a CAGR of about 16.8%, while net income is actually lower now than it was in 2011 (down at a CAGR of about -9%). This is disconcerting because the source of all sustainable shareholder returns is net income: it's the source of dividends, it's the source of increased book value through retained earnings, and net income is ultimately what leads to increased stock prices, given the strong correlation between net income and share appreciation.It's with that in mind that I find the disconnect between revenue and net income so alarming. Specifically, I ran a correlation analysis between revenue and net income from 2011 to the most recent quarter and found a very weak positive correlation between the two (r=.09). The most recent quarter exemplifies this problem. Although revenue was up $285 million from the same period last year, net income was only up about $22.5 million. This prompts the question: what has to happen to revenue to make net income rise materially? It is a relevant question in my view, given that income is quite important.There's also a fair bit of dilution present, as the share count has grown at a CAGR of about 2.3% since 2011. There's an obvious economic consequence to each ""slice"" of the business being shaved, but more importantly, it sends a signal about management here. They are less interested in shareholder well being than they otherwise might be.There are two problems that leap off the page at me from the balance sheet. The first is the high level of debt present. Although there's a great deal of cash present, approximately 40% of the $3.1 billion in long term debt is due before the year 2020. This is troublesome in my view, because it indicates there's a risk of a solvency or liquidity crisis in the company's future. More disconcerting than the debt present is the fact that fully 58% of the assets at the firm are intangibles. Given that intangibles have an alarming history of being written down, with immediate and predictable effects on earnings, this is another risk that I don't feel current shareholders are being adequately compensated for.Finally, it just seems that this is a relatively low margin business. The net income margin at Expedia has been variable, but it's recently been floating around the mid-single digits. In 2015, the company managed to generate a net margin of 11%, but it has dropped to about 3% since then.Modeling the Future From DividendsIt's obvious that there are some significant problems with the past that Expedia has created, but investors buy a future stream of cash flows, and thus I must try my hand at forecasting likely price activity over the next few years. This is an inherently difficult task, so I like to make the task slightly easier by isolating only one variable and building a model based on that. In this case, I want to hold all else constant but the dividend.Since 2011, the dividend per share has grown at a CAGR of about 10%. It seems to me unlikely that this growth rate will be maintained given the combination of dilution and high levels of debt present, so I'm going to model a growth rate of 4% from now until 2020. In addition, there's been a great deal of variability with the dividend over the past six years, so I think it makes sense to be as conservative as possible with dividend forecasts.When I perform this exercise on Expedia, using this assumption for dividend growth, my model spits out a CAGR return of just over 6.5%. in my view this is too little return for taking on the risk present, and so my dividend forecast suggests yet another reason to avoid the shares.The StockFor better or worse, investors can't access the cash flows of different companies directly, but must buy shares that trade in the public markets. The difficulty is that those shares are often priced in a way that seems to defy logic, and they are often priced at odds from the cash flows of the underlying businesses. In my view, this creates both challenges and opportunities for investors. When the assumptions embedded in share prices are too pessimistic, that may create the possibility for a decent return. When shares are priced for perfection, though, the level of risk is high. The reason is simple enough. If the company delivers the wonderful results the optimistic market expects, not much will happen as the good news is already ""priced in."" If, on the other hand, the market is disappointed by its erstwhile darling, the shares will drop. Thus, there's the wrong type of asymmetry present with expensive shares: not much upside and a great deal of downside potential.Technical SnapshotAs per our ChartMasterPro Daily Trade Model, the trend for EXPE turned bearish with a daily close below $146.00. This signals a bearish breakdown from an uptrend channel which began on May 19. From here we see the shares falling to the $132.00 level over the next three months.On Monday we may buy EXPE put options which will provide us with approximately 15x leverage on our short trade (for details on the option, please visit our website). Our initial stop-loss exit signal will be a daily close above $148.00.For investors in the shares, we recommend that you sell to avoid any further drop in the share value.ConclusionThe shares of Expedia are optimistically priced at the moment, which presents risk to shareholders. To demonstrate how optimistically priced they are, net income would have to balloon by about 189% over the next twelve months in order to make Expedia equal the (likely overvalued) overall market. Shareholders are currently being asked to pay too much for future cash flows from this company, and therefore should avoid the name."

When my latest bearish piece came out, the bulls jumped all over the article, suggesting that my logic was flawed and that the company was going higher. The stock has been triggered by my screen again, and I want to go for a hat trick and recommend that investors avoid the name. In my view, long investors are in for the same troubles they encountered every time I’ve looked in on this name this year. In this article, I’ll review why I continue to think this company is a poor investment at these levels.In my previous article, I ran a correlation between revenue and net income, trying to make the point that at some future date, we should expect to see a positive relationship between the two. In my view, if rising revenues don’t lead to (eventually rising) net income, what on earth will? I don’t consider this a controversial claim, but some readers took umbrage with it. I’ll simply state that the seeming disconnect between revenue and net income lingers. Revenue is up significantly over the past seven years while net income is lower now than it was then. In addition, net income has been remarkably volatile. This should be a disconcerting trend to current shareholders in my view.Another thing that leaps off the page when reviewing the long span of financial history here is the dilution present. The share count has grown at a CAGR of about .65%. The fact that share count has risen during the most recent quarter relative to the same period last year says to me that the dilution trend here lingers. This is troublesome to me because it indicates that marginal shareholders are buying a thinner and thinner slice of the future cash flows of this business. That, plus the rising share price, makes this a particularly pernicious trend for marginal investors.Turning to the capital structure, in my last article, I made reference to the high levels of intangible assets on the balance sheet (fully 58%), suggesting that shareholders' equity is much more tenuous than some investors might believe. That problem persists, obviously, but in this article, I want to drill down more deeply into the debt load. The debt here has grown rapidly since 2010 (up at a CAGR of about 14% since then). This is troublesome because it restricts the company’s future options, and it increases the risks of a solvency crisis. This risk is particularly acute in this case because 39.4% of long-term debt is due before 2020. In addition, the interest expense here is relatively high (5.48%). This is an obvious drag on net income, as evidenced by the most recent 10-Q. In the absence of the interest expense of about $85 million, Expedia would have managed to earn a profit of about $56 million rather than the loss of $29.4 million that it's experienced over the first six months of 2017.The (poor) financial history at Expedia may be interesting to some, but we need to be concerned more with the future than with the past, so it falls to me now to try to come up with a reasonable model for future price. Whenever the task of predicting falls on my narrow shoulders, I engage in a ceteris paribus exercise, meaning that I only “move” the variable that I consider to be the most significant determinant of value, which is the dividend in this case.One thing I didn’t take into account in my previous article is the fact that the company will either need to repay or refinance about $1.23 billion of debt in the next 2 ½ years. In my view, this will act as more of a drag on the dividend than I had originally anticipated, and I’m therefore going to drop the growth rate between now and 2022 to 3%. When I perform this forecast on Expedia, I infer a compounded return of about 3.5% over the next five years. In addition, most of this return comes from the assumption of a capital gain from here, which I consider a less reliable measure of return and therefore less likely than the dividends from the firm. Thus, 3.5% is in a sense the best that shareholders should expect from this company over the next five years.As per our ChartMasterPro Daily Trade Model, the trend for EXPE turned bearish when the shares closed below $146.00 on August 17. This signaled a breakdown from a bear flag on the daily charts. From here, we see the shares falling to the $132.00 level over the next three months.On Monday, we will buy EXPE put options, which will provide us with approximately 18x leverage on our short trade (for details on the option, please visit our website). Our initial stop-loss exit signal will be a daily close above $148.00.For investors in the shares, we recommend that you sell to avoid any further drop in the share value.Investing is an innately relativistic process, meaning that we must choose between option A and B. We buy A and eschew B. In my view, and history seems to support this view, future stock returns are largely dependent on valuation. The more you pay for something, the lower your subsequent returns are going to be. When a company is trading at a significant premium (250%) to an arguably overvalued market, there’s a tremendous level of risk present. In addition, the company is expensive to its own past. In my view, there’s increasingly less upside than downside here, and investors would be wise to avoid the shares at these levels."

Based on comparable valuations, Expedia's stake could be valued around $2.4B to $3B.Expedia has been one of the leaders in the travel industry and owns several global brands.With a diversification across several brands in the travel industry, some investments will have a hefty payback.Can we build in this intangible factor into Expedia valuation and find out its true potential?","Executive Summary:About the company, Expedia:Expedia is an American travel company headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. It is a leading provider of branded online travel services for leisure and business travelers. It uses the award-winning Expert Searching and Pricing - ESP - technology to deliver the most comprehensive flight options available online, allow customers to dynamically build complete trips that combine flights, Expedia Special Rate hotels and other lodging, ground transportation, and destination activities. Expedia has over the years partnered and owned a lot of global brands to bring in this package booking functionality.On a side note, an interesting fact which many of us may not know is that Expedia was initially founded as a division of Microsoft (MSFT) in October 1996. Shortly after, in 1999, it was spun off from MSFT and filed for its own IPO raising $72.8M. I also read this short story behind the name, Expedia. Richard Barton, who was the original CEO and who had pitched the idea for online travel business to Bill Gates, initially had considered naming this company as ""Microsoft Travel"" but later changed it to Expedia from the combination of words ""exploration"" and ""speed.""A quick look at the financials and service offerings :Expedia locked in sales of $6.7B for the year ended December 2015 and $1.9B, $2.2B and $2.5B for each of the three quarters in 2016. The company has reported an increasing revenue YoY for the past 9 out of 10 years.The service offerings as per the latest Q3 2016 results are as follows:· Hotel rooms (63% of revenue)· Vacation rentals (8% of revenue)· Air tickets (8% of revenue)· Rental cars, cruises and others (12%of revenue)· Advertising revenue (9% of revenue)Expedia's acquisition spree:Why is Expedia investing in so many brands?Over the years, Expedia has built a leading network of online travel services, which has driven a strong user base. As Internet dramatically started changing the way that consumers and businesses communicate, Expedia was quick enough to catch on the new emerging trends. EXPE has always been on a shopping spree scouting for the next innovation in the travel industry. It owns, partners and operates several international global online travel brands including Hotels.com, Hotwire.com, Trivago, Travelocity, Orbitz and HomeAway.Expedia has invested in several brands. Some of them are:Expedia's companies operate more than 100 branded points of sale in more than 60 countries. It also powers travel bookings for over 10,000 partners such as airlines and hotels, consumer brands, and high traffic websites through Expedia Affiliate Network.Expedia has done a great job by leveraging its technology and marketing and investing in the latest innovations.What does Trivago IPO mean for Expedia?Trivago, which is a fast growing hotel booking platform, recently decided to file for an IPO. Expedia had paid $632M for a 61.6% ownership stake in Trivago in 2013 with a plan to expand its geographical reach in Europe, and this plan definitely worked well for EXPE. Although we do not know the valuation of the Trivago IPO as of now, it is estimated that Trivago would be valued somewhere between $3 and $5B. This is based on a comparable valuation of TripAdvisor (TRIP). TRIP is currently trading at a Price/Sales ratio of 5. As per F-1 filed with SEC, Trivago has generated a revenue of $657M till Q3 2016 which is already 60% over its 2015 revenue. Its revenues are expected to reach a target of around $1B in 2017. Considering a Price/ Sales ratio of 5, Trivago can be valued at around $5B. Expedia's 61.6% stake would make it a little more than $3B. Even if Travigo is valued a little lower, say at $4B, Expedia's stake would still be around $2.4B. A valuation of $4B would mean that Expedia would have earned a 2.8 times return on investment in less than 4 years and a valuation of $5B would mean a return of around 3.7 times on its initial investment. This means that Travigo has definitely been a profitable investment for Expedia.What about Expedia's other acquisitions?When Expedia paid $3.9B for vacation rental website HomeAway in 2015, $280M for Travelocity and another $1.38B for Orbitz.com in 2015, there had been several concerns in the market. However, Expedia's CEO was very confident about these deals as being very strategic for the company.As per Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's President and CEO,Orbitz merger has helped the company with some cost savings and also to compete with its rival, The Priceline Group (PCLN). HomeAway, an Airbnb (AIRB) competitor, is likely to be a huge win-win for the company and its consumers. With Airbnb currently being valued at $30B, who knows what could be the future valuation of HomeAway?Current valuation of ExpediaExpedia reported a revenue of $6.6B as of 2015 and a YoY growth of 15%. The net margin increased from 6.11% in 2014 to 11.46% in 2015. The return on equity is at a healthy rate of 23% and return on capital invested is at 14.6%. The debt is on the higher side with the current ratio being 0.5 and the debt/equity ratio 0.66. However, the company is able to sustain these debt levels currently.The current P/E ratio is 108.8 which is quite high. However, the forward P/E ratio is 19.5 which seems to be quite reasonable for the company. The PEG ratio is 1.2 and Price/ Sales ratio is 2.2. So the current valuations suggest that though the company is not very cheap, it is not overly priced as well considering all the financial factors.Investor Takeaway - What do Trivago valuations tell us about Expedia valuations?Expedia is maintaining its leadership position by leveraging its technology and brand name and through acquisitions to keep up with the changes in its industry. Some of the acquisitions may seem to be overpriced than others. Some acquisitions may also fail, incurring a loss to the company. However, with a diversification all across the travel industry, some acquisitions are bound to return a hefty payback. If you build this intangible factor into the company's valuation, Expedia seems to be a very reasonable buy even at the current price. Can we unlock this potential in the travel industry by investing in Expedia?"
4029581,58671,2016-12-09T15:44:15-05:00,Expedia bought HomeAway on December 15th 2015 for $3.9B via a cash and stock deal.Expedia has transitioned HomeAway's model from a listing model to a fee model allowing travelers to book rentals directly through HomeAway (similar to the Airbnb model).HomeAway's margins on its Traveler Fee are enormous and the business will be a cash cow for years to come.The best way to participate in this investment is to buy Liberty Expedia Holdings due to the 8% discount to NAV.,"HomeAway owns a group of Vacation Rental websites, including HomeAway.com, VRBO.com, VacationRentals.com, BedandBreakfast.com, various international vacation rental websites, and travelmob.com. Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) bought HomeAway on December 15th 2015 for $3.9B split between roughly $1B cash and $2.9B worth of Expedia stock. It has been almost a year since the acquisition, which provides enough time and data to evaluate the effectiveness of the acquisition. I believe this acquisition was one of the best value-creating acquisitions of late and I commend the management of Expedia from seeing the potential in HomeAway and executing.The success of this acquisition highlights the strength of Expedia's management, which I believe is widely underappreciated by investors. The success of the HomeAway acquisition and subsequent business model transition has largely been missed by investors and few truly understand the value HomeAway will deliver for shareholders going forward.Business Model Transition and Expedia AcquisitionSource: Expedia Investor Presentation: March, 2016HomeAway's original business model was to list vacation rentals on its websites and collect listing fees from owners of those properties. Then, in 2012, Airbnb (AIRB) came along. Airbnb offered essentially the same listing services as HomeAway, but on top of that it allowed users to book directly through Airbnb. Airbnb became the intermediary between the owner and the renter facilitating the transaction all while collecting a fee for doing so. Airbnb was different from HomeAway in other ways outside of just the fee-based model. Airbnb allowed different types of listings outside of what HomeAway offered, including renting out a single bedroom in a multiple-unit condo. HomeAway realized, at some point after Airbnb came along, that it needed to change its business model both in order to compete but also because the fee model was more lucrative.HomeAway realized it was not equipped to undertake this business model transition itself in mid-2015. Throughout the summer and fall of 2015, the HomeAway Board went through a process to explore the sale of the company. During that process, five companies expressed interest in HomeAway but only Expedia eventually made an offer for the company. Expedia announced the HomeAway acquisition on November 4th 2015. In that press release, Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was quoted:It was clear that Dara and Barry Diller, Expedia's Chairman of the Board, know that a business model transition was an incredible opportunity. Barry Diller, in an interview on CNBC, shortly after the completion of the HomeAway acquisition, added:Traveler Fee and HomeAway MarginsExpedia began transitioning HomeAway to the new model right away. The new model was to charge a fee for booking through the website, which it calls a ""Traveler Fee"". A Traveler Fee is charged to the traveler (or renter) when they book through HomeAway websites, which also comes with a Book with Confidence GuaranteeTM. The Traveler Fee can be avoided by booking directly with the property owner, so the amount from renters that book through HomeAway websites is a big factor in the revenues and profit generation.Why a Traveler's Fee? Because the traveler's fee has very high margins. Airbnb and HomeAway are unique assets within the vacation rental market. Unlike all other categories within the travel market (Airlines, Hotels, Car Rental, Cruises), Vacations Rentals are completely decentralized allowing the platforms in the industry to control all of the bargaining power. As a property owner, if you don't list and rent through Airbnb or HomeAway you have very few options, although more are emerging like FlipKey, Booking.com, and TripAdvisor Rentals. The Traveler's Fee are approximately 6% of the rental amount. So what are the costs associated with the Traveler's fee from HomeAway's perspective per its website:6% of the rental amount in exchange for a flat fee service that is the same for every purchase, sign me up. This is similar to a StubHub model. HomeAway costs are the same for every transaction but margins increase as rental amounts increase. So how does this all translate into financials? Here are HomeAway's financials pre and post the acquisition.HomeAway is operated as a separate entity within Expedia making a comparison of the business before and after the acquisition viable. As you can see, EBITDA margins have increased significantly and revenue growth has accelerated. These trends are directly linked to the implementation of the Traveler's Fee. As HomeAway moves more rental transactions on to its platform, these trends should continue going forward.Expedia has set a target that HomeAway will generate $350M in adjusted EBITDA in 2018. Based on the recent results, I think that goal is low. 2017 will be a large investment year for HomeAway, including a shift to the cloud that will likely stifle some of the EBITDA margins in the short term. 2018 will be the first ""clean year"" of post-acquisition HomeAway and I forecast it can do $1.3B in sales and $520M in adjusted EBITDA. Apply an EV/EBITDA of 15, which is pretty fair for a fast growing internet commerce platform and you're talking about a valuation of $8B.ConclusionExpedia's acquisition of HomeAway was a masterful acquisition. I commend Dara Khosrowshahi and Barry Diller on seeing an opportunity in the marketplace and executed on it. They were able to double the value of HomeAway in one year from an acquisition price of $3.9B to a current valuation of $8B. Expedia is a great company with tons of growth in front of it at a cheap valuation with a stellar management team. For a normal investor, I suggesting buying shares of Expedia. For a more enterprising investor, I suggest buying shares of Liberty Expedia Holdings (NASDAQ:LEXEA) which offers an 8% discount to NAV and holds almost 100% of its assets in Expedia shares."

Gowell was previously CEO of National Leisure Group where he built the web’s first cruise and vacation experience e-commerce service.Below is a brief demo video about SilverRail:(Source: SilverRail)The company says it ""handles more than 1 billion online rail searches each year…distributes tickets for more than 35 providers and carriers…processes more than 25 million bookings each year and serves more than 1,500 corporate customers worldwide.""SilverRail had raised $69 million in funding from top-tier venture capital firms Accel Partners, Mithril Capital Management, and others. Mithril is a later stage investment group founded by noted venture capitalist Peter Thiel.Its most recent round was in 2014, raising $40 million to ""accelerate the integration of global rail carriers, continue building its search technology, and expand carrier IT solutions.""Acquisition Terms and RationaleNeither company disclosed the consideration to be paid or the terms of the majority stake acquisition. Expedia did not state that the deal would affect its financial results and only filed an 8-K to disclose the press release, so the transaction is likely not material to its financial condition.The two companies were well-known to each other before the deal announcement. In November 2015 the two companies announced a strategic partnership for SilverRail to power Expedia’s expansion into the rail business.Of note is Expedia agreeing to purchase a majority stake rather than the entire company stock. I wonder if the founders are using a version of the Trivago model.Trivago is a subsidiary of Expedia. Trivago’s founders (and Expedia) retained their stake in the company, even as it went public in December 2016.It could be the case that SilverRail’s founders and/or certain investors are retaining their stake in anticipation of an IPO in the coming years. In the meantime, Expedia will be able to help SilverRail grow the breadth and depth of their business, further integrate its technology with Expedia’s platform and retain rights to acquire the part of SilverRail it won’t initially own.Expedia is acquiring SilverRail due to the rise in consumers using rail-based transportation for business and pleasure, especially throughout Europe and Asia.So, Expedia figured out it could no longer wait to include a robust rail technology offering in its portfolio.As Greg Schulze, SVP Global Tour and Transport at Expedia, said in 2015,By bringing a strategic partnership under house control, Expedia stands to reap continued benefits by being a preeminent provider of rail-based transportation options.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

Pre-IPO, Expedia holds 63.5% of trivago, but we don't know how much of the company Expedia will retain post-IPO.There is an important tax-related contingency, that of the entity making a tax ruling request of the German tax authorities post-IPO about wanting a tax-free exchange of founder's shares vs. Germany's rights to tax the new public limited company entity for any capital gains as a result of the disposal of certain assets (merger with Trivago N.V.)If Trivago does not receive a favorable ruling, the entity will reorganize first into a German stock corporation and then into a European public limited liability company (Trivago Societas Europaea).Selling shareholders are the company founders, who will receive all of the net proceeds from the offering.J.P. Morgan is the lead left underwriter for the offering, which also includes Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Allen & Company, BofA Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, and others.CommentaryTrivago has created a hotel and lodging-focused search and review process that makes it easy for consumers to find lodging that fits their needs.It has developed a CPC-based bidding platform to enable hotels to place higher in results, a la a Google-type of advertising system.The service's independence is also a selling point, with user reviews providing consumers with additional, in-depth information that can't be found anywhere else.I call this the ""Amazon"" approach. Users know they can get largely unbiased consumer reviews of the hotel experience to make smarter decisions. This feature also incentivizes hotels to provide better customer service to avoid negative reviews.Trivago also likely benefits from being in the Expedia family, although their F-1 filing indicated an ""independent"" approach to their business, with the exception of Expedia providing certain ""corporate functions, including with the legal, tax, treasury, audit and corporate development areas, and hosts all of the servers we use that are located within the United States.""However, the online market for travel aggregation is a very large market, so Trivago will always have significant competitive threats from existing players and potential new market entrants.We don't know the proposed pricing of the IPO shares or potential market cap of the public entity so cannot form a final opinion on the IPO opportunity.But the company's financials indicate that top line revenues are growing quickly, and the firm is generating cash flow from operations. Operating income is negative, however, so that is a caution.Depending on valuation, Trivago may be a potential addition to a growth investor's portfolio.I will provide updates as we know more.I write about IPOs, M&A, and billion dollar privately-held tech companies.

It's with that in mind that I want to write briefly about Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and why I think the stock is overpriced and is destined to fall.The FinancialsNet income at Expedia has declined precipitously over the past year, and the stock price initially reacted accordingly, moving from ~$135 to $95. This is what happens when rosy expectations aren't met. But by the time quarterly earnings hit their low in March of 2016, the stock was off to the races again, breaking the $100 per share mark before head toward the current $119.Taking a longer term look at net income here, it's apparent that it's quite choppy at Expedia. For instance, between 2010 and 2011, it dropped 7%, between 2012 and 2013, it dropped an alarming 28%, and from 2015 to 2016 it dropped 64%. The market forgives this lack of consistency, but I can't.Revenue growth has been quite robust, and perhaps that's why investors have bid the shares up to the levels they have. As is plain from this chart, though, net income has not followed suit. At this point, investors seem to be hoping that something will change, that some sort of catalyst will transform these growing revenues into rising profits. I don't know what such a catalyst would look like, and, based on my readings of various Expedia analyses, neither does anyone else. But hope lingers for now.A bull will argue that the future won't resemble the past, and that's obviously true. The future will obviously be different, but so what? Expedia is certainly a major player in the $1.3 trillion travel market, owning 20% of the online market and 13% of the total market respectively. There's also obviously room for the company to grow. My question is, so what? Why will the next $1 billion of revenue generate a profit margin greater than the current 2.9%? What will suddenly change in the online travel game to make this a materially more profitable company?There is also a great deal of debt here, which is necessary, perhaps when stock buybacks and dividends are ~$700 million greater than net income since 2011. More troubling to me is the fact that 47% of the debt is due within 4 years.Modeling the StockAs I've said repeatedly, and is particularly relevant in this case, the returns an investor makes largely depend on the price at which they manage to acquire the shares. For instance, a profitable company with a high margin that's trading at a significant premium will more than likely generate poor returns, in spite of the great underlying performance. When presented with the combination of a company that has a spotty track and a stock that is trading at a premium, investors should run, not walk, away.In trying to make this case mathematically, I've made some assumptions about what has to happen in order for Expedia to trade at the same approximate valuation as the overall market. I prefer to compare all companies to the average, because investing is a relative game and if I can find better value elsewhere in the market, I will take it. For those who object to this and insist that I compare Expedia only to its past self, I would say that in this way, too, it is overpriced.Using the figures presented in their most recent financial statement, Expedia earned $1.69 in 2016 from continuing operations, which implies a PE multiple of ~70 at today's price. Holding all else constant (the number of shares, current margin), in order for the EPS to grow to where the PE lines up with the current (arguably overpriced) market, it would need to grow to ~$4.6. In order for this to happen, holding margins constant, Expedia would need to generate revenues of about $24.4 billion, or roughly 2.8 times the current revenues. For investors who focus on revenue, the idea that this revenue will grow that much is, shall we say, a stretch.Technical SnapshotAs per our ChartMasterPro Daily Price Model the trend for EXPE turned Bearish on February 13 when the shares closed below the bullish uptrend line which began on January 6. From here we see the stock dropping to the $112.00 level over the next six months.Today we bought the EXPE 21APR17 120 Put Options which will provide us with approximately 12x leverage on our SHORT trade. Our initial stop-loss exit signal will be a daily close above $122.00.For investors in the shares we recommend that you SELL to avoid any further decline in the share price.ConclusionIf Expedia returns to its more normal PE multiple, it may be a compelling investment, though it'll likely never be a compelling company as it is too unpredictable. At the moment, though, this is a very bad combination of a stock priced for perfection and a business that is imperfect. Avoid Expedia."
4045405,51362,2017-02-13T13:00:46-05:00,"Online Travel is a secular growth industry which now operates within a duopoly between Expedia and Priceline.
        Expedia is expected to double its earnings over the next 4-5 years due to recent M&A and industry growth.
        The company is well-managed with a long-tenured CEO and with many notable investors on the Board.
        Expedia's valuation is reasonable and investors can receive an additional discount by investing in the Liberty Expedia shares.","Recommendation: Long Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) equityCurrent Stock Price: $122.65 (as of 02/10/17)Target Stock Price: $200 (63% upside)Timing: 1 to 4 yearsCatalysts: integration of recent acquisitions, continued strong organic growth, and margin expansion.Situation OverviewExpedia is the largest Online Travel Agency (OTA) by bookings. Over the past 3 years, Expedia has rolled up the OTA industry through a series of strategic acquisitions which have transformed the OTA space into a duopoly with Priceline (PCLN) remaining as the only competitor at scale. Over the next 4 years, we expect Expedia's earnings to more than double as the company benefits from acquisition synergies and strong organic growth. Trading at only 11.4x 2017E analyst consensus EBITDA, we believe the stock price can more than double over the next four years, in-line with earnings growth and with minimal multiple compression.Competitive AdvantagesOnline Travel Agencies are internet based distribution services which are differentiated in their ability to generate user traffic, offer unique travel inventory, and push through a high rate of user traffic conversion into bookings.Expedia is the only OTA that offers a full range of travel inventory covering flights, hotels, cars, cruises, attractions, vacation rentals, and rail. Expedia is uniquely able to offer packaged deals (flight + hotel) at attractive rates.Expedia completely overhauled its technology platform from 2010 to 2013, enabling the platform to operate more effectively and at a lower cost. Expedia now has an industry-leading traffic conversion rate. Expedia continues to spend ~$1 billion a year on technology to maintain its edge, more than any other OTA.Expedia has made significant brand investment since its founding in 1996. Expedia and its multiple sister websites (Travelocity, Orbitz, Hotels.com, Hotwire, ect.) are some of the most recognized brands in online travel. Expedia leverages its brand position to generate over 450 million monthly unique website visits. Expedia's enormous traffic advantage enables the company to drive significant leverage in its negotiations with travel providers and operate at superior scale unit economics.Barriers to EntryOnline Travel Agencies benefit from network effects and need scale to operate at a profit. Expedia has a dominant market position in the U.S with 7x the bookings base as compared to Priceline, the #2 player. In Europe, Expedia is the #2 player with half of the bookings base as compared to Priceline.Travel inventory is extremely fragmented and requires the OTAs to maintain large salesforces to recruit travel providers to their platforms. The OTAs also need significant IT resources to integrate the various online reservation platforms maintained by the millions of individual travel providers.Expedia has spent billions of dollars and over 20 years developing, testing, and optimizing its technology systems to operate effectively and generate the highest possible conversion rates. Having a high conversion rate is the key differentiator which enables an OTA to operate at lower costs so that it may spend more aggressively on user traffic acquisition and thus attract more travel provider partners. This is a virtuous cycle which is difficult to set into motion.Expedia has made enormous brand investment to establish significant brand equity in the marketplace. In the last 12 months, Expedia has spent over $4 billion on sales and marketing, of which the majority was spent on brand advertising and direct marketing. This enormous marketing spend enables Expedia to maintain its industry-leading traffic generation, reinforcing the network effects on its platform.Secular GrowthExpedia operates in the massive $1.3 trillion global travel market. Overall spending on travel is growing faster than GDP in both developing and developed countries due to the growing preference to spend money on experiences vs. physical goods. Additionally, ~50% of global travel bookings occur offline. OTAs will benefit from the gradual increase in online penetration of travel bookings. Industry experts estimate that organic growth in the OTA industry will continue at a double digit pace for the next 5 to 10 years. Expedia serves almost every geographic and market segment through its vast portfolio of travel brands and will be the primary beneficiary of the significant secular growth in online travel bookings.Management and GovernanceDara Khosrowshahi is a visionary leader who has served as the company's CEO since it was spun out of IAC Interactive in 2005. Legendary media executive and investor Barry Diller serves as the Chairman of the Board. Dara previously served as CFO of Diller's IAC Interactive. The duo was extremely early in recognizing the potential in the OTA industry and began acquiring OTA businesses in the late 1990's under the IAC Travel umbrella. Management has shown extremely capable and flexible capital allocation skill and has at various times made significant internal investments, acquisitions, divestitures, buybacks, and dividends. Over the past 10 years, Expedia has generated an annual total return of 14.0% vs. 7.1% for the S&P 500 and 8.4% for the Morningstar Leisure industry benchmark.Other notable shareholders include John Malone, who maintains a Board seat, and notable travel industry specialists PAR Capital Management and Altimeter Capital.Variant ViewExpedia has closed over $7 billion in acquisitions since 2014 (1/3 of the current Enterprise value) which has obscured the company's financial trajectory and has made the stock more difficult to study and value.The trivago business operates at earnings break-even due to its aggressive growth plans. trivago adds almost 10% to enterprise value but does not contribute to earnings, making Expedia's stock appear more expensive. In December 2016, Expedia IPOed trivago in a small float offering which highlighted the value of the segment. Adjusting for trivago reduces the valuation multiple on the core business by ~9%.Over the past 4 years, Expedia has reduced its commissions charged to hotel partners in order to match Priceline. This intentional reduction has created a multi-year headwind to unit economics and has resulted in overhead spending deleverage. Beginning in 2017, Expedia will no longer need to adjust its commissions lower which will lift the headwind to unit economics and enable margin expansion.ValuationExpedia trades for 11.4x 2017E consensus EBITDA vs. Priceline at 17.1x. Priceline focuses on the high-margin European hotel market and generates a higher return on invested capital; therefore, we recognize that Priceline's valuation premium over Expedia is justified. However, given that Expedia's mix is increasingly shifting towards international hotels and high-growth meta-search, we feel that there is room for multiple expansion.Historically, Expedia has traded with a forward multiple in the 9x to 12x EBITDA range. The current multiple is at the high end of the range, but current growth prospects are higher than they have been historically. Finally, when adjusting for the impact of trivago, the remaining business trades squarely in the middle of the historical range.We derived our 4-year price target of $200 using a sum-of-the-parts valuation. Extrapolating the growth from each segment over the next 4 years and assigning current market multiples implies 63% upside from the current share price with no overall multiple expansion. This implies a high teens IRR. We have baked conservatism into our modeling assumptions to account for potential cyclical impacts. Our projections are materially below sell-side forecasts which gives us comfort that there is a margin of safety in our valuation.Our valuation does not include Expedia's portfolio of minority equity stakes in other travel technology businesses which are currently carried at $520 million on the company's balance sheet. Investors have a ""free option"" on the upside from Expedia's investment activity. There could be significant value if Expedia has invested in the next 'Kayak' or 'trivago', which is likely considering the company's M&A track record.Finally, investors can receive an additional 10% to 15% discount on shares of Expedia by investing in the publicly traded Liberty Expedia vehicle (NASDAQ:LEXEA). Liberty Expedia is a John Malone controlled holding company which holds shares of Expedia, debt, and ownership of BodyBuidling.com. The discount investors receive from Libery Expedia shares varies from 10% to 15%, depending on the value ascribed to BodyBuilding.com.RisksKey risks include the cyclicality of travel spending, the threat of competition from a new entrant, and the threat of competition from existing players.Travel spending is inherently cyclical. In 2009, the U.S. lodging sector saw revenue decline ~20% while Expedia saw its revenue fall 6.6%. Expedia fared much better than the overall industry because of the strong structural growth tailwinds. Those tailwinds will likely continue through the next decade. The OTA model also has some counter-cyclical features. Because variable costs are ~60% and OTAs do not hold any inventory, OTAs can rapidly reduce expenses in a downturn. Furthermore, in a weak demand market, travel providers become more promotional and depend more on the OTA channel.We do not view the threat from a new entrant (Airbnb, Google, TripAdvisor, ect.) to be a dire risk because of the significant barriers to entry and competitive advantages that OTAs enjoy. For example, Airbnb (AIRB) has penetrated the alternative accommodations market with a limited salesforce and almost no advertising. In order for Airbnb to penetrate the traditional OTA market, it would need to substantially change its business model. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) would be unlikely to transform into an OTA because it already benefits from the massive ad spend that OTAs and travel providers pay Google. To become an OTA, Google would need to make significant capital investments and cannibalize its extremely lucrative existing paid search business.TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) has actually attempted to compete with the OTAs and its ongoing struggles demonstrate the challenge of penetrating the market. TripAdvisor has an existing paid search business (like Google) and introduced the ability for customers to make a booking. Because TripAdvisor did not have the travel inventory, it had to partner with OTAs to fulfill the bookings requests. TripAdvisor had to reallocate space on its website from paid ads to the booking feature which cannibalized its existing business. TripAdvisor has not generated a high conversion rate from its booking option and thus has not been able to afford the variable marketing spend needed to generate traffic; this is despite the fact that TripAdvisor already had over 300 million unique monthly visitors. As a result, TripAdvisor has seen its earnings decline and its stock price cut in half since it rolled out the booking feature in 2014.Finally, the risk of competition from Priceline has weighed on analysts due to Expedia's moves to match Priceline's lower commissions and enter the European hotel market. Priceline has responded by publicly stating that Expedia has behaved rationally by matching Priceline's low rates and expanding internationally. Priceline has not changed its business plans or pricing and Expedia has completed its transition and has stated its intention of keeping commissions at bay going forward. This strikes us as the behavior of rational industry participants.Now that the industry has transitioned from a fragmented state into a duopoly, it is widely expected that OTA unit economics will improve as there is less competition for variable marketing spend (lower customer acquisition costs) and rising traffic conversion rates due to fewer consumer choices. Finally, there is healthy secular growth which will minimize the need for OTAs to battle for market share as a means of improving earnings.Article by Luis V.

4004682,96696,2016-09-07T14:02:09-04:00,"Expedia is departing from its strategy in the tussle over direct-booking with big hotel chains like Marriott.Expedia will be providing technology support to Marriott and help it in selling hotel rooms on Marriott’s platform.This move shows the growing clout of big hotel chains due to consolidation in the lodging industry, but it also points towards the technology advantage of OTAs.Investors would need to reevaluate the valuations for hotel chains, hotel REITs and OTAs like Expedia and Priceline if this trend gains momentum.","Expedia Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE) has signed a deal to provide technology support to Vacations by Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) on their own platform. Expedia has replaced Switchfly as the technology provider from September 1. This agreement is a significant shift in Expedia's stance in its battle against the direct-booking efforts of major chains like Marriott, Hilton (NYSE:HLT) and IHG (NYSE:IHG). Although, the partnership seems a bit untenable, given the fact that Expedia will end up aiding Marriott's efforts to increase direct booking, it also shows the rapid pace of change with the lodging industry.For the past few quarters, major hotel chains have been increasingly voicing their opposition to high commissions charged by online travel agents (OTAs) like Expedia and Priceline (PCLN) for bookings made on their platform. These commissions can easily go over 15% and have become increasingly onerous as this distribution channel becomes more prominent.Hilton and Marriott launched major rewards program for members which allows customers to book rooms on company site at a lower price than OTAs. In response to this both Expedia and Priceline lowered the search position for brands providing lower rates to members. However, the biggest factor in favor of hotel chains is the consolidation happening within the hotel industry.Besides smaller acquisitions like IHG acquiring Kimpton, Accor acquiring Fairmont, HNA Tourism Group acquiring Carlson Hotels there has been mega-acquisition of Starwood by Marriott. This will create a hotel behemoth having over 1.1 million rooms (after China gives approval) giving the hotel chain tremendous negotiating power against OTAs.Marriot-Starwood combination would corner over one-third of the total corporate spend in several big cities including New York, Houston, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Shanghai and San Francisco.Fig: Market share cornered by Marriott-Starwood within corporate travel. Source: CWT solutions groupThe higher market share might explain the current partnership between Expedia and Marriott. Expedia seems to be following the saying, ""If you can't beat them, join them"". The current partnership allows customers to book on Marriot's site where Expedia is providing the technology support. Although the layout of search results is similar to Expedia's platform, there is no explicit Expedia branding on the results.Fig: Layout of the page on Vacations by Marriott. Technology provided by Expedia without branding.Benefit for MarriottThere is a clear benefit for Marriott within the current deal as it can use the technological expertise of Expedia while having the customers booking on its own platform. This should certainly translate to a much better agreement in terms of commission rate. It would not be unthinkable that the commission through this distribution channel is a mere fraction of what it has to pay on Expedia's or Priceline's platform.This is also better than the earlier deal between Expedia and Red Lion Hotels where Expedia could offer member-only rates on its own platform and also enroll non-members in Red Lion's Hello Rewards program.The real icing on the cake is that there is no Expedia branding on the page which should translate to better customer loyalty on this platform. This agreement also displays the enormous negotiating power which Marriott has due to its size. Going forward we should expect to see similar deals giving Marriott an edge over technology providers.Benefit for ExpediaIf there was no benefit for Expedia, the management would not have gone ahead with the deal. As of now, there is no long-term fixed agreement on this partnership. The partnership helps the company become a provider of technology instead of acting as a mere distribution channel. It will help Expedia in collecting more information and data about travelers. This can be used to provide other services to customers like information about events, flight bookings, tours and activities.It will cover only U.S point of sale and will also not affect hotel commissions Marriott pays on Expedia's platform.Effect on ValuationThis agreement shows a major change in the distribution channels for hotels. We should continue to see greater negotiating power for big hotel chains. As they face the challenge posed by Airbnb, this leverage would be a major tailwind for them. Top chains including Marriott, Hilton, IHG, Choice Hotels and Hyatt will try to increase the share of direct booking in their distribution channel mix. We might also see one or two major mergers in this industry as higher market share translates to better deals with OTAs and better pricing power.OTAs like Expedia and Priceline face headwinds due to consolidation of hotel industry. This will put a downward pressure on commissions charged by them. Although they have created a duopoly in most of the markets, tech majors like Facebook are also trying to get a piece of the travel market.These factors and the growth of Airbnb would prevent OTAs from showing growth similar to 2009-2014 period when EXPE stock increased by 1100% and PCLN stock increased by 1700% compared to 140% by S&P.Investor TakeawayMarriott has entered into a partnership with Expedia to provide technology on Marriott's platform. Earlier, Expedia was staunchly against hotel chains offering better deals through direct booking. This reversal in strategy of supporting the direct booking efforts by a hotel chain shows the shifting of negotiating power into the hands of bigger hotel chains.As Starwood acquisition gets necessary approval from Chinese authorities, Marriott will have greater pricing power in big markets. Marriott's stock is trading at 19x forward PE compared to 22.5x for Hilton and 35x for Hyatt. A greater scale than other rivals should help Marriott get better deals providing better margins for the company and give upward momentum to the stock.Expedia and Priceline would need to adjust their strategy due to rapid changes in the lodging industry which is their biggest revenue source. Both the stocks have to face big headwinds and investors should follow wait-and-watch approach for these two stocks as future market share and strategies for different players become clearer."
4011507,61281,2016-10-11T14:31:29-04:00,"Expedia’s Trivago is expected to go public by the end of Q1 2017.Valuation reflects an exciting opportunity in current IPO market.Expected overall OTA market growth, high growth rates, and positive operating profit strengthen the bull case.I’m bullish on the Trivago IPO.","The OTA giant Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) progresses towards taking its majority-owned German subsidiary, Trivago, public and is starting to arrange the logistics for an expected IPO. This year was weak for IPOs; only 81 companies have gone public so far, compared with 144 companies in the same period last year, and at the current run-rate, 2016 will have the least IPOs since 2009, which is a clear sign of the uncertainty in the markets. However, while the markets are volatile and fragile this year, and the IPO market is impacted, a few successful high-profile IPOs like Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), Line (NYSE:LN), and Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) show that the market still has a healthy appetite for IPOs - it's just very picky.The Trivago IPO is raised at this time due to the put/call windows that Trivago and Expedia included in the 2013 deal when Expedia acquired 63% of Trivago. The two companies agreed to include a put/call rights that may cause Trivago owners to sell 50% or 100% of their remaining shares to at fair value Expedia, or Expedia may cause Trivago owners to sell to it these portions of the remaining stocks. The first window closure was postponed until March 31, 2017, after Expedia's and Trivago's founders agreed not to exercise the put/call rights during the first half 2016 window. The parties agreed to postpone the put/call window so that they could explore the feasibility of an IPO; however in the case that the parties abandoned the IPO plans, they could reopen the window later.Expedia CEO Khosrowshahi mentioned the potential IPO at the Q2 2016 earnings call saying: ""Neither Expedia nor the Trivago founders exercised their option under the open put/call window this year nor we have instead agreed to explore the feasibility of an IPO of Trivago shares with the preliminary and ambitious goal of completing the IPO before year end. An IPO would allow investors to value Trivago as a separate standalone company. Note that this is an IPO and not a spinoff. Expedia does not plan to sell any of our shares in an IPO and there are no guarantees that an IPO will ultimately be pursued or be successful.""Last month, Trivago advanced one more step toward an IPO when the company reportedly picked advisors and book runners for the potential offering. Now, it's a matter of time until the company files its S-1 and starts the roadshow. The rationale behind the current timing of the IPO, besides the put/call window, is to take advantage of the appetite for high-profile IPOs, which was mentioned above. With Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP) and Pinterest (PINIT) also marching toward the same goal and concerns of a potential correction still hovering above capital markets, Trivago needed to accelerate the process so it would not be left behind in the race.As we are getting closer to the IPO, this is the time to get a rough understanding of the possible valuation and whether this offering is even worth considering.The OTA MarketThe online travel market contains dozens of different brand sites and apps, but it is mainly controlled by Priceline (PCLN), Expedia and Airbnb when the first two own most of the known brands. Both companies strengthen their dominance through acquisitions when the two market leaders recently acquired leading brands like HomeAway, OpenTable, Kayak, Orbitz, Travelocity, and more.The total market size is expected to grow by 44%, from $564B in 2016 to $817B in 2020 as presented in the chart below. This growth trend is supported by the shift from traditional service to online service also reflected in rapid growth expected in the e-commerce and e-payments marketsWith a strong list of brands, Expedia is expected to maintain its dominant position in the market together with Priceline and Airbnb, with Trivago being one of Expedia's strongest brands. Expedia's broad network of travel aggregators of hotels, flights, cruises, car rentals, and other travel aspects Trivago can greatly benefit from the industry's growth through its ties with Expedia and the intercompany revenues the network provides.Trivago's BusinessTrivago is a German-based travel metasearch company that aggregates travel search results from different sources across the web and features price comparisons for hotels, worldwide. Every referral to an online travel service provider is worth money to Trivago, and this is its primary revenue stream. Since the beginning of the year, Trivago has generated $377M from third-party customers, as well as from other Expedia-owned brands. As is common in the travel industry, Trivago experiences a steep decline in vacation bookings in the fourth quarter of every year as summer, spring and holidays vacations are generally booked during the first three-quarters of each year.Taking into account revenue seasonality and historical YoY and QoQ trends, Trivago is expected to grow its top-line figures by 44% YoY from $548M, in 2015, to $788M, in 2016E, which maintains Trivago's portion within Expedia of only 9% of the total revenue for the year.As presented in the chart below, Trivago has had a constant increase in its annual revenue at an impressive rate of 54% on 4-years CAGR and a quarterly growth rate of 19%. Looking at the intra-year revenue fluctuations, seasonality is highlighted in the sharp drop every fourth quarter. However, every Q4 is still higher YoY.Regarding profitability, Trivago is in a different path than the rest of the high-profile IPOs that took place or expected to take place this year. Trivago has a small operating profit that reflects a modest 2% operating margin and a 3% adj. EBITDA margin. Unlike many other recent IPOs that struggle to break even, Trivago passed that point, and it is now struggling to expand its profits and margins. As the Trivago financial data is somewhat limited at this point, I have no visibility into the bottom line or gross margin figures that could shed additional light onto the company's financials.These days, Trivago is partnering with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on its dynamic travel ads. The ads on Facebook and Instagram are expected to bring additional significant bookings volume in the following years. The Facebook partnership is mutually productive, according to CEO Khosrowshahi, and the spend there is now achieving real significance. This partnership might turn out to be a great growth driver for Trivago or a real burden like the Square (NYSE:SQ) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) deal. Only time will tell, and currently, there is not enough publicly available information to assess that partnership and its impact on future performance.Trivago ValuationIn 2013, Expedia acquired 63% of Trivago's shares for $632M in cash and stocks, which include a control premium and a put/call rights exercise window for the remaining 37% in the mechanism that was described above. The first window was postponed to end in March 2017, and the second window opens in 2018 in depending on the IPO developments.Four different methods are used to valuate Trivago when a subjectively weighted average is used to compute for the preliminary valuation.Method #1: an industry average P/S multiple using the data table below.Method #2: Redeemable minority interest fair value.Method #3: Portion of Expedia's market cap according to Trivago's revenues percentage of total Expedia revenues.Method #4: Average P/S of Expedia previous deals as presented in the table below.After consolidating the final valuation of each method into a summary table, I assign weights according to the relevance of the method to the IPO valuation: 40% to method #2, 30% to method #1, 20% to method #3, and 10% to method #4. The final result is a $2.5B valuation as shown in the chart below and reflects a P/S ratio of 3.85 to Trivago, which is the lower range of the major OTA players.Considering the spectacular performance of the previous high-profile IPOs this year, Trivago could expand its P/S ratio by almost 2x and still experience healthy demand. The conservative approach implying that Trivago will not try to raise money at a 7 P/S ratio but only at a 6 P/S ratio, which reflects a $4B valuation, renders the company more attractive than Twilio during IPO and than the current valuations of Twilio, Nutanix, and Line post-IPO.SummaryExpedia's German-based majority-owned subsidiary Trivago is expected to go public by the end of Q1 2017 as part of the 2013 acquisition agreement. In the IPO, Trivago founders are supposed to sell some of the non-controlling minority shares, while Expedia does not sell any shares and remains the biggest shareholder, with 63% ownership. Trivago's valuation ranges between $2.5B and $4B, which reflects attractive revenues ranging between 3.85 and 6, which will probably attract a healthy demand that could increase the valuation even further.Unlike many other unicorns or high-profile companies going public, Trivago doesn't have only significant growth potential and impressive growth rate but it also a positive operating profit that involves different kind of challenges around maintaining that status and expanding the profit.With the attractive valuation, alongside with the existing profitability, impressive growth, and promising future, the Trivago IPO currently looks like an interesting investment opportunity. I initiate a bullish outlook for Trivago's IPO, with a specific price target to be determined once the official offering documents are be filed with the SEC."
3992126,102061,2016-07-27T13:49:36-04:00,"Expedia is an industry leader in online travel booking now offered at a great price with impressive recent acquisitions and a growing industry.The market has been hesitant on the travel industry due to recent global events, but the long-term outlook for the industry looks promising.The one-year price estimate is $135.87, which is a 15.9% increase of the current price.","As those following Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE) should know, the company spent a lot of cash in 2015 on some big time acquisitions. Those included Orbitz, Travelocity and HomeAway. The three major acquisitions ended costing Expedia a little under $6B. The company is still in the process of fully integrating these companies into the Expedia business model, but the potential synergies at hand could be very beneficial to Expedia on a long-term horizon. These additions are expected to lead to large growth in revenue which will allow Expedia to invest more in capital expenditures as well as dividends and stock repurchase programs. As global uncertainty looms, online travel booking continues to increase (see graphic below) and it appears this trend will continue into the future. Expedia also is showing solid fundamental metrics.The previously mentioned three factors help Expedia's outlook look quite promising. The HomeAway transaction appears to have the most potential as Expedia gained the world's most popular vacation site, which includes the well-known VRBO. HomeAway had close to $15 billion in bookings just last year alone and the vacation rental market allows Expedia to tap itself further into yet another travel based market.Courtesy of BloombergThe metrics for Expedia are quite promising. The company currently boasts a trailing twelve month P/E ratio of 27.28 which is just below the industry average of 27.6. Expedia also has seen a 10-year average of revenue growth of 14.79% and that percentage is expected to increase in the future. Earnings over the next five years are projected to grow 20.10% annually.The integration of the company's recent acquisitions will play a pivotal role in this revenue growth forecast, but I'm confident Expedia will be able to smoothly recognize the synergies that made these recent deals worth the time and most importantly, worth the money. Expedia also has done quite well in outperforming the market over the past five years (see graphic below) and indications point toward this trend continuing. Expedia also is the only online travel payer to pay a dividend which is currently at 0.82%.Courtesy of: Company 10-KSo what exactly is driving this revenue growth for Expedia? Current global situations may be having a questionable impact on travel in the short term, but overall the long-term model for travel growth looks the same as I mentioned earlier. I'm sure you were all waiting on it to be mentioned, but what about Brexit? Expedia surprisingly does not have a large amount of exposure in Europe, especially when compared to competitors Priceline (NASDAQ: PCLN) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP). As of late 2015, Priceline received 88% of its revenues from overseas markets compared to just 43% for Expedia. Expedia also benefits from the continued increase in online consumer spending as the trend of booking trips online continues to increase.The core business of Expedia grew by 33% in 1Q16 in terms of Gross Bookings. Gross Bookings overall for Expedia have seen at least a double-digit percentage increase in each of the last four years. 58% of Expedia's sales come from hotel bookings and Expedia is doing a great job at marketing both of those brands - Expedia and Hotels.com. The company has benefited quite nicely from the Hotels.com loyalty program which allows customers to get a free hotel room after every ten hotel rooms booked. After taking a look at the operating metrics of Expedia, it is pointed out that the average hotel stay has increased in each of the last three years. This continued increase could lead to more revenue growth for Expedia in the hotel sector.Due to the overall growth potential for the online travel industry, the market is seen as very opportunistic. Expedia and Priceline are viewed as industry leaders, but there are other existing organizations with recognizable market share along with disruptors in the market. Industry leaders are consistently making moves whether it is making an acquisition, striking an important partnership, or just continuing to be more innovative than competitors. Although Expedia made some big moves in 2015, they must continue to stay a step ahead of others in the industry. The recent moves from Expedia make me strongly believe they will continue to be active enough in the future to remain to do just that.Today, we are seeing more hotels and airlines use their own websites to steer customers away from online travel sites. This could be why we see Expedia spending such a large increased amount on advertising. This move is to undoubtedly capture market share in the industry and also battle the hotels and airlines previously mentioned. One thing Expedia and others in the industry will continue to be able to offer is the diversification of booking options available. This is why I believe Expedia and the online travel agency industry as a whole will continue to be a major player in the travel industry for years to come.Airbnb (AIRB) is a disruptor in this industry that has seen a great deal of growth in the past couple years. It is seen by many that Expedia's acquisition of HomeAway is going to be a way for Expedia to fight Airbnb in the vacation market. Expedia is expected to heavily ramp up marketing for HomeAway in the next three years which should benefit the company quite well. Airbnb can definitely be seen as a long-term threat to Expedia and others in the industry, but the overall reputation and legal backing Expedia has will not allow Airbnb to take away a large portion of market share for the foreseeable future.So how about the dividends I mentioned earlier? As previously stated, Expedia is the only major competitor in the industry that pays a dividend. Expedia's dividend yield is well below the S&P average of 2.1%, but it is a nice benefit for those deciding to hold the equity for the long term. The company has a strong payout ratio of 20.89%. This information, along with consistent dividend increases, leads me to believe Expedia is still able to hold strong cash flow while paying out these dividends. It does not appear that the dividend program for Expedia is hurting the company in terms of maintaining a healthy positive cash flow.Another impressive metric for Expedia is that the company has managed to cut its cost of sales as a percent of revenue in each of the last four years (see graphic below). My research indicates Expedia will continue this trend in the future as the company continues to exploit the cost benefits of running an e-commerce business. 1Q16 results for Expedia back this belief as the company lowered its cost of revenue percentage from 1Q15 by roughly 2%.Graphic created by authorIn summary, the revenue growth potential along with the strong overall metrics for Expedia make the company an appealing equity for a current investment. According to CNN Money, the average one-year target estimate for Expedia is $135.50 (see chart below). The integration of recent acquisitions will allow Expedia to recognize synergies and continue to pull itself away from the company's main competitors. There are some potential risks and challenges involved with Expedia, but it is important to recognize the volatility of the risks at hand. Expedia has done a great job in the past in terms of dealing with challenges in the industry and there is no strong information that leads me to believe that this trend will falter anytime soon. The travel industry continues to grow and booking a trip is going to continue to be part of the process for travelers. I believe those travelers will continue to go with the industry leader Expedia and that is why I think Expedia has a great future ahead.Courtesy of: CNN Money"

(NASDAQ:EXPE) with its cross-over Ba1 rating. Our fundamental analysis highlights a much safer credit profile for EXPE, whose strong cash flows cover all their obligations including debt maturities through 2022. Moreover, their sizable expected cash build would allow them to service all obligations including debt maturities if their cash flows ever fall short. We therefore rate EXPE six notches higher at an IG3+ credit rating, or an A1 equivalent using Moody's ratings scale. Cash bond markets are also overstating credit risk with a cash bond YTW of 4.342% relative to an Intrinsic YTW of 3.092%, while CDS markets are accurately stating EXPE's credit risk with a CDS of 100bps relative to an Intrinsic CDS of 124bps.Cash Flow ProfileWe produce a Credit Cash Flow Prime™ chart for Expedia, Inc., as we do for every company we evaluate. The chart provides a far more comprehensive view of credit fundamentals than traditional ratio-based analyses. It shows the cash flow generation and cash obligations related to the credit of the firm, adjusted for non-cash financial statement reporting distortions from GAAP. The blue line indicates the gross cash earnings (Valens' scrubbed cash flow number) expected to be generated based on consensus analyst estimates and Valens Credit's own in-house research team. The blue dots above that line include the cash available at that time while the blue triangles indicate that same amount plus any existing, available lines of credit.The colored, stacked bars show the cash obligations of the firm in each year forecast. The most difficult obligations to avoid are at the bottom of each stack, such as interest expense. The obligations with more flexibility to defer year to year, such as pension contributions and maintenance capital expenditures, are at the top of the stacked bars. All of the calculations are adjusted for non-cash distortions that are inherent in GAAP accounting, including the highly problematic and often misused statement of cash flows.If the company generates and has cash levels that are above their obligations, the risk of default is extremely low. Even if the cash generated yearly is close to the levels of the stacked bars, a company generally has the flexibility to defer payments of various kinds. For example, they can allow assets to age a little longer, or they can cut certain maintenance costs such as maintenance capex. While decisions such as those can create other business concerns, the issue in credit risk is simply this: Does the company have enough cash to service their credit obligations?EXPE's cash flows would exceed all obligations including debt maturities through 2022. Additionally, if the firm were to experience a drop in cash earnings, their excellent liquidity profile indicates that they would have no issues servicing their debt obligations. Moreover, EXPE's strong asset backing drives a robust 123% recovery rate on unsecured debt. Overall, their robust recovery rate, sizable market capitalization, strong Adjusted ROA profile, and substantial cash generation would likely allow them access to credit markets to facilitate debt refinancing if necessary.Management IncentivesLike most people, senior executives and board members do what they are paid to do. This is why EXPE's Form DEF 14A is key to understanding this company's fundamentals, something that credit agencies seem to be missing. Our Incentives Dictate Behavior™ analysis focuses on AGN's senior executive compensation and governance. This analysis is meant to help investors understand corporate governance, how aligned a management team may be with shareholder interests, and the potential consequences of a management compensation framework to the business.EXPE management's short-term compensation is based on stock price performance and worldwide hotel bookings, while their long-term compensation is based on adjusted EBITDA.The adjusted EBITDA, stock price performance and worldwide hotel bookings growth metrics should drive management to grow the business, without necessarily focusing on controlling capex or leverage. As a result, they may be incentivized to overspend on capex (lowering cash available for servicing other obligations) and increase leverage, which could lead to an ROA' compression even as the management team successfully executes on driving growth. In addition, stock price performance is not a favorable short-term compensation metric. Management's decision-making, under such incentives, may not lead to long-term value accretive actions. Moreover, since management's framework is overly growth focused, margin compression as well as weakened asset utilization may occur. This would likely lead to weaker cash flows for servicing obligations and debt maturities, a net negative for debt holders.Management RepresentationsWe provide analyses of companies' statements on earnings calls, termed Earnings Call Forensics™. This analysis is meant to help assess a management team's confidence in their conference calls when discussing certain areas of the business such as operations, stability, strategies, their ability to manage business risks, and especially, their liquidity and solvency.In the case of EXPE, the analysis of their Q1 2016 earnings call highlighted consistent highly questionable markers from management. Management may be downplaying concerns about the sustainability of unit growth momentum across their offerings and about margin pressures from discounting. They may also be exaggerating the potential of their strategic partnerships and the progress of their integration of acquisitions such as Orbitz and HomeAway.ConclusionUltimately, a company's credit risk (or lack thereof) is driven by cash available against cash obligations. EXPE's credit risk is being materially overstated by Moody's and overstated cash bond markets. Given EXPE's strong cash profile, robust Adjusted ROA, and sizable market capitalization, ratings are expected to improve while cash bond market spreads are expected to tighten once the company's fundamentals are recognized.Our Chief Investment Strategist, Joel Litman, chairs the Valens Equities and Credit Research Committees, which are responsible for this article along with the lead analyst, Cheska Pablico.

4011245,76975,2016-10-10T14:03:49-04:00,"According to media reports, Expedia is reportedly looking to make an IPO for Trivago, one of its subsidiaries.Investors have begun drawing parallels between the IPO and the TripAdvisor spinoff in 2011.Does the Trivago IPO have the potential to reward investors as richly as the TripAdvisor spinoff?","According to a report by Reuters, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) has already set in motion the process for an initial public offering for Trivago, its popular hotel metasearch/media business. The IPO, which according to a source, could be valued at more than $1 billion, is set to take place in late 2016 or early 2017. Expedia paid 477 million euros ($531 million) in 2012 for a 62% stake in Trivago, with the rest of the company remaining in the hands of its three German founders. Expedia has insisted that this is not a spinoff since it does not plan to sell its shares during the floatation. Investors will, however, still get a chance to own part of the 38% stake by the founders since they are reportedly seeking to sell out through the IPO.Although Expedia is unwilling to let go its majority stake, investors are naturally drawing parallels between the Trivago IPO and the TripAdvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP) spinoff in 2011. The TripAdvisor spinoff was simply sensational, with the spun-off unit sporting a market cap 40% bigger than the parent company just 20 months after the event.Does Trivago have the potential to reward shareholders as richly as TripAdvisor?Trivago valuationTrivago operates quite differently from your average OTA (online travel agency), with its revenue model being remarkably similar to TripAdvisor's at the time of its spinoff. The company acts as an independent information resource for travelers where people visit to compare hotel prices. The platform aggregates hotel content from a variety of sources and then displays the results to users. Trivago compares rates from more than a million hotels on more than 250 booking sites. Once people make a decision to book a certain property, they navigate to traditional OTAs such as Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia where they can do their booking. Trivago makes money through a cost-per-click model when users on its platform click on ads displayed on the platform.Trivago's revenue model is remarkably similar to how TripAdvisor has traditionally operated, the key difference being that TripAdvisor users can now book directly from its platform using the Instant Booking feature. More than half of TripAdvisor's revenue comes from directing traffic to the two giant OTAs.Looking at the respective business models of TripAdvisor and Trivago, we can easily surmise that the actual valuation of Trivago could be significantly higher than the $1 billion being thrown around. For starters, Trivago generated revenue of $200 million during the second quarter (~10% of Expedia revenue), after growing 48% Y/Y. The business is expected to finish the year with revenue of ~$770 million, or about 20% higher than TripAdvisor's revenue during the time of the spinoff. Trivago remains a growth machine, with its core European market growing at a 33% clip during the last quarter while the rest of the world grew 69%. At the time of the spinoff, TripAdvisor was valued at $4 billion, with Expedia investors receiving one Expedia share and one TripAdvisor share for every two Expedia shares.Expedia says that Trivago is solidly profitable, though the company has never divulged actual profit details. One thing is clear, though: that Trivago might not be anywhere nearly as profitable as TripAdvisor was in 2011, mainly due to heavy marketing spends. The company has been expanding into international markets aggressively and spends heavily on TV advertising to create brand awareness in new markets. While Trivago still operates as an independent unit, TripAdvisor's close ties to Expedia allows it to spend relatively less money on marketing expenses.Trivago's heavy spending on S&M activity quite naturally depresses margins quite a bit. Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos estimates that Trivago finished last quarter with a 25% contribution margin in its Europe market and 10% across other geographies outside Europe. Assuming half of Trivago's revenue comes from its core European market with the rest coming from other parts of the world, then the business sports a contribution margin of ~17.5%. The profit margin is bound to be lower than that. TripAdvisor had a 30% profit margin during the time of spinoff and an EBITDA margin of ~40%. A $4 billion valuation implies the company was valued at ~15.6 x EBITDA. Assuming Trivago sports an EBITDA margin of just 10% and applying a 15.6x EBITDA valuation would put Trivago's value at ~$1.2 billion.There's a good possibility that I have underestimated Trivago's EBITDA margin, which implies that the company's valuation could turn out to be significantly higher than that.Why Expedia is not sellingIt's not very hard to see why Expedia is unwilling to sell its 62% Trivago stake - and it has a lot to do with post-spinoff remorse from TripAdvisor. By spinning off TripAdvisor, Expedia lost a high-margin and high-growth media business forcing the company to rely more heavily on a single, transactional revenue stream. Expedia has continued to rely heavily on TripAdvisor as one of its largest marketing channels, but it's more of a love-hate relationship than the purely symbiotic one it has been in the past.And that's not a very good thing, especially now that TripAdvisor's Instant Booking competes directly with traditional OTAs like Expedia and Priceline. Using Instant Booking, people can book properties directly on the TripAdvisor platform without having to navigate to OTA websites. This definitely means loss of valuable traffic and business for the companies. Trivago can conceivably borrow a leaf from TripAdvisor and start monetizing its vast traffic by allowing people to book on its platform directly. You can be sure Expedia doesn't want to be blindsided by events this time around.And now the big question: Does Trivago have the potential to reward shareholders a la TripAdvisor? Although TripAdvisor has lately hit a wall leading to the TRIP stock losing 25% YTD, investors who bought at the IPO are still sitting on a healthy return of 154%. Notably, the market has rewarded TripAdvisor with a richer valuation since the IPO, with the current 26.9x EBITDA TTM almost double the reading at the time of the spinoff. Trivago's revenue model is quite similar to TripAdvisor's, and the business has continued growing briskly despite global economic headwinds and persistent terror attacks. Investors will quite likely be willing to bet on the company's long-term growth prospects. Don't be surprised if the Trivago IPO enjoys a fairy tale run a la TripAdvisor."
3985591,44781,2016-06-30T15:50:26-04:00,"On Monday during the Brexit sell-off I decided to initiate a position in EXPE.This is a revolutionary company in the online travel space with a dominant brand portfolio, aggressive management, and a young, but growing dividend.This investment may not be right for many of my fellow DGI brethren; however, for those looking for growth, this company offers it at a reasonable price.","I have to admit, that Friday's Brexit sell-off wasn't as bad as I feared it may have been. Monday's was sharp as expected and I put capital to work throughout the day. However, the rebound we've seen over the past two trading sessions surprises me; I expected a longer term draw down in share prices as fear of European recession looms. Selfishly, I was hoping for more declines due to the overweight cash position that I'm currently sitting on. I have a long shopping list of companies that I'd like to own, but many still seem to be over valued. I thought the potential contagion effect of this Brexit vote might have sparked fears within the big institutional buyers (whose aims are typically more short sighted than my own), meaning that the markets could experience further downside momentum for some time while the big boys wait for the dust to settle on the other side of the Atlantic. However, the overall sentiment towards the decision seems to be that the U.K. has made a mistake and that other countries are likely to see this and not follow suit. This, more than anything, I think, is why we've had such a sharp rebound mid-week. Will this continue? I don't know. What I do know is that much of the market still appears to be over valued and I am happy to sit on my hands until we get a larger pull back before putting more cash to work.But, all of this aside, as a little guy in the markets all I can do is stick to my own plan: buying very high quality companies when they're trading at attractive valuations with a mind to hold for the long-term. Amongst all of the volatility we've been experiencing and the constant banter from talking heads on media outlets and politicians vying for power, it's important to remember this and not get caught up in the noise. So, over the weekend and moving forward throughout this week I've been doing work on a few companies that seem to get getting cheap. I bought shares of one of this companies on Monday: Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) at $98.46, which will be the focus on this article.Before getting into the analysis, I will say that unfortunately for investors reading this now, the price of EXPE shares has popped rather significantly since Monday's close and they're now trading at $104. I don't like the value that EXPE offers quite as much at these levels as I did sub $100; however, I wouldn't be surprised if there were more attractive opportunities to buy on the horizon…and, for someone holding for the long-term and not quite so caught up as I am on totally maximizing returns, a few dollars per share might not be all that significant anyway if this company continues its strong growth.When choosing companies to own, I like putting my money behind those with strong brand names, defensible moats, and reliable income and/or growth looking forward. In my mind, EXPE meets these standards; excelling in the first two. Expedia, through its willingness to be aggressive in M&A in pursuit of dominance within its space, has amassed an impressive collection of brand names. You've probably heard of a few of these, and maybe didn't even know they were all situated under one corporate umbrella.Source: Expedia IROne brand in particular that I would like to highlight is HomeAway. This acquisition by EXPE management really sets this company apart from some of the other online travel operators. Why, you ask? Well, I am a regular user of, and a huge fan of, AirBnb. I host guests in my home just about every weekend and when my wife and I travel it is our go to site for booking a quick night's stay. Now, HomeAway isn't AirBnb, but it is a similar operation and essentially the best alternative option that I can invest behind since AirBnb is not (yet…I can dream, can't I?) public. I think this Uberfication of utilizing spare rooms/empty homes is the way of the future. It's cheaper, easier, and feels more like home when traveling…not to mention, it pays for a hefty portion of my mortgage every month. I compliment EXPE for its foresight in this regard and I expect that HomeAway will be another accretive acquisition for the company, helping to push revenues higher for years to come.But, moving away from my personal infatuation of the monetization of our spare room, EXPE shines in other areas as well. As far as defensible moats go, this company has emerged from the disruption of the personal travel industry victorious and due to its aggressive stance with M&A, I don't foresee any reason why they shouldn't continue to thrive. Honestly, as a member of the millennial generation, I simply can't believe that there was a time when individuals would have to go meet with a travel agent to make complicated vacation plans. Nowadays, booking trips is a cinch; you can do everything, from figuring out where to go, how to get there, where to stay, what to do, and how to get back home, all in one place with relatively few clicks of the mouse (or touch screen for those who are even more technologically advanced than me). EXPE offers one stop shopping for all of this, all the while, giving individuals the option to compare prices and ensure that they're receiving the best deal possible. Expedia's Mission Statement goes as such: To revolutionize travel through the power of technology. Revolutionize, indeed. I think they're succeeded and will continue to reap the benefits of their incredible foresight for years to come.Now, I'm sure that there are people out there today who still use travel agents. Sure, this is probably a stress free way to do things, though I like having the ability to make decisions on the fly the feeling that I'm in control of my destiny (and the value that I receive). Regardless, I think it's all but certain that after booking your trip for you, when those travel agent ladies and gentlemen go home at night it's likely hard for them to have a peaceful night's sleep knowing that their jobs are very insecure due to market disruption by tech companies like EXPE. When I think about jobs that will eventually go the way of the do-do because of tech disruption, travel agents sit near the top of the list. But, just because agents are on the way out doesn't mean that travel is slowing down. On the contrary, it is picking up. It is becoming clear that we are seeing a generation shift when it comes to how younger individuals spend their disposable income. Rather than focusing on gathering material goods, they're more interested in amassing experience. Travel is the epitome of their desires and I believe this is an investable trend worthy of getting behind.So, now all opinionated bullishness aside, let's take a look at the numbers. As I said in this recent piece here on SA, my purchase of EXPE shares on Monday wasn't an income play, although the company does pay a small dividend (I will speak more about this in a bit), but rather, one focused on growth. EXPE has put together wonderful performances in recent years regarding its top line growth with revenues up 16.9% in 2012, 18.4% in 2013, 20.8% in 2014, and 15.8% in 2015. Now, I don't expect numbers as strong as these to last forever, though I do expect that EXPE will continue to grow revenues in the double digits over the short/medium term, which helps to justify the company's ttm P/E ratio of 28x. I know many readers are going to think that's a steep price to pay, but due to the strong growth expectations that analysts have for this company, forward P/E ratios over the next couple of years are looking much better with 2016 EPS estimates averaging in at $5.12, or a 20x forward multiple, and 2017 estimates averaging in at $6.68, or a 15x multiple. Obviously no one has a crystal ball, but these numbers are the averages of the opinions of 27 and 28 independent professionals respectively; in the end you have to make decisions for yourself, though to me, those averages carry significant weight.Although the company's quarterly dividend is small (0.97% yield), it has more than tripled since 2010. EXPE's EPS is a little shaky, not heading upwards in the staircase formation you might see with a more typical dividend growth stock; however, the overall trajectory is headed in the right direction and I expect for this to continue. Like EPS, free cash flow/share jumps around as well, up one year, down the next. In 2015 it was down y/y, though capital spending was up on the year, primarily due to the $3.9b HomeAway acquisition.But, when looking at a relatively young company/industry like this, it's just as important to track user growth and interaction metrics as it is typical financial metrics like EPS and revenue growth. These user numbers translate not only to revenues, but higher margins as well with the companies being able to increase pricing power as they scale. EXPE highlighted their performance in a couple of these areas with this image, front and center on their investor relations page concerning the most recent quarterly report.Source: Expedia IRAs you can see here, the company's growth wasn't limited to revenue, gross bookings, or room nights. The company's adjusted EBITDA was up 31%, more than 13,000 properties were added to its portfolio, now totaling over 282,000, and management spent $312m repurchasing 2.9m shares, leaving approximately 9.6m shares left on the current buyback authorization. In 2015 the company slightly reduced the outstanding share count and as a long-term investor, I'm hoping to see them follow suit in 2016 as wellManagement gave a positive outlook during the Q1 call, estimating that the second half of 2016 will be strong. In Q1, only 35% of bookings were international, leading me to believe that recent Brexit issues and what's like to be stronger dollar moving over the short term at least, won't effect this company to the same extent of many of the other high growth tech names who do a much higher percentage of their business overseas.I'll admit that it wasn't a perfect picture painted in Q1. While revenues from the hotel segment were up 25% alongside the aforementioned 37% increase in room nights, one of the primary stats that I look at when analyzing hotel related stocks is revenue per room night (organic growth) which was down 9%. Management said this decrease was due to ""margin reductions aimed at expanding the size and availability of the global hotel supply portfolio, increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs, as well as a net unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact.""The company's cost of revenue, technological costs, and costs of selling and marketing costs were both up significantly on the year, leading to an overall operational loss on the quarter. Now, this obviously isn't what any investor wants to hear, especially one who's typically focused on sustainable cash flows and EPS growth that support a sustainably growing dividend; however, right now the focus is obviously on expanding the brand and property portfolios, staying ahead of the competition and solidifying overall brand prominence. Like I said before, I expect that the earnings faucet can be turned higher when management decides to transition out of the growth phase, but I don't see a reason to do so while we're still in the early stages of the digital booking transition and there is still market share to be taken. The company's operating cash flow was up slightly y/y in 2014 and 2015 and nearly halfway through the fiscal year, ttm cash flows are outpacing 2015 totals as well.Although revenue per room night was down, revenue per airline ticket sold was up 1%. Air revenues overall were up 54% on the quarter boosted by a 52% increase in airline tickets sold.And finally, ending on another high note, advertising and media revenues increased by 44%. I expect this segment to continue to post strong results as the company expands its brand portfolio and subsequently its property portfolio. Advertisers realize that EXPE is a dominant player in the online travel booking space allowing them to demand premium dollars for ads on their platforms.EXPE Q1 Earnings ReportSource: F.A.S.T.

3964423,68695,2016-04-11T11:06:06-04:00,"Using Adjusted Earnings, Expedia’s Adjusted Return on Assets was 17% in 2015 – significantly higher than the traditional 2% ROA most financial databases report.This difference is primarily caused by EXPE’s $10.8bn goodwill, which leads to a significant distortion of the firm’s economic reality under GAAP.Also of note is the difference between the firm’s Forward Adjusted Value-to-Earnings ratio of 14.6x versus a traditional forward P/E of 20.5x.","Performance and Valuation Prime ChartThe PVP chart above reflects the real, economic performance and valuation measures of Expedia, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) after making many major adjustments to the as-reported financials. The four panels explain the company's corporate performance and valuation levels over the past 10 years plus best estimates for forecast years based on quarterly financials and consensus estimates.The apostrophe after ROA', Asset', V/A', and V/E' is the symbol for ""prime"" which means ""adjusted."" These calculations have been modified with comprehensive adjustments to remove as-reported earnings, asset, liability, and cash flow statement inconsistencies and distortions. To better understand the PVP chart and the following discussion, please refer to our guide here.The problem with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is that they create inconsistencies when comparing one company to another, and when comparing a company to itself from year to year. By making adjustments, we aim to remove the financial statement distortions and miscategorizations of GAAP. Some of these can be automated through consistently applied formulas; however, many must be made manually. Manual adjustments that cannot be automated include mergers and acquisitions accounting, special charges, business impairments, and others. The practice of creating consistent, apples-to-apples comparable measures of financial performance is often considered either tedious or overly complex by even seasoned financial analysts.Under GAAP, as-reported financial statements and financial ratios of EXPE do not reflect economic reality. The traditional return on assets computation understates the company's profitability by incorrectly including certain items. The distortion of both profitability measures and valuation metrics of EXPE were primarily driven by the inclusion of the firm's immense goodwill ($10.8bn) and other intangibles ($3.3bn), which inflate the firm's asset base, and by incorrectly expensing R&D ($830mn) and operating leases ($109mn) rather than treating them as part of the company's investments.After adjusting for similar issues and a host of other GAAP-based miscategorizations, Valens calculates EXPE's Adjusted Return on Assets as 17% in 2015. In contrast, most financial databases show a traditional ROA of only 2%, far below the cost of capital. Meanwhile, the firm's Forward Adjusted Value-to-Earnings ratio is 14.6x, at the middle of historical valuations, while the firm's traditional forward P/E is at 20.5x. The profitability of EXPE's operations and their equity's true value are therefore not what traditional metrics originally suggest.Adjusted Return on Assets - ROA'The top panel of the chart shows the firm's Adjusted ROA (a.k.a. ROA', or ROA Prime). This measure is comparable from year to year and across peers as it ""cleans up"" the aforementioned GAAP accounting issues to provide consistent analysis.EXPE's Adjusted ROA was 17% in 2015, more than 2x the U.S. average cost of capital and more than 8x the firm's traditionally reported ROA of 2%. The spread between EXPE's Adjusted ROA and its traditional ROA is driven by an understatement in the company's Adjusted Earnings From Operations (the numerator, Earnings'), and an overstatement of their Adjusted Total Operating Assets (the denominator, Asset').Earnings are understated because the traditional calculation of net income does not recognize R&D expenses and operating leases as part of the company's operating investments. The incorrect deduction of these items makes it near-impossible to objectively compare the firm to its peers and even to its own historical performance. Our adjustments resolve the accounting issues between the expensing and capitalization of certain expenses.Furthermore, by adjusting for the firm's goodwill of $10.8bn and their other intangibles worth $3.3bn, the returns earned by EXPE through its operations can be identified. This adjustment provides better investment analysis because it separates the firm's profitability into: 1) organic Adjusted ROA, which indicates how well management executes the business, and 2) acquisitive Adjusted ROA, which shows how well management does when they acquire a business.With everything considered, EXPE appears to be far more profitable than what traditional metrics might suggest. That is a major difference in context and concept for evaluating the firm's situation.Growth in Business Assets - A'In the second panel of the four-panel chart, Asset' growth stands for ""Asset Prime Growth"" (or Adjusted Asset Growth) and is the real annual growth rate of the cleaned-up and properly adjusted asset base of the company. This metric shows the management team's propensity to reinvest or divest over time. When viewed in context of Adjusted ROA, the growth rate explains a lot about management's intended strategies and even their performance incentives.EXPE has maintained strong Adjusted Asset growth over the past decade through numerous acquisitions. They grew their Adjusted Asset base by 15% in 2007 before ramping growth to 28% in 2008 due to their acquisition of Venere.com. Adjusted Asset growth then slowed to 3% in 2009 before once again ramping to 21% when the firm acquired Mobiata. This strong Adjusted Asset growth continued, reaching 22% in 2011 and 16% in 2012 with their acquisition of VIA Travel. The firm's Adjusted Assets then slowed to 0% levels, ramping once again to 19% in 2014 and 16% in 2015 due to the firm's acquisitions of trivago GmbH, Wotif, Travelocity, Orbitz, and HomeAway.Valuation Relative to Adjusted Assets - V/A'The third panel shows the Adjusted Value to Assets ratio (V/A'), a ""cleaned-up"" Price-to-Book metric that compares the Adjusted Enterprise Value (V') of the company to its Adjusted Asset level (A'). The Adjusted Enterprise Value is the market capitalization of the company plus the total debt of the company, including off-balance sheet debt, while the Adjusted Asset level reflects the total operating assets of the firm, necessarily adjusted for problematic accounting standards for reporting of the balance sheet. Adjusted Assets is the same as the denominator of the Adjusted ROA calculation and the Adjusted Asset growth panel.EXPE is trading at the middle of historical valuations relative to asset values with an Adjusted Value to Assets ratio of 4.1x, almost twice the firm's traditional 2.8x P/B. Based on adjusted valuations, the firm initially appears to be overvalued by the markets as an Adjusted Value to Assets ratio of 4.1x would have to be supported by an Adjusted ROA of at least 27%, almost twice the firm's actual Adjusted ROA. That said, the firm's equity may be fairly valued relative to assets if analyst expectations are realized.Valuation Relative to Adjusted Earnings - V/E'In the fourth panel, we have another perspective of valuation to help triangulate the market's embedded expectations for company performance. We always want to know what is ""priced in"" to the stock price. In this case, Valens evaluates the Adjusted Enterprise Value (V') of the firm relative to their expected Adjusted Earnings (E') for the next year. Adjusted Earnings are earnings resulting from the company's core business operations, regardless of how it is financed, and adjusted to its current dollar value. This is adjusted to eliminate accounting distortions and shenanigans, and enhance comparability across different companies, industries and geographies, to determine potential mispricings. The Adjusted Enterprise Value (V') numerator is the same as that in the Adjusted Value to Assets ratio.EXPE's as-reported forward P/E is at 20.5x, initially making the firm's equity appear overvalued (considering that long-term P/E ratios average around 15x-17x). However, our analysis finds that EXPE is trading at the middle of historical valuations with a 14.6x Adjusted Value to Earnings ratio. Therefore, there may be equity upside if Adjusted ROA' levels rise from normal 16%-19% levels seen in the last five years, as analysts project.ConclusionAs-reported financial statement information and financial ratios, which make up most of the publicly available financial databases, do not consider the extent to which distortions, miscategorizations, and misclassifications cause as-reported financial statements to depart from economic reality. Even the venerable ""statement of cash flaws"" - pun intended - is horribly distorted, as many items in the statement of cash flows are actually non-cash related. What is deemed cash flow from operations, investing, and financing activities are inconsistently booked from company to company and even just from year-to-year at an individual company. The distortions are material and directionally changing, and the mismeasurements that result are decision-changing issues.A far better picture of the economic reality of Expedia, Inc. can be seen once those distortions are removed. The firm generated returns more than 8x what most financial databases report in 2015. Moreover, adjusted valuations indicate that the firm is trading at only modest levels relative to earnings. With that context of corporate performance and market valuation, we have a far better means for evaluating EXPE's prospects for the future of its stock.Our Chief Investment Strategist, Joel Litman, chairs the Valens Equities and Credit Research Committees, which are responsible for this article along with the lead analyst, Cheska Pablico. Professor Litman is regarded around the world for his expertise in forensic accounting and ""fundamental forensic"" analysis, particularly in corporate performance and valuation."

Very few people we would imagine. Often the only thing stopping people from traveling is money, or the lack thereof. But with middle classes growing all over the world there are few industries benefiting as much as the travel industry. Especially with macroeconomic factors in its favor such as low fuel costs and rising wages. Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) is one such company which we believe will see a long-term benefit from this growth in tourism around the world. At the current price it represents a great investment for buy and hold investors.We have been long Expedia since the middle of January and have seen a reasonably good 5% gain during that time. Admittedly, not as strong a gain as we had expected, but with a long-term view we see this as the start of many greater gains to come.The reason we are bullish on the stock comes down to the growth in tourism worldwide. The word China gets bandied about so often by companies and investors that it's starting to lose its allure to some degree. But with outbound tourism in China growing to over 100 million people in 2015, this is certainly not something to dismiss quickly.Of course Expedia will not benefit from this as much as someone like Priceline (NASDAQ:PCLN) might. A slowing economy and increased competition in China forced Expedia to pull out of the China travel market and sell its stake in Chinese travel company eLong to Ctrip (NASDAQ:CTRP). The company has an agreement with Ctrip that means it still benefits from Chinese visitors to the United States. According to data provided by Statista, Chinese visitors to the United States is expected to grow to 5 million per year by 2020.Source: StatistaThis is a rapid rise from just 800,000 Chinese visitors in 2010 and should help keep the US Tourist Arrivals growing strongly for many years to come. The chart below shows the latest tourists arrivals data which still shows reasonable growth despite the strong dollar.We have been very impressed with the growth of Expedia's revenue. It is growing at twice the rate of the industry and this looks set to continue to be the case in the near future. By having over 1.5 million lodgings on offer for travelers it certainly has a strong offering and should support the growth we are seeking as investors.We still find the fact that Expedia covers all bases in the travel industry very encouraging. Although we still have a preference for Airbnb (Private:AIRB) as a platform, the acquisition of HomeAway (NASDAQ:AWAY) was a great move by the company. The way people travel is rapidly evolving thanks to the disruption to the traditional model brought on by Airbnb. With Expedia being able to offer both styles of accommodation it gives it an advantage over the competition. As we have a tendency, personally, to compare hotel prices to homes on Airbnb, we believe successful integration of HomeAway within Expedia could eliminate the need for people like us to use Airbnb.The rise in mobile bookings is something we expect will benefit the company also. At present the company estimates that one in four hotel room nights are booked on a mobile device. Its app is very easy to use and the ease at which you can make a booking is a real time saver. There could be opportunities also for the company to leverage the rise of ""chat bots"" designed to become digital assistants. This may well turn out to be a key booking method in the future.Finally, we think the fact that the company now allows hotels to bid for higher rankings in its search results through its Accelerator Program will prove to be a good move. By monetizing its platform in this way the company has created another revenue stream.We feel 2.0 times sales is a good multiple to value the stock at. As you can see on the chart above this is about the level which the share price pivots around. We have forecast revenue to come in just above the consensus forecast at $8.9 billion for fiscal 2016. Based on this and an estimated 138.5 million shares outstanding, we have a price target of $128.51. This equates to a fantastic return of 19.2% from the last close price.Growth in tourism looks set to continue for many years and Expedia is well-placed to profit from it. We expect significant gains in the year ahead and the same can be said for fiscal 2017. Expedia is in our opinion a great investment today."
3970876,98366,2016-05-03T18:29:48-04:00,Expedia is positioned well to grow market share and capture a good portion of the 4% tourism growth expected in 2016.The acquisition of HomeAway gives the company an edge over its competitors.Earnings growth is expected to average 26% per annum for the next five years.,"It is starting to look like the travel juggernaut that is Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) is unstoppable. This growing company had another great quarter, this time smashing earnings estimates by 15 cents and revenue by $60 million. Due to projected tourism growth in 2016 and the company's recent acquisitions, we believe it will produce solid earnings growth this year and next. We have been holding the shares since January and, despite a 14% gain, continue to hold on for more gains.The rapid growth of Expedia has largely been down to the advance in technology and the growth in worldwide tourism. Apparently, there used to be a time in which you would sit with travel agents and book vacations with them in person. As foreign as this may seem to many now, this distant memory isn't actually that long ago. How things have changed! We, like many consumers, book everything from flights to hotels online these days. It is far more convenient and time-efficient than a trip to a travel agent. The other key benefit of the shift to online booking is that there are no real boundaries that the company faces. Expedia receives 450 million monthly visits through operations across 75 countries worldwide at a mere fraction of the cost it would take for physical locations.The UN's World Tourism Organization estimates that tourism is going to grow by around 4% in 2016, following a record 4.4% increase to 1.2 billion in international tourist arrivals in 2015. The reports states the following:We believe this level of growth in tourist arrivals should help the company continue to grow its earnings for a number of years to come. Sell-side analysts are forecasting earnings growth of 26% per annum for Expedia in the next 5 years. Whilst this may sound incredibly ambitious, we feel the company is positioned to deliver on this promise.The company acquired HomeAway in order to compete with Airbnb (AIRB), and we must say we are very pleased with management's decision. Airbnb has definitely been eating into hotel bookings, which in turn was eating into Expedia's bookings. But now with HomeAway as part of its business, Expedia covers all bases in the travel industry giving it an advantage over its peers. Airbnb is the clear market leader in the vacation rental marketplace, but if Expedia can integrate HomeAway into its own search options without cannibalizing its sales, then we believe HomeAway could start to eat into Airbnb's market share. We have mentioned it before, but we have a tendency to check accommodation options through Expedia and compare it to what is available through Airbnb. If the company can eliminate this need, then it stands to benefit in our opinion, potentially at the expense of Airbnb.As you can see above, the revenue growth the company has been producing has been phenomenal. Thanks to the growth in worldwide tourism, its strong organic growth, and the acquisition of HomeAway, we expect the company to continue to grow revenue at a high rate for the next few years. This year, we anticipate revenue growth accelerating to 25% year-over-year, taking Expedia's revenue through to a record $9 billion.We believe thanks to its strong performance and excellent growth prospects investors would now be willing to pay upwards of 2.2 times sales for the company's shares. As you can see above, this is a reasonable level for the shares to trade at. Based on this ratio, our full-year revenue forecast of $9 billion, and an estimated 151 million shares outstanding, we have a target price of $131.13. This represents a return of around 12.5% from the last close price of $116.52.In our opinion, Expedia remains a great long-term buy and hold investment that we expect will reward shareholders with strong gains over the next five years. The company has a competitive advantage over its peers thanks to its acquisition of HomeAway, and we believe it is positioned well to capture market share growth in the next few years."
3980179,92986,2016-06-06T13:08:05-04:00,Accommodation & food services have a strong outlook despite slowing service sentiment.Hotel and restaurant prices keep soaring.Expedia and its peers have a strong fundamental tailwind.,"One of the stocks I am long since a few months is Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE). I wrote an article about the company using the bottom-up method. In this article, I want to talk about the lodging and travel business using the top-down method.First of all, let's look at the ISM non-manufacturing index. Service sentiment is back at a multi-year low after posting two strong months in March and April. This is quite alarming because services are supposed to support the economy because manufacturing is not able to.Source: Institute for Supply ManagementThe non-manufacturing industry accommodation & food services is doing quite well. There has only been one month of contraction after the 2012 and 2013 weakness. The industry is almost on a consistent basis among the strongest growers in the non-manufacturing business.Source: Institute for Supply ManagementRestaurant and hotel prices confirm the NMI outlook. Price growth dipped in 2013 but remained in a steady uptrend.This is a good sign. Restaurants and hotels increase prices mainly because demand is really strong. In addition to that, price growth is not only steady but rising. Good news for investors, bad news for consumers who like low prices.Construction spending in the lodging industry has risen sharply in 2015. Construction spending growth hit a multi-year high. Since then, growth has returned slightly above the 4 year average.Expedia's sales are about to hit a new all time high in this quarter. If you exclude the 2011 quarterly dip, sales have been in a accelerating growth phase since 2006. Even the great recession could not stop revenue growth.EXPE Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsExpedia's stock price performance is almost twice as high as Marriott's (NASDAQ:MAR) performance.Expedia's PE ratio is 39 which is about ten points above the industry average. Despite having a higher PE ratio, the company has one of the lowest PEG ratios (1.15).EXPE data by YChartsIn my opinion, we see further strength in the lodging industry. Changing fundamentals are in favor of all companies in this industry. Especially Expedia will benefit since this company growths mainly due to take-overs and a changing environment (online booking & offering).I keep my Expedia long position and might add to the position in the near future."
3962051,92986,2016-03-30T14:23:13-04:00,Strong secular growth during the past ten years and an astonishing outlook for the coming five years.Successful business model of organic growth and acquisitions.A valuation that looks too good to be true - but it is.,"A part of my trading strategy is never being too much net long or net short. Most of the time I am about 10-20% net long. Most of my trades are intra sector ratio spreads. In other words, I trade companies directly against each other. I've written a few articles discussing such trades like O'Reilly Auto Parts (NASDAQ:ORLY) versus Ford (NYSE:F) or D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) versus the S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSEARCA:XHB).I increasingly do trades like this to eliminate market risk. Both crashes and rallies have no effect when it comes to my portfolio returns. My portfolio has almost no correlation with the 'market' and is mostly moves my secular trends and differences between companies.In this article I want to share my thoughts on Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and tell you why I think this company is interesting for the long run and can be traded versus its peers.Expedia started as a division of Microsoft and was spun off in 1999. Two years later the company was bought by TicketMaster which changed its name to USA Networks. USA Networks, which had changed its name to InterActiveCorp, spun off its travel part in 2005.Nowadays Expedia is worth over 16 billion USD and services travelers in over 75 countries.Sales & IncomeExpedia's sales have been growing consistently if we ignore the only dip in 2005. Even the big recession of 2008 couldn't stop the rapid growth.This strength is provided by two factors. First of all: Expedia is a young company focused on growing as fast as possible. Secondly we see secular growth in the travel business. This is almost entirely due to the use of internet and the possibilities it gives customers and companies. Everything is done online. Buying clothes, shoes, cars, toys and even food. In other words: consumer spending is happening online.Expedia is doing everything right. They provide the best online services and are able to benefit from this secular trend.EXPE data by YChartsUnlike Expedia's earnings we witnessed crashing net income during the financial crisis and some contraction between 2012-2013. The net income dip after 2012 is due to high SG&A expenses and operating costs.EXPE data by YChartsEXPE data by YChartsExpedia was making 79% of all sales in the USA back in 2005. As of 2015 this percentage has decreased to 56%. Many costs connected to this growing strategy have put some pressure on net income.Add to this Expedia's amazing CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) performance. Room nights grow 25.3% on average (every year(!)), gross bookings add 22% while EBITDA soars 13.2%.Valuation & Growth OutlookExpedia is trading at 18.8 times earnings. 12 points below the 30 times earnings of the lodging industry. However, almost all companies of the lodging industry are hotel chains and part of Expedia's business model. Therefore I think being below the industry valuation is not a big problem.Expedia's growth expectations are sky high. Even after the amazing performance during the past ten years.Growth ExpectationsIf we add growth to Expedia's price to earnings ratio we get a PEG ratio of 0.80.The thing I like most about Expedia is its growth strategy. The company is optimizing its mobile services because one in four rooms is booked via a mobile device. Moreover, 40% of online traffic comes from mobile devices.Not only is Expedia optimizing online services for customers but also for the hotels that use these devices. Expedia makes it extremely easy for Hotels to use these services and attract customers.Add to that the fact that Expedia not only does a lot of advertising but makes a lot of money from third party advertising. Expedia's advertising & media business growths almost 66% on average every single year.Expedia's growth is strengthened even further by acquisitions. By buying HomeAway in 2015 the company added 1.24 million lodging alternatives to its existing basket of 270.000 alternatives. The picture below shows Expedia's acquisition history.Source: Expedia Inc. February 2016 Investor PresentationI think Expedia's stock can rise much higher than the current price around 110 USD. I bought the stock at the end of 2014 and shorted the SPDR Industrial Select Sector ETF (NYSEARCA:XLI) to hedge my position.I wrote a few articles about growth slowing and added this trade to my portfolio to be long secular growth and short the slowing economy."
3961264,96696,2016-03-28T06:07:22-04:00,Priceline and Expedia will face competition on commission rates if Airbnb expands into hotel booking.The present incumbents would not be able to move into Airbnb’s turf due to regulatory obstacles.It is certain that cannibalization of Priceline and Expedia’s room night will be done by Airbnb.Hotel chains might start favoring Airbnb as an alternative distribution channel.,"Priceline Group, Inc. (PCLN) and Expedia, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) have faced growing concerns over their future growth potential due to the rise of Airbnb, Inc. (AIRB). Currently, Airbnb is valued at $25.5 billion, which is more than EXPE's market cap of $16 billion and close to 40% of PCLN's market cap of $64 billion. In the third quarter of 2015, Airbnb sold 23.8 million room nights in comparison to 61.5 million by EXPE and 115.6 million by PCLN.Both Priceline and Expedia have been able to survive in the highly competitive online travel agency (OTA) market by spending billions of dollars in the past few years to consolidate the market. The end result has been that 95% of the market is now in the hands of these two OTA behemoths. Both these OTAs currently charge commissions as high as 15% to 25% for bookings made on their platform.Entry by another player in this market would mean an instant pressure on commissions which are bread and butter for these OTAs. Currently, Airbnb charges 3% commission from hosts and additional 6-12% fee from travellers. Hence, the gross fee charged comes to 9-15%, which is much lower than those charged by Priceline and Expedia.A bigger issue is that Priceline or Expedia cannot simply enter Airbnb's market of peer to peer apartment rental because of regulatory and legal issues. Although, both the firms have tried to expand their market: Expedia by buying HomeAway and Priceline by making in-house development to allow travellers to book an apartment. Airbnb has a natural moat in this niche which would be very difficult to overcome by either of the two OTAs.At the same time, there is exponential room night and listings growth on Airbnb platform. There are several pros and cons for hosts within the Airbnb platform, but overall, the system is growing at a very fast pace and getting high degree of acceptance from both hosts and travellers.Fig: New listings on Airbnb platform in the past eight years. Source: Airdna.coThis will lead to increasing cannibalization of the room nights booked on Priceline and Expedia. A recent report posted by STR Global and Morgan Stanley points to this fact.Fig: Impact of Airbnb on other OTAs. Source STR Global, Morgan Stanley ResearchThe report estimates Airbnb having 183 million room nights booked in 2020 against 563 million by other OTAs. If 20% of these room nights come from other OTAs, it will lead to 7% fall in their demand. On the other hand, if 50% of these room nights come from other OTAs, the fall can be as high as 16%.Airbnb has a number of hurdles to overcome. These include safety, zoning permission, taxes and hosts working on an equal footing with hotel industry. However, all the regulatory bodies will also have to look at the income charts for hosts. A majority of the hosts have an income below the median income and many of them use this platform to pay for important necessities. This fact should reduce the blow which regulators might otherwise deal to Airbnb.Fig: Breakup of household income of hosts in France. Source: Airbnb.comHotel chains have shown an ostrich behavior to the growth of Airbnb, trying to ignore it instead of meeting the challenge head-on. Increasingly, more and more CEOs from bigger hotel chains have started accepting the strength of Airbnb in their earnings call and looking at ways to deal with the challenge. Many of these incumbents have even hinted in using Airbnb as an additional distribution channel. Currently, Airbnb requires only 3% fee from hosts. Bigger chains might be able to negotiate a lower total service fee by Airbnb, as they are able to do with Priceline and Expedia.Airbnb has not been very aggressive in pursuing hotel industry, but if it is to increase its market share, then we should see big announcements in terms of partnerships or collaboration by hotel chains and Airbnb, sooner rather than later. This should be a win-win situation for both. Hotel chains will get a much deeper insight into Airbnb platform and deep knowledge on the current customer requirement trends. They will also get a lower commission rate than they currently pay. Airbnb will get additional revenue stream and would be able to provide travellers with comprehensive lodging options.Valuation impactPriceline gets a major chunk of its revenue from Europe where it is also facing pressure due to price parity rules. It also relies on its agency model to a greater extent where hotels pay commissions on bookings made instead of the merchant model. This has contributed to higher profit margin for the company and hence better valuation than Expedia. As Airbnb increases its market share, Priceline will face a higher pressure on profit margins which will be squeezed to lower levels, thus impacting its valuations to a greater degree than it will affect Expedia.Fig: Higher profit margins have provided better valuations for Priceline than Expedia.Any hit on the profit margin will impact Priceline much more adversely than Expedia.ConclusionsPriceline and Expedia are facing increasing challenges from Airbnb which is able to boast of a high number of room nights booked on its platform. They will face a double whammy due to competitive pressure on the commissions charged and possible use of Airbnb platform as a distribution channel by hotels. The next few quarters will be particularly tough on these two OTAs. Avoiding Priceline stock at this price point should be an ideal approach in this fluid market scenario."
3812836,98366,2016-01-15T09:52:49-05:00,"A stronger USD and low oil prices could be a catalyst for increased US vacationing overseas.We believe the acquisition and integration of HomeAway is going to be a big success.Rising middle classes in China, Indonesia, and India could help maintain the high levels of growth for a long time.","The US dollar has strengthened significantly against the majority of the world's major currencies in the last two years. This, along with cheap oil prices, could be a catalyst for more traveling from US consumers. One company we believe could benefit from this is Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE).While it is true to say that a strong USD is not great for tourism inside the United States and the businesses that rely on it, it does make traveling overseas that much more appealing for US consumers, especially when combined with the low oil prices. As Expedia is an online travel company that provides consumers with everything from flights to complete holiday packages and rental cars to cruises, it could be about to benefit greatly. It operates numerous well-known brands worldwide covering mainstream and niche areas of the travel industry. Shown below is the company's portfolio of brands.Source: Company PresentationShould Expedia be worried about slowing tourism to the United States? We don't think so. International users will vacation whether the USD is strong or not, the only variable is the destination. As Expedia provides access to around 271,000 hotels in over 200 countries, we believe it has this eventuality covered.The growth of the business overseas in the last ten years has been fantastic. The diversity of the company's customer base (shown below) has improved significantly, but also reveals just how much further the company has left to grow.Source: Company PresentationThe rising Chinese middle class is going to be a big growth catalyst for Expedia if they can capture a meaningful slice of it. Chinese disposable income is forecast to grow at a rapid rate, and the $165 billion that Chinese tourists spent in 2014 will at least double by 2030.One other item that we really find encouraging is the fact that Expedia covers all bases in the travel industry now, and although we still have a slight preference for Airbnb (AIRB) as a platform, the acquisition of HomeAway (NYSEARCA:AWAY-OLD) was a great move by the company.When we travel, depending on the number of people traveling, we usually check both a hotel comparison site and Airbnb. By acquiring HomeAway it now means the company can compete for the business they may have been losing to Airbnb. The additional lodging alternatives is incredibly significant and at the time of the acquisition HomeAway had approximately 1.2 million properties listed across 190 countries. Successful integration of HomeAway within Expedia could eliminate the need for people like us to use Airbnb.The company is well-positioned for the rise of mobile bookings. The company estimates that one in four of its hotel room nights are booked on a mobile device. We have used the app for booking ourselves and find it to be very efficient.In terms of valuation Expedia looks to be good value for money right now.Source: YchartsThe stock is currently trading at a (normalized) PE ratio of 26.6 times trailing earnings, compared with Priceline (PCLN) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) which trade at 23.25 and 47.38 times trailing earnings, respectively. We've chosen to normalize the price to earnings ratios here because there was a one-time item in Q2's results which throws off the balance. Without normalizing Expedia's PE ratio would be showing as 16.98.Whilst Priceline's PE ratio is lower, we do see Priceline as being undervalued right now. But that's for another day.Source: YchartsIn the last ten years the company's revenue has rocketed, as demonstrated above. We believe the stronger USD, falling oil prices, and integration of HomeAway will help sustain this growth in the short-term. In the long-term the growing middle classes in China, Indonesia, and India will do the same. For this reason, we believe the company can continue to grow its revenue at an average of 20% per annum for the next 3 years, after which growth will continue to be strong, but at slightly lower levels.When a stock is good value for money, which we believe Expedia's is right now, and is going to grow revenue at that high rate, it makes for an extremely compelling investment in our opinion. We expect the share price to grow at a similar rate to its revenue growth."

Income-seeking investors should head higher up the capital structure, focusing on the company's bonds.Expedia's stock yields less than 1%. Its 2024 bonds, however, yield close to 5%.","As someone who used to be a full-time trader of equities, moving in and out of securities at frequencies that many would find preposterous, I can tell you first-hand the importance of timing an equity investment.Moreover, as someone who is active across the spectrum of financial assets, from private equity to public equities, from physical commercial real estate and precious metals, to corporate bonds, Treasuries, and preferred stocks, I can also tell you that one's overarching goals for an investment should play a big role in how one approaches the acquisition of that investment. It sounds like common sense. But in a world in which we are bombarded with an ever-increasing number of facts and opinions, it can be easy for someone to lose one's way, allowing insignificant facts to scare one away from an investment opportunity, or allowing cleverly disguised political or financial motives to steer us in a direction we otherwise would find detrimental to our financial health.Despite my belief that timing is an important consideration when acquiring an equity investment (timing has a huge impact on one's future returns), I do not share the same sentiment when it comes to acquiring, for example, individual bonds. From my perspective, equities are to be purchased first with capital appreciation in mind and second with income in mind.Bonds are the opposite. Bonds are to be purchased first with income in mind and as an afterthought for potential capital appreciation. If you are comfortable with the credit risk of a particular company and the bond meets your income requirements, it is less than prudent to play the waiting game, hoping you can acquire it at a cheaper price. Sometimes you'll win and sometimes you'll lose. But every time you'll be making a less than responsible gamble with your future income.With that in mind, I'd like to bring to people's attention an income opportunity about which many investors are likely unaware, despite it likely satisfying many investors' income and credit risk requirements. It's time to check out some Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) bonds.Expedia's BusinessThe first thing you should know about Expedia is that it is much more than just Expedia. Sure, you likely deduced that Expedia, Inc. owns Expedia.com. But Expedia's reach goes well beyond its namesake website. As one of the world's largest online travel companies, Expedia's brands include, among others, Hotels.com, Hotwire, Travelocity, Orbitz Worldwide, trivago (as majority shareholder), and in the near future HomeAway.com.Expedia's portfolio of brands generates healthy revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow (see below), while maintaining a reasonable amount of leverage despite the 2015 acquisition spree (acquired Travelocity, Orbitz Worldwide and announced the acquisition of HomeAway).While I am less sanguine than Expedia appears to be about their revenue mix by product, I do like their growth in the international market, growing revenues abroad from 21% to 45% of total revenues over the past decade.Even though I'm not thrilled with 69% of Expedia's total revenues coming from hotels, it doesn't seem unreasonable to expect Expedia to continue to grow market share in the online travel segment, thereby offsetting my concerns about revenue concentration for the time being. As the following slide from Expedia's Q3 2015 earnings presentation shows, there is still plenty of room for growth both in terms of the switch to online travel bookings as well as in terms of growing Expedia's global share of the online travel space.The OpportunityFor investors who, like me, view Expedia's credit risk as reasonable, there is an opportunity to capture predictable and contractually obligated payments by owning the company's debt. Expedia currently has three U.S. dollar denominated CUSIPs trading on the secondary market. These include (1) $500 million of senior unsecured August 2018 maturing notes, CUSIP 30212PAB1, with a 7.456% coupon; (2) $750 million of senior unsecured August 2020 maturing notes, CUSIP 30212PAH8, with a 5.95% coupon; and (3) $500 million of senior unsecured August 2024 maturing notes, CUSIP 30212PAJ4, with a 4.50% coupon. It is the 2024 notes that I think represent an opportunity at this time.As an aside, the company also has €650 million of 2.50% coupon 2022 maturing senior unsecured notes, $750 million of brand new 5% coupon 2026 maturing notes issued in a private offering, and a $1 billion revolving credit facility expiring in September 2019 of which $987 million was available at the end of Q3.The August 15, 2024 maturing notes were recently yielding 4.713% with approximately 8 years, 8 months to maturity. The notes carry Ba1/BBB- ratings from Moody's and S&P, and, as outlined in the prospectus supplement, also include a conditional put for a change of control (at 101 cents-on-the-dollar) as well as a make-whole call.I realize 4.713% isn't the type of yield that you'll be bragging about at parties. At the same time, income investors looking to build a diversified portfolio that generates predictable and reliable distributions with higher levels of principal protection will be hard pressed to find many better opportunities in today's environment. I know because I look for those opportunities nearly every day of the week.What About the Fed Raising Rates?Over the past seven years, income investors have been bombarded with the ""rates-are-about-to-skyrocket"" fear mongering that has caused many people to put money into ""no-brainer"" dividend-growth investments or simply wait on the sidelines for rates to finally head higher so they can buy bonds. As many Seeking Alpha readers recently learned, those ""sure thing"" popular dividend-growth opportunities aren't always a ""sure thing"" (see here). Moreover, as people waited for higher rates that never materialized, the opportunity cost to their portfolios grew (more on that in a bit).Now, however, the Fed appears closer to raising rates than at any time since the financial crisis. Doesn't this mean investors should wait? Given the next Fed announcement is one week away, I certainly understand why people would want to wait. Also, a Fed rate hike certainly has the possibility of creating a panic move higher in Treasury yields, pulling down corporate bond prices with it. From my perspective, the current credit risk and yield for Expedia's 2024 notes warranted a purchase. At the same time, I recognize the risk of prices heading lower in the near future. I am therefore employing a dollar-cost average approach to acquiring Expedia's 2024 notes (yes, dollar-cost averaging also works in the world of bonds!).For those investors who think Expedia's 2024 notes are compelling but prefer to wait for lower prices, let me also share the following thoughts:An investor who chooses not to purchase a bond that meets his or her credit and income requirements in order to wait for slightly lower prices may win or may lose. It's a gamble. We all have different viewpoints on when to gamble. That's a decision each of us must make on our own.Risks/ConcernsExpedia's bonds are certainly not immune to risks. There is always the risk that a company takes certain corporate actions that are unfavorable for the bonds, such as acquisitions that increase leverage, large stock buybacks, and aggressive dividend policies. Additionally, Expedia operates in a highly competitive market, a risk that I see lingering for quite some time. And, of course, a general protracted downturn in the U.S. and/or global economy could have notable consequences for Expedia. In a serious economic downturn, it is certainly possible that Expedia's bonds trade notably lower for the duration of the downturn. Unlike in the world of stocks, however, absent a default, there is a contractual guarantee that the bonds will return to 100-cents-on-the-dollar at maturity.Another concern for some investors might be the ""junk"" rating from Moody's (Ba1 is the highest non-investment grade rating). When looking at credit ratings, keep in mind that at the end of the day, a bond essentially ends up with a AAA rating or in default. What I mean is that between the time you purchase a bond and that bond's maturity date, the company will either meet its contractual financial obligations or it will default. The ratings are simply a snapshot representation of the rating agency's opinion of the risks inherent in the bond on its journey towards maturity.ConclusionEven though I have my share of ""risky"" investments in my portfolio (investing in startups is inherently risky), I much prefer sleep-well-at-night types of investments. Based on what I currently know about Expedia, its 2024 notes are one of those investments I plan to tuck away for some time to come.I realize owning a bond isn't going to help make you the life of the party. But if your goal is to build a diversified portfolio that generates predictable and reliable distributions with relatively high levels of principal protection, Expedia's 2024 notes are worth considering.Disclaimer: I am not your financial advisor. I don't know the details of your particular financial goals, time horizon, risk tolerance, etc. Only you and/or your qualified financial advisor can decide if investing in individual bonds, including Expedia's notes, is right for you. Additionally, just because Expedia's bonds may be suitable investments today, doesn't mean they will be suitable investments in the future. Nobody can say for certain whether Expedia will be able to meet its financial obligations over the life of its 2024 notes."
3713416,76305,2015-11-25T10:26:35-05:00,HomeAway agreed to be acquired by Expedia for $10.15 in cash and 0.2065 in Expedia stock.The deal is expected to close 1st quarter of 2016.We believe the likelihood of the deal closing is high.Investors should be careful of the risk incurred at current levels -- the risk doesn't justify the return.,"On November 2, 2015, HomeAway (NYSEARCA:AWAY-OLD) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) announced they entered into a definitive agreement in which Expedia would acquire HomeAway for ~$3.9 billion in cash and Expedia stock. HomeAway shareholders would receive $10.15 per share in cash and 0.2065 shares of Expedia stocks which equates to ~35.14 per share with Expedia trading at $121.We recently covered HomeAway in our May Issue of InvestorVantage with Wade Slome (Sidoxia Capital) when shares were trading at $27.45 per share. He had this to say about the company,We would say his analysis, patience, and fortitude paid well. Another great job Wade!HomeAway is the leading online website for vacation rentals. They've been able to ride the wave of growth in the ~$100 billion alternative accommodations industry. This acquisition by Expedia should amount to numerous synergies within the company. Expedia's expertise in global lodging and travel platforms and leading technology should help scale and distribution of HomeAway's platform. It will provide for a better product and customer experience over time.Brian Sharples, CEO of HomeAway said,So is there opportunity as a Merger-Arbitrage Candidate now?We do not see a high probability of failure given Expedia's strong capital position, free cash flow generation, and the lack of regulatory interference. However, as you can see in the calculation below, it doesn't look like a very interesting opportunity given the potential loss of -2.21% annualized return profile.The deal is said to close in Q1 of 2016 (4 months), both sides appear to be excited about the deal and the synergies involved, and there appear to be no regulatory hurdles. This should help pave the way for a smooth transaction.Expedia has ~1.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet and has very strong free cash flow generation of ~1 billion. HomeAway is currently priced at ~29x FCF which gives an implied yield of 3.40%. It also trades at an EV/EBIT multiple of 77.14. This puts the company on the upper end of the valuation spectrum. With that said, the company has a very strong user base that is growing, so we would be surprised by an increased bid from another company. Potential suitors include Priceline (PCLN) or TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP).There are many uncertainties around potential mergers, such as anti-trust approvals, multiple government reviews, changes in market conditions, shareholder approval, and due diligence.If the deal was not completed, we would expect prices to drop to the pre-deal price of $26.00, or a loss of $8.94. We give the deal a 95% chance of being complete based on the parties and terms of the buyout offer.If we look at the recent quote the stock is trading at $34.94 per share, $0.20 below the announced cash/stock offer of $35.14 per share by Expedia (based on Expedia trading at $121 per share).We calculate our expected return with the probability of a successful deal ($0.20 x .95 = $0.19). And we subtract that from our expected loss with the probability of that loss occurring (8.94 x .05 = $0.45). This is the expected weighted return which gives us a potential loss of -0.74%, or -$0.26 per share. To calculate our annualized Expected return we divide that by the expected time of holding in years (4 months = .33). This gives us an annualized expected loss of -2.21%.BOTTOM LINEWe like the strategic acquisition of HomeAway by Expedia. We do not see a high probability of failure given Expedia's strong capital position, strong free cash flow generation, and the lack of regulatory interference. The market appears to already be pricing in a higher deal price, which increases the risk profile if a deal were to fizzle out.We think it's a great acquisition by Expedia, however, from an investment standpoint, this appears to be unappealing at current levels with a potential -2.21% annualized loss profile. In addition, we would be subject to the closing price of Expedia, which could be much lower by Q1 2016. The risk does not justify the return in this case.Notable Shareholders:Ron Baron | Westerly Capital | Bares Capital | Beaconlight Capital | Eminence CapitalPlease share your thoughts in the comments section below as I learn just as much from you as you do from me. It can be a timely endeavor, but I answer all of your comments and questions myself. Your patience and understanding is greatly appreciated. I will get to your comments as soon as possible. :)WARNING: Merger-arb can be tempting for investors to use leverage to increase their annualized return on high probability events…Resist the urge! Many Wall Street firms conduct merger-arb as their main business and they will normally have 50 or more merger-arbitrage investments at any one time. They understand that if a couple of deals go bad, the winners will more than take care of the loses.Merger-arb can be a very crowded strategy at times. Similar to value investing, it can be cyclical and go in and out of favor over time.The key to merger-arb is to focus on the few deals that are highly probable (ideally ALL cash deals) with minimal regulatory hurdles and an acquirer with a great capital base. And if you're new to merger-arb, watch a few deals play-out over various industries to get an understanding of the deals.If you do invest in merger-arb situations conduct proper due diligence and make sure to spread your risk appropriately. If you are so inclined to learn more about these types of special situation, I highly recommend Graham's writing on arbitrage in his Security Analysis book."
3959946,96696,2016-03-21T12:37:00-04:00,"Higher commissions charged by Priceline and other OTAs have been a grudging point for hotel chains since the beginning.Hotel chains like Marriott and Hilton have stepped up their effort to increase the share of direct bookings, thus lowering the commissions paid.Long-term impact on Priceline and other OTA stocks should not be underestimated.","Hotel chains have always felt that OTAs like Priceline Group (NASDAQ:PCLN) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) have charged them unreasonable commissions for bookings made through their platform. These commissions can easily be as high as 15 to 20%. On the other hand the marketing costs for other channels like bookings on the hotels' website or other offline channels rarely go above 4-5%. In the earlier stages of the evolution of the OTA platform, these higher costs were justified due to a higher cost of building the technology and platform. Also, the hotel chains were quite slow in adopting new technology which forced them to rely on OTAs.However, for the past few quarters, more and more hotel chains, especially the bigger chains like Hilton (NYSE: HLT) and Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR), have started building their platforms much more aggressively. Both of them have pushed their direct booking platforms through heavy advertisement. Marriott started with ""it pays to be direct"" campaign in August 2015 and received close to 7 million views on YouTube. Similarly, Hilton Worldwide has launched its campaign of ""Stop Clicking Around"" a few weeks back and has garnered over 3 million views on YouTube. It also had 49 spots from February 15 to 17 in US, with an estimated budget of $1.3 million according to iSpot.tv.These campaigns are launched on the back of two important factors. First is the easing of ""rate parity"" and ""most favored clause."" Rate parity clause requires the hotels to match the lowest rate they are offering across all channels on OTAs platform where similar rooms are available. Most favored clause requires the hotels to give the best terms to OTAs, of all other partners. Both these clauses came under increasing reviews from different investigators in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and more last year.The second factor lies at the core of the technological evolution of these platforms. It was quite expensive for a single hotel chain to spend heavily on its digital platform when the technology was in its infancy, back in the late 90s. Now it has become much simpler for a big hotel chain to have a digital footprint and also pays a better return over the long term.Starting from April 11, Marriott will be launching new hotel rates for Marriott Rewards loyalty members. One can see the future plans for the chain by the breadth of this program. It is going to be available for 4,200 hotels across the world. Furthermore, if a guest finds a lower rate on any other platform than the one available on Marriott site within 24 hours of booking, Marriott will match that rate and provide an additional 25% discount. Its CMO has gone on record to say that the reason for this aggressive marketing is that they wanted to remove the myth that one can get the lowest rates only through other travel websites (OTAs like PCLN and EXPE).Hilton's CEO Chris Nassetta mentioned in the last quarterly results that they have secured three main concessions from OTAs in their negotiations. They are: getting rid of last room availability for OTAs, lowering margins to reasonable levels and having the ability to offer preferential treatment to Hilton's loyal customers. Hilton Honors deals now offer 10% off the published rate and additional points which can be used for free wifi, complimentary nights and digital room keys as well as concerts and weekend getaways.The efforts by major hotel chains to increase their direct bookings and customer loyalty programs will only increase. It has already rattled both PCLN and EXPE management. Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO mentioned in a recent investor day discussion on March 16th that if Marriott and Hilton do not provide their best prices and availability to Expedia then they will lose share on the platform. Priceline Group CEO Darren Huston also remarked at the ITB Berlin Convention in early March that he's annoyed by efforts made by bigger hotel chains to push direct bookings. Similar sentiments were shown by the CEO during the fourth quarter earnings call on February 17th when he remarked that he doesn't like some of the actions taken on chain levels.There's a marked difference between independent and chain hotels in terms of online booking share done on OTA for both the US and European market. Major chains already have a higher percentage of online bookings through non-OTA channels and should be able to increase this share considerably.Fig: Difference in OTA and online direct share among independent and chain hotels in US for 2015. Source: PhocuswrightFig: Difference in OTA and online direct share among independent and chain hotels in Europe for 2015. Source: PhocuswrightConclusionIn the highly competitive lodging industry a major direct online booking push by big players like Hilton and Marriott will force other players to relook their marketing channels. Instead of considering only RevPAR metric, hotel chains would put a greater focus on NRevPAR which is RevPAR minus the cost of commissions. When this metric is looked, the direct booking model is more profitable. This might not be a death knell for OTAs but it would put downward pressure on their gross bookings and commission rate. In the end this will affect their topline and bottom line and eventually their stock levels."
3958449,96696,2016-03-15T05:59:34-04:00,Expedia has recently launched new features like Accelerator program which should boost its commission rate over the long run.A number of smaller investments like 30.5 percent stake in hotel management app Alice and 14.9 percent stake in airport ride-sharing app Wingz bring new capabilities.Expedia beats Priceline on a number of important metrics.Good valuations to enter for a long run play.,"Expedia Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) is part of a duopoly along with Priceline Group Inc. (PCLN) in the online travel agency (or OTA) industry. Together they have cornered 95% of the total market, giving them a wide moat. Both the firms have splurged heavy resources on a number of acquisitions in the past few years. EXPE on its part has acquired HomeAway, Orbitz, Travelocity, Wotif, Auto Escape, Trivago and many other firms in the last couple of years.However, its true strength will be revealed when it can deliver organic growth. One of the biggest announcements made by the firm recently has been the launch of Accelerator program. This program would allow hotels to move their listings from third page to first page by paying extra commission to Expedia in additional to their regular commissions. This bid-for-placement program can be a win-win situation for both hoteliers as well as Expedia. Hotels facing lower occupancy rates for particular season can use this feature to increase their bookings. This feature has a clause which states that the boost in listings will still require the hotels to have good reviews, rankings and quality score. Hence the overall integrity of the system is maintained and customers see only higher quality hotels.A similar feature has been available with Bookings.com under Priceline for a number of years. It is called Preferred Program which enables properties to list higher by paying extra commissions. By adding this feature, Expedia will be closing a major gap with Priceline and also be able to offer lower commission rates for regular listings.The last few years have been full of activity for both EXPE and PCLN. All the major headlines were grabbed by their multi-billion dollar acquisitions like Orbitz and HomeAway. However, apart from these bigger acquisitions, Expedia has also been investing in a number of smaller ventures which provide niche capabilities to its platform and make it stand out from its competitors. These include 30.5 percent stake in Alice App for $9.5 million Series A funding. It will provide back-end platform for hotel operations and also provide a guest app for communications with hotel staff. This will help Expedia to enter the business end of the hotel industry. It is software as a service (NASDAQ:SAAS) platform which will help hotels to respond to requests made by guests and in turn provide them with requisite reporting and analytics.It also invested $11 million in Series B funding for airport ride-sharing app Wingz giving it a 14.9 percent stake. EXPE expanded its relationship with Decolar, largest online travel agency in Latin America, with $270 million minority investment amounting to 16.36 percent stake. There are a total of 15 companies in which Expedia has a minority or majority stake. Over a period of time, these purchases along with organic growth should make Expedia a one stop shop for all travel needs.When compared to Priceline, Expedia has delivered lower revenue growth, hotel room night growth, margins etc in the past few years. This is reflected in the current market cap of both the firms. PCLN is enjoying a market cap of $68 billion, whereas EXPE is at $18 billion, a mere 26% of its rival.However, there is one major metric where it is showing better results than PCLN. This is in the stability of its Revenue/ Gross Booking ratio. Gross bookings are the total bookings made on the platform. We can see this difference in both the firms from the table and graph:Table: Revenue, gross bookings and revenue/gross bookings numbers for Expedia and Priceline.Fig: The revenue/gross bookings for Expedia and Priceline. Source: Company filingsExpedia has maintained its revenue to gross booking percentage at over 11% for the past six years. During the same time Priceline has seen a massive drop from 22.5% to 16.6%. Although PCLN is still ahead of EXPE in this metric, we need to look at the revenue mix of both the firms. EXPE draws only 70% of its revenues from hotel bookings which are by far the highest margin sector. On the other hand PCLN gets over 90% of its revenue from hotel bookings. Hence, it will naturally have a lead in revenue to gross bookings.The fact that this percentage is falling for PCLN shows that it is not able to earn similar commissions from hotels as it was in the previous year. Also there would be a convergence in this metric for both the players as there is heavy pressure by the hotel industry to keep the OTA commissions low. With the rollout of features like Accelerator Program by EXPE, it should be able to further boost this ratio and close the gap with PCLN.EXPE is currently trading at a PE ratio of 20.0x and PS ratio of 2.3x. Compared to this PCLN is trading at PE ratio of 26.7x and PS ratio of 7.4x. EXPE also gives a dividend yield of 0.84%, giving a dividend growth of 33% in the last year and has a payout ratio of only 14.2%. PCLN does not give dividends. EXPE also has a share repurchase program in place.ConclusionIn the next few years as the travel industry sees some major changes like hotel consolidation, Airbnb challenge, changing customer preferences and new technologies we should see the OTA players move towards identical features, business model and revenue mix. EXPE will benefit from new features like Accelerator Program and investments in niche firms. A close look at all these factors shows that Expedia Inc is a much better investment, having reasonable valuation and good growth possibilities."

The company reported an increase in revenue of 27% on a year-over-year basis excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a segment-wise basis, gross booking in the core OTA increased by 23%, and in the Egencia segment, increased by 1% from the same quarter last year.

Let us take a closer look at EXPE's results to decide whether one should invest in the stock.Boosting Inorganic growthThe company is very actively pursuing an inorganic growth strategy to drive profits. Expedia acquired several companies providing travel-related services thus expanding on its reach and portfolio. In the past two years, the company made strategic investments by acquiring Travelocity in January 2015, and Wotif Group in November 2014 which focuses on the Asia Pacific region. Trivago was acquired in March 2013 while Orbitz Worldwide (NYSE:OWW) was recently bought up in September 2015. Cumulatively, these acquisitions led to a growth of 9% in bookings for this quarter.Continuous ImprovementThe company has been continuously upgrading its online services. In the third quarter of 2015, its expenses relating to technology increased 18% from the same quarter last year. This was for projects undertaken by the company related to Brand Expedia, and other technology platforms. The expenses include development of online business experience and use of mobile applications for conducting business.In the mobile technology platform, the company recently launched an exclusive application for Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) mobile phone users, which offer a special pricing to customers. Further, it has also provided hoteliers of Brand Expedia Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (Google) Android mobile devices to manage bookings more effectively. The company's app related to Hotels.com recently received the Travel Weekly Silver Magellan Award in the category of online travel services. The mobile app of the company related to Hotwire received the award for ""Best Travel App of 2015"" by PCMag. This shows how the company has been proactive on the technological front in order to boost market share.Expedia is constantly improving its site by introducing clearer fare choices and new site features. Recently, on 20th October, 2015, the company launched new flight products, which helps customers, compare and understand flight components in a more transparent way and providing a more comprehensive platform.Trivago, a metasearch engine, which was recently acquired by Expedia, has led to significant growth in the advertising and media business this quarter. Trivago covers 49 different countries and has been very successful in gaining recognition. Surveys done by Expedia shows that one in two Americans now recognize the brand Trivago. There is also a support system called Trivago Hotel Manager, which helps hoteliers market their services more effectively. The graphic below shows Expedia's increase in revenue contributed by the Trivago brand.Fierce CompetitionExpedia is more successful in the domestic U.S. market with a good market share, but has less share in the international market compared to major competitors such as Priceline Group (PCLN). Research shows that regions such as Asia Pacific and Latin America have been growing more in terms of travel demand.Over the years, both Expedia and Priceline have formulated different strategies to one up each other. In 2010, Priceline overtook Expedia as the world's largest online travel agency by adopting strategies of offline advertising. Priceline recently made a deal with TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) to gain more brand exposure. A similar strategy is expected to be followed by Expedia.Future ProspectsExpedia expects year-end adjusted EBITDA growth to be between 12% and 15%. The company also has strong expectation from Orbitz Worldwide as the Chief Financial Officer Mark Okerstrom said that an increase of $75 million per year in savings and revenue is expected. However, EXPE would incur integration and restructuring charges relating to Orbitz Worldwide and Wotif Group to the tune of around $20 million to $30 million in the fourth quarter.The company plans to launch more innovative travel products by the end of 2015, which are being tested at present. These include features like price trend analysis though which customers would be able to track airfare prices and understand trends over a 14-day period. Price prediction will also provide recommendations to the customers about changes in fare prices.According to research conducted in the first half of 2015 by ComScore, around 180 million people visited travel sites every month, which was 27% higher than last year. In addition, 36 million people who visited the US in April 2015 checked Expedia. This figure outnumbered collective visits to any individual airline or hotel website during that period.Bottom LineA closer look at the financials of Expedia reveals cash and equivalents as on 30th September, 2015, at $1.5 billion, which shows strong liquidity of the company. However, interest expense for the quarter also increased by $8 million or 30% due to more long-term debts.With a P/E ratio of 21.49, Expedia seems relatively undervalued compared to peers such as TripAdvisor and Priceline. Moreover, EXPE's net profit margin, while not the best, is still quite impressive compared to other peers.From a technical viewpoint, with a relative strength index of 54.49, the stock seems neither overbought nor oversold. Money flow index at 53.01 shows some inflows over the past month, but shows a general declining trend over a trailing 12-month period.Concluding RemarksExpedia has developed a very aggressive strategy to continue operating as a market leader. Its range of travel products has gained a lot of recognition, thus helping the company experience significant growth in revenue. Furthermore, with the third-quarter results beating market expectations, I expect the stock to witness continued upward momentum. On the flip side, it still remains to be seen how the company is able to stay agile in a sector brimming with fierce competition. Nevertheless one can add EXPE at current levels with a long-term perspective.(Author: R. Murarka)"
3597646,21798,2015-10-24T07:32:35-04:00,"Expedia has strong growth in a growing economy.
        The stock is reasonably priced based on long-term projected earnings.
        Market Commentary concludes the report.","The following article was previously released on September 14 to the paid subscribers of Momentum at a Reasonable Price. I have made it available to the public in response to requests to see a free sample. The stock increased 13% in just over one month.Weekly PickAs the economy in the U.S. continues to improve, consumers will be in a good position to travel. This creates a good opportunity for Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE). This online travel company operates these familiar brands: Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Hotwire.com, CarRentals.com, and Travelocity. Expedia makes the process of booking travel/lodging for both consumers and businesses easy and efficient.An independent travel research firm, Phocus Wright, found that over 50% of U.S. and European leisure and corporate travel expenditures occur online. The research firm also found that the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions have an online penetration rate of 20% to 30%. These rates are showing strength and are expected to continue increasing. I expect Expedia to continue benefiting from this trend.Expedia has a strategy for growth through product innovation, acquisitions, and global expansion. Product innovation includes making the company's websites conducive and easy to use for consumers and business travelers to research and purchase travel options. The product innovation is in a technology team for each of the company's brands that works on improving conversion and growth rates.The company also has an eye for acquisitions. Expedia's latest stab at an acquisition is its effort to buy Orbitz (NYSE:OWW). Although Orbitz is expected to post a loss this year, it is expected to be profitable in 2016. This is likely to have positive implications if the deal is approved and completed. The deal is controversial because the Hotel Industry is not in favor of it, citing that the combined company would control the online booking market and would impose higher costs on the industry.Expedia's recent acquisition that closed early in the year was Travelocity. This deal brought Expedia over 20 million travelers per month.Expedia's global expansion is being helped through the company's majority stake in Trivago, which is Europe's best known travel brand. Trivago plans on expanding rapidly in the U.S., Canada, and other countries. This will help drive Expedia's global expansion efforts. Expedia can also seek out additional acquisitions to expand globally.Expedia has a key customer base that generates repeat business for the company. The amount of repeat customers has been increasing due to Expedia's investments in loyalty programs. This is another driver of growth for the company.ValuationAlthough the company's forward PE ratio of 21.5 is above the S&P 500's forward PE of 16.3, Expedia's strong growth justifies a higher than average valuation. Expedia's PEG of 1.5 puts the expected growth into perspective. Since Expedia is expected to increase earnings at about 18.8% annually for the next five years according to consensus estimates, the PEG of 1.5 shows a fair valuation as it is based on 5-year projected earnings growth.Expedia is expected to increase revenue at a strong double-digit rate of 13.5% next year. The revenue growth combined with Expedia's high ROE of 29% is likely to support the company's strong expected earnings growth.The RisksSince the travel industry is highly sensitive to the strength of the economy, Expedia's revenue is likely to take a hit during recessionary times. The stock also takes a beating during a recession. Therefore, I would not want to own the stock when a recession appears to be on the horizon. With the U.S. economy making incremental gains and with the Fed near the beginning of an interest rate increase cycle, a recession is not likely any time soon.ConclusionWith a fair valuation in terms of long-term projected earnings, I think that the stock can grow approximately in-line with earnings growth. Therefore, the stock can reasonably gain 18% to 19% per year.Options IdeaConsider selling the October 23 put at the $112 strike price. It has significant premium remaining. If the stock price remains above $112, you'll collect the premium and can consider selling another put with a November or December expiration. If the stock does drop to $112, you can exercise the option and purchase the stock at a discount to today's price, while also collecting the premium that you sold.Market CommentaryThe market still looks a little shaky, but I still think that this is just a correction. We are just about to begin an interest rate increase cycle, which shows that the economy is improving. The improvements in GDP and other economic indicators have been small, but they are still improvements. A recession doesn't appear to be on the horizon any time soon. Therefore, this correction is not likely to be more than 20%. That would be the worst-case scenario in my opinion. I think that 15% is more reasonable for the current situation.There was some disappointing news on Friday with the Michigan Consumer Sentiment report, which came in at 85.7 below a forecast of 91.2. This was the lowest level since September 2014. This measures consumer optimism. So, with a lower than expected reading, consumers are feeling less optimistic about the economy due to global economic concerns. The current figure of 85.7 is still healthy. This figure typically falls below 70 before or near recessions.Fuel prices are still low, so consumers are retaining some cash to spend on other things, which is good for the economy. Although I can't be certain, my opinion is that the stock market may continue to show weakness in September and October, but show strength in November and December, heading into the end of the year.The Federal Reserve meets later this week on Thursday, so we'll know whether interest rates will be increased or not. An announcement of a raise might cause some initial selling, but I don't think it would be a big deal. Of course, the Fed may decide to postpone an interest rate increase. Regardless, we are likely to see continued volatility in stocks in the near term."

3446086,25265,2015-08-18T16:23:54-04:00,"A significant portion of Expedia's cash flow comes from the growth in deferred merchant bookings.As of June 30, 95% of Expedia's cash balance was encumbered by the deferred merchant bookings liability.A recession would likely expose this fact and call into question Expedia's cash flow.","The purpose of this article is to show investors what really drives Expedia's (NASDAQ:EXPE) impressive cash flow. On an earnings basis, the stock trades at a very high multiple - 30x this year's consensus estimate of $4.03/share while growing the top-line in the 15-20% per annum range. Some of that growth is attributable to acquisitions. Organic growth and the pending Orbitz acquisition are expected to contribute to EPS growth of 34% in 2016, according to consensus estimates. That would be nearly double the expected revenue growth of 18% and would put shares at a more reasonable multiple of 22x EPS, assuming everything goes according to plan.Setting EPS aside, I'd like to focus on free-cash-flow from here on out. The company generates impressive cash flow numbers. Here is a look free-cash-flow over the past few years.Source: company 10-Ks/10-QsA billion dollars in free-cash-flow for a $15B company with 15-20% topline growth looks impressive. However close followers of Expedia understand that a lot of cash generated from operations comes from what the company refers to as ""deferred merchant bookings."" This exists because travelers typically pay Expedia upfront when they book a hotel reservation. However Expedia does not typically send payment to the hotel until the stay actually occurs. To a lesser extent, this also occurs for car rentals, airlines, etc. So Expedia gets the use of the cash for a certain amount of time. Technically this is not Expedia's capital (it is a liability on the balance sheet), so I subtract it from free-cash-flow. Here are the same numbers from above presented again while subtracting deferred merchant bookings.Here you can see that deferred merchant bookings represent a sizable portion of the free-cash-flow this company generates on an annual basis. The consistent positive cash contribution from this line item (travel is expanding as the economy grows) leads to an increasing liability for deferred merchant bookings on the balance sheet.Source: company 10-Ks/10-QsThe large increase as of June 30, 2015 is somewhat misleading. This tends to burn off by the end of the year as the summer travel season ends in Q3 - though I still expect it to be higher at year-end 2015 than it was in 2014 as travel overall once again expands this year.Next let's compare this liability to that of Expedia's total cash and short-term investments balance.Source: company 10-Ks/10-QsWait a minute - is this company's entire cash balance a product of the liability that exists for prepaid customer travel? Yes it appears so. All of the company's cash balance was encumbered at the end of 2013 and 2014. The company has spent a lot of cash in recent years (more than it generates organically) on acquisitions, stock buybacks and dividends. These activities have, at least partially, been financed by customer travel deposits. These corporate activities have also eaten up the company's entire non-deferred merchant bookings cash balance. Ok so what you say? Well you are right at the moment, the market doesn't seem to care as the stock price is near an all-time high. I'd say that at the present time no one is paying attention. However we need to consider what would make the market start to pay attention to this metric.I believe that when the next recession hits the U.S. economy revenues at Expedia will decline. Most people already book travel online, so the industry tailwind of bookings coming online from offline will be much less pronounced than it was during the last recession. Travel for business and leisure will slow and Expedia will not be immune. When that happens, the deferred merchant bookings liability will begin to deflate. With that, Expedia's cash flow will decline. Expedia's cash flow will suffer from a double whammy - revenue declines leading to lower net income as well as a reversal of the inflows to cash from deferred merchant bookings from declining revenues. Could Expedia's cash flows from operations turn negative? I would argue that it easily could as the deferred merchant liability declines. At that point investors will begin to pay attention to Expedia's cash balance.I think Expedia could be a high beta short during and leading up to the next recession. That being said, I am not advocating for a short position today. A recession does not appear to be on the horizon in the U.S. But when one does hit (and one will eventually), I expect that absent some creative financial engineering, Expedia stock will get hit hard. If cash flow goes negative, that will lead to questions about Expedia's cash position, which could lead to a capital raise of some sort. This would only add fuel to the thesis that one should steer clear of this stock and likely short it. In the past the stock has had violent reactions to earnings misses. This shows the Q2 2013 earnings miss reaction. An equally violent move lower could come in the event of a rapid decline in travel brought on by a recession. That is why I view Expedia as a high beta short when the time is right. Obviously today is not the time to short the stock but at some point it will make a lot of sense. I welcome a healthy debate and for anyone to tell me why I am wrong here."
3553706,24157,2015-10-06T10:27:57-04:00,"Momentum stocks' run may be coming to an end and Expedia could be next.
        The company's history of acquisitions has not created true shareholder value.
        The Orbitz acquisition is more than priced in and shares have significant downside risk.","Investors chasing momentum stocks are playing a dangerous game. As a stock moves up, momentum increases, and investors pile in which drives the price higher. However, this momentum can change in the blink of an eye. After greatly outpacing the gains of the market over the past two years, we believe Expedia Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) could be the next momentum stock to see its run end. A mix of overvaluation and destruction of shareholder value lead Expedia into the Danger Zone this week.Expedia's Business Is Declining Despite EPS GrowthExpedia's share price is up more than 133% since 2010, which is nearly double the return of the S&P 500. However, as demonstrated in Figure 1, Expedia's after-tax profit (NOPAT) has declined 6% compounded annually over this same timeframe.Figure 1: Expedia's NOPAT Moving in the Wrong DirectionThe divergence between share price and profits is due to investors not understanding the shareholder value destruction resulting from Expedia's acquisition approach to growth. Since 2013, Expedia has acquired Trivago, Auto Escape, Wotif, and Travelocity for a total of $1.65 billion. Earlier this year, Expedia announced the purchase of Orbitz for $1.6 billion.These acquisitions have failed to create shareholder value as shown above, but EPS growth has masked this fact by growing at 18% compounded annually since 2010. The impact of an acquisition on a company's accounting earnings is not indicative of its economic value to shareholders, a point illustrated by the high-low fallacy.Since traditional analysts rarely discuss the cash flow impact of acquisitions, few investors are aware of their true costs. In the case of Expedia, acquisition-driven balance sheet expansion costs equaled approximately $4.43/share, an amount that should be deducted from 2014 earnings. In total, Expedia's economic earnings per share were -$1.17 in 2014, which falls well below the reported GAAP EPS of $2.99. Longer-term, Expedia has failed to generate positive economic earnings in any year since going public in 2005.Competitors are High Quality and High QuantityExpedia faces competition from a host of travel and lodging booking sites, hotels/airlines/car rentals' own websites, and large online travel agency Priceline (PCLN). Priceline also has been on an acquisition spree, but, unlike Expedia, it has done so in a more shareholder-friendly manner. Priceline maintains a top quintile ROIC of 54% and generates positive economic earnings.Just this year, Amazon launched its travel-booking site Amazon Destinations. While the service still focuses on a small client demographic, Amazon Destinations has access to a captive client base of 244 million consumers already using Amazon. Google also announced a new travel feature, Google Flights, earlier this year. Google Flights shows travel information immediately in Google search results, which allows consumers to compare airfares without ever leaving Google. One would be remiss to not point out non-traditional competition from the likes of Airbnb as well.A Rising Tide Doesn't Lift All BoatsMuch of the bull case behind Expedia relies upon its position in the travel booking industry. In late July, UBS estimated that a combined Expedia and Orbitz would have a 73% share of the U.S. online travel agency market. Additionally, the travel agency market is estimated to be a $1.3 trillion growing industry. However, simply occupying the space does not ensure success for Expedia. As shown above, its past history of acquisitions has not been successful in growing true cash flows and with more competition entering the market, further consolidation and margin compression is likely. To reach the profit levels bulls believe are possible, Expedia must execute its acquisition of Orbitz without further deterioration of already negative cash earnings, which does not appear possible unless the terms of the deal change drastically. The bigger problem for bulls is how much the current share price already implies Expedia's profits will grow. Put another way, the bigger problem for bulls is that the share price seems blinded by the EPS performance and oblivious to the negative economic performance of Expedia's business.Buyout Risk Seems MinimalIn the online travel agency market, the two largest players are Expedia and Priceline. As such, any merger action would likely come in the form of smaller acquisitions by these two. An acquisition of Expedia by Priceline, or vice versa, would certainly raise antitrust issues. Additionally, with over $2.9 billion in debt (17% of market cap) and an overvalued share price, we find it unlikely Expedia will be acquired.Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic AccountingWe have made several adjustments to Expedia's 2014 10-K. The adjustments are:Income Statement: we made $250 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing $42 million of unusual expenses (<1% of revenue). We removed $146 million related to non-operating expenses and $104 million in non-operating income.Balance Sheet: we made $5.9 billion of balance sheet adjustments to calculated invested capital with a net increase of $1.3 billion. The largest adjustment was the inclusion of $2.9 billion due to asset write-downs. This adjustment represented 62% of reported net assets.Valuation: we made $5.1 billion of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $1.9 billion. The largest adjustment to shareholder value was the removal of $670 million in minority interests. This liability represents 4% of Expedia's market cap.Valuation Is Overly OptimisticDespite the challenges noted above, Expedia has been one of the best performing stocks over the past few years. Price momentum has boosted the shares to dangerous levels when analyzed through the lens of a discounted cash flow model. To justify its current price of $124/share, Expedia must grow NOPAT by 16% compounded annually for the next 15 years. IBIS World estimates that the travel agency industry will grow by 2.3% compounded annually through 2020. Placing a bet on Expedia would mean that the company can grow its business significantly faster than the industry, which implies Expedia makes large market share gains while also improving margins. With no large competitors left to acquire, we find it hard to believe Expedia can organically take such significant market share.Even if Expedia is able to grow NOPAT by 10% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is worth $51/share today - a 59% downside.No matter how you slice the high expectations already embedded in the stock, it is clear the valuation of EXPE has more room to fall than rise.Merger Success Remains Large CatalystIn the short term, the biggest catalyst to Expedia's share price was the approval of the Orbitz merger. EXPE jumped 14% the day the merger was announced, and has risen in total 59% since the announcement. It would appear as if approval and subsequent operational success of the merger is already baked into the price, as shown above.Long-term, Expedia must fend off competition from every angle. Any signs of weakness or losing ground to incumbent Priceline, or newcomers, like Amazon, Google, or Airbnb could undermine the positive price momentum that has elevated the stock to such lofty heights.Short Interest Implies Some Have Realized Expedia's OvervaluationExpedia short interest stands at 11.6 million shares, which represent 9% of shares outstanding. While not as large as some other companies we've seen, it is apparent that a portion of investors have realized the troubles at Expedia.Executive Compensation Could Be More Shareholder FriendlyExecutives at Expedia receive base salaries, cash bonuses, and equity awards. The compensation committee has a wide range of factors on which they base cash bonuses and equity awards. These factors include business and financial performance, executives' individual performance, general economic conditions, and non-cash compensation as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA. We would much rather see Expedia have more specific goals for management, such as economic profits, rather than a general list of factors that determine executive compensation.Dangerous Funds That Hold EXPEThe following ETFs allocate significantly to EXPE and earn a Dangerous-or-worse rating.Disclosure: David Trainer and Kyle Guske II receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme."

[1] If we look into the past couple of years, the forerunners in the online travel space have been growing through acquisition. The rule in the OTA space seems to be: the bigger the scale and the more diversified the offerings, the higher the chances are of generating profitability. Expedia’s management believes that the consolidation in the online travel space will continue this year as well.The North American Online Travel Market ScenarioThe North American online travel market is forecast to grow at the slowest pace between 2012 to 2017, compared to other major economies, at 7% CAGR. Nevertheless, with estimated revenues of over $200 billion in 2013, it remains the biggest online travel market in the world and is expected to maintain an important position at least for the next few years. [2] About three-fourths of the North American online travel sales are generated in the U.S., where Expedia is the market leader with over 40% share of bookings.Expedia’s Position In The U.S. MarketExpedia might own up to 75% of the U.S. online travel market as a result of its Orbitz acquisition, according to the 2013 market shares provided by PhoCusWright. However, online travel agencies ((OTAs)) together account for 16% of total gross travel bookings from the U.S. [3]In this article, we talk about the market consolidation which Expedia might attain in North America after its Orbitz acquisition. We also talk about some of Expedia’s acquisitions that might positively impact Expedia’s stock price in the future.We have a price estimate of $103 for Expedia’s stock, which is at a slight discount to the current market price.Travelocity Acquisition Can Improve Advertisement Revenues (~10% Upside)In January 2015, Expedia acquired Travelocity for $280 million, from its parent company Sabre Corp. The acquisition is a progression from the 2013 strategic agreement between Expedia and Travelocity, wherein Expedia provided content, inventory, customer service, and technology to Travelocity’s U.S. and Canadian websites, while Travelocity focused on brand marketing and received a performance-based marketing fee. The acquisition pertains to Travelocity’s websites in the U.S. and Canada. Expedia intends to retain the Travelocity brand, alongside Expedia’s signature brands such as Hotels.com, Hotwire, Venere, and so on. The Travelocity brand name will further help Expedia in acquiring the former’s loyal customer base that approximately amounts to 20 million. [4] [5]Travelocity has 16% share in the U.S. OTA market, which Expedia has more or less captured through the partnership. Expedia is now ramping up media sales on Travelocity sites. Advertising and media is a high-growth, high-margin, and less capital intensive business, compared to the hotel and airline bookings business. [6] We believe that Expedia stands to gain more since it has not only eliminated some competition, but also created an additional distribution channel for itself. Further, the increased scale of operations after the acquisition is expected to help Expedia to negotiate better terms with inventory suppliers and deliver cost savings at the same time.We currently forecast Expedia’s advertising and media revenue to increase from around $450 million in 2014, to cross $1 billion by the end of our Trefis forecast period. However, if Travelocity helps boost the revenues from this segment even further in the future, to reach $2 billion by the end of our forecast period, then there can be a 10% upside to our price estimates for Expedia.Orbitz Acquisition Can Lead To Better EBITDA Margins For Hotel Booking (~15% Upside)In February 2015, Expedia announced its intention to acquire Orbitz Worldwide, the Chicago-based online travel agency (OTA) responsible for brands like Orbitz.com and Cheaptickets.com. Expedia expects the deal to close by the second half of 2015, once regulatory approvals are achieved. [7]Orbitz currently has $12 million in gross bookings. Also, the Orbitz partner network and Orbucks loyalty program would be beneficial for Expedia’s growth. Orbitz’s airfare search technology is one of the most advanced for combining fares across different airlines. These factors would propel an increased number of hotel partners and air ticket buyers on the Expedia platform, and eventually lead to a bigger scale for its operation. [8]Expedia’s partnering hotels might witness a rise of commissions which they pay to Expedia, with fewer OTAs available in the marketplace, after the Orbitz acquisition. Wotif, after being acquired by Expedia in 2014, is already increasing the commissions it charges to accommodation operators in Australia and New Zealand, from 12% to 15%. The hotels would also need to put in a greater effort to attract customers to directly book from their own websites. The clout of a consolidated OTA entity will be significantly greater.We currently forecast Expedia’s EBITDA margin on hotel bookings to gradually increase from around 17% in 2014 to around 18% by the end of our Trefis forecast period. However, the Orbitz acquisition and Expedia’s subsequent consolidation in North America (with an almost 75% market share in the U.S.) can help Expedia to charge higher hotel commissions. This might boost Expedia’s EBITDA margin on hotel bookings even further, to reach 19% by the end of our forecast period. Given that scenario, there can be an almost 15% upside to our price estimates for Expedia.Disclosure: None"

This caused the offer-to-bid spread to expand from 2% to 5% (the profit that we can earn if we buy Orbitz today and wait until the merger closes). This article reviews only the competition in this industry to assess the success of the merger. The fair value of Orbitz is not very important anymore since the merger has already been approved by shareholders.CompetitionThere are four main players in the US online travel agency (OTA) market: Expedia, Priceline (PCLN), Orbitz and Travelocity. According to research firm STR Global, these companies control about 95% market share.Expedia, the buyer group, enjoys a 40% market share, while Orbitz has about 20% market share in the US. The transaction would create a very big player with more than half the market. Honestly, only looking at the OTA market, this figure is high. In addition, international gross bookings of Orbitz are only 20% of the total gross bookings, so negotiations with the authorities might be tough.However, the travel industry (online and traditional) is very competitive. It has very low barriers to entry and so there are a number of players. The annual report of Expedia cites them:The competition is fierce and there are many new trends. For example, travel suppliers have focused recently on distributing through their own websites, offering advantages that OTA players cannot offer such as ""member-only fares, bonus miles or loyalty points."" On top of this, search engines such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Yahoo (YHOO) are creating their own tools to drive customers to these new websites created by suppliers. This is diminishing the OTA traffic. Orbitz explains this trend in its annual report:Finally, other big websites like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) or AirBnB offer online services that directly compete with the travel packages Orbitz sells.This fierce competition is pressuring the margins of both Expedia and Orbitz. The industry is maturing and consolidation is likely - a view shared by research firm PhoCusWright. In its report U.S. Online Travel Overview, it shows that ""the percentage of travel in the U.S. booked online currently stands around 39%"" and it is growing very modestly.How do we explain the spread?The main reason for the spread is the ""second request"". According to the book ""Merger Arbitrage"" by Thomas Kirchner, many second requests are resolved:In my opinion, this risk is overestimated by the market. The deal will not harm competition in the travel industry.In addition, termination fees are a very important and good prediction of success. Expedia's termination fee is $115 million in cash. This equals more than 8% of the market capitalization of Orbitz. I think Expedia will prefer to sell any of the brands of Orbitz (to get the antitrust approval) before paying this sum. Orbitz's termination fee is $57.5 million, which is also very high.Finally, there is one aspect that makes me like this deal. The CEO of Orbitz has worked for Expedia for seven years. I do not think the market is discounting this fact. The annual report of Orbitz reads:Investment summary and conclusionSecond requests take between four to six months to complete. The companies received the second request in March, so we expect the transaction to last three more months. In this case, the annualized return is massive - about 20% (5% absolute spread multiplied by 12 months and divided by the expected time to close, i.e. 3 months). Given that the downside is 29% (the expected loss if the merger fails, i.e. the premium paid by Expedia), the risk/reward ratio is very interesting.In conclusion, this merger is a very good opportunity. Both companies' CEOs will negotiate with the regulators to obtain a good deal, but given the fierce competition in the industry, the merger is the only way to survive."
3391535,32711,2015-08-03T15:01:11-04:00,"ELong has been dragging down Expedia's earnings for some time now.The latest quarterly report again showed how badly eLong is doing.Expedia's exit from the business will allow it and investors to focus more clearly on its core businesses, as well as boost the consolidated bottom line going into the second.","The news that Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) sold its stake in eLong, reported in May, was received positively by investors, and for good reason. Expedia's Chinese operations were putting a serious drag on the bottom line, and the company's Q2 results again underscore just how badly eLong was doing. The sale will allow Expedia to focus on its core OTA business, which is doing very well, and is on the whole likely to improve margins and earnings over the years to come.eLong ExitOn the 22nd of May, Expedia confirmed the sale of its 62.4% stake in eLong to a group of buyers including Chinese OTA powerhouse Ctrip. The transaction was worth $671 million, ending a 10-year relationship and abandoning management's previously stated ambition of turning the Chinese business around.Expedia's latest earnings report confirmed that the sale was a good move, as eLong's business continues to deteriorate following a trend that Expedia is unwilling or unable to reverse. Although the numbers were only reported up to the sale, they paint a grim picture.On top of a 19% decrease in bookings and a whopping 84% drop in revenue, eLong's adjusted EBITDA fell to a loss of $28.9 million from a gain of $7.6 million in the same period a year ago, while an already meager $0.3 million in operating income fell to a $45.5 million loss.This led to a 3% drop in adjusted EBITDA and a 30% drop in operating income for the combined company. It is likely that these drops would have been more severe if eLong's results had been included until the end of the reporting period. For some time now, Expedia has been reporting results excluding eLong in order to show the strength of its core business, which will from next quarter on thankfully no longer be necessary.Core business strengthExpedia's move to focus on its core businesses is a good one, as they are doing very well. Core OTA , which accounted for some 86% of revenue for the quarter, grew revenue by 15% for the quarter, on top of a 23% increase in bookings. Trivago continued its excellent growth run, revenue up 37% to now account for 8% of gross revenue.Excluding eLong's results, adjusted EBITDA would have risen by 12% for the period, and net income by 4%. Adjusted EPS of $0.89 meanwhile topped the $0.85 consensus quite easily.Looking ahead, the sale of eLong will provide some extra cushioning against forex swings, but the company's consolidated bottom line will also benefit year-over-year next quarter simply from the exclusion of eLong. Although the 2014 Q3 report doesn't break out eLong's results, eLong's own earnings report for the period showed the period's net loss widen from RMB50.4 million to RMB58.3 million.Overall, the company Expedia is still guiding for adjusted EBITDA growth of 10%-15% for the year, although management warned that costs related to the potential Orbitz acquisition could pressure results in the second half. On the other hand, the sale of eLong has allowed Expedia to lower its expectations for the full year effective tax rate to the mid-20% range.ConclusionFew doubted the wisdom of Expedia's decision to sell its majority stake in the struggling Chinese firm eLong, and Q2 results once again underscored how badly eLong was doing and the impact this had on the company's consolidated results. This move will allow the company to report results excluding eLong in earnest, which should boost the bottom line going forward as well as free up resources to invest in its core businesses, which continue to perform well."
3062256,24663,2015-04-11T12:00:07-04:00,"Cowen made a bullish call on EXPE, explaining the reason for its high P/E ratio.While EXPE's P/E ratio might be a top valuation metric among retail investors, it means little to the valuation of the company.Instead, see how EXPE measures in FCF against PCLN. It's quite telling.","Research firm Cowen increased Expedia's (NASDAQ:EXPE) price target by $25 to $115 last Thursday. The research firm gave numerous reasons why investors should disregard the stock's high P/E ratio of 27, in which Seeking Alpha summarized nicely. Cowen did however leave out one important piece of information to put this puzzle together.The one thing Cowen did not mention is Expedia's free cash flow compared to Priceline Group (PCLN). P/E ratios are popular metrics for valuation among retail investors, but are often misguided. From year to year, a company's outstanding shares can change. A company can have one-time item costs or can have a fluctuating tax rate that affects its P/E ratio. Free cash flow is a better reflection of how a company performs from year to year and of a company's true valuation.PCLN Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsFree cash flow is how much a company earns from its operations minus capital investments. Priceline Group is largely considered the superior company to Expedia, having a lower P/E ratio, higher operating margin, and more of a return on equity. Yet compared to each company's market capitalization, Expedia trades at almost half the P/FCF ratio as Priceline Group. This ratio informs investors that Expedia is not overpriced and that all the good things Cowen mentions apply to a very cheap company rather than an expensive one.The majority of Expedia's business lies in North America - Priceline's in other areas of the globe. Priceline might then seem like the better investment, but it is also almost twice as expensive, and in my opinion has made inferior growth investments in recent memory.We are yet to see Priceline's $2.5 billion acquisition of OpenTable become a big part of its business, and although its investment in Ctrip is often seen as promising, it is only a minority stake. Expedia's purchase of Travelocity and Orbitz makes the U.S. online travel market much less fragmented, establishing Expedia as the No. 1 company domestically. I also like the unique lodging options that Expedia's partnership with HomeAway creates and the expanded presence in Australia and New Zealand that its acquisition of Wotif Group creates. So Expedia has all the makings of a stock that's worth much more than 12.5x FCF, perhaps leaving more upside than even Cowen foresaw."
3375145,73185,2015-07-30T10:35:23-04:00,"Expedia, Inc. is nearing an acquisition of fellow online travel booking site Orbitz.The online travel industry is in a period of high growth and is projected to continue.Despite a highly competitive industry, we see upside in Expedia after the merger with Orbitz.","On May 27th, Orbitz (NYSE:OWW) shareholders approved a $1.3 billion takeover by Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE). The proposed merger between the two companies would combine two of the largest players in the online travel industry.The online travel industry is in a period of high growth. In 2013, online travel sales were estimated to be growing 12% annually. Many expect double-digit growth to continue, as online travel sales are estimated to only make up 13% of the global travel industry. It is estimated that Expedia and main competitor Priceline (PCLN) have about 30% of the global online travel agency each, with Orbitz behind at 8%. After these companies, the online travel booking market is highly fragmented and competitive.The online travel market is essentially turning into a battle of acquisitions between Expedia and Priceline. Over the past three years alone, Expedia has acquired majority stakes or full control of Trivago, Auto Escape, Wotif, and Travelocity. Including the impending acquisition of Orbitz, Expedia has chosen to expand their business by building an ecosystem of valuable brands through acquisitions. Priceline has also aggressively pursued acquisitions, including Kayak.com, OpenTable, and Booking.com.There is a key strategic difference between the two companies. Expedia's acquisitions are related mostly to booking services, while Priceline's acquisitions target more peripheral travel services, such as meta-search (Kayak) and restaurant reservation booking (OpenTable). Essentially, Expedia is trying to capture the booking market while Priceline is trying to grow in the peripheries of the travel industry. In the near term, both strategies are valid as the online travel agent industry continues to mature.While Expedia is currently competing with Priceline, other major players are looking to enter into the online travel industry. Earlier this year, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched Amazon Destinations. However, we expect it to take time for Amazon to establish significant market share. That being said, Amazon does have some competitive advantages over Expedia. Most notably is the size of the Amazon ecosystem, which consists of 285 million active users. Assuming Amazon is able to build a functional product, Amazon Destinations could pull active Amazon users who use Expedia back to their own ecosystem for travel related purchases. Another advantage for Amazon is its commission structure. Reportedly, Amazon is charging 15% commission to hotels, compared to the industry standard of 20-25%. This provides a financial incentive for hotels to partner with Amazon as opposed to Expedia or Priceline.Despite the incredibly competitive market, we see upside in Expedia. We believe the merger with Orbitz will add strategic value to the company, and we value a post-acquisition Expedia stock at $119 per share.Our model for EXPE, assuming the acquisition is approved in the back half of this year and effects are realized in FY16, can be seen below.Using our forecasted EPS, a 1% perpetuity rate, and a CAPM discount rate, we arrive at a fair value for EXPE of $119 per share. We thus believe that approval of the Orbtiz acquisition adds roughly $12 per share of value to EXPE."
3132196,32711,2015-05-03T02:55:34-04:00,"Investors shrugged off a bottom line miss from Expedia, focusing rather on strong bookings growth and market share gains.However, the company's spending currently outpaces revenue growth, and its Chinese operations remain very problematic.As such, it is likely that there will be continued pressure on the bottom line this fiscal year.","Online travel booking is booming. Most of the major players in the industry are recording double-digit revenue growth on the back of solid bookings. Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) is one of the companies that has managed to benefit most of all, and it continues to expand as demand continues to rise unabated. Its Q1 report marked another improvement in terms of market share, and while the company posted a loss in operating income exacerbated by eLong, investors cheered the numbers and sent the stock up some 8% following the release. Still, without much clarity on when eLong's operations will improve, and spending outpacing revenue growth, bottom line concerns remain.Solid bookingsAlthough the effective tax rate as well as Forex headwinds negatively impacted earnings, the underlying business looks solid as ever judging from bookings growth, at least when you exclude China. Gross bookings were up 19%, driving a 14% increase in overall revenue for the period. Excluding negative currency effects, these figures would have been 25% and 23% respectively.Room nights looked particularly good, up 32% compared to a 24% increase in the same period a year ago, which is good news as hotels account for some two-thirds of overall revenue. By segment, core OTA continued to grow at a solid clip, sales up 17%, while trivago was easily the fastest growing segment with a 43% increase in revenue.Remaining competitive in an intense discounting environment is however leading to higher expenses, and with it, putting pressure on the bottom line. For the period, Expedia reported an operating loss of $51 million including China, compared to a $3 million operating loss last year. This led to an adjusted loss per share of $0.03, while analysts were expecting a profit of $0.09 per share. Excluding China, the company delivered an operating loss of $10.9 million. Still, investors shrugged off the miss, apparently focusing on bookings.In order to maintain its growth in market share, the company is spending heavily on advertising, total sales & marketing up to nearly 70% of core OTA revenue for an increase of around 500 basis points or 22% year-over-year. Meanwhile, SG&A expenses rose 17% Y/Y. Overall, spending is outpacing revenue growth, which is expected to continue as competitive headwinds remain.China challengesThe Chinese online travel environment is an intensely competitive one. ELong has in fact described the market as ""hyper-competitive"", as companies like Ctrip continue to dominate the space. While accounting for some 20% consolidated room nights, it only accounted for 2.5% of revenue for the period, and continues to lose money. In Q1, the operating loss ballooned to $40.1 million from $7.9 million a year ago, due to aggressive investments in technology and marketing.Again, investors seemed to shrug this off, as the company's consistent presentation of data ""Ex-China"" actually looks pretty good. The impact on the bottom line was tangible in Q1, however, and at some point investors are going to start wondering when an improvement will materialize in the company's China operations. Although it is only a small chunk of consolidated revenue, it seems to be putting a disproportionate amount of strain on the overall bottom line, and this is something to keep in mind going forward. At the same time, investments are seeing diminishing returns, room nights growth slowing to 34% from 43% a year ago.ConclusionInvestors cheered Expedia's Q1 report, glossing over the operating loss to focus on the company's underlying bookings growth, which was strong. However, several headwinds remain, as the company's spending outpaces revenue growth in order to keep gaining market share. At the same time, the company's Chinese operations remain intensely problematic, with high spending and a ballooning operating loss continuing to weigh on the overall bottom line."
2994966,39791,2015-03-13T08:09:25-04:00,"Valuation seems expensive and stock is trading near its 52-week high.Though there has been an improvement in the top line growth, the bottom line is affected from high costs.Fierce competition from Priceline and poor performance of its Chinese operations are major concerns.","Expedia Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) is amongst the largest travel companies globally, with 150 travel booking websites running in more than 70 countries. The company, which was launched by a small division in Microsoft in 1996 has become one of the largest online travel operators (OTAs) in the world now. Expedia owns many travel related websites, which help customers research, plan and book not only their travel, but also their stay and leisure activities. However, given the fierce competition and stock overvaluation I would recommend investors to stay away from the stock.What does Expedia doExpedia earns its revenue mainly through travel bookings, hotel bookings, car rentals and advertising. Its core portfolio consists of four distinct segments - OTA group, eLong, Trivago and Egencia. It owns brands like Expedia.com, Hotels.com, hotwire.com, venere.com, trivago.com under its umbrella. Brands Expedia and Hotels.com are the most popular ones, belonging to the OTA group. eLong is another website by Expedia, which is popular in China and Trivago helps boost its media presence. TripAdvisor is their largest metasearch partner overall. Egencia enables corporate travel business.Expedia Risks1) Entry barriers are not high - Expedia faces competition from not only similar peers in the industry like Priceline (PCLN), but also other smaller websites which are making inroads into this segment. Though the bigger companies are gobbling up the smaller ones, newer nimbler players keep on entering the industry. Also there are many country specific websites, which are more acquainted with the local trends and customs and they pose a threat to the international ones. Expedia's eLong is facing threat from China's local websites. In India, MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT), Yatra are very popular and pose a threat to Expedia. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has also ventured in the travel industry by launching its own flight search tool in India. Thus the competition is growing. Expedia has to face competition not only from the existing ones in the industry, but also from new entrants venturing into the industry.2) Expansion into other markets not bearing results - Expedia is present not only in its core market of USA, but also other markets in Australia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. It derived 47% of its total revenues in 2014 from its international market. Compare this to 88% for Priceline. The company is making efforts to increase its foothold in China, where it is facing fierce competition from the local websites. eLong is facing headwinds in the Chinese market and is generating losses for the company. eLong EBITDA was a negative $27 million.3) Increasing Cost base - The company is incurring higher spends for media and advertising. Costs are also increasing in acquiring smaller competitors and to get new customers. It will have to incur extra costs to integrate Orbitz and Travelocity into its system operation. The total costs in 2014 increased 22% when compared to the previous year.4) Stock is Overvalued - Expedia shares are overvalued. The stock is currently trading at $88.95, which is very near to its 52-week high price of $89.9. Expedia's valuation seems to be expensive with a P/E of 17.7x, compared to Priceline's at 16.3x. Also EXPE's P/B of 6.3x is quite expensive, when compared to the industry's average of 2.7x. The company has a market capitalisation of $11.3 billion. Though the stock gave 16.8% returns in the last one year, the stock price has been quite volatile throughout the year. Expedia has underperformed its main competitor Priceline by a wide margin over the last 5 years.Source: Google Finance5) Outlook does not look bright - ""We are expecting a deceleration in revenue growth in 2015 on headwinds from Travelocity implementation, further impact from the reduction of our hotel margins, the negative impact of foreign currency and the continued success of our loyalty programs,"" stated Expedia's CFO Mark Okerstrom in the Q4 CC transcript.Expedia Upside RisksConclusionThough the EXPE stock price has increased since the last time I wrote about this stock, I still think that the stock is overvalued. The company suffers strong competition from Priceline and has been unsuccessful in China. Expedia's EPS declined for the year due to lower margins, which are not expected to improve in the near future as well. Expedia is not very optimistic about its 2015 revenue growth and fears a reduction in their hotel margins. Also there would be integration costs for the new websites, which will further shoot up costs. PCLN on the other hand, has been more consistent in its performance and has been steadily increasing its profits. With Expedia stock being almost at its peak now, I would recommend investors to exit and look for other options like Priceline to play the OTA market."
2980256,83336,2015-03-06T11:27:05-05:00,"Expedia has recently acquired two of its major competitors, Travelocity and Orbitz.Expedia has been rapidly increasing its share in a growing web-based travel agency business.Having adopted two very loyal client bases from its competitors, Expedia will conglomerate resources, cut out waste and duplicated departments, and grow in value.","Expedia operates an online travel agency, offering hotel and car rentals, vacation packages, and cruise booking among other related services. It is based in Bellevue, Washington and has been included in the Forbes list of 400 best-managed companies. The company has partnerships with over 325,000 hotels in more than sixty countries worldwide. This is compared to leading competitor Priceline with around 200,000 hotel partnerships worldwide despite currently having five times the market share. Priceline is currently Expedia's major competitor after Expedia purchased Travelocity and Orbitz for $280M and $1.3B respectively early this year. In addition to Travelocity and Orbitz, Expedia also owns the following brands: hotels.com, hotwire, trivago, carrentals.com, venere.com (specific to the European market), and several others.Expedia posted solid ROE numbers at 26% pre-tax and 22% post-tax last year. Priceline boasted a higher ROE of 31%, yet this number has been on a steady and significant decline of 26% over the past four years. I expect this trend to continue into the future.With Expedia's newest acquisitions, the company adopts new, loyal client bases while being able to eliminate certain roles and processes formerly performed by each company independently. This benefit to efficiency will give Expedia a further advantage in addition to its access to new consumers. Expedia did have a slightly high long-term debt to equity ratio of .98 in 2014 after numbers around .5 the three years prior, but this is predominantly due to the company's purchase of treasury stock, a good indicator of executives having good future expectations for the corporation's direction. With a market cap of 11.68B it is 18% of the market cap of Priceline's 64.9B. Expedia's enterprise multiple of 15.4x is significantly lower than Priceline's at 19.4x, implying that it could be an undervalued stock in comparison to Priceline. Expedia also has an EPS of 2.99 and cash flow per share of 10.7, a good indication of high quality earnings.A drawback that comes with the stock is the stock's dividend yield. With a dividend yield at less than 1%, this stock may lose some luster to investors looking to fortify their existing incomes with quarterly dividend payments. Although in the past five years Expedia has been successful in paying common stock holders at least four times per year and never at a decreasing rate. Another potential risk factor is a poor earnings performance from recently acquired Travelocity and Orbitz. However I do not see this happening, as both already possess loyal customer bases, and with less competition in the market place, Expedia should have more flexibility and upside in its pricing.I believe going long Expedia offers more potential upside than downside in an established but growing industry. There are fewer competitors in the market to engage in price competition with Expedia, and I believe its array of branded companies will lead to long-term success in the years to come.I suggest going long Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) on today's market at its current trading price of $92.18 per share. Expedia is in a young, growing industry with yet-to-be recognized upside, all while benefiting from a steadily growing economy. The upside of this industry is a takeover of the travel agency industry by web-based companies. Expedia and similar sites have experienced, on average a 177.5% increase in revenues over the last five years and a 371.5% average increase of market cap in that same time. With a recovering economy resulting in optimism to push travel and an increasingly technologically based world, this trend among web-based travel agencies should not stop in the near future. Expedia has been gaining ground on its larger competitor, Priceline (PCLN), through a recent acquisition of competitor Travelocity and a later announced planned purchase of still larger competitor Orbitz at about 9x EBITDA. Expedia has shown steady growth in return on equity while Priceline has experienced a steady four-year decline in the same category.Analysts predict around a 10% growth rate of Expedia over the next two years. However, I think this is a conservative estimate underplaying the role a reviving/growing economy will have on Expedia, which thrives on expendable income and economic confidence. This is also a day and age where internet based purchases and planning are growing every day. Online travel planning will continue to develop into a business that could fully replace traditional travel agencies all together. These changing business environments combined with the recent horizontal integrations will cause Expedia's share price to rise as the business it is in continues to generate higher sales with an expanding customer base."
3209236,69675,2015-05-26T10:39:53-04:00,"Shares of Expedia popped up after news broke that it was selling its stake in eLong, a Chinese travel company.The sale may look odd because of China's large market, but with the fundamentals of eLong looking poor, it was actually an amazing move at a nice price.With the sales, it seems Expedia is caring less about growth and is now beginning to shift more toward margin improvement, something this cash will likely help with moving forward.","Shares of Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) closed up nearly 7% on May 22nd after touching a fresh 52-week high in response to the company selling its majority stake in Chinese travel company eLong (NASDAQ:LONG) to Ctrip.com (CTRP) along with some other investors. While this move does cut down on the company's exposure to China, what is viewed as a large and growing market, I believe the company's decision was an intelligent one that will allow it to create more value in the long run than it would likely have gained from holding onto the firm.A look at the dealAccording to Expedia's press release, the company sold its 62.4% stake in eLong for $671 million. Based on the terms of the deal, this values all of eLong at approximately $1.08 billion, which represents a more than 33% premium over the $22.44 per share the business closed at after news of the transaction broke. Unfortunately, this does cut down Expedia's exposure to China directly since eLong connected travelers with over 218,000 locations in the region, but the business did strike a deal that will allow them to operate together in order to create attractive travel packages for customers of both platforms.As a result of this transaction, Expedia should see its cash pile rise meaningfully. According to the company's most recent quarterly report, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.74 billion so, if nothing else has changed materially, the company's cash and cash equivalents should now stand around $2.41 billion (before factoring in taxes from the sale). This represents almost 17% of the company's overall market capitalization and should allow management to grow the enterprise further.Another positive aspect of the deal is that it helps Expedia's bottom line and cuts its exposure to an investment that has struggled to generate a profit. While over the past three years, eLong has seen its sales rise nearly 46% up to $175.06 million, the business has been generating annual net losses. In 2014 alone, the company lost $43.35 million, about 60% higher than its loss a year earlier and far greater than the modest gain the company recorded for its 2012 fiscal year.A catalyst for future growthWith its purchase of Orbitz Worldwide (NYSE:OWW) for $1.34 billion, Expedia is becoming an even more meaningful player. As a result of the purchase, the company's revenue (using 2014's metrics and assuming that operating results remain unchanged) should rise by 16.2% from $5.76 billion to $6.69 billion and its gross bookings should increase by 24.6% from $50.45 billion to $62.88 billion. This will set the stage for it to finally measure up against The Priceline Group (PCLN), whose sales in 2014 were $8.44 billion with gross bookings of $50.30 billion.Gross Profit MarginWhile, from a size standpoint, Expedia is now able to stand up as an equal (or near equal) with Priceline, the company still has a long ways to go if it wants to be as profitable as its peer. In 2014, Priceline came out on top of its peer group in terms of gross profit margin with a metric of 89.8%. This represents a meaningful improvement over the 77.6% the company reported just two years earlier and is far higher than Expedia, whose gross profit margin rose from 77.7% to 79.5% over this time frame. Even Orbitz and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) (through its Groupon Getaways) have done better, with gross profit margins in 2014 of 80.7% and 84.2%, respectively.In an effort to grow its business, management at Expedia has willingly accepted lower margins on its services for years and, based on its gross bookings, this strategy has worked quite well. Now, however, this shift away from eLong appears to be indicating that the company is planning to expand its margins now that its size has grown large enough to be on the same ground as Priceline. Assuming the company can do this without alienating its customer base, this should be a boon to business, some of which can be further fueled by the monetization of its unprofitable eLong investment.TakeawayMoving forward, it will be very interesting to see how things progress with Expedia. The company made, in my opinion, a wise move by divesting itself of eLong and it's likely that the company can make good use of the cash it will receive from the deal. Ultimately, the business will have to focus more on margin expansion in the future if it wants to be held in the same light as Priceline but I don't think that investors will have to wait too long for that since this sale seems to indicate a shift in focus that will attempt to prioritize profits over growth down the road."
2911176,24276,2015-02-12T10:37:20-05:00,"Expedia has now bought out two competitors in as many months, as consolidation in travel increases.The company is not yet big enough to be a threat to industry leader Priceline.Priceline reports next week, and is likely to blow past earnings estimates. That's the buy.","Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) has done its second buyout of a competitor in 2015, announcing it will buy Orbitz (NYSE:OWW) for $12/share, or $1.6 billion in cash.This followed last month's purchase of Travelocity from Sabre (NASDAQ:SABR), for $280 million.The moves illustrate just how quickly the travel business has transformed in the age of the Internet. Travel agencies, which depended on computer connections to systems like Sabre, were quickly replaced in the 1990s by self-service systems like Expedia. Innovation in business models like Priceline (PCLN) quickly followed, followed by ancillary systems advising travelers on their choices, like TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), and comparison sites like Kayak, now part of Priceline.This new industry is now in heavy consolidating mode, but Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi insists it remains fragmented, with Expedia and Priceline holding just 15% of the market between them. TripAdvisor zoomed 13% overnight on strong earnings, but also on speculation that it may make a nice meal for Priceline, with its $55 billion market cap.While the quick succession of deals may have some bears smelling an antitrust problem, Priceline is still killing the competition. In addition to its main site, it owns Booking.com, the Expedia of Europe, as well as Travelweb, Lowestfare and OpenTable, which it bought last year. If you're looking for further consolidation in this space, look outside travel toward longer-term stay specialists like HomeAway (NYSEARCA:AWAY-OLD) and food sites like Yelp (NYSE:YELP) valued at just a few billion dollars each.As to which travel giant to buy, the answer to me is simple: Priceline. Expedia is going to incur real costs integrating Orbitz and Travelocity into its operations, costs that those bidding up the stock underestimate. Khosrowshahi insists its units are run separately, but they do share data and best practices, and, now, accounting. No two systems are alike. Software has to be written and tested. The old systems work in the meantime, but Expedia's costs are going to rise. It is not going to get ""oligopoly profits"" from the consolidation, meaning consumers still have a lot of choices, and Priceline already has a lower Price/Earnings multiple.Should you be looking at this space at all? Yes, because travel and entertainment are growing thanks to lower gas prices. Priceline reports fourth-quarter earnings next Thursday, and the whisper number is for earnings of $5.36/share, the official number is $5.27, but with just 53 million shares outstanding, that comes to just $284 million, which would be its lowest figure of the year. Even given some integration costs from OpenTable, Priceline has made a habit of surprising to the upside, and next week may carry a big surprise indeed.If you're into the space, in other words, now is the time to buy."

The acquisition (which is a progression from the 2013 strategic agreement between Expedia and Travelocity) pertains to Travelocity’s websites in the U.S. and Canada [1]Sabre had already entered an agreement to sell Travelocity Europe, better known as LastMinute.com, for $120 million to Switzerland-based Bravofly. The deal is expected to close in the next few months, subject to regulatory approvals. [2]In August 2013, Expedia inked a strategic marketing agreement with rival Travelocity. Under terms of the deal, Expedia provided content, inventory, customer service and technology to Travelocity, while Travelocity focused on brand marketing and received a performance-based marketing fees. The agreement pertained only to Travelocity’s websites in the U.S. and Canada. Expedia’s technology platform began powering Travelocity’s U.S. website in Q1 2014. The Canadian website was migrated to the new platform in May 2014. [3] To know further details of the deal, read our article: Expedia Is Better Positioned For Growth After The Travelocity Deal.The 2013 agreement between Expedia and Sabre, provided Expedia with the option to acquire certain assets from Travelocity at a later date. Sabre entered into the agreement in order to mitigate the losses and expenses it was incurring due to Travelocity. Expedia will gain a greater market share, primarily in North America, as a result of this acquisition. [4]The acquisition will have a positive impact on both the companies. Sabre, the company that owns Travelocity, has a debt laden balance sheet and it is looking for ways to erase some of that. It sold Travelocity’s business travel arm to BCD Travel in 2013, and raised $600 million through an IPO (initial public offering) in April 2014 to reduce a portion of the $3 billion debt. Additionally, Travelocity announced two rounds of lay-offs in 2013 and its CEO, Carl Sparks, left the company in May 2014. Hence, Travelocity, which was globally one of the largest online travel company in the past, was acquired for just $280 million. To add some context, this amount was only $80 million more than what TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) paid for tour provider Viator.Expedia intends to retain the Travelocity brand, alongside Expedia’s signature brands such as Hotels.com, Hotwire, Venere, and so on. The Travelocity brand name will further help Expedia in acquiring the former’s loyal customer base that approximately amounts to 20 million. [5]We discuss below several points regarding how the deal will impact Expedia.We have a price estimate of $84 for Expedia’s stock, which is at a slight discount to the current market price.Expedia’s Current Position In The U.S. Online Travel Market SpaceThe North American online travel market is forecast to grow at the slowest pace compared to other economies such as Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. Nevertheless, with estimated revenues of over $200 billion in 2013, it remains the biggest online travel market in the world and is expected to maintain an important position at least for the next few years. [6] About three-fourths of the North American online travel sales are generated in the U.S., where Expedia is the market leader with over 40% share of bookings. Priceline (PCLN) controls about 16% of the U.S. online travel agency (OTA) market, but has been aggressively trying to pare Expedia’s lead through: 1) heavy brand advertising; 2) establishing partnerships that power bookings; and, 3) the acquisition of Kayak in 2013. All action were intended to increase the visibility of Priceline’s brands in the domestic market. To counter these competitive thrusts from rival Priceline, Expedia inked a strategic marketing agreement with Travelocity in 2013.How Has The Travelocity Partnership Helped Expedia’s Growth So Far? The deal with Travelocity yielded better than expected results for Expedia in the first nine months of 2014. The company displayed a 22% year-on-year increase in revenues for the first nine months of 2014, to $4.4 billion. The key factors propelling this growth were the healthy performance of the hotel room nights and air tickets segments.The company sold close to 136 million rooms globally, exhibiting a 25% year-on-year growth and Travelocity accounted for 4% of that growth. The hotel bookings business is Expedia’s most important and accounts for nearly 70% of our valuation for the company. The effect on air ticket volume growth was even more pronounced. About 30% more air tickets were sold by Expedia, of which 18% were contributed by Travelocity.  Travelocity has 16% share in the U.S. OTA market which Expedia has more or less captured through the partnership. Expedia is now ramping up media sales on Travelocity sites. Advertising and media is a high-growth, a high-margin and less capital intensive business, compared to the hotel and airline bookings business. [8] We believe that Expedia stands to gain more since it has not only eliminated some competition but also created an additional distribution channel for itself. Further, the increased scale of operations after the acquisition may help Expedia to negotiate better terms with inventory suppliers and deliver cost savings at the same time.Business Rationale For Expedia Buying TravelocityTravelocity is merely responsible for marketing its brand and Expedia does not have much visibility into the marketing strategy, according to the latter’s Q1 earnings call. [8] Therefore, it might make more sense for Expedia to completely integrate Travelocity and have an cohesuve ecosystem rather than segregate one unit from the others. Expedia has demonstrated its strength in the U.S. by building a formidable market share. The company could replicate or slightly tweak its successful strategy to grow the Travelocity brand in the country.Disclosure: None"
2634805,32711,2014-11-04T07:32:45-05:00,"Expedia continues to deliver excellent earnings and revenue growth.While the stock is richly priced, this isn't unusual for a high-growth company.As it continues to invest in its business, earnings as well as share price should continue to rise.","Some industries aren't faring particularly well during an uneven recovery. Many consumer discretionary categories have been under pressure as cash-strapped consumers cut back on their spending. However, some discretionary industries are in great shape. Online travel booking is booming, at least, judging by Expedia's (NASDAQ:EXPE) latest earnings report. The company smashed expectations, showing impressive growth across most of its markets.Bookings strengthThe well-known online booking network delivered some red-hot numbers for its third quarter. Revenue rose 22% year-over-year to $1.71 billion, beating calls for $1.68 billion. EPS excluding items of $1.93 soared 35% year-over-year and smashed the $1.74 consensus estimate.Bookings continue to grow at a rapid pace. Gross bookings rose 29% to $13.5 billion for the period. Revenue from hotel bookings, a category that accounts for nearly three quarters of the company's overall sales, increased by 21%. These results indicate that demand is very healthy for travel-related services.Geographically, the domestic business outperformed year-over-year with revenue up 23.8%, while the international business grew by 20.3%. By segment, leisure customers continued to supply the lion share of revenue. This segment grew by 23% year-over-year. The corporate segment grew by around 14%.Both Hotel and Air, the company's two main product categories, grew by 21% year-over-year. Room nights were up 24%, partially offset by a 2% drop in revenue per night. Ticket volumes rose by 28%, but prices here were also a drag, revenue per ticket down by 7%. Despite some of these pricing headwinds, the company managed to increase its pro forma gross margin 221 basis points year-over-year to 82.5%.Still, there are some concerns. Some international markets are showing signs of a slowdown, most notably China. According to management, China's travel market is ""fiercely competitive"", with several players significantly increasing their investments. As a result, Expedia too will be stepping up its spending on eLong, which is expected to lead to higher losses for the Chinese travel website in Q3 and going into fiscal 2015.Despite the strong results, the company's isn't resting on its laurels. Expedia will continue to invest in improving its platforms, growing its media and advertising business, investing in marketing and continuing its search for potentially lucrative M&A opportunities in the space.ValuationsAlthough the stock is richly priced, it is not outrageously expensive. Expedia trades at a fairly lofty 34.5 times trailing earnings, well above the 26 industry average, but the forward P/E is less daunting at around 18. Meanwhile, the price-to-sales is considerably lower than the 2.67 industry average at 1.96, while revenue and earnings growth is extremely robust. For a stock with this kind of continued growth, the stock seems to be trading at a more or less fair valuation.ConclusionExpedia came out with another big quarter, smashing expectations and delivering impressive double-digit earnings and revenue growth. Although some international markets are slowing down, continued investment should solidify its position in rapidly expanding areas such as China. The company has a great competitive position in the domestic market, and should be able to bolster this lead with intelligent marketing and cost control. In terms of valuation, the stock seems fairly valued, but could still see further upside with revenue and earnings momentum."
2846066,23479,2015-01-23T18:08:33-05:00,"Expedia announced the release of two new products called Real Time Feedback and Sell Tonight - tools which will be useful for both travelers and hoteliers.Priceline's accommodation site, Booking.com, announced the launch of Booking Now - a mobile application that aims at providing a customized booking experience to its users.The application releases by the two online travel behemoths point toward the importance of quick-turnaround bookings, primarily completed on the mobile platform.","On January 13, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) announced the release of two new products called Real Time Feedback and Sell Tonight - tools which will be useful for both travelers and hoteliers. The products are currently available in test markets in the U.S. and will be gradually introduced on a global scale later this year. The products are latest features added to the hotel-facing tool suite called Expedia PartnerCentral (EPC).Real Time Feedback's target audience are mobile-savvy travelers. The product is designed on the basis of feedback from hoteliers who wished to gain more support from Expedia in securing positive hotel reviews. The real time interface sends an email or notification via mobile application to a guest, shortly after the guest checks into an Expedia.com-booked hotel. The email/notification contains three questions: ""How was your check in?"", ""How is your room?"" and ""Are you happy with the location?"" Guests are encouraged to provide specific feedback, which are transmitted in real time to the hotelier via Expedia PartnerCentral. The hotelier gets the opportunity to act upon the feedback, thereby avoiding a potential negative trip review from the traveler later on.The other product, Sell Tonight (accessible via Expedia PartnerCentral), allows hoteliers to push out same day rates and availability to Expedia.com and Hotels.com customers through the customers' mobile applications. The product also informs hoteliers about the same day rates prevalent in their markets, hence making the hoteliers better equipped to compete and increase the same day bookings. Expedia's investment in technology was to the tune of $650 million for twelve months ending September 30, 2014. [1]We have a price estimate of $84 for Expedia's stock, almost in line with its current market price.Priceline's Booking.com Launches Booking Now: On January 15, Priceline's (PCLN) accommodation site, Booking.com, announced the launch of Booking Now - a mobile application that aims at providing a customized booking experience to its users by utilizing user behavior data and GPS technology. The application is currently available for download in the U.S. in Apple's App Store but will gradually be rolled out globally. The application platform will comprise of over 580,000 properties across the globe and provide custom accommodation recommendations for spontaneous travelers wishing to book accommodations within 48 hours. Booking Now personalizes real time search results for travelers based on the profile they create on the website, with specific preferences such as desired price range and options like parking, breakfast and Wi-Fi. Booking Now suggestions also can be based on the user's current street location anywhere in the world. [2]Priceline would offer stiff competition to brands such as Hotel Tonight with its Booking Now. Hotel Tonight popularized the concept of same day bookings in 2010 and enjoyed huge growth ever since, along with $80 million funding. Although there were competitors who tried to gain market share, Hotel Tonight never before experienced competition from such a formidable adversary like Priceline. [3]We have a price estimate of $1108 for Priceline's stock, which is at a 10% premium to the current market price.The application releases by the two online travel behemoths point toward the importance of quick-turnaround bookings, primarily completed on the mobile platform. Expedia and Priceline both seem to understand that the present day traveler needs to book services at a very short notice, and also, that travelers expect the ubiquitous presence of the online travel agencies at every stage of the booking process and even thereafter. Hence, embracing these aspects are of crucial importance for gaining competitive edges in the marketplace.Hence, some of the trends that will rule the online travel market in 2015 seem to emerge from these early application releases. These trends are discussed below:According to Forrester Research, the market for mobile payments in the U.S. will expand from $52 billion in 2014 to $142 billion by 2019. Also, in terms of smartphone ownership, only 19% of U.S. consumers owned a smartphone in 2009. The percentage increased to 66% in 2014. [4] Hence, if we assume the majority of smartphone owners make mobile transactions, then such applications such as Booking Now and Sell Tonight become really crucial in expanding the user base and increasing the number of transactions for the online travel agencies.In this fast paced world, travel booking is not always a leisurely or planned process, wherein consumers book itineraries months in advance. Travelers are looking for hotels or flights just hours before their journey. On the other hand, there are hoteliers who want to offload excess inventory at the best possible prices. Hence, the online travel agencies are taking on the role of matchmakers: they're matching both the demand and supply and in turn, increasing their own profitability.The intense competition in the online travel space is good news for customers, whereas for the online travel companies this implies that constant innovation and upgradation of services is the trick to stay ahead of the competition. Users expect better service from the online travel agencies, and this includes a seamless end-to-end experience - from the time they book travel related services until the completion of their journeys. Hence, an application like Real Time Feedback gives the traveler the benefit of better services, and it also provides hotels the chance to avoid being negatively reviewed. Both the hoteliers and users are presented with a better travel and service experience.Disclosure: No positions."
2816706,72385,2015-01-13T09:36:22-05:00,"Priceline and Expedia are positioned to benefit from any drops in airfares.The companies are also, barring a global slowdown, likely to benefit from increasing tailwinds in the BRICS countries.The online travel agency space is crowded and many of the players, like Google and TripAdvisor, are established.","The conventional wisdom is that the airline stocks will benefit from the drop in oil prices. But Priceline (PCLN), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), and all of the players in the online travel agency industry ought also to benefit. Priceline and Expedia are online booking sites and the main players today in the online travel agency (OTA) industry. Their competitors include travel search websites like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), daily deal sites like Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), social media companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and airlines and individual hotels who sell directly to customers.The macro trends are favorable for these companies because of the drop in oil and also because of the ever-increasing role of travel in our lives. We travel these days for leisure, business, recreation, and countless other reasons. Will we travel more because of the drop in crude? Perhaps. Airlines so far have not been dropping their fares, so it is not clear whether the fuel savings will be transferred to the airline customers. In the United States, Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) has been calling for a federal investigation from the Department of Transportation into the fact that the price of airplane fuel has dropped but the price of airline tickets has not. This might, of course, be grandstanding on Schumer's part. If the government does pressure airlines in some way to drop their prices, expect to see that savings transferred to consumers. Additionally, we have not yet seen discount airlines like Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) or JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) breaking ranks and offering special deals either. Any declaration by them of a fuel-based airfare discount is likely to lead to discount announcements by the other airlines as well. The takeaway point, at any rate, is that the online travel agencies will only see this increased traffic if the airlines drop fares to reflect the lower cost of fuel.In addition to this possible short-term catalyst, there are also more fundamental dynamics to think about. One bullish thing that investors often overlook when they see the crowded OTA space is that Priceline and Expedia benefit from a network effect in that the more customers they have, the more travel providers they can attract and so on. They have substantial first-mover advantage over startups for this reason. The long-term technology trends are favorable to these companies as well. The rise of the OTA industry has been its own accelerator: consumers all across the world are increasingly bypassing middlemen and acting as their own travel agents. The comparable rates algorithms are easy to use and intuitive in their results. Mobile adoption rates continue to be strong in this space around the world.In spite of their recent share price struggles, the general narratives of Priceline and Expedia are unchanged: the companies are still growing relatively rapidly - especially in the world's developing markets. The OTA world may now be approaching saturation in developed markets like North America and Europe, but the middle classes in the BRICS countries will almost certainly in the next few years have growing amounts of discretionary income to spend in this space.There are of course risks for Priceline, Expedia, and in the OTA industry in general. One concern is that the many competitors in this space will lead to diminished consumer growth. Priceline, big as it is, currently controls only 16% of the North American OTA market. And the competitors are not small companies. Google, for instance, has recently ramped up its involvement in the OTA industry with its use of ITA Software, which offers algorithms for comparing the ticket data for individual airlines. The competition in the non-airline OTA space is stiff as well. For instance, Priceline's purchase of OpenTable.com for $2.6 billion this last summer puts it in direct competition with restaurant-ratings app Yelp (NYSE:YELP), which offers free reservation services for restaurants along with a variety of other features.Management execution is another concern. For instance, Priceline arguably paid too high a price for its OpenTable acquisition. Current revenue trajectories suggest up to $200 M for OpenTable, with about $30 M in net income, which, given the acquisition's $2.6 B price tag, comes in at around a 10x P/S multiple and up to 100x P/E multiple. A couple of management shakeups have occurred at Priceline in recent days. Gillian Tans was promoted from the COO of Priceline's Booking.com unit to its president, and David Vismans was promoted to chief product officer. It is perhaps for these reasons that companies like Priceline and Expedia have been seen by a lot of the players in the hedge fund space as being richly valued - too richly, perhaps, to warrant investment-grade interest. Their P/E and P/S multiples are not especially cheap by traditional value investing metrics.Another concern for the OTA industry heading into 2015 is that more conventional fluctuations in the business cycle will in fact be headwinds that will impact the travel industry. Some global metrics are suggesting a slowdown, especially in China. If global macro trends continue to reflect a slowdown then the disposable income of BRICS citizens will not be as substantial as might be hoped by sell-side OTA analysts.Analysts recently have taken note of these risks and have become more bearish in this space. FBR downgraded Priceline in early December on growth concerns, and Goldman recently dropped Priceline from its Conviction Buy list as well. Both ratings drops seem to be assuming that the company is entering the later stages of its quick growth phase. FBR's Jake Fuller recently came out with a bearish note on Expedia because he thinks that air ticket growth has slowed in recent months. Recently Stifel downgraded Priceline to Hold on concerns about macro headwinds, including especially forex and increasing OTA competition. Concerns about a strong dollar biting into Priceline's and Expedia's profits have been around for a while now, and in light of the weak Euro and the global QE trend they ought to be taken seriously.In spite of the risks one reason why there may be some short-term opportunity here is that the stock prices of Priceline and Expedia so far do not really seem to be reflecting an expectation on the part of the market that the savings in airline fuel costs will be extended to consumers. Priceline has declined upwards of 10% over the last three months, even as the overall trajectory of the market has been positive. Expedia has held its own over the last three months, suggesting a transition to a company that is valued on its value fundamentals and not on its growth potential.PCLN data by YChartsEXPE data by YChartsIn sum, Priceline and Expedia are the world's two largest online travel agencies, and as such they have the most powerful network effects at their disposal to take advantage of a discount in airfares if and when it occurs during this oil downturn. Moreover, when we consider their growth trajectories in the coming year, we ought not just to think of North America. Barring a global slowdown, the increasing disposable income of the middle classes in the BRICS countries is something that will also be put to travel use in the coming years and ought to provide a nice tailwind for the whole OTA space. For this and other reasons I am bullish on the business prospects of these stocks. Whether their stock price valuations will reflect these improving fundamentals, is, I admit, a more complicated prospect."

(NASDAQ:EXPE) is perfectly positioned to capture the surge in travel that is expected in 2015 as consumers have more money in their pockets thanks to lower gasoline prices. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to produce double digit earnings growth in 2014 and 2015.Expedia is one of the most recognizable online travel companies. It now has an extensive list of brands including Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Hotwire, Egencia, Venere.com, trivago, CarRentals.com, Expedia CruiseShipCenters and eLong, the second largest online travel company in China.Expanding Through AcquisitionsOn Nov 14, Expedia announced that it had completed the acquisition of Australian-based Wotif Group for $652 million in cash.Wotif operates travel websites in the rapidly expanding Asia-Pacific region including Wotif.com, lastminute.com.au, travel.com.au, LateStays.com, GoDo.Com.au and Arnold Travel Technology. It focuses mainly on hotel and air with 29,000 bookable properties worldwide.The Asia-Pacific region is shaping up to be a key battleground among travel companies due to the expanding middle class in China and India and the belief that the demand for travel to and from that region will be growing more quickly than some other parts of the world.Another Beat in the Third Quarter of 2014On Oct 30, Expedia reported third quarter results and beat the Zacks Consensus by 21 cents, or 13%. Earnings were $1.83 compared to the Zacks Consensus of $1.62.Expedia has put together quite a string of beats. It hasn't missed on the Zacks Consensus since 2013.Revenue soared 22% to $1.7 billion from $1.4 billion a year ago primarily due to strong hotel room night and air ticket growth. Room nights jumped 24% year-over-year due to strong performance at the Expedia and Hotels.com brands. The gain was evenly split between both domestic and international growth. Gross bookings gained 29%, also driven by room night and air ticket growth.Big Earnings GrowthThe analysts have slowly been raising estimates throughout the year.Earnings are expected to rise 44% in 2014 to $3.58 from $2.49 in 2013. Analysts are still bullish about 2015. They expect to see another 17% earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus is looking for $4.19 in 2015.Expedia is tentatively scheduled to report fourth quarter results on Feb 5, 2015 so we'll find out then just how strong 2014 was.Opportunity in the Shares?Expedia shares got slammed in the October stock market sell-off. They have come back but are still trading in the same narrow trading range they've been in over the past 6 months.Expedia trades with a forward P/E of 20 which is near its median of 19.4 over the last 10 years. So it's not cheap, on a historic basis, but neither is it expensive. However, current economic conditions, with falling gasoline prices, favor the travel industry in 2015. Consumers are expected to put their new found cash into other things, especially travel.If you're looking for a travel name with solid fundamentals and growth prospects, you would be wise to keep Expedia on your short list."

Indeed, despite impressive revenue growth over the period (revenue moving to $4.7 billion from $2.7 billion in the last full year) the company is still only trading at a forward 12 month P/E of 18.6, hardly outrageous for a company likely to grow revenue 13% and EPS 14% next year.Source: Thomson Reuters EikonAny brakes on growth?Consumers globally are tripping over themselves to become their own travel agents and compare rates online, so what's the bear case?In addition to the core Expedia brand, the company also owns Trivago, Hotels.com and its most recent acquisition in Asia, Wotif. Anytime you make an acquisition, management attention and company resources need to be devoted to integration - both at the technology and staffing level. Secondly, the company is still building out its offering for Trivago which requires management time / focus and lastly, and perhaps most obviously, people only travel when they're (A) employed and (B) confident in the outlook. So broader macroeconomic issues and consumer confidence are going to play a major role in the growth trajectory.At the equity level, out of 26 analysts, no one can bring themselves to rate the company worse than a hold - four strong buys, nine buys and 13 holds is already pretty optimistic. Of course many a cynic/realist will tell you a hold is just a sell in disguise. We won't get into the dynamics of the equity research industry here.Source: Thomson Reuters EikonInteresting shortsThe last point to make from an equity standpoint is that there's a significant amount of short interest. The hedge fund industry sees the overvaluation and thinks that it's a good play in the event of any growth hiccup or broader market correction. About 8% of the stock is held short, compared to a 52-week high of 9.5% - so while that's an amber caution it's certainly not flashing red.Source: Thomson Reuters EikonCleared for takeoff?So speaking of the equity - what level of growth is built into the current price? Is the market already anticipating the earnings growth or is there some level of mispricing? Well, it depends how bullish you are. According to StarMine's Intrinsic Value model, the hotels and entertainment services sector is trading at an overvaluation of around 68%. By comparison, EXPE is only trading at a modest premium to fair value - 11%. However, if you're a glass half empty person - (a value investor) - that's probably enough to throw you off. The bubble chart above gives a picture of the relative value terrain - and it's interesting to see that EXPE (the solid blue bubble) is at the higher end of five-year forward growth, yet at the low end in P/E terms. So you get a lot more growth than some of the other firms, but the size of the bubble indicates the price / intrinsic valuation ratio - so big is bad.More attractive multiples than AmazonFor the investor looking to gain exposure to the sector without the nose bleed multiples of an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or LinkedIn (LNKD), this is probably an exciting play. However for the more value-oriented investor, it's still not cheap. But with this market at all-time highs, few stocks can legitimately claim that title."

Expedia's partnership with Travelocity helped in generating growth by creating an additional distribution channel in the U.S. The company's performance received a further boost from its disciplined management of cost of revenue, technology, content and general administrative expenses. This in turn fueled investments into sales and marketing and resulted in healthy growth of adjusted EBITDA by 23% to $366 million and net income to $75 million with a year-on-year growth rate of above 300%.Our $85.04 price estimate for Expedia is at slightly above the current market price. We will update our estimate after the Q3 2014 earnings release. Expanding Offerings And Market Presence To Create A Niche Against CompetitionExpedia recently announced the continuance of its partnership with HomeAway, the world's largest vacation rental website. HomeAway services account for approximately 15% of the U.S. and European vacation rental bookings market [1]. In October2013, the two companies launched a pilot program with the addition of around 10,000 vacation rentals to the U.S. version of Expedia.com. Expedia will now be able to list 115,000 HomeAway vacation rental properties on its U.S. website.Vacation rentals are residential properties which owners and managers rent out to travelers for few nights, weeks, or months. The US market for such rentals was estimated to be around $23 billion in 2012 [2]. The share of online travel in the vacation rental segment doubled from 12% in 2007 to 24% in 2012, and this is expected to increase to 30% by 2014. The partnership is symbiotic in nature with HomeAway getting an exposure to Expedia's 13.4 million monthly visitors and with Expedia offering its user greater convenience of combining home rentals with flights, cars and other travel bookings offered through the website.Expedia also is in talks to take over its major rival in New Zealand and Australia, wotif.com, home to the Wotif, Lastminute.com.au and Latestays brands. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2014. The company claims to serve a customer base of 3.5 million (as of December 2013), and its acquisition will further strengthen Expedia's position in the APAC region [3].Partnership With Travelocity Continues To Boost GrowthIn 2013, Expedia and its rival, Travelocity signed an agreement wherein Expedia contributes to the content, inventory, customer service and technology for Travelocity's U.S. and Canadian websites, while the latter concentrates on the marketing aspect of the brand and in return, receives a performance-based marketing fee. (To know further details of the deal, read our article: Expedia Is Better Positioned For Growth After The Travelocity Deal) The Canadian website was launched in Q1 2014. As a consequence of the partnership, there was a 3% room nights growth and 18% growth in ticket volume in the U.S. [4]. In Q2 2014, Expedia's worldwide room sales were close to 46 million, yielding a 28% year-on-year growth and Travelocity contributed to 4% of that growth. The hotel booking division accounts for nearly 70% of our valuation of Expedia. In the air tickets segment too, there was a 28% growth in Q2, with Travelocity's contribution being 18% [5].Expedia's partnership with Travelocity is expected to offer stiff competition to Priceline, which in 2010 overthrew Expedia from its top position in the online travel agency by sales. Priceline's accelerated international expansion backed by its acquisitions aided it in the process. Currently Priceline is proving to be a formidable competitor for Expedia on the domestic front, with its offline advertising campaign (Booking.yeah) for Booking.com, its partnership with NYC and Co. to aid bookings on New York City's official tourism website, and its acquisition of Kayak, a leading US meta-search engine with 50% share of the US market.Declining Revenue Per Room Due To Increased Penetration Of Expedia Traveler Preference (ETP) ProgramThe ETP program, introduced in the latter half of 2012, offers customers the choice between upfront payments for bookings (merchant model) and paying post the stay (agency model). The agency model gained popularity as more travelers preferred paying after their stay. As a consequence, over 59,000 hotels have signed up for the ETP program since its launch. Revenue margins are lower under the agency model, as Expedia acts as a travel agent and earns a small commission based on the bookings. The merchant model which was the predominant paying mode prior to ETP, offered higher revenue margins as the transaction was completed in Expedia's website itself. Due to this shift in the transaction pattern, the revenue margins have been adversely affected. This, coupled by the largest hike in room rents (over the last ten quarters), resulted in a 4% decline in Expedia's revenue per room night in Q2 2014.We believe the ETP program adoption would be rapid amongst customers as the programs gets rolled out globally, resulting in an increased revenue contribution from the agency model. The program will compensate for the lower margins by boosting the room nights sale. Additionally, the agency model puts Expedia at a better position to compete against Priceline in terms of flexibility. In 2013, the agency model accounted for 83% of Priceline's sales as it was used by its subsidiary Booking.com. Expedia's agency model registered a 38% sales growth in H1 2014 as against the merchant model sales growth of 18% [6].Disclosure: No positions."
2647225,72015,2014-11-07T02:10:04-05:00,"Priceline and Expedia trade at similar forward multiples, despite analyst projections of faster future earnings growth at Priceline.
        Priceline possesses a more conservative balance sheet than Expedia and exhibits a stronger competitive position through impressive efficiency ratios.
        While Expedia shares appear to be slightly overvalued, Priceline shares could rise by at least 60% given the company's earnings growth potential.","Priceline Group (PCLN) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) are two of the most popular online travel providers and both happen to be publicly traded companies. Priceline has a significantly larger market capitalization than Expedia ($57 billion vs. $10 billion). Along with operating Priceline.com, the Priceline Group also operates Booking.com, Kayak.com and OpenTable.com while Expedia owns Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Hotwire.com and Trivago.com, amongst other websites. This article uses a DRAG analysis to compare these two travel provides to see which stock appears to be the better investment.Please click here to read my article which outlines the DRAG analysis framework in more detail.To summarize, the four variables used in a DRAG (dividend and risk adjusted growth) analysis are as follows (each company is ranked from 0 to 3 in each category): 1) How cyclical is the industry in which Priceline & Expedia operate? 2) How strong are Priceline's and Expedia's competitive positions within this industry? 3) How risky are Priceline's and Expedia's balance sheets? 4) What are Priceline's and Expedia's dividend yields and dividend growth histories?The premise is that a company that operates in a non-cyclical industry, with a strong competitive position and a clean balance sheet that pays an attractive dividend should trade at a higher earnings multiple than a company without these attributes, even if the lower quality company has higher projected future earnings growth. After adjusting for these variables, it becomes easier to compare companies in different sectors with different levels of future growth potential.Priceline vs. Expedia DRAG Analysis:Although some of the above numbers are quite different, I am confident giving both of these stocks the same (below average) score for the level of industry cyclicality. Travel is an economically sensitive industry and online retail stocks on average possess slightly higher than average beta. Priceline has been a particularly volatile stock over the last year and although Expedia has a minuscule beta over the last year, looking at the stock's long term history, investors should not expect this low level of volatility to continue moving forward. I decided to use a five (instead of ten) year history of earnings standard deviation for this comparison due to both companies having a relatively short history. It is interesting to note that although Priceline has demonstrated higher earnings volatility, its profits grew each year during this period, while Expedia's earnings peaked in 2011 and have declined in the two years since.Both of these companies control a collection of widely known travel websites. Although other large competitors exist in the online travel sector, such as Travelocity (which is owned by the privately held Sabre Holdings) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), these are the two dominant players. The numbers show that Priceline appears to have a significant competitive advantage over its smaller rival. Both its gross and operating margins are superior to those of Expedia, as are its efficiency ratios. While Expedia's ROIC is adequate, Priceline delivers a return on its capital that is nearly ten percentage points higher. It is important to note that Priceline's advantage in this area has existed during the entire last decade and while Expedia used to have a higher gross margin, Priceline has made significant improvements in this area during the last five years. The above reasoning allows Priceline to earn a slightly above average score for its competitive position, while Expedia comes in a little below average in this area.Priceline also bests Expedia on the flexibility of its balance sheet. With just under $2 billion in long term debt outstanding compared to $3.5 billion in cash and a $57 billion market cap, and interest coverage approaching 40 times, Priceline's balance sheet is impressive and nearly flawless. Expedia also has slightly more cash on hand ($1.5 billion) than it does long term debt outstanding, which is why I am not overly bothered by its current ratio of less than 1. This weak current ratio has been the case for Expedia going back several years and I do not believe it is an indication of any financial problems at the company. Expedia deserves an average score for its balance sheet, although investors should continue to monitor is current ratio and interest coverage moving forward to ensure no nasty surprises emerge.While Priceline does not and has never paid a dividend, Expedia's stock yields slightly less than 1%. The company initiated its dividend in 2010 and paid a special dividend of $0.52 per share in 2012, which is excluded from the above dividend growth analysis. Expedia's modest dividend gives its shares a slight edge relative to Priceline for income investors, but the yield is so small that this advantage does not appear significant.Priceline and Expedia both happen to trade for between 17 and 18 times 2015 projected earnings per share. However, analysts believe that Priceline should be able to grow its earnings faster than Expedia by approximately 4% per year moving forward. The DRAG framework also gives Priceline credit for its pristine balance sheet and impressive margins and efficiency ratios. Meanwhile, Expedia gains some ground back due to its modest dividend yield. Nevertheless, this analysis shows that while Expedia shares appear to be slightly overvalued, Priceline shares are undervalued by more than 60%. Earlier this week, Priceline announced an outlook that disappointed investors, knocking nearly 10% off the value of the shares. However, this analysis shows that this pullback has created a buying opportunity for the stock, which has impressive growth potential on the horizon and is a compelling equity investment, especially relative to Expedia."
2902576,25120,2015-02-11T10:41:53-05:00,"Expedia reports soft earnings, indicating that margins and earnings continue to take a beating in a competitive environment.A strong dollar and integration costs hurt bottom line results, as marketing expenses are up significantly as well with Expedia facing stiff competition.Despite the solid booking growth, I am worried about the long-term margin potential and competition from Priceline.com.","Investors in Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) were not happy at all with the results, which the online travel company reported for the final quarter of 2014.The company is seeing continued pressure on the revenues it generates for facilitating a hotel room booking as a result of intense competition. Combined with higher technology and deal related expenses, as well as the impact of a strong dollar, the company is facing harsh times in terms of growth and profitability.While the absolute valuation multiples are justifiable given the topline sales growth, I am very cautious, while relative multiples appear fair as well. Fierce competition as well as a fat ""cut"" taken by the business makes me very cautious about the prospects for margins and the shares in the long run.Solid Demand, Hurting MarginsLast week, Expedia reported its fourth quarter. The number of room nights booked through the websites of the company rose by 27.5% to 47.3 million nights over the past quarter.Expedia stressed that acquisitions added just a percent to reported revenue growth. What should be mentioned is that international bookings made up 45% of sales in the past quarter. That business faced a 7% point headwind from the strong dollar, with revenues of the international business being up by 18%.Arguably, business is good with the number of bookings increasing so rapidly, and hotels being able to charge so much for their rooms. Despite this observation, competition is hurting Expedia's ""cut."" Revenues reported by Expedia in relation to gross bookings came in at 12.0%, down from a near 12.7% ""cut"" reported last year.Despite pressure on the ""cut"" taken by Expedia, the company still collects a nice average fee for facilitating a booking. The 12% cut translates into a healthy average fee of $29 per hotel room booked through its websites.Margins Take A HitWhile gross booking numbers and top line revenue growth is solid, the margin developments are very disappointing.Reported operating margins came in at 7.0% of sales, down a full five percent points compared to the year before. The company took $25.6 million in restructuring charges, equivalent to 1.9% of sales. The vast majority of the collapse in the reported margins resulted from greater selling and marketing efforts. These costs increased by a full four percentage points to 46% of sales, thereby pressuring margins.As a result of lower margins, net earnings were down despite top line sales growth. Net earnings were down by some 30% to $66.0 million. Adjusted earnings fell by 10% to $113 million, with earnings coming in at $0.86 per share, thereby missing consensus estimates at $1.00 per share.Growing By Multiple BrandsExpedia is not a simple online hotel business. The company operates under many brands including Trivago, Expedia, Hotels.com, eLong and CarRentals.com, among others. To expand the business even further, Expedia recently announced the $280 million acquisition of Travelocity as well as the $612 million purchase of Australia-based Wotif Group.The company remains fairly aggressive with its expansion strategy in what is still a very fragmented and growing global market. The technology provided by the company should allow for long-term sales leverage, something not apparent in the latest results driven by the high marketing efforts.The company continues to aggressively sacrifice current earnings to grow the business, thereby gaining market share away from Priceline.com (PCLN), the largest competitor of the business. By now, Expedia generates roughly half its sales abroad, and roughly 70% of sales from hotels. Together with Priceline, Expedia dominates the online travel market, which is still very small compared to the traditional travel market.Both Expedia as well as Priceline.com base their business on gross bookings of some $50 billion in a year. The total global travel business is estimated to be worth $1.3 trillion according to Expedia's presentation. Despite their dominance on online bookings, both firms still have a lot to gain from the ""offline"" business.Steep ValuationExpedia ended the fiscal year of 2014 with $1.8 billion in cash, equivalents and long-term investments. Note that the $280 million Travelocity acquisition was not yet factored in, so likely cash holdings are lower at the current time. Total debt stood at $1.75 billion which results in a flattish net cash position at the current time.At $78 per share, the 132 million shares outstanding value the business at some $10.3 billion. This values the business at 1.8 times trailing revenues of $5.76 billion. Shares are valued at 10 times adjusted EBITDA of $1.02 billion and 19-20 times adjusted earnings of $528 million. Based on GAAP net earnings, the multiple comes in close to the mid-twenties.Comparative Valuation With Priceline.comExpedia's larger competitor is Priceline, which is actually similar in terms of the booking numbers. Over its past twelve months, Priceline reported gross bookings of $48 billion, as bookings reported by Expedia total some $50 billion for 2014.That is where the similarity ends. Priceline.com focuses on the lower end with average selling prices for hotel rooms for a night coming in much closer to $150, while Expedia sees numbers in the $200-$250 region. These lower average prices allow Priceline.com to charge relatively higher margins. Its revenues of $8.1 billion result in a ""cut,"" defined as revenues/bookings, of more than 20.5% in the third quarter of 2014. This compares to the 12.6% ""cut"" reported by Expedia for that quarter.This much higher revenue base allows for much higher margins. Adjusted earnings reported by Priceline.com come in at 41% of sales on an after-tax basis, much better than the 15% margins reported by Expedia. On top of this comes the quicker revenue growth which Priceline reports. Revenues grew by 25.0% on an annual basis in the third quarter, at a time when Expedia grew its sales by 21.3%.Priceline.com is pretty much focused on international markets thanks to the success of Booking.com. As a matter of fact close to 88% of Priceline.com's bookings come from foreign markets, creating greater currency headwinds compared to Expedia which generates roughly 45% of its sales abroad.Following the outperformance on all these metrics, Priceline.com is valued at $53 billion, which is a huge premium compared to Expedia's $10.3 billion valuation. It should be stressed that Priceline has net cash holdings of little over $4 billion. Even adjusting for this balance sheet strength, the valuation discrepancy remains huge given the similar gross booking numbers. The truth is that Expedia takes a smaller cut, has relatively higher expenses, grows less quickly and appears to lose share to its major competitor.This observation is probably the reason why the company is aggressively pursuing deals and marketing efforts to maintain and grow market share.Concluding ThoughtsInvestors in Expedia and the wider online travel sector have already made a killing in recent years. Over the past five years, investors have tripled or quadrupled their money in shares of both Expedia and Priceline.com. Long-term holders in Priceline.com have really hit the jackpot.That said, Expedia's shares are now trading flat over the past year, while shares of Priceline.com are actually down 15%. Priceline's shares have been hurt by worries about dollar strength given the huge foreign operations of the company.For now, investors in Expedia do not expect much of a value convergence between both operators. Expedia has been active in making deals with Travelocity and Wotif.com, spending nearly a billion on both businesses. On the conference call, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi stressed the growth of Trivago and the other brands of the family. That said, growth of Trivago, the core and other operations came at an expense in the form of higher marketing efforts, hurting margins a great deal.Worse, earnings will not improve quickly following higher technology and integration related expenses following these recent deals. These deals are all part of Expedia's ambitions to grow the business to achieve more global scale. As a result, most of the anticipated EBITDA improvements in the future will only be visible in the second half of 2015.All in all, the profit developments are not very nice as the efficiency of Expedia lacks that of Priceline, creating a huge discrepancy in the valuation, although the earnings multiples of both companies are roughly similar. The issue is that Expedia has much slimmer profit margins while it grows much more slowly as well. The many brands and websites employed by Expedia make it hard to achieve these kinds of margins and efficiency metrics.The question remains whether Expedia can keep up with its competitor, which is more profitable, has more resources, has more consistent offerings and grows quicker. Following this observation, I think Expedia might be further away from closing the gap with Priceline. As a result, I believe the margin pressure on the business might be more lasting and pronounced in the future.Following this observation, I am not a buyer of the shares despite the top line sales growth with GAAP earnings multiples being in their mid-twenties. Priceline.com is not an imminent buy in my eyes either as I think that firm takes too much of a ""cut"" as the middleman, leaving future earnings potentially vulnerable for margin compression as well.All in all, Expedia is fundamentally the cheaper play versus Priceline.com based on gross booking numbers. That is of no use if it cannot report decent profits on these bookings in relation to the current valuation. Following this observation, I remain on the sidelines with fundamentals providing little support in the coming quarters."

(NASDAQ:EXPE) is slated to report 3Q 2014 earnings after the bell on Thursday, October 30th. The earnings release is expected at approximately 4:00 p.m. EST followed at 4:30 p.m. with a webcast presentation available through Expedia Investor Relations. This economically sensitive company is one of the top two global online travel agents and could therefore influence direction of the index futures and other broad market gauges.Outliers & StrategyKey measures:Recent NewsTechnical ReviewSimilar to last quarter, Expedia shares have consolidated around $80 ahead of the earnings release. July's consolidative support went down to $78 and just above the current 200-day moving average. Seasonally, the stock has tended to do well in the fourth quarter amid holiday travel planning. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryExpedia's revenue generation coming mostly from U.S. travel could be a positive amid Ebola fears, but much of the growth is tied to international revenue. Despite global economic slowing, the stock has held up reasonably well. Expedia has beaten estimates the last four quarters and the stock responded poorly to a 1-cent beat, so the company probably needs to report an EPS of above $1.80 on revenue of least $1.69 billion to support the stock pushing back up toward all-time highs.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

2440535,70915,2014-08-21T02:58:36-04:00,"Expedia’s latest quarter brought in top-line and bottom-line growth obtained through higher bookings and cost control respectively.
        The company’s acquisitions and partnerships will prove to be beneficial in combating domestic and international competition.
        Growing market, better-than-industry performance and dividend-increase deliver a strong buy rating.","When it comes to traveling, Expedia Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) needs no introduction. The company operates as an online travel agency. It sells travel products and services acquired from a variety of hotels, commercial airlines, cruise lines and car rental companies. While travelers know about the company very well, investors should be familiar with the company as well since it offers a great profit potential. In the past one year, the company has given its shareholders a price return of more than 80%.This price return is backed by gross billings of more than $40 billion for the company which shows its success. Yet, the global market share of Expedia presently is less than 4%. This fact alone should be enough to give investors an idea of the future potential of this company. Expedia has reported another successful quarter this month. In this article, I will briefly go through that performance highlighting the major components. Later, I will discuss the future upside potential Expedia has to offer.Second QuarterTotal revenue of Expedia increased to $1.5 billion delivering a year-over-year growth of 24%. Hotel and air, the two main product streams grew by 23% and 22% respectively. The increase in hotel revenue came from a 28% increase in room nights booked supported by a 2% increase in the average daily rate ""ADR"".As you can see, higher bookings prevailed and ADR improved by a very low margin. This trend is expected to continue in the longer run. This is because hotel discounts and loyalty programs are growing significantly to attract tourists, hence keeping ADR growth relatively low. Another support of my view comes from the fact that 93% of Expedia's sales come from leisure travelers with only 7% being corporate or business travelers. Leisure travelers value discounts and cheaper deals. Hence, it is important for the company to keep ADR low to keep hotel accommodation attractive in front of the larger segment.Gross margin for the quarter improved 169 bps to 79.9%. Higher cost for credit card processing (due to increase in merchant bookings) was offset by the higher volume sold, leading to a 26.7% year-over-year increase in absolute gross profit. Following a similar trend, operating margin improved by 207 bps as all costs except marketing fell as a percentage of sale. Higher marketing is needed to retain customers so it shouldn't be much of a concern, especially since it is driving a healthy top-line growth for Expedia.The net result of the above statistics was that the diluted earnings per share grew from 31% to 67%. All in all, the quarter showed a truly strong operational result in which both revenue and profit improved, courtesy of increased bookings and cost control. In the coming times, there is no obstruction in Expedia's way to become a top performer.This is because Hotels.com of Expedia is the leading hotel specialist in the world and has its branches in 60 countries. This not only helps Expedia market itself more effectively and attract a wider customer base, but also allows it to form alliances with a greater number of hotel chains in different countries.Also, the company is taking care of the domestic market with wise strategic moves. It recently got into a partnership with Travelocity through which Travelocity will now become an extra distribution channel for Expedia. The agreement will help Expedia fight the growing competition from Priceline (PCLN) in the US. It should also help the company in grabbing additional market shares from other competitors.While Expedia drives more than half of its revenue from the US, the international markets offer tremendous opportunity to grow. This can be seen through the growing revenue contribution from the international markets. From 24% in 2006, it has grown to 47% in 2014. The acquisition of Trivago in 2013 also continues to help Expedia in elevating its top line. Trivago has over 600,000 hotels across 140 booking sites in 30 countries. It has a significant presence in many European countries which is of strategic importance to Expedia.The company's car rental business is also going to benefit from the latest acquisition of the Auto Escape Group, which is made up of 2 European car rental brands. The acquisition will join Expedia's CarRentals.com, and will help in the growth of the company's global car rental business considerably.The benefit from these moves is going to be doubled keeping in view the expanding market. Though 78% of the US population uses the internet presently, the proportion of Europe's population online is close to a lesser 61%, while the internet penetration in Asia is still very low at 26%. As a growing number of people move towards using internet and gradually booking travel online, Expedia should reap benefits.Bottom LineProfit-yielding acquisitions and expanding markets coupled with strong advertisement have helped Expedia deliver a three-year revenue growth averaging 16.3%. This has been above peers who have delivered only 7.6%. Similarly, a return on equity has been strong at 16.6%, way above the competition. With the latest 20% increment in dividend, Expedia is a perfect investment to bet your gains on. It holds a significant profit opportunity, and therefore gets a strong buy rating."
2504445,56092,2014-09-18T09:45:51-04:00,"Expedia is one of the top online travel companies in the world, with a strong portfolio of internationally-recognized brands.Expectations are high after strong Q2 results, with several analysts upgrading their ratings.While the stock price could still increase by another 10%, we believe that further upside is limited and that the stock is too expensive to buy.Current shareholders could still hold in the short-term in the hope of a further price jump, but should look to sell in the next few months.","Investors who held Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) shares over the past year must be pretty pleased with their 65% return, and rightly so. The question we're looking to answer now is what should growth-at-the-right-value investors do with the stock at the current price. We believe it is time to take profits and wait for a pullback before re-investing.Company DescriptionExpedia is one of the leaders in the Online Travel space, and owns top-tier domains such as Hotels.com, Hotwire and Egencia (for business travel). It owns a large stake in eLong, the second largest online travel company in China, and has been acquiring brands in Europe (Trivago, Auto Escape Group) and Australia (Wotif.com) to further expand its international footprint. In total, Expedia owns 150 travel sites in over 70 countries, which combined attract 60 million unique visitors each month.For investors who are new to Expedia, we will quickly recap the Q2 highlights:Source: ExpediaGrowth ExpectationsExpedia does not typically talk about long-term growth expectations, but it did predict that full-year adjusted EBITDA would grow in the range of 16% to 19%, on the back of its performance in Q1 and Q2.On the whole, analysts seemed cautiously optimistic following the Q2 results:With even the most optimistic price target only yielding a 9% return, which is pretty low for a risky growth stock, it might be time for shareholders to take some profits and reinvest in a cheaper growth business.Valuation and Peer ComparisonWhile we like Expedia as a company, we don't like its current price and believe it is due for a pullback. What concerned us the most is that there are few valuation metrics on which one could build an argument to buy Expedia as a growth stock at a reasonable price, even when comparing it to close competitors such as Orbitz (NYSE:OWW) or Priceline (PCLN). You could like Orbitz for its cash flow and performance metrics, or Priceline for its financial stability, but none of the key value indicators that we typically track speak in favor of Expedia. It's expensive according to most valuation metrics, even when compared to growth expectations. Similarly, while we're not heavily concerned about Expedia's debt and liquidity ratios, they do not impress us.ConclusionExpedia backers should be happy with the return they received in the past year, and sell the stock while it's near its two-year high. It's a great growth company but right now it is simply overbought, and it may be wise to sell and re-invest after a pullback. The Online Travel space in general is an interesting area to remain invested in, and fans of the sector might want to have a look at Priceline for a better valuation."

2410845,20568,2014-08-11T15:14:26-04:00,,"Expedia, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) recently crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter as demand for travel and travel services strengthened. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to see double digit earnings growth both this year and next.Expedia is one of the most recognizable online travel companies. It now has an extensive list of brands including Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Hotwire, Egencia, Venere.com, trivago, CarRentals.com, Expedia CruiseShipCenters and eLong, the second largest online travel company in China.Expedia Beat By 38.4% in Q2On July 31, Expedia reported its second quarter results and easily beat the Zacks Consensus by 26 cents. Earnings were $0.94 compared to the consensus of $0.68.Revenue jumped 24% to $1.49 billion from $1.21 billion a year ago. The other metrics also showed solid growth with Room Night growth rising 28% versus 19% a year ago and Gross Bookings jumping 29% due to room night and air ticket growth.The quarter was boosted by the marketing partnership with Travelocity, which it entered into in the fourth quarter of 2013. That deal contributed 400 basis points of the room night growth.Analysts Are BullishThe analysts liked what they heard as 6 estimates were revised higher for 2014, but it wasn't just 2014 they were excited about. Six estimates were also revised higher for 2015. Expedia isn't cooling off. Earnings are expected to rise 39.6% in 2014 and another 23.6% in 2015.The company also recently rewarded shareholders by raising its dividend by 20% to $0.18 a quarter. That's a yield of 0.8%.Shares At 2-Year HighExpedia shares have been on the move for most of 2014. They recently hit a new 2-year high.The company isn't cheap, though, with a forward P/E of 24, but that puts it in line with its high growth competitors. You're buying it for the growth, which it has plenty of.If you're looking to cash in on the strong demand in travel, Expedia is one stock to keep on your short list.EXPEDIA INC (EXPE): Free Stock Analysis Report (email registration required)"
2274223,25120,2014-06-18T05:11:15-04:00,"Susquehanna turns positive on Expedia as it believes consensus estimates are too pessimistic.The company has demonstrated inferior revenue growth and margins.If it can improve these metrics versus competition, the relative valuation gap and opportunity is large.Yet I am not very convinced Expedia has the ability to do this, losing relative market share in a scalable business.","Investors in Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) react very enthusiastic to an upgrade form analysts at Susquehanna which believe consensus estimates for the online travel company are too pessimistic.If the company can close the huge margin gap with its biggest competitor, more upside might be on the horizon indeed as Susquehanna is predicting. That being said, inferior historical growth in a scalable business makes me very cautious to back this prediction.Susquehanna Turns PositiveAnalyst Brian Nowak at Susquehanna Financial group upgraded Expedia from a neutral stance towards positive. The price target has been raised by $11 to $90 as consensus estimates for 2014 and 2015 are too conservative according to Nowak.According to internal and even conservative assumptions, the earnings per share consensus is 3 and 4% too low for 2014 and 2015, respectively. The company behind Travelocity and Trivago has shown a volatile performance in the first half of this year, but it's set to outperform in the coming period.Better conversion at Expedia resulting from the tie-up with Travelocity and increased traffic and ARPU for Trivago are driving results as well as a solid performance of Hotels.com.Cautious Start To 2014Back in May, Expedia released its first quarter results. The company has access to roughly $2.2 billion in cash and equivalents, while holding another $1.2 billion in debt, resulting in a solid net cash position.The company posted a 19% jump in first quarter revenues to $1.20 billion as the underlying business grew at a much quicker pace. Total hotel nights being booked were up by 24%, which in its turn drove gross bookings growth of 29%. Booking came in at $12.6 billion, but revenues as a percentage of bookings were down 84 basis points to 9.5% of bookings.The company saw real difficulties turning a profit on its activities in the first quarter, posting a GAAP loss of $14.3 million. Adjusted, non-GAAP earnings were down 39% to $21.5 million. GAAP losses were driven by a $18.5 million amortization charge of intangible assets.Factoring in Tuesday's jump to $78 per share, Expedia's equity is valued at $10.1 billion which values operating assets at roughly $9.1 billion. Based on trailing revenues of $5.0 billion, operating assets are valued at roughly 1.8 times annual revenues. Trailing net earnings of $323 million implies a 28 times GAAP earnings multiple.Slower Growth, Offset By Higher PayoutsOver the period 2004-2013, Expedia has grown its annual revenues at a compounded annual growth rate of 11%. While this has been impressive, note that the industry in which it operates has seen superior growth. Competitor Priceline.com (PCLN) has grown its revenues by nearly 25% per annum over this period, driven by the hugely successful acquisition of booking.com.As growth for Expedia is slowing down it has resorted to increased loyalty incentives and discounting which is hurting its revenues/bookings ratio in a serious way. Given the strong balance sheet and slowing growth, Expedia is returning cash to investors.The $0.15 quarterly dividend provides investors with a 0.8% dividend yield while the company repurchased 1.7 million shares in the first quarter, at a rate of nearly 6% per annum.Rapid Changes Dominate The IndustryExpedia's shares have ripped higher in recent years on the back of the industry growth and general market enthusiasm. As a result shares have quadrupled from $20 in 2011 to current levels at $80.Expedia has grown in recent years, both organically as well as through the acquisition of Trivago which closed last year, giving the company a stronger foothold in Europe. This came after competitor Priceline.com bought Kayak after it has just seen its public offering.Just last week, Priceline.com announced its intentions to acquire OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN) in a $2.6 billion deal, giving it a strong footing in the restaurant booking business.Takeaway For InvestorsWhile Expedia's growth is impressive, the company is losing business to Priceline.com and other businesses in a rapid growing industry. As scale is crucial for the business, this is obviously a very damaging development. The fact that Expedia runs so many different websites is not helpful either.As a matter of fact, Priceline.com's trailing revenues of $7.1 billion are just little over 40% higher than Expedia. Yet it is growing much quicker and showing superior margins after posting trailing earnings of $2.0 billion versus earnings of $323 million for Expedia.This gap is only widening at the moment, but has been well-reflected in the share price. Priceline.com's market capitalization, including a comfortable net cash position, values the company at $62 billion. This values the company at 8.7 times revenues, compared to just a 2 times multiple for Expedia on that metric.On the back of this logic, it is understandable why Expedia looks relatively attractive. Yet on earnings metrics Priceline.com looks more attractive, while showing better growth rates as well. As such the crucial factor is the question whether Expedia can really improve its margins, after reporting after tax profit margins of 10-15% historically. If it can do this, earnings of $750 million-$1 billion are attainable which could push shares easily towards $100 per share.I must say that I am not convinced that Expedia can pull this off, as the company continues to lag its main rivals. Intense competition and scattered offerings are the main reasons. I remain cautious and stay on the sidelines.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2537455,58341,2014-10-02T16:48:04-04:00,Expedia has beat EPS estimates for four straight quarters.Earnings will grow more than 16% each year over the next five years.Acquisitions are fueling Expedia's international expansion.,"Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), an $11B online travel company, reported Q2 EPS of $1.03 vs. the $0.76 consensus Wall Street estimate and revenue of $1.49B vs. the $1.44B estimate on July 31st. This was a year-over-year increase in earnings of 61% and 24% for revenue. In the same period gross margins rose 169 basis points to 79.9%. Gross bookings were another bright spot in the quarter, up 28.9% to $13.05B.Expedia generated $493.5M in cash in Q2, bringing total cash and near-term investments to $2.37B. This makes long-term debt manageable at $1.25B, plus allowing the company to return cash to shareholders. Dividend payments were $19.2M and share repurchases were $217.2M in the quarter. In 2012, the board of directors authorized a 20M share repurchase program (now has about 5M shares left to buy back).This was the fourth consecutive EPS beat and the largest in the last year (beat by $0.01-$0.08 in the previous three quarters). In this time the post earnings performance of the stock was an average gain of 8.75% (up the next day after earnings on three out of the four times).While shares of Expedia are up 23% year to date, the stock trades at a P/E ratio of 18.15x (2015 estimates) with 17.6% EPS growth, price to sales ratio of 2.12x, and a price to book ratio of 5.95x. The strong earnings estimates for next year aren't just an anomaly either as the average annual EPS growth rate over the next five years is 16.9%. Top line growth will be in the double digits in the foreseeable future too, rising 20.3% this year and 12.9% to $6.48B in 2015.Acquisitions are a major part of Expedia's future with the most recent being Wotif.com, an Australian online travel company, for $658M. To help finance the purchase and keep a healthy cash position on the balance sheet, it issued $500M of 2024 notes at a 4.50% yield. This summer it also agreed to acquire Auto Escape, a European online car rental company, for an undisclosed amount. This adds more than 20 websites to Expedia's portfolio and bolsters its presence in Europe with synergies in the car rental market. Q2 revenue from international markets grew 26.3% from Q1 and 27.2% from the year ago quarter.Domestic revenue was still the majority of the business at 53% as of Q2, increasing 22.9% from Q1 and 21.4% from Q2 of 2013. The Hotels.com Hotel Price Index (Hotels.com is owned by Expedia) showed that the average price of a hotel room per night in the U.S. increased 5% to $137 in the first half of 2014. This was second highest growth rate for any update on the index since its inception in 2004. Growth largely came from the Mountain West and Midwest regions, which includes a 20% increase in Nashville, Tennessee, to $164 per night.Since Q3 is the most significant and profitable quarter for Expedia the positive momentum for the U.S. is unlikely to cool down after the large beat in Q2. Trivago's advertising business will generate a large part the operating profits as marketing costs slow from the first two quarters of the year. Margins should also pick up in the back half of the year as the company pushes its mobile device booking. The company expects mobile device bookings to represent 20% of total bookings by the end of 2014. Mobile offers provide consumers with accessibility to book arrangements on a moments notice fill short-term (less than a week in advance). This also is a positive for Expedia as margins are higher on short-notice travel plans.Potential headwinds, albeit short-term, are scares from the first diagnosed case of Ebola in the U.S. Shares of airline and online travel companies were hit on October 1st on these concerns. This could potentially have a marginal affect on travel plans for the beginning of Q4, but Q3 results will be unfazed.David Tepper, prominent investor and founder of $20B Appaloosa Management, believes the future is still bright for the company as well. In the first quarter of this year Appaloosa Management started a position in Expedia. The 695,837 shares represent a roughly $61M investment.The collection of Wall Street analysts have 9 hold ratings, 8 buy ratings, and 0 sell ratings. BNP Paribas, which has an outperform rating on the stock, raised its price target to $100 on August 14th (14% above the current share price) from $91 on June 11th.Unusual Options ActivityOn September 30th, call activity was over 8 times the average daily volume (40,699 calls traded vs the 5,003 average). Implied volatility soared 5.2% to 30.05. The call to put ratio was 9:1, which was led by large buying in the November 22 $90 calls (4,004 traded) and the November 22 $92.50 calls (21,405 traded). This was new activity in both options since the open interest was below 900 contracts in both. Given that Q3 earnings are expected to be released on October 30th these large call buyers are likely making a bullish bet on another upside surprise. Heading into the Q2 earnings release, there was massive call buying in the September options one week prior (stock rallied 6.34% after the results).The Weekly Chart Shows A Pathway To $100A move to $100 at current 2015 estimates would put the forward P/E ratio at 21.41x and the PEG ratio at 1.22x, both of which aren't at an expensive valuation. The stock trades at a P/E ratio of 21.35x on 2014 EPS estimates at the moment, so look for Expedia to trade at a low 20's multiple for next year too. The weekly chart above shows the consolidation from February through July and the subsequent breakout in August. This is significant in that short interest is over 10% and could take nearly 8 days to cover using the average daily stock volume. The combination of Q3 earnings, the remainder of the current buyback plan, and short covering could propel Expedia shares to the mid $90s/low $100s over the next few months."
2329685,67393,2014-07-22T13:01:49-04:00,"Priceline and Expedia are the world's two largest online travel agencies - can both sustain their growth into the future?Priceline is better positioned for growth due to its higher share of the international OTA market.Both companies have been spending on advertisements, inventory additions, acquisitions, and other growth initiatives lately, though Expedia is far outspending Priceline.","Priceline (NASDAQ:PCLN) first came to my attention when Stock Rover CEO Howard Reisman chose it as one of his Top 5 large cap growth stocks (as mentioned in my previous article). In fact, it lands in second place when applying Howard's personalized ""17 Factor Growth Stock Ranker"" screener to his ""Twelve Strong Large Cap Growth Stocks"" watchlist1. Here is the criteria by which the screener operates:However, as a traveler I have always used Priceline's main online travel agency (OTA) competitor, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), since oddly enough, Priceline has never really crossed my radar. When I added EXPE to Howard's watchlist (below), it ranked 10th, not bad overall given that it is being compared to 12 strongly performing growth stocks, but still far behind PCLN.As further confirmation of their differences, Priceline ranks number one by Stock Rover's ""S&P 500 Fastest Growers"" screener, while Expedia doesn't even make the list.So I am wondering: Why does Priceline appear to be doing better than Expedia, a company of which I am a satisfied customer? Is it simply a better service, or is it just better positioned for growth? And can both companies, as the two largest OTAs in the world, sustain their high growth? To answer these questions, I did some further investigation.Destination Overview: The OTA IndustryBefore analyzing each company by itself, let's look into the OTA industry as a whole for some background.From the macro perspective, travel is something that will play an increasingly important role in our lives as the world becomes increasingly globalized. More and more, we aspire to travel for leisure, and we need to travel for business, so it is only natural that the travel industry will see continuous growth in the coming years. Coupled with the rapid growth of online and mobile consumer services, OTAs are therefore very well positioned. Moreover, OTAs benefit from a substantial network effect: the more customers they have, the more providers they can attract and vice versa.However, there are also some considerable risks they face. First of all, the travel industry, and thus the OTA industry, is highly susceptible to fluctuations in the business cycle as well as geographic disturbances such as inclement weather or civil unrest. OTAs also face heavy competition, not just among themselves but also from travel search sites such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), daily deal sites like Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), social networking sites, local travel agencies, and hotels themselves, which are trying to direct more traffic to their own websites. Google's recent venture into the OTA industry with its purchase of ITA Software, a company that develops algorithms for comparing airline ticket data, presents a particular threat, because many travel sites, Priceline and Expedia included, depend on ITA for their flight data. Furthermore, OTAs are currently under legal scrutiny for their occupancy tax policies - the question of whether their revenue is taxable under tax ordinances that apply to hotels could have an impact on their after-tax earnings.OTAs derive their revenue from two different business models, the merchant model and the agency model, as well as a small amount from advertising. In the merchant model, which is more established, travel agencies buy rooms/tickets/car rentals wholesale from their providers and then resell them at marked-up prices, taking over marketing functions for a 20% or more commission. Customers must pay upfront for their bookings in this model.The agency model is emerging in popularity, as it has the potential to be more lucrative for travel agencies and is favored by customers who appreciate the choice of paying at checkout rather than when they book. In the agency model, OTAs simply get paid a commission in the low-to-mid teens when a customer books, but lower margins are balanced out by reduced service commitments from credit processing and payment collection. Priceline and Expedia have both adopted this model and are seeing higher growth from it than for their merchant businesses.Package Offerings: Business StructuresWith the industry as a whole in mind, let's see what each company individually has to offer.PCLN:Priceline Group, Inc. offers hotel rooms, air tickets, rental cars, vacation packages, cruises, ""things-to-do,"" and travel insurance through the several sites under its umbrella. Booking.com, Priceline's European accommodations booking site, is its main revenue driver and operates under the agency model, which in total accounted for 65% of Priceline's revenue by sales in 2013, while the merchant model accounted for 33%. It currently offers 420,000 properties in 190 countries and operates in 42 languages. Priceline's namesake U.S. site, Priceline.com, offers both price-disclosed and ""Name Your Own Price"" models for hotels, rental cars, and flights both separately and in packages. The NYOP model is aimed at cost-conscious customers, allowing Priceline to reach a greater customer base, and also helps companies dispose of excess inventory without affecting their retail prices. This model is opaque, meaning the company a customer is booking from is not revealed until the transaction is over and the bookings are nonrefundable. The opaque model, however, is waning in popularity with customers, since a stronger travel industry means that companies have less excess capacity and thus fewer available deals. Priceline now also offers ""Express Deals,"" which allow users to find discounts without bidding. Priceline's other websites include rentalcars.com, travel meta-search website and mobile app Kayak, and Asian hotel booking service Agoda.com.Priceline gets 80% of its bookings internationally and 15% domestically. It only holds 16% of the U.S. online travel market share, which is probably why I did not know much about it before, but it has a 31% share of the international travel market, which is growing much faster than the North American travel market. Priceline especially benefits from placement in a European market that not only has increasing penetration rates in comparison to the North American market but also a greater number of boutique hotels that are more likely to depend on OTAs for traffic. Finally, Priceline derives 3% of its revenue from advertisements, which has actually gone up 1992.6% year over year in Q1 2014 due to its acquisition of Kayak (more on this later).EXPE:Expedia, Inc. also offers a wide variety of travel products both in packages or on a stand-alone basis, with over 200,000 hotels and 300 airlines in 33 countries offered to over 50 million unique visitors to its websites. Its portfolio includes its main full-service Expedia.com business, Hotels.com, a hotel ""expert"" that offers premium content about lodgings, Hotwire.com, its opaque discount travel site, vacation package business Classic Vacations, local ""things-to-do"" advisor Expedia Local Expert, corporate travel full-service business Egencia, and Expedia Affiliate Network, which provides marketing and online booking services for its clients (airlines, hotels, etc.) Expedia has been expanding its international presence with European travel sites Venere.com and VIA Travels and popular online Chinese travel agency eLong.com as well as venturing into travel meta-search with trivago.com. Sales for leisure travel comprise 92% of Expedia's revenue while sales for corporate travel contribute 8%. Expedia also uses both the merchant and agency models, with the Merchant model contributing 24% of its revenue by sales in 2013 while the agency model brought in 70%.What really differentiates Expedia from Priceline is that it gets 53% of its revenue domestically, where it reigns dominant with an over 40% market share. 47% of its revenue comes from international bookings, but, as mentioned above, the international travel market is growing at faster rates while analysts see the North American travel market as nearly mature.Surveying Sales GrowthSo how does business structure translate into the numbers? Let's first look at the yearly sales growth of each company, shown in the tables below:With growth rates substantially higher than Expedia's (below) across all five years, Priceline's prime placement in the international market is indeed paying off. In fact, in 2010, Priceline overtook Expedia as the world's largest online travel agency by sales. To give a better sense of where Priceline's growth is coming from, its international bookings increased 43% in 2013, compared to an increase in domestic bookings of just 16%. Its merchant business actually decreased by 0.3% year over year in Q1 2014, in part due to the decline of the opaque model, while its agency business grew 3.2%. In addition, by volume, its hotel room nights were up 37%, its rental car days were up 36.8%, and its airline tickets were up 9.4% in 2013.Expedia's growth (above), though slower than Priceline's, is still in the healthy double digits. It saw its international bookings grow 27.6% in 2013, compared to a domestic growth rate of 11.1%. Its agency business follows Priceline's trend of faster growth, at 115.2%, while its merchant business grew at a still substantial 40.6%.Its revenues for hotel nights increased 12% in 2013, as the result of a 24% increase in room night volume but a 10% decrease in revenue per night, and its revenues from airline tickets were up 28%. While Expedia.com, Hotels.com, and trivago.com were its strongest businesses, with trivago seeing a whopping 80% increase in revenue, Hotwire.com was its weakest link.Both companies see more conservative sales growth estimates for the coming year, likely due to a revenue mix that is increasingly skewed towards the agency model and international business, where revenues per night are on average lower. Yet, these numbers are still in the double digits, driven by an improving economy and each company's efforts to increase their offerings.Exploring EPS GrowthAccording to the table above, Priceline has seen very high earnings growth since 2011. Its next year's expected EPS growth is at a still strong 22.2%, though this number is lower than it has been in previous years given plans for accumulating inventory, increasing personnel, and furthering advertising efforts that will compress margins.Expedia's EPS growth (above) has fluctuated wildly during the past five years but is expected to grow at 16.7% next year. Its EPS growth rocketed up 122% for the current year from a slump in the past two years, which is in part due to the success of its trivago acquisition and its Expedia Traveler Preference Program (ETP) initiative that cut down costs (more on this later).Valuation: Is the Price Right?So, we can see clearly that both companies are growing. To see whether they are fairly priced for their growth, let's examine some valuation metrics.PCLN and EXPE have similar Price/Earnings and PEG ratios, with PCLN looking just a little bit cheaper. Given that the P/E ratio for the Internet Catalog & Retail industry is an astronomical 276.91, both companies are actually valued at very significant discounts to industry norms. However, EXPE looks significantly cheaper by the EV/EBITDA, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow metrics.Overall, it's hard to say which stock is a better value, but given that we are focused on growth and PCLN is growing faster than EXPE yet has a marginally lower PEG forward, PCLN looks to me like a slightly better deal.(Price)Lining up the Numbers: FinancesSeeking a better explanation for the valuation metrics, which don't provide such a clear story, I checked Priceline and Expedia's income statements and balance sheets over the last 10 years.Priceline's income statement, above, looks exceptionally healthy. Its sales revenues have grown, while its cost of sales has actually decreased in recent years. All of its margins have also increased, especially its gross margin due to its continued transition toward the agency model, which has virtually no costs of revenue.Expedia's income statement (above) doesn't look too bad either, but its numbers are not quite as good as Priceline's. It has seen consistently increasing sales as well as sales costs, but while its current cost of sales is similar to Priceline's, its sales are significantly lower. Its margins are also all significantly lower than Priceline's, and its operating margins have fallen to the single digits since 2012. This reveals that Expedia is not as efficient in generating profits as Priceline is.Let's now look at the Balance sheets.Above, Priceline's balance sheet reveals that its long-term debt has jumped from 0 in 2011, but its low debt/equity ratio of 0.3 assures investors that the balance sheet is still in very good shape.Expedia's balance sheet (above), on the other hand, has a higher debt/equity ratio of 0.6, meaning that it is in a relatively riskier situation. This is reinforced by its long-term debt, which is more than half the amount of its cash. Though Expedia isn't in bad financial shape, it definitely isn't as liquid as Priceline is, which could affect its ability to finance future growth initiatives.Comparing each company's investment spending, in the table below, we can see that Expedia is actually spending considerably more in all categories than Priceline.This makes sense, given that Expedia has a few more disparate brands under its name. It is currently working on increasing its inventory, especially in international markets, and has made several acquisitions over the past few years to broaden and diversify its market share, which helps explain its high level of intangible assets. Note that in 2013, Priceline's intangibles also jumped dramatically, in most part due to its $2.1 billion acquisition of Kayak.Cruising Capital EfficiencyBut is Expedia's heavy investment spending paying off? And is each company making effective use of their capital in order to turn profits for shareholders? The Return on Assets, Return on Equity, and Return on Invested Capital metrics can help answer these questions.Priceline's ROA, ROE, and ROIC (above) have fluctuated a bit, and though they are still pretty high, they have decreased recently.Expedia's capital efficiency metrics (above) have also decreased. Moreover, they are much lower than Priceline's.I am pegging this trend on both companies' appetite for acquisitions and large increases in expenditures lately, which have not yet translated into profits. Expedia, especially, has been spending more, as seen in the section above, while at the same time earning less than Priceline. However, part of its debt can be attributed to the $1.4 billion it has spent in share repurchases over the past four years to drive up shareholder value.Trekking the Price Trails: Performance and MomentumPriceline has performed better than Expedia and the S&P 500 in the long term, with an astonishing 5-year Return vs. S&P 500 of 798.1%. Interestingly enough, it has performed worse than the S&P 500 over the past 3 months.As shown below, I charted Priceline and Expedia, with the S&P 500 set as a baseline (in red) over the past 3 months as well as the past 5 years.Past 3 months:Past 5 years:PCLN has indeed been lagging behind the S&P 500 and Expedia over the past 3 months, but it is by far leading the pack when charted over the past 5 years. Thus, PCLN seems to have been losing momentum lately, perhaps due to the fact that high growth momentum stocks have been out of favor in the market recently. The very high absolute share price could also serve as a barrier to many potential investors, particularly retail investors. Overall, however, Priceline has inarguably outperformed Expedia over the long term. As its price trends away from its 52-week high, this may even present an opportunity for investors to buy.Growth Runway: The Journey to the Final DestinationExpedia, by itself, seems to be running a good business and expects continued high growth into the next year, but Priceline seems to be doing even better, outperforming in all the above categories. At this point, investors need to know whether both companies can sustain their current growth and also whether Expedia has a place in the OTA industry in the long run.Though it is difficult to predict something like this, my research leads me to believe that both companies can indeed coexist, and even thrive, in the OTA market, at least for the next decade. I'll lay out my evidence by company.Priceline:Though it has wrested the title of the world's largest online travel agency, Priceline currently fills only 7% of the total online market share of fillable rooms, so it still has a long growth runway ahead of it. In addition, it currently controls only 16% of the North American OTA market. Management has made efforts to expand its North American presence, with an offline advertising campaign for Booking.com that debuted in 2012.Another avenue for growth is the rapid emergence of alternative lodgings, which currently make up 25% of Priceline's inventory. These lodgings, including villas, guest houses, bed and breakfasts, hostels, and even houseboats, fill gaps in Priceline's European business, where the hotel supply is limited. In addition to the listings on its Booking.com site, Priceline recently launched Villas.com, a vacation rentals site that now competes with other increasingly popular vacation rental marketplaces such as HomeAway and Airbnb. Aside from Europe, Priceline is also seeking to expand into the Asian travel market with its Agoda.com business and an alliance with Chinese travel agency Ctrip.com for outbound travel from Asia.Priceline's biggest acquisition to date has been the $2.1 billion it paid for Kayak in May 2013, but this has proven to be a smart move so far, as Kayak brought in $69 million in revenue in just Q1 2014, contributing 7% of Priceline's inorganic revenue growth. Kayak has allowed Priceline to diversify its revenue mix to include travel media and advertising and also compete with other travel search sites such as Google and trivago. Priceline is also currently in the process of purchasing OpenTable.com (NASDAQ:OPEN), an online restaurant reservations company, in a $2.6 billion all-cash transaction. Given the close relationship between travel and dining, this makes sense for Priceline, and it also gives Priceline entry into another lucrative market. However, OpenTable faces stiff competition from immensely popular restaurant-ratings app Yelp (NYSE:YELP), which is planning to offer free reservation services for restaurants, whereas OpenTable requires a commission.Expedia:Expedia also has some enticing strategies for growth up its sleeve. It currently captures only 4% of the worldwide OTA market share, meaning it too has significant room to grow. In 2013, it acquired German travel meta-search site trivago.com for $625 million, which contribute to its business in much the same way Kayak does for Priceline. trivago, too, has been a shrewd acquisition, growing 80% over the past year. Expedia is also seeking expand its European market share by acquiring Italy-based hotel and vacation rentals site Venere.com in 2008 and Nordic travel company VIA in 2012 and partnering with Accor, Europe's leading hotel operator, to increase its European hotel inventory. Moving in on the Asian travel market, Expedia established an agreement with eLong, mainland China's leading travel planning website, in 2012 to further expand hotel booking options for users. It also started a joint venture with AirAsia, Asia's leading low-cost airline in 2011 and a partnership with Indian company Thomas Cook Visa & Passport Services to provide visa assistance services to its customers.Expedia has also recently formed an eight-year agreement with Travelocity, another full-service travel planning site, in which Expedia provides content, inventory, customer service, and technology for Travelocity while Travelocity provides marketing services. In effect, this agreement removed Travelocity as one of Expedia's competitors, essentially converting it into a marketing business, and allows Expedia to better compete with Priceline. In addition, Expedia debuted its Expedia Traveler Preference Program in 2012, which allows travelers to pay when checking out of hotels rather than at the outset. This shifts the responsibility of payment collection and credit card processing fees to hotels, which now invoice Expedia rather than Expedia invoicing them, but while this model is more costly for hotels, it also increases their traffic flow. Ultimately, the ETP initiative should improve Expedia's margins and allow it to better compete with agency model players.Conclusion: Which itinerary should investors follow?Priceline and Expedia are both great businesses that each still have significant room to grow, but Priceline is currently better positioned with a larger share of the international OTA market. Since Priceline is moving in on the North American market and Expedia is aiming to grow internationally, the two businesses will no doubt run into each other, but due to prime positioning and strategic acquisitions, both should see continued growth in the years to come. Ultimately, however, with a stronger performance in all categories, Priceline provides a more enticing package for investors.1 The ""17 Factor Growth Stock Ranker"" screener and ""Twelve Strong Large Cap Growth Stocks"" watchlist can be imported into your account for free from the Stock Rover library.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2290603,23479,2014-06-27T16:24:16-04:00,"Expedia registered a robust 25% and 23% rise in hotel gross bookings in 2012 and 2013, respectively, as travelers switched from traditional methods to online for reservations.While we expect the hotels division to register healthy growth in bookings, we estimate that its revenue margins will decline.This will be attributable to faster growth in agency model bookings as compared to merchant model bookings.","Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) is a leading online travel agency that connects travelers with travel suppliers such as hotels, airlines, cruises and car rental companies. It operates several online travel websites, including expedia.com, hotels.com, hotwire.com and trivago.com. The company also runs a corporate travel business, Egencia, which seeks to optimize travel costs and improve the travel experience for employees of its corporate clients.With a revenue contribution of 72% and gross bookings contribution of 46%, hotel bookings is the most important division in Expedia's portfolio. The division makes money by earning commissions on hotel reservations. In addition to accounting for a majority of its revenue, hotel bookings offer around 19% revenue margin which also makes it the most profitable division, compared to airlines (~2%) and car rentals & cruises (~8%). In this article, we highlight the key trends impacting Expedia's hotel divison.We have a $77 price estimate for Expedia's stock, in line with its market price.International Expansion And Broader Roll-Out Of ETP To Fuel Gross Bookings GrowthWe estimate that Expedia registered a robust 25% and 23% rise in hotel gross bookings in 2012 and 2013, respectively, as travelers switched from traditional methods to online mode for reservations. Increased adoption of the Expedia Traveler Preference (ETP) program, which was launched in the back half of 2012, was also one of the major drivers that fueled the growth. ETP allows travelers to choose between paying for bookings upfront (merchant model) and paying after the stay is completed (agency model). Prior to the rollout of ETP, Expedia was predominantly a merchant model company. Hotels are adopting ETP at a fast pace since many guests prefer to pay at the time of checking out of the hotel. Over 45,000 hotels have signed up for the ETP program to date. [1]With more than 40% market share, Expedia is the dominant OTA in the U.S., the world's largest travel market. However, the U.S. is also a slow growing and highly competitive market which is pushing Expedia to pursue international expansion for future growth. International markets currently account for 44% of Expedia's total gross bookings and 47% of its total revenues. The company has a stated goal of deriving more than half of its revenues from international points of sale. [2]To achieve this target, Expedia is rapidly growing in Asia via its partnership with the Chinese OTA eLong. The company is building a stronger foothold in Europe also through the acquisition of Trivago, a German meta-search company that has an inventory of more than 750,000 hotels (before the Trivago acquisition Expedia had only 200,000 hotels) from more than 200 booking sites in 40 countries. [2]We expect Expedia's expanding list of hotels and growing international presence to propel the future growth in gross bookings at more than 10% annually until 2016. Thereafter, we forecast the growth rate to slow down owing to increasing competition from other OTAs, meta-search companies and hotels that are increasingly selling their services online.Rising Competition And Agency Model Revenues Will Drive Down Revenue MarginsWhile we expect the hotels division to register healthy growth in bookings, we estimate that its revenue margins will decline. This will be attributable to faster growth in agency model bookings as compared to merchant model bookings, as a result of the broader rollout of ETP. Revenue margins (revenue per transaction) under the agency model are lower, as Expedia simply acts as a travel agent and earns a small commission on bookings, while under the merchant model revenue margins are higher as the transaction is completed on Expedia's website itself. The waiver of processing, cancellation and change fees by OTAs and travel suppliers in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage will also drive down revenue margins. Based on these factors, we estimate revenue margins on hotel bookings to fall below 17% by the end of our forecast period.Expansion Into Low ADR Regions Will Negatively Impact Overall ADR GrowthPhoCusWright estimates that the online travel market in Asia-Pacific grew by 18% in 2013 to $93.4 billion. [3] Expedia plans to continue expanding aggressively in the highly lucrative and vast travel industry of the Asia-Pacific region. While the growth in this region will increase booking volumes, we believe it will counteract ADR growth achieved by Expedia in the U.S. and Europe, because ADRs in Asia-Pacific are lower than in the U.S. and Europe.Disclosure: No positions."
2197873,62713,2014-05-07T08:31:42-04:00,"Expedia continues to defy the odds and demonstrate that it is one of the best travel sites on the market.Although competition will continue to be fierce, there are still plenty of growth opportunities for this company.As sites like Yahoo, Google and Facebook continue to evolve, online travel will eventually be on their radar. And Expedia is in the perfect spot to be acquired.","It seems fitting to say that shares of online travel company Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) have come a long way. Since reaching the low of 2009, the stock has surged well over 900% to Tuesday's close of $70.51. This level of success has caused investors to wonder about an exit strategy. While Expedia operates in a highly competitive environment, which includes rivals like Priceline.com (PCLN) and Orbitz Worldwide (NYSE:OWW), the company has held its own. And if first-quarter results were any indication, Expedia has no plans on going anywhere undesirable.First-quarter revenue rose 19% to $1.20 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $1.18 billion. Management said the strong was primarily driven by strong demand in hotel revenue, which surged 12% year-over-year. This is even with the 10% decline in daily room rates, which management said was due to expanding its hotel offerings and its shift toward hotels in Asia-Pacific.These promotions and discounts were offset by strong growth in advertising and media, which grew 116%, helped by the contributions of Trivago, which Expedia took a stake in last year. So if you're keeping score at home, that's 4% growth that was not organic this quarter. Still, it all matters on the bottom line. All told, Airfare revenue jumped 28% as Expedia sold 30% more tickets.The company posted a 15% increase in domestic revenue, while international revenue increased 23% (23% excluding foreign exchange). Interestingly, however, international revenue, which arrived to $559 million, now accounts for 47% of worldwide revenue, up 2% year-over-year. This supports my belief that the company's marketing has begun to pay dividends.What's more, this continues Expedia's solid revenue performances, which now makes five consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. Even more impressive, during that span, revenue has grown by an average of 18%. In terms of profits, Expedia has delivered in that area, as well.The company posted a first-quarter loss of $14.3 million, narrowing its loss from a year ago, helped by the higher revenue. This amounted to 11 cents per share, beating estimate by 4 cents. Last year, Expedia posted a loss of $104.2 million, or 77 cents per share. Excluding items such as depreciation and stock-based compensation costs, Expedia earned 16 cents per share, beating estimates by 2 cents.Remarkably, the company was able to post a solid profit beat, even as expenses increased 20%, mostly related to marketing costs. But as noted, Expedia, which runs its own brand website and others such as Hotels.com and Hotwire, has seen strong revenue figures. This tells me that the company is getting a solid return on these marketing investments.I don't know if the company could have enjoyed a 29% surge in gross bookings without spending some money. Domestic gross bookings increased 35%, and international gross bookings increased 21% (22% excluding foreign exchange). And even if I wanted to raise an eyebrow at the 20% increase in expenses, I would have to do it in the context that it didn't impact revenue margin in a meaningful way. By ""meaningful"", I'm referring to 1.5-point or 2-point declines in margins. But with revenue margin maintaining its high single-digit level, I was impressed.From my vantage point, Expedia continues to defy the odds and demonstrate that it is one of the best travel sites on the market. Although competition will continue to be fierce, there are still plenty of growth opportunities for this company. So margins compression is a worthwhile concern. To the extent that is justifies selling this stock, I don't believe it does.As sites like Yahoo (YHOO), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) continue to evolve, online travel will eventually be on their radar. And Expedia is in the perfect spot to be acquired. With shares still trading 14% from their 52-week high of $81.78, I would definitely hop onboard here and ride this company to $80 by the end of the year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Wall Street Playbook's consumer sector analyst.

Valuation has reared its head. Note that the mid/large cap YTD aggregate performance of Internet & catalog retail is -14.4%.Source: Thomson Reuters Eikon, StarMineBargains or bulls?Is it yet time to go bargain hunting? In aggregate, one suspects the answer to be no - conceivably the historical equivalent of going bargain hunting in the third quarter of 2000, or in late 1929 when the market was down 47.9% and no one remotely conceived of an eventual peak to trough decline of 89%.Yet the bulls still have their points - no one is going bankrupt, the perverse U.S. tax code ensures these companies maintain mountains of cash offshore and companies are mostly profitable with positive cash flow. While accurate, these comments misstate the actual issue.Large-cap tech stocks do not need to go bankrupt to deliver a lousy return. They merely need to underperform the lofty expectations built into current prices - and even after YTD underperformance, all of these firms are expecting double-digit earnings growth for the next 10 years. That doesn't sound like the end of an adjustment cycle.Not all Internet retail stocks lean toward overvaluation. Take Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE). When it comes to travel, the Internet has driven a fundamental shift in consumer behavior. Once, we called travel agents and made hotel reservations by mail; now we do those things in minutes online.Source: Thomson Reuters Eikon, StarMineCheap by comparisonEXPE has delivered strong returns for its shareholders over the last five years - almost 400%, but with a P/E that's still only in the mid-teens and a Price/Intrinsic Valuation ratio of 1.03, compared to an industry average of 2.23.

This model looks at the types of firm characteristics that fund managers seem to be using to drive their current stock holdings - is valuation in vogue? ROE? Sales growth? Leverage? Earnings revisions? Based on current analysis of fund manager holdings, EXPE has the type of profile that's likely to result in an increase in institutional holdings, which is normally supportive (to say the least) of the stock price. For the curious - analyst upgrades, volume, earnings upgrades, change in accruals and revenue growth (this year/last year) are some of the main factors driving its high score.Source: Thomson Reuters Eikon, StarMinePlanes, trains, automobiles - and valueWhile not inexpensive, EXPE would appear to be a lower beta play for parking your money within the tech sector while the market tries to determine fair value for many of these players.

It has shown itself to be relatively immune to this year's valuation adjustments (it's actually up, YTD) and looks likely to be in vogue with the asset management community.It's not cheap, but for those needing internet exposure without volatility -- or sleepless nights -- perhaps it's a more peaceful journey.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Alpha Now at Thomson Reuters is a team of expert analysts that are constantly looking at the financial landscape in order to keep you up to date on the latest movements.

2137263,23478,2014-04-11T09:58:20-04:00,,"By Jeff BaileyExpedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), since the spin-off of its travel content unit TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) in December 2011, has been on a tear, matching the advance of its online travel agency rival Priceline (PCLN) and tripling the gain in the S&P 500. PCLN data by YChartsThe market has been rewarding Expedia for its recent run of rapid revenue growth, pushing up valuation metrics such as PE ratio. EXPE PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsBut as with too many tech and online businesses these days -- we’ll mention Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) – revenue gains at Expedia have been painful to achieve, coming at the expense of once-lush operating margins. Let’s look back four years to before the TripAdvisor spinoff and compare margins to those at Priceline. PCLN Operating Margin (TTM) data by YChartsWhat you’re seeing mostly is the stupendous results of Priceline’s 2005 acquisition of booking.com, which put it in the foreign hotel room business. The deal was visionary and brilliant. U.S. hotel chains and airlines are highly consolidated. They don’t need travel agencies to sell tickets and rooms, and consumers don’t need the agencies to find a Hyatt (NYSE:H) or to find Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). But the fragmented overseas hotel industry does need middlemen, and it pays richly when rooms are booked on its behalf.The booking.com acquisition is one of the great pieces of M&A work in recent years, and one can hear Expedia’s envy as it describes its own business, the competition it faces and its goals in its 10-K filing:Poor Expedia. Priceline is way ahead, its international business accounting for 85% of gross bookings and 94% of operating income in 2013. (And Priceline runs most of it through a Netherlands unit, which is taxed minimally.) Expedia setting a goal of half sales coming from international seems to be aiming for mediocre returns, as it competes against a company with superior margins that keep widening.Expedia’s stock run-up has pushed its valuation, on a traiing basis, ahead of Priceline’s, which seems to make little sense. Unleash some financial advisor tools to learn more.PCLN PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsOh, sure, there’s the argument that in playing catch-up, Expedia has more room to run. But as we reported earlier, it appears Priceline is far more efficient in its online advertising spend -- $1.8 billion last year – and in converting visitors to its site into customers. Priceline has been refining an operation that’s already well positioned in the most lucrative travel field – foreign hotels – while Expedia is still trying to match its rival’s reach in the area; Priceline in 2013 had 425,000 properties to rent you a room from, Expedia 260,000.[One indisputable winner in online travel is Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), as overall online advertising has become more expensive for travel agencies, letting Google keep a rising share of consumer spending on travel.](As we reported, TripAdvisor also seems pricey after its run-up.)In a stock market correction, or economic downturn, both Expedia and Priceline would likely suffer. People travel less when they’re economically stressed. But the substantially superior basis for Priceline’s success might cushion it somewhat from those factors. And in a continuing upswing, it’s the swifter competitor.Disclosure: None"
1988231,24706,2014-02-03T08:31:28-05:00,,"By Craig BowlesOverviewExpedia, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) is slated to report 4Q 2013 earnings after the bell on Thursday, February 6. The earnings release is expected at approximately 4:00 p.m. EST followed at 4:30 p.m. with a webcast presentation available through Expedia Investor Relations. This economically sensitive company is one of the top two global online travel agents and could therefore influence direction of the index futures and other broad market gauges.Outliers & StrategyKey measures:Recent NewsTechnical ReviewExpedia is trading at a similar price as last year at this time but showed 30% downside in between, so the stock has been beyond both sides of the previous $56-$64 balance area. This past Friday, shares fell below the 50-day moving average with recent relative performance appearing less than optimistic about the earnings report and emerging market chaos worries. Analyst estimates, however, have remained firm, so a positive earnings report could get the stock back above $66 level which would push shares to retest the high. A negative report and it's hard to make a case that the stock will find support at the $57.50 200-day moving average. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryAs great a company as Expedia is, being the king of global travel booking has a severe downside when global chaos emerges as we found out in 2008. Expedia is an exciting story that also pays a 0.9% dividend yield. The stock has fluctuated wildly during the last year, partly because earnings have missed and beaten estimates by such large margins on two out of the four releases. Given the potential for earnings surprises and large price moves in the past year, a disappointing report on Thursday could exacerbate an already precarious test below the 50-day moving average. Conversely, the stock has rebounded back to similar levels as a year ago which were all-time highs, so upside technical resistance is limited above $66.00. Given the P/E is double Expedia's 5-year average, risk of a downside move is higher.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

1687932,23479,2013-09-11T14:02:02-04:00,,"Expedia’s (NASDAQ:EXPE) stock has declined by about 25% since its Q2 2013 earnings announcement on July 25. Although revenues grew by 16% y-o-y, investors were disappointed as net income declined by more than 30%. In the first half of 2013, Expedia’s EBITDA margin faced high pressure owing to heavy advertising from competitors. The company’s average daily growth (ADR) growth also remained flat due to increase in contribution from low ADR hotel bookings in Asia.We recently lowered our price estimate for Expedia as we expect the company’s EBITDA margin and ADR to grow slower than our initial estimates. (Read: Expedia’s $62 Fair Value: Expansion Opportunities Outweigh Margin Pressures) Despite the downward revision, our price estimate of $62 for Expedia stands at a premium of over 20% to the current market price as we believe that the company’s expanding international footprint, improving scale of the advertising business and growing strength in mobile bookings and hotel bookings position the company for better growth than the past few quarters have shown.International Expansion Is An Important Growth DriverExpedia is the biggest U.S. online travel agency in terms of gross bookings, and the company has been focused on expanding its leadership position in international markets. The revenue contribution from international markets has nearly doubled for Expedia in the past five to six years from 24% in 2007 to around 45% at present.The agency model for hotel bookings is experiencing greater acceptance in Europe due to a large number of small and independent hotels in the region. Such hotels prefer the agency model for bookings as it allows guests to pay at check-out. In line with this, the Expedia Traveler Preference (ETP) program, which gives guests the option to choose from the merchant or agency models of payment, is gaining popularity in Europe. Over 30,000 hotels have signed up for the new program till date. [1]Rising per capita income in emerging economies also provide tremendous growth opportunities for travel agencies. Additionally, Internet penetration in these economies is relatively low and is expected to grow at a rapid pace, which leaves immense potential for growth in the online travel industry as a whole.The acquisition of VIA Travel by Egencia, the Air-Asia Expedia joint venture, the growing popularity of hotel.com, the collaboration with Fotopedia Paris & Fotopedia Japan, and the eLong partnership to expand in China are factors that have contributed to Expedia’s growth in international hotel bookings. We believe these will continue to be the guiding factors for its future growth as well.Increasing Strength In Hotel BookingsHotel bookings is the most important division in Expedia’s portfolio. It contributes approximately 62% to the company’s valuation as per our estimate. In addition to accounting for the majority of its revenue, hotel bookings offer around 20% revenue margin which also makes it the most profitable division compared to airlines (2%) and car rentals & cruises (9%).Backed by near 20% growth in global room nights booked, Expedia registered 12% y-o-y growth in hotel revenue in Q2 2013. Although these growth rates are lower than those achieved in the past quarters, we believe the company’s market share will increase in domestic as well as international markets in the future.Expedia recently entered into a strategic marketing agreement with Travelocity that will allow the former to sell inventory in the U.S. through the latter. In effect, Travelocity will act as an additional distribution channel for Expedia, helping it to counter rising competition from Priceline.com (PCLN) and Booking.com in the domestic market. For more insights on the Expedia-Travelocity deal, read our article Expedia Is Better Positioned For Growth After The Travelocity Deal.We believe that Asian operations will drive growth in international bookings as the market is fragmented with a large a number of independent hotels. Such hotels have a greater reliance on OTAs to generate bookings compared to large hotel chains which can sell a good amount of inventory through their own websites. Advertising Is Now A Bigger Contributor To The Overall BusinessUntil 2012, advertising contributed marginally to total company revenues. However, with the acquisition of Trivago the division’s revenue contribution increased close to 7% in Q2 2013. With over 600,000 hotels and 140 booking sites across 30 countries in Europe, Trivago is one of the leading meta-search engines for hotel bookings in the region. It has managed to double its revenues each year since 2008.Expedia spent 33% more on sales and marketing in Q2 2013 compared to the same quarter last year, and Trivago accounted for 11% out of the 33%. Expedia plans to continue investing aggressively in Trivago to globally expand the business in key travel markets, including the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. [2] Although such investments will impact the company’s bottom line, we believe they will also drive strong growth in the advertising division. According to our analysis, Expedia’s advertising revenues will increase by over 100% y-o-y in 2013 due to the acquisition of Trivago, and grow in high-single digits to low-double digits thereafter. Rising Mobile Penetration Expedia claims that over 50 million apps have been downloaded across all of its brands and geographic regions. The hotels.com app is one of the top ranked apps in many countries. The company launched new apps and mobile websites in Q2 2013 across several of its brands, including Hotwire.com, which introduced an iPad app that features interactive maps and a simplified booking process that allows users to cut travel booking time by half. ((Expedia, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2013 Results, Expedia Inc, July 2013)) Expedia is also striving to increase mobile bookings by spreading awareness about the Expedia app through its newly launched TV campaign. [3]The company aims to cover 20% of its transactions via mobile devices by 2015. With a growing number of people using mobile devices to go online, we believe the mobile platform offers immense growth potential for travel services. Additionally, mobile bookings present an opportunity to generate incremental revenues as they are usually made over shorter booking windows.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"

Other stocks mentioned: Chart Industries (NASDAQ:GTLS), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), US Airways (LCC), Delta (NYSE:DAL)The street is obsessed with bubble talk. Cramer doesn't think in terms of the market as a whole as overvalued, but individual stocks like Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and SolarCity (OTCQX:SCTY) that have rich valuations. Some of these valuations might be justified, since ""cult stocks"" have a tendency to go higher, and those who have positions in these stocks care more about growth trajectory than short-term profitability. The bubble talk brought down Facebook (FB) and Starbucks (SBUX), even as both reported strong quarters.

However, Cramer recommended digging deeper into the report; Costco is doing well. Traffic is rising, markets are strong and Costco plans to double its store count. Holiday items, apparel, hardware are all strong. CEO Craig Jelinek admitted that TV sets and computers were weak and that Costco needs to expand its cosmetics offerings.

(EXPE) is slated to report 1Q 2014 earnings after the bell on Thursday, May 1st.Adjusted Earnings Per Share: The current Street estimate is $0.15 (range $0.07 to $0.31).Revenues: Analysts expect an increase of 16.6% y/y to $1.18 bln (range $1.13 bln to $1.25 bln).","By: Craig BowlesOverviewExpedia, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) is slated to report 1Q 2014 earnings after the bell on Thursday, May 1st. The earnings release is expected at approximately 4:00 p.m. EST followed at 4:30 p.m. with a webcast presentation available through Expedia Investor Relations. This economically sensitive company is one of the top two global online travel agents and could therefore influence direction of the index futures and other broad market gauges.Outliers & StrategyKey measures:Recent NewsTechnical ReviewExpedia has given back much of the upside that followed the previous earnings release and shows a $67.50-$74.00 balance area. Highs show a subtle upward trend which the stock had gotten above but has corrected back to. Downside corrections have been increasingly violent in recent years but could find initial support at the $62 200-day moving average. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryAs great a company as Expedia is, being the king of global travel booking has a severe downside when global chaos emerges as we found out in 2008. Expedia has beaten estimates three out of the last four quarters and should be assisted by estimates having been more than halved from three months ago. The stock was punished after a 2c beat, so probably needs to beat estimates by more than that. A 3-4c beat would put EPS closer to the middle of the analyst range of 19c. Q1 bookings were running ahead of estimates through February and $1.19 bln is the middle of the analyst range, so might be more of a focus. Given the P/E is still well above Expedia's 5-year average, risk on a downside move is enhanced.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

1744842,25120,2013-10-14T20:21:03-04:00,,"Shares of Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) took a beating in Monday's trading session after analysts at Deutsche Bank took a cautious stance on the company's prospects.I must agree with Deutsche Bank, as I have been quite cautious on Expedia for a while. I am concerned about the competitive position of the firm as competition in the online travel industry only continues to intensify.I remain on the sideline awaiting clues about the competitive position at the third quarter earnings report, scheduled to be released in a few weeks' time.Deutsche Bank Is CautiousAnalyst Ross Sandler downgraded Expedia from ""Buy"" to ""Hold,"" giving the company a $51 price target.Sandler believes there are three possible scenarios for the company in the short run. A ""Quick Fix"" allows the company to meet its full-year guidance. The ""Almost Gets There"" fixes the second quarter issues, but creates additional costs for onboarding the Travelcity deal and other items. The worst case scenario is the ""Breakdown"" case in which Expedia sees further execution and competitive issues, prompting management to guide downwards again.While Deutsche Bank was quite optimistic about a ""Quick Fix,"" or an ""Almost Gets There Fix"" outcome, it now believes the ""Breakdown"" scenario has become more likely. Recent management changes at Hotels.com and poor quarterly channel checks make Deutsche quite pessimistic into the next earnings report.ValuationExpedia ended its second quarter with $2.30 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments. Total debt stood at $1.25 billion, for a net cash position just over a billion dollars.Revenues for the first six months of the year came in at $2.22 billion, up 19.4% on the year before. Expedia reported a $32.7 million loss compared to a $102.0 million profit a year ago. The company took $166 million in amortization charges, legal reserves, and acquisition-related charges, mostly in the first quarter.At this pace annual revenues could come in around $4.7 billion, as Expedia could report a modest annual profit.Factoring losses of 7%, with shares trading around $48 per share, the market values Expedia at $6.5 billion. Excluding the net cash position, operating assets are valued around $5.5 billion.This values operating assets of the firm at 1.2 times estimated annual revenues for 2013 and a not too meaningful profit multiple.Expedia pays a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 1.2%.Some Historical PerspectiveShares of Expedia have seen solid returns over the long run as the online travel market has grown a lot. Shares rose from lows around $7 in 2009 to a peak around $68 earlier this year. Ever since, shares have given up roughly 70% of their value, trading around $48 at the moment.Between 2009 and 2012, Expedia has grown its annual revenues by a cumulative 47% to $4.03 billion. At the same time, earnings fell from $300 million in 2009 to $280 million last year.Investment ThesisInvestors in Expedia have had a rough year so far, while equity markets have performed well. Shares trade with year to date losses of around 21% as competition is intensifying putting pressure on Expedia's earnings, and its valuation.I last took a look at Expedia's prospects back in April of this year, when the company reported its first quarter results. I concluded that investors were disappointed as competition is intensifying, prompting shares to fall to levels around $56 per share.As shares have fallen even further towards $48 per share, the valuation of operating assets has also dropped to $5.5 billion, or roughly 20 times last year's earnings of $280 million.In hindsight investors were not too happy with the expensive deal of Trivago, announced back in December of 2012. The $564 million deal added an estimated $120 million in revenues -- quite a premium compared to Expedia's valuation at just 1.2 times annual revenues.While the market is still growing rapidly, Expedia is facing headwinds from tough competitors, including Priceline.com (PCLN), among others. While Expedia is still growing rapidly, competition is increasing, which is hurting margins. At the same time online advertising, notably on platforms like those offered by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is becoming more expensive, resulting in a double impact on earnings.I have to reiterate my stance from first quarter. I do like the long-term prospects of the online travel industry. Yet I see short to medium term pressure on earnings, while the stock has sold off another 15% from the levels in April. Investors are fearful about the fact that firms like Priceline.com might outcompete Expedia by undercutting it entirely.This downgrade will most likely put pressure on consensus estimates for third quarter earnings, scheduled to be released on the 7th of November. While the absolute valuation is somehow justifiable, it is notably the relative revenue multiples versus the likes of Priceline.com that might start to look appealing. That being said, profitability is eroding quickly as Expedia's competitive position seems to be undercut at the moment.As above, I remain on the sidelines awaiting the third quarter earnings report to find out more clues about the valuation and competitive position of the firm.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1447821,23479,2013-05-20T14:27:45-04:00,,"With over $1 billion in Q1 2013 revenues (a 24% y-o-y increase), leading online travel agency Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) made a promising start to fiscal 2013. However, while all  of its other brands continued to grow at healthy rates, Hotwire.com  faced some challenges which limited Expedia’s growth. The company  anticipates the weakness in Hotwire to continue in the current quarter  as well and consequently lowered its 2013 EBITDA guidance by $20-$30  million.Hotwire is an opaque travel website that  offers its users travel deals for airfare, hotels, car rentals, cruises  and vacation packages at discounted rates. In an opaque pricing model,  which offers discounts as high as 60% over traditional online booking  options, a user can see the price but not the name of the supplier until  they make a non-refundable payment. In a tough macro environment, an  opaque booking system offers lucrative deals to travelers and enables  suppliers to get rid of their excess inventory. Opaque bookings accounts  for approximately 10% of Expedia’s revenue and an even higher  percentage of its profits.Expedia claims that the sluggishness in Hotwire’s business can be  offset by increasing revenues from VIA Travel and the  recent acquisition of leading meta-search company Trivago. It aims  to focus on innovating and improving its products and services by  investing in new technologies to drive growth across geographical  segments. We believe that with an expanding international presence, the  robust growth in hotel bookings and a focus on developing its mobile  platform, the company is well-equipped to leverage growth in the global  online travel market.In this article we discuss in detail the key factors that impact Hotwire’s growth potential.Priceline’s Launch of Express Deals Has Increased Competition With the launch of ""Express Deals"" in July 2012, Priceline  (PCLN) now offers three ways to book hotels on its website --  clear listing, ""name your own price,"" and the Express Deals. In the  last few months, Priceline has increased its advertising efforts both  online and offline, which has contributed to the popularity and success  of Express Deals.Offering thousands of great deals on hotels,  Express Deals allows  users to view price, amenities, star level of the hotel, locality and  user ratings, but not the name of the hotel, which is only revealed post  a non-refundable payment by the customer. Offering discounts of up to  45%, Express Deals is covered by Priceline’s Big Deal guarantee, which  promises to pay the user an amount of $25 and match any lower price that  the user finds for the same hotel on competing websites.Priceline has extended Express Deals as a mobile booking  application available for the iPhone, Android and Mobile Web, and claims  to be getting a good response on the same. In addition to rising rental  car reservations, improved hotel room nights aided by express deals  helped Priceline register 9% annual growth in domestic gross bookings.  (See also: ""Priceline's Pulsing Growth Will Inevitably Slow Down."")Hotwire faces competition from other leading players in addition to  Priceline such as Travelocity’s top secret hotels and from smaller  players such as Get Going, lastminute.com and Wotif’s Wot hotel?Improving Macro Conditions Lead to a Decline in Opaque BookingsOpaque booking systems are more attractive to leisure travelers in a  tough macro environment as they offer deep discounts over the  traditional online booking option. However, with an improving macro  environment, travel suppliers witness higher occupancy rates for their  products and are less likely to offer their inventory at discounted  prices.Though Hotwire offers the opaque booking option for all travel  products -- air tickets, hotels, cruises and car rentals -- the system is  more popular for hotel bookings. We estimate hotel bookings to  contribute close to 70% to Expedia’s valuation. With revenue margins of  approximately 20%, hotels are also the most profitable travel product  for OTAs as compared to air tickets (~2%) and car rentals & cruises  (~9%).The opaque booking model is more attractive for OTAs in terms of  revenue margins earned. Thus, if there is a drastic decline in opaque  bookings, it can reduce hotel revenue margins earned by Expedia.Weakness in the Domestic Car BusinessThe continued fleet constraint along with rising prices created a  tough environment for the opaque pricing model last quarter. Car rental  rates are expected to absorb operating expenses such as fuel costs,  rising cost of automobiles and other operating expenses. Given that the  car rentals industry is becoming more competitive, there is increasing  consolidation which is reducing the number of players in the market.We believe that the above trends are likely to persist for the rest  of the year. The opaque pricing model is more suitable for  price-sensitive customers. With rising car rental fees, we expect a  lower percentage of car booking through the opaque model.ConclusionThough Hotwire is expanding internationally, Expedia believes that  the footprint is not large enough to drive growth in the business. On  the other hand, the acquisition of VIA travel has contributed to  Expedia’s growth in the last few quarters. Additionally, the company  recently acquired Trivago which is a leading meta-search engine for  hotel bookings in Europe. In Q1 2013, the inclusion of Trivago for less  than a month added more than 1.5% to Expedia’s global revenue growth. While the company expects to witness weakness in its Hotwire brand for  the rest of 2013, we believe that higher revenues from Trivago and VIA  Travel will contribute to its growth momentum. (See also: ""Can Expedia Take More Share In The European Hotel Market With Trivago Deal?"")Our price estimate of $69 for Expedia is at a premium of over 10% to the current market price.Disclosure: No positions."
1689882,23469,2013-09-12T07:54:41-04:00,,"As we will show in this article, we believe that Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) is a good mid-term long opportunity on a combination of unrealized potential, recent weakness, and its elevated short float at nearly 12%. While the company is operating at a 40+ PE ratio, the company is below 15 in future PE, and we believe that the market is not correctly valuing the potential of EXPE moving past 2013. The combination of the company's overhaul of old technology, growth of its investments in companies like trivago, eLong (NASDAQ:LONG), and VIA for Egencia, and mobile growth make us believe that Expedia has strong upside. In our ""Bear Case,"" we will refute current negatives that investors and analysts are pushing forward about EXPE. We will highlight that these issues are mostly short-term in nature and do not properly understand the overall movement EXPE is taking. Using a discounted cash flow analysis (located at the end), we are estimating that EXPE has no less than 60% and up to 100% upside that should play out over the next 6-12 months as the second half of the year performs better and gears up for a promising 2014.CatalystsThe company has performed a number of promising acquisitions/investments that we believe help the company fill some necessary gaps and add strong organic growth. The three main business lines that we believe add the most attractive catalyst growth are trivago, eLong, and VIA for Egencia. The company has a 61% equity stake in trivago, partnership and stake in eLong, and acquired VIA in 2012 fully to build out its Egencia brand.The current situation for EXPE is that they have seen Brand Expedia start to slow down a bit in its growth and see rising competition from Priceline's (PCLN) business lines, mostly from Booking.com. Therefore, the company needs new growth initiatives. One of the most important ones is their trivago stake that the company has. Trivago is a hotel metasearch engine that is mostly based in Europe. Hotels are the most profitable portion of the travel industry, and the company's stake here gives them a large inventory of hotels. On Expedia, for example, the company has 200K hotels on inventory. Trivago has over 700K hotels with 140 booking sites in thirty countries. In the latest quarter, trivago added 4 percentage points to revenue growth, which came in at 16% for the quarter. We can see that trivago is already offering a lot of potential growth. International revenue was up 24%, driven mostly by trivago and European exposure growth.Further, Expedia is now scaling trivago's business outside of the USA. In the latest quarter, the company expanded trivago into Argentina, Chile, Colombia, India, Singapore, and South Korea. Why is trivago so important to the future of EXPE?Trivago has skills in hotel supply, hotel relationships, and brand awareness in Europe. It's weaker in technology and mobile. EXPE can take their skill in tech and mobile and apply it to a name that is familiar in Europe. Further, Trivago allows Expedia to compete in Europe with Booking.com and PCLN's recently acquired Kayak. Some comparisons of Trivago versus Kayak in Europe - in Madrid, Trivago offers 1200 while Kayak offers just over 900. In Vienna, Trivago has over 1100, while Kayak has 700 properties. This pattern is similar all over Europe. Europe is fragmented with smaller independent hotels, so the use of OTAs is obviously more important here. Further, the online penetration for Europe is just over 60%, so there is lots of potential for trivago to grow from more individuals coming online. Another interesting note came from the company's CFO in a Goldman Sachs conference. There he noted that the growth of mobile is bringing a whole new style of traveling for people that book day of or very shortly before they need a hotel, flight, car, etc. Those people would go through tour books or book something upon arrival. Now, they can turn to mobile apps to make a quick reservation. That new style of traveler is something that will also create traction for trivago as their technology improves.""In its first quarter as an Expedia business, trivago continued its international push and grew its revenue nearly 80% year-over-year. Trivago is continuing its global expansion and is currently focusing ramp-up efforts in some very key markets, including the U.S., Canada and Australia, New Zealand."" - Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO Q2 2013 earnings callWhat kind of growth can trivago create?The company has doubled revenue every year since 2008, and it will allow EXPE to create a better revenue makeup. Right now, EXPE has about 75% of its earnings from hotels versus more than 95% for PCLN. The European market is expected to grow CAGR of nearly 6% through 2016 versus under 5% for the USA. Further, Eastern Europe offers much more growth potential than any area of the domestic market for EXPE. Trivago should grow at a much higher rate than that 6% average as it increases technology, mobile exposure, and moves into new markets. Trivago made around $130M in 2012, so we can expect to see around $200M in 2013. Growth should slow from 100% due to harder comps, but we should still see 40-50% growth per year through 2017 as the company moves into new markets, expands its role in Europe, and adds technology. We should see around 800M (on the low side) to 1B (on the bull side) in revenue by 2017, which adds 20%+ in growth over the next 4.5 years alone. In the latter part of our article, we will show how these numbers work together to create a lot of upside.Another major catalyst for EXPE is their partnership with eLong. In the partnership, EXPE and eLong work together to share technology, hotel inventories, and work on expanding China's outbound business. The key for EXPE in the deal was to be able to get better Asian exposure, but eLong and Ctrip (CTRP) already pretty solidly own the domestic travel. The company, therefore, wanted to work on attracting customers going from China to foreign nations. This population will grow significantly as China's consumer class rises. In 2012, there were 84M outbound travelers from China, up 18% from 2011. Inbound travelers slowed in 2012, but expectations for around 40M added travelers per year entering China. Expedia's use of eLong will allow them to take advantage of those entering travelers. Both areas should continue to rise, but we can see that the potential is way higher for outbound in growth. They see the majority of growth for eLong in this area.In the past year, LONG made over 25% growth in revenue. In the TTM, the company has already grown 15% over 2011 numbers. How much more growth can one expect for eLong?The company's key will be room night growth, which grew at over 70% in Q1, while CTRP only grew 40%. The recent issue for EXPE with profit growth in eLong is due to aggressive marketing and coupons. Yet, we can see that the plan is paying off with LONG taking market share and growing their name in China. The tourism industry in China is expected to grow about 10% per year for domestic travel, and if LONG can take more of that market share, they will be able to see some solid growth. Additionally, OTA is still a small part of travel in China as the country only has online penetration at just over 40%. We estimate that LONG can grow at 25-35% per year in sales each year for the next several years. With even a 25% growth per year through 2017, we should see sales grow from 120M to 366M. We believe that expecting 400M - 450M in sales by 2017 can happen.Finally, we believe that Egencia is still a great growth place for Expedia. While EXPE has owned Egencia for nearly a decade, the company is seeing solid growth after the acquisition of VIA and we believe can continue to be a place of renewed growth over the next several years as the economies throughout the world get back on their feet. Egencia led to 7% growth in air tickets volume in the latest quarter and signed some promising deals with Jones Lang LaSalle, Volvo, and Newell Rubbermaid. The company will be the corporate travel solution for these companies. Moving forward, what are the prospects for Egencia?Egencia grew by 25% year/year in revenue to $95M in the latest quarter to move to over 320M in the latest TTM. The company should continue to see solid growth in this division. One prospect that helps is the company's acquisition off VIA, which is the leading corporate travel solution in the Nordics. VIA has helped to add a decent amount of the growth to Egencia, but we see EXPE as refocused on this division. The company's main issues in their OTA business has been raising competition, and the company believes that they can take market share in corporate travel to offset these issues. The division is the fifth-largest corporate travel company in the world, and they plan to grow business through a global growth approach. The acquisition of VIA helps them gain more exposure to European business. Egencia is making strong strides into other growth markets with a lot of attention to India, China, and other high-growth markets. Egencia will be able to grow at 20-25% per year over the next several years and can offer 750M-800M in revenue by 2017. The company has noted they are committed to Egencia as a major growth portion of the company.We see some strong catalysts in these three areas of Expedia business on top of growth from Expedia Brand (Expedia, Hotwire, Hotels) that can offer consistent growth at the 20-40% per year range (if not more). The company's current valuations and recent pullback do not effectively price in this future growth.Bear CaseThe bear case for EXPE has begun to take shape this year with concern growing over the company's rising competition from Booking.com, a division of Priceline, taking market share from Hotels.com and Hotwire. The two main bear cases are:1. Hotwire's slowdown in growth is causing a major negative for the company moving forward. The company dropped its total EBITDA growth by 20-30M due to weakness here.2. The competition is not going away for EXPE, and that could lead to more rough waters ahead.Bears grew fearful after the company's latest report. About Hotwire, the company noted in their latest earnings report:In addition, the challenges at Hotwire we called out last quarter were particularly in acute in Q2. And in fact, Hotwire's performance in the quarter was worse than we expected.Hotwire, Expedia's deal-based website with opaque travel deals that allow customers to get great deals but not know suppliers until they agree to buy, has created a large issue for EXPE. The business is 10% of EXPE's revenue, and a hit to it is a problem. Hotwire suffered as the car rental business shrunk in size and created higher prices for rentals. Further, PCLN upped competition with ""Express Deals."" It is another form of opaque travel and has been heavily marketed by PCLN.The Hotwire decline is definitely a concern for EXPE, but we believe that the stock has more than priced in this issue. Further, the company can make up for a decline here with larger bookings in the three growth areas we mentioned. Investors are solely focused on issues at Hotwire and have not paid any attention to the quiet growth potential of EXPE's foreign markets.In our model at the end, we will show a decline in domestic growth rates to a more sustainable 6-8%, while international revenue should be around 20-25% growth. EXPE's triple threat of international booking with VIA, eLong, and trivago, EXPE can more than make up for issues at Hotwire. The company has not noted a major plan to get Hotwire back on its feet, but a loss of business in Hotwire should be made up by growth elsewhere.Another main argument for bears is that Priceline's Booking.com is creating real competition for Hotels.com, and the space is becoming crowded with new international companies springing up and little economic moats. While it is true that moats are hard to create in the online travel industry, EXPE believes that the online travel space is a $1T business. Right now, PCLN and EXPE are bringing in just over $10B, so there is a ton of potential for the entire pie to get bigger. Catalysts for that include more international expansion, larger Internet penetration, and a movement to online travel over common travel methods that currently exist.DCF AnalysisSales: In the following analysis, we are going to assume a worst-case and best-case scenario. The most likely case falling in between the two levels. Our three main areas of growth are eLong, trivago, and Egencia. Our estimates are that trivago can offer 800M - 1B in sales by 2017. ELong can offer 400M - 500M in sales, and Egencia can offer around 700M - 800M. Therefore, the three combined on the bear side can offer 1.9B in sales. On the best-case side, we can see 2.3B in sales.Right now, Expedia makes about $4B in sales from Hotwire, Hotels, and Expedia websites. Assuming no growth in these areas, the company will add about 60% in growth from these three areas over the next five years. Assuming a 5% growth rate per year for these areas, we should have 4.9B by 2017. In a 7% CAGR model, we should see 5.6B.In our worst-case model, we will use 5.9B in sales for 2017. In the best case, we can assume 6.9B in sales.Operating margins: Margins have come down this year, but the company has noted these issues are temporary, and we would expect them to bounce back in 2H of 2013 back to an 8-10% level. The company is going through a large marketing campaign for new businesses and believes that 2014 comps will make margins stronger again. Therefore, we will assume a 9% operating margin for each year.Tax rate: Taxes have stayed consistently between 25-30%, and we will use a conservative 30% for the model.Depreciation and Amortization: Not a huge factor for an online business, but the company has seen it bounce back in 2013, and we expect it be around 4% of revenue, which is has been in past years.Capex: Been steadily on the rise as the company has returned more value to shareholders and increased acquisitions. We believe that consolidation will continue and should see capex rise 6-10% per year as a result of a shifting business environment.Using these numbers in our DCF analysis, in the worst-case scenario, we come up with a price target of $75 in the worst-case scenario. In the best case, we have an $87 target. If we land around $80, we are looking at 100% potential profits that should play out over the next 12-18 months for EXPE.ConclusionAs we can see, the situation at EXPE has left investors with a great opportunity. This is a cheap strong-growth name with plenty of upside left in the stock. Even with very conservative estimates for the current Brand Expedia, which are below market estimates, the stock can more than make up for these issues in other areas. We acknowledge the bear case, and we believe that its not focused on the big picture here. Look for Expedia to play catch up with Priceline.com and begin to see a lot of upside over the next 6-12 months with 100% potential by the end of 2014.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

1380651,25120,2013-04-29T06:14:40-04:00,,"Shares of Expedia (EXPE) ended last trading week on a bad note. The online travel company reported a disappointing set of first quarter earnings results on Thursday after the close. The report and accompanying soft guidance for the second quarter sent shares tumbling in Friday's trading session.First Quarter ResultsExpedia generated first quarter revenues of $1.01 billion, up 24% on the year before. The strong revenue growth rate is surprising given that gross bookings rose by merely 16% to $9.78 billion. Revenues comfortably beat consensus estimates of $966 million.On average Expedia took a $10.40 commission on every $100 spent on hotels and related travels by consumers booking through its websites. In comparison, last year the company took an average commission of $9.75 for every $100 spent.The company reported a net loss of $104.2 million, compared to a $20.6 million profit last year. Earnings were impacted by $66 million in stock based compensation related to the acquisition of Trivago GmbH, as well as a $60 million charge related to a Hawaii tax court ruling.Adjusted earnings fell by 4% to $35.3 million, coming in at $0.25 per share which is a penny below last year's level. Adjusted earnings beat consensus estimates of $0.23 per share, but the size and nature of the one-time charges took investors by surprise.Looking Through The NumbersGross bookings rose 16% over the past quarter, and were aided by the acquisition of VIA Travel which added roughly 4%. Bookings were particularly strong in the hotel segment, as they were up by 28%, while air tickets bookings increased by merely 9%.Revenue growth was further driven by the international operations which reported a 36% revenue growth, compared to 16% in the US. In total some 45% of revenues were generated internationally, bringing the company on track to derive the majority of revenues from abroad next year.Hotel revenues, which now make up 70% of Expedia's revenues, increased by 24% as hotel nights were up by 28% partially offset by a 3% decline in revenues.The favorable effect of higher revenues and increasing gross margins was completely undone by a 295 basis point increase in selling and marketing expenses, which came in at 48.6% of total revenues. Higher expenses were driven by online and offline marketing efforts.ValuationExpedia ended its first quarter with $2.1 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments. The company operates with $1.27 billion in short and long-term debt, for a net cash position of approximately $800 million.For the full year of 2012, Expedia generated annual revenues of $4.03 billion on which the firm net earned $280 million. At this rate, the company is on track to generate annual revenues of approximately $5 billion in 2013, on earnings of roughly $200 million after the charges in the first quarter.Factoring in Friday's 10% decline, and the market values Expedia around $7.9 billion. Excluding the net cash position, operating assets are valued a little above $7 billion. This values operating assets at approximately 1.4 times annual revenues and 35 times annual earnings.Expedia currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share for an annual dividend yield of 0.9%.Some Historical PerspectiveLong-term shareholders in Expedia have most certainly enjoyed their investment in the company. Shares were trading in their low 30s back in 2007, before hitting lows of $7 during the financial crisis in 2009. From that point in time, shares have steadily recovered, a recovery which accelerated in 2012. Shares did manage to peak at $68 earlier in 2013, and have lost some 15% from that point in time, currently exchanging hands around $58 per share.Between 2009 and 2012, Expedia has managed to grow its revenues by roughly 50% from $2.74 billion in 2009 to $4.03 billion over the past year. Net income actually fell slightly from $300 to $280 million in the meantime.Increased CompetitionThe main takeaway from Expedia's last earnings report is the increased competition in the online travel industry. According to researcher comScore, the US online travel industry grew by 9% in 2012, thereby surpassing the $100 billion mark. Expedia, with a 31.6% market share in the industry, based upon pageviews, holds a greater share compared to two of its main competitors Priceline.com (PCLN) and Orbitz Worlwide (OWW).Fortunately for Expedia, the company has already focused early on international markets. International revenues merely made up a quarter of total revenues back in 2007, a ratio which today stands around 45% as the company is on track to generate the majority of its revenues abroad in the coming year.The foreign operations received a boost from the acquisition of Trivago GmbH announced back in December of 2012. The $564 million deal, under which Expedia acquired a 61.6% stake in the German company, will boost Expedia's annual revenues by some $130 million, based on 2012's performance. The company has doubled its annual revenues every year since 2008, and is thereby expected to boost the international growth profile of Expedia.Selling and marketing expenses grew relative to revenues due to product support for the main brands, especially internationally as competition is increasing. Notably online advertising, on platforms like Google (GOOG), is increasing the costs related to affiliated advertising programs.Investment ThesisBesides making acquisition to boost the growth profile of the foreign operations, Expedia has invested a lot for its shareholders. Over the past quarter, it repurchased some 2.0 million shares for $127 million, thereby retiring its share base by 6% per annum.The investments in mobile applications are paying off as well, as Expedia's app has been downloaded over 30 million times across its brands. The initiatives on its Expedia Traveler Preference program are moving according to plan with roughly 25,000 hotels having signed up. Participating hotels have seen much higher room nights growth following the participation in the plan.Still investors are disappointed. One-time charges depressed profitability in the first quarter, and increased marketing expenses are to blame. Expedia furthermore sees second quarter headwinds due to the early Easter weekend in 2013. The problems at the Hotwire business which materialized after Hurricane Sandy have actually intensified during the first quarter.When Expedia announced the acquisition of Trivago back in December, I concluded to remain on the sidelines. While I applaud the strong financial position and the strong revenue growth, shares were trading at fair multiples around 20 times 2012's annual earnings. The increased competition in the industry, which I predicted, seems to have materialized as Expedia is boosting marketing efforts to maintain growth.Today I reiterate my stance. While the long-term prospects of the online travel industry remain good, I see short to medium pressures on profitability and the higher valuation makes the stock vulnerable to a setback.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1347171,23479,2013-04-17T08:19:40-04:00,,"Quick TakeDue to its expanding international footprint, Priceline (PCLN) overtook Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) as the world’s largest Online Travel Agency (OTA) by  sales in 2010. However, with a 43% share of gross bookings, Expedia  remains the most popular OTA among American users. In comparison,  Priceline’s share in U.S. travel bookings was just 11% in 2012,  according to research firm PhoCusWright.While domestic (U.S.) bookings accounted for 45% of Priceline’s gross  bookings in 2007, the proportion has declined to just 18% in 2012. This  has been a result of Priceline’s strategy to expand its presence in  international markets. With the U.S. travel market nearing saturation,  rising opportunities in alternate markets such as Europe and  Asia-Pacific make them attractive destinations for OTAs. Nevertheless,  despite slowing growth, the U.S. online travel market remains the  biggest market in terms of sales and will continue to be so for years to  come.In this article we discuss why the U.S. remains a big market for  online travel agencies and some recent steps taken by Priceline to close  its market share gap with Expedia in the region.U.S. Will Remain The Biggest Online Travel Market Despite Declining GrowthThe U.S. online travel market is growing at the slowest pace compared  to other economies such as Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific.  Nevertheless, with estimated revenues of $151 billion in 2012, the  country remains the biggest market in terms of online travel sales.  Having the highest Internet penetration in the world among major regions  (78.6%), the U.S. has a higher proportion of travel booked online (51.5%) compared to other regions.Latin America and Asia-Pacific travel markets are expanding at a  robust pace, with a forecast average annual growth rate of 23% and 18%  respectively compared to an average annual growth rate of 5% for the  U.S. during 2013-2016. However, with expected online travel sales of  over $180 billion by 2016, the U.S. is estimated to remain the largest  online travel market for the next few years.

Kayak AcquisitionIn November 2012, Priceline announced its acquisition of leading meta-search engine Kayak  (NASDAQ:KYAK) for $1.8 billion. Though the acquisition is pending  antitrust review by UK regulators, Priceline expects to close the deal  by the second half of 2013. The acquisition of Kayak will mark  Priceline’s entry in the meta-search space. A meta-search engine is a  search tool which collates results from multiple search engines,  providing a broader scope for user searches. Meta-search remains an  integral part of the online travel booking supply chain.Growing at a CAGR of 47%, Kayak’s topline has witnessed robust growth  between 2007-2012. The company currently receives about 80% of its  revenue from the U.S. and has over 50% share of the U.S. meta-search  market.We believe that by attracting more traffic to Priceline’s website,  Kayak’s acquisition can increase booking transactions for the  company. Thus, we think that the acquisition better equips Priceline to  close the market share gap with Expedia in the U.S. market.- Kayak can add value to Priceline’s travel search and advertising platform: We  feel that the acquisition could serve as a way for Priceline to expand  its paid search or advertising offerings, an area where it does not have  much exposure currently. While revenues from advertising contribute  very little to Priceline’s overall earnings, for Kayak, with  contribution of more than 50%, advertising is an important revenue  stream. We believe that the expansion of its advertising platform can  broaden and diversify Priceline’s revenue base.- Reduce Dependence on Google: According to  Travel Trends, Priceline is one of Google’s biggest customers, having  spent close to $375 million in online advertisements in Q3 2012 alone. However,  with Kayak on board, Priceline might reduce its dependence on Google to  get traffic for its website. With the launch of Google Flight Search  and Google Hotel Finder, many online travel companies have accused the  online search engine of placing its results upfront, which negatively  impacts the visibility of other travel products. Reducing its dependence  on Google, Priceline can incur significant annual savings in  its advertising budget going forward.- Build a Strong Mobile Foundation: In Q3  2012, Kayak registered an 87% y-o-y increase by processing 56 million  queries via its mobile applications. Kayak’s mobile applications were  downloaded 3.1 million times in Q3, a 95% increase over last year, and  the company believes that it has a more loyal mobile user base compared  to the PC user base.According to the 2012 Traveler study, 38%  of leisure travelers and 57% of business travelers in the U.S.  use mobile for getting travel information. Developing  a mobile platform requires significant costs in terms of design and  development. We feel that by leveraging each other’s expertise in  mobile, Priceline and Kayak can grow their mobile user bases even  faster.2. Increasing Offline Marketing Spend In The U.S.Last year, Priceline launched its first offline advertising campaign  to build the Booking.com brand in the U.S. With an inventory of over  280,000 hotels and 18 million reviews in 178 countries, Booking.com has  been the primary product behind Priceline’s success in the European  market. We believe that by increasing Booking.com’s presence in the US  market, the offline campaign can help expand Priceline’s footprint in  the market.

1366531,23479,2013-04-24T13:19:57-04:00,,"Quick TakeBacked by higher international revenues and continued acceleration in hotel bookings, leading online travel agency [OTA] Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) closed its fiscal 2012 with 17% higher revenues ($4.03 billion), compared with 2011. Despite the economic weakness, it managed to post solid growth in the last few quarters and marked a 24% year-over-year growth in its Q4 2012 earnings. Expedia is set to announce its Q1 2013 results on April 25, and though the company is wary of increasing competition in international as well as domestic markets, we believe that it will be able to post yet another quarter of strong growth.With a goal of growing its user base, Expedia aims to continue innovating and improving its products and services to drive growth across geographical segments. We believe that with an expanding international presence, the robust growth in hotel bookings and a focus on developing its mobile platform, it is well-equipped to leverage growth in the online travel market.Increasing International Footprint To Drive Future GrowthExpedia is the largest OTA in the U.S. in terms of gross bookings and has been focused on expanding its leadership position in international markets as well. Its international revenue contribution has nearly doubled in the past five years from 24% in 2007 to over 40% in 2012, and it claims to be gaining additional market share in the $1 trillion global travel market [Expedia Management Discusses Q4 2012 Results – Earnings Call Transcript, February 5, 2012].Much of Expedia’s revenue growth in Q4 2012 was driven by a 33% annual increase in global room night booked, which translated to a 15% y-o-y increase in hotel revenues. Annual growth in international room bookings accelerated to 49%, compared to 38% in Q3 2012. In comparison, the domestic hotel bookings increased by only 19% sequentially in Q4 2012.The fragmented European hotel market and rising per capita income in emerging economies provide tremendous growth opportunities for travel agencies. Additionally, Internet penetration in these economies is relatively low, but is expected to grow at a rapid pace, which leaves immense potential for growth for the online travel industry as a whole. The expanding international footprint is one of the prime reasons why Priceline (NASDAQ:PCLN) overtook Expedia as the world’s largest OTA by sales in 2010.Strong global growth in Hotels.com, international expansion of Hotwire, the acquisition of VIA Travel by Egencia, the Air-Asia Expedia joint venture, the collaboration with Fotopedia Paris & Fotopedia Japan, and the eLong partnership to expand presence in China are factors that have contributed to Expedia’s growth in international hotel bookings, and we believe these will continue to be the guiding factors for future growth as well.In December 2012, Expedia announced its acquisition of  Trivago, one of the leading meta-search engines for hotel bookings in Europe. The two companies have signed a definitive agreement, wherein Expedia will acquire a 61.6% share in Trivago for an estimated price of 477 million euros. We feel that apart from marking Expedia’s entry in the meta-search space, Trivago will help increase its footprint in the European online travel market. (Read: Can Expedia Take More Share In The European Hotel Market With Trivago Deal?)Expanding Mobile Platform In order to rapidly expand its mobile user base, Expedia has launched a number of applications for iPhone and Android users over the years. The latest feature, launched last month provides users with up-to-date information at every stage of their travel using a set of visual cues. (Read: Expedia Adds a New Mobile Feature To Tap Expanding Mobile User Base)Offering bookings on over 200 airlines and 140,000 hotel properties, the Expedia application has so far been downloaded more than 11 million times in 228 territories on various operating systems - iOS, Android and Windows 8 (tablet version).

As Expedia aims to continue investing in building its mobile platform, we anticipate its mobile penetration to increase in the future.Priceline’s Increasing Focus On U.S. Remains A Big ThreatExpedia remains the most popular OTA among American users accounting for 43% share of gross bookings as compared to Priceline’s share of only 11% [Priceline, Travelocity take steps to increase share, Travel Weekly, February 5, 2013]. Over the years, Priceline has been successful in narrowing the market share gap in the domestic (U.S.) market with Expedia. If Priceline ends up acquiring Kayak, it can help increase its foothold in the U.S. market. The acquisition of Kayak could increase traffic to Priceline’s website, in turn increasing its booking transactions.Last year, Priceline launched its first offline advertising campaign to build the Booking.com brand in the U.S. With an inventory of over 280,000 hotels and 18 million reviews in 178 countries, Booking.com has been the primary product behind Priceline’s success in the European market.

(Read: Priceline Plans To Pare Expedia’s Lead In U.S. Online Bookings)Additionally, Priceline remains a big threat for Expedia in the European market as well. Though Expedia attracts a higher number of unique visitors in Europe compared with Priceline, the latter is known to have a wider presence in the European hotel market. Expedia has a global inventory of >145,000, whereas Priceline’s booking.com covers over 180,000 hotels in Europe alone.We will update our current price estimate of $68.29 for Expedia after the Q1 2013 earnings release.Disclosure: No positions"

1382491,23479,2013-04-29T17:27:21-04:00,,"Quick TakeWith over $1 billion in Q1 2013 revenues (a 24% y-o-y increase), leading online travel agency Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) made a promising start to fiscal 2013. Barring Hotwire, which has been facing some challenges since the last few quarters, all of Expedia’s brands continued to grow at a healthy rate despite macro headwinds. Consistent with past trends, the robust growth in hotel room nights, especially in international markets, was the key driver behind Expedia’s growth. Global hotel room nights booked increased by 28% y-o-y in Q1 2013.On account of its acquisitions and continued marketing efforts to build its brand internationally, Expedia’s cost of revenue and marketing expenses increased faster than revenues in Q1 2013, which contributed to a marginal annual decline in net income. Backed by the acquisition of VIA Travel, the company witnessed a 14% y-o-y increase in air ticket revenues, though it does not anticipate the positive trend to continue in the future. Additionally, the U.S. car rental business came under pressure from fleet constraints and associated efforts by rental car companies to drive up pricing.Increasing competition in the online travel space, both domestic and international, continues to limit Expedia’s growth. Nevertheless, the company aims to focus on innovating and improving its products and services by investing in new technologies to drive growth across geographical segments. We believe that with an expanding international presence, the robust growth in hotel bookings and a focus on developing its mobile platform, it is well equipped to leverage growth in the global online travel market.Stronger Hotel Portfolio To Contribute To Future GrowthDespite a 3% decline in average revenue per room night, Expedia’s hotel revenues increased by 24% y-o-y backed by strong growth in the number of room nights booked (28% y-o-y). While the domestic room nights grew by 15%, international bookings marked 43% y-o-y growth. Though Expedia faced some weakness in demand from Southern Europe, its global performance remains strong.In addition to accounting for the majority of its revenues (>70%), hotel bookings is also the most profitable division with revenue margins of approximately 20% compared to 2% and 9% from airline booking and car rentals & cruise bookings, respectively.Expedia’s Hotels.com currently offers an inventory of only 145,000 hotels globally and it continues to work towards building its global portfolio. With a more than 70% contribution to Expedia’s valuation, as per our estimate, we believe that the hotel portfolio will remain a key driver for Expedia’s growth in the future as well.Some steps taken by Expedia in the recent past that reiterate our belief:1. Acquisition of Trivago - Expedia completed its acquisition of Trivago in March this year. Trivago has over 600,000 hotels across 140 booking sites in 30 countries. It has a significant presence in many European countries, which is of strategic importance for Expedia’s international business. Expedia claims that it intends to expand the Trivago brand in other geographies in the future. In Q1 2013, the inclusion of Trivago for less than a month added more than 1.5% to Expedia’s global revenue growth. (Read: Can Expedia Take More Share In The European Hotel Market With Trivago Deal?)2. International Expansion – Expedia’s international revenue contribution has nearly doubled in the past five years from 24% in 2007 to over 40% in 2012, and it claims to be gaining additional market share in the $1 trillion global travel market. The fragmented European hotel market and rising per capita income in emerging economies provide tremendous growth opportunities for travel agencies. Additionally, Internet penetration in these economies is relatively low but is expected to grow at a rapid pace, which leaves immense potential for growth for the online travel industry as a whole.Strong global growth in Hotels.com, international expansion of Hotwire, the acquisition of VIA Travel by Egencia, the Air-Asia Expedia joint venture, the collaboration with Fotopedia Paris & Fotopedia Japan, and the eLong partnership to expand presence in China are factors that have contributed to Expedia’s growth in international hotel bookings. We believe these will continue to be the guiding factors for future growth as well.3. Expedia Traveler Preference (ETP) Program – The ETP program is a new business model recently introduced by Expedia that provides customers with an option to choose between paying immediately or at the time of checking out of the hotel. The model helps the company better compete with leading agency model players and hotel direct booking channels. Expedia has approximately 25,000 hotels signed up for the program with over half currently live in production. It claims that some of these hotels have witnessed over 5% higher booking rates compared to when the payment choice option was not enabled. Expedia intends to roll out the program globally in the future. Though this could result in lower hotel revenue margins, it will increase the conversion rates and unit growth over time.Increasing Progress In The Mobile PlatformIn order to rapidly expand its mobile user base, Expedia has launched a number of applications for iPhone and Android users over the years. The latest feature, launched last month, provides users with up-to-date information at every stage of their travel using a set of visual cues.In Q1 2013, Expedia crossed the 30 million global app download milestone across its major brands and claims that its mobile booking mix continues to increase. Offering bookings on over 200 airlines and 140,000 hotel properties, the Expedia application has witnessed an increasing proportion of its traffic moving to the mobile platform with 10% of its customers engaging in mobile at present.With the rapid adoption of smartphones and tablets, mobile devices are increasingly becoming the preferred and more convenient option for accessing the web. The mobile platform poses a number of challenges in terms of design and developments, which require significant investments. Additionally, the conversion rate (percentage of people browsing its website who actually make a booking) for mobile is much lower compared to PCs. However, Expedia is investing to make its platform more responsive, which it feels can improve the conversion rate on mobile in the future. With continuous investing in building its mobile platform, we anticipate Expedia’s mobile penetration will increase in the future.2013 Outlook- 2013 effective tax rate of 25%- Low double digit growth for adjusted EBITDA- Annual adjusted EBITDA dollar growth to come in the back half of the yearWe will update our current price estimate of $68.29 for Expedia after the Q1 2013 earnings release.Disclosure: No positions."

The latest feature, launched last  month, provides users with up-to-date information at every stage of  their travel using a set of visual cues.Leveraging location-based  technology and timezone updates, Expedia’s new mobile itinerary feature  provides users live access to latest travel data such as airport  terminal maps, flight status, confirmation codes, gate information,  hotel maps, addresses etc. at a time that a user is most likely to need  the information. The updated mobile application will be launched on  Android and iOS for phones and tablets in 30 countries and 16  languages.Offering bookings on over 200 airlines and 140,000 hotel properties,  the Expedia application has so far been downloaded more than 11 million  times in 228 territories on various operating systems - iOS, Android and  Windows 8 (tablet version).Expedia has been witnessing an increasing proportion of its traffic  moving to the mobile platform with 10% of its customer engaging in  mobile at present. The company aims to continue investing in building its mobile platform  to accelerate its mobile penetration. Though the mobile space poses a  number of challenges in terms of design and developments, we believe  that it is worth the investment and would help fuel Expedia’s business  in the years ahead.The Mobile Platform Offers Huge Long-Term Growth OpportunitiesWith the rapid adoption of smartphones and tablets,  mobile devices are increasingly becoming the preferred and more  convenient option for accessing the web. Unlike the online revolution of  the 90s, the mobile revolution is growing equally fast in both  developed and emerging countries. According to IDC, mobile travel spend  is expected to cross the $2 billion mark by 2014, registering y-o-y  growth of above 40%.As per a study last year commissioned by Expedia and conducted by  comScore, around 48% of the users use a tablet or smartphone to fully  plan their trips while 44% use a mobile device to search for information  regarding a future trip. Of the 44% who use mobile devices to plan  their travel, 44% preferred using an application to do so. Since mobile  penetration is estimated to increase in the future, we expect to see a  higher proportion of online travel searches and bookings done using  mobile devices.By expanding its mobile user base, Expedia can also leverage growth  in mobile ad spending in the US. eMarketer estimates the overall  spending on mobile advertising in the US to have increased to $4 billion  in 2012, representing 180% growth over 2011. It forecast mobile  advertising in the US to rise to $7.19 billion in 2013 and reach $21  billion by 2016.Huge Investment And Lower Conversion Rates For The Mobile PlatformWhile the mobile platform offers immense growth potential, it poses a  number of challenges in terms of design and development, which require  significant investments. Additionally, the conversion rate (percentage  of people browsing its website who actually make a booking) for mobile  is much lower compared to PCs, which lowers the monetization benefits  from the platform.However, when it comes to last-minute bookings, the mobile platform seems to be a preferred choice among users. As per a recent report by Google,  mobile searches for last minute hotel bookings increased by 411%  between June 2011 and June 2012, whereas that for the desktop searches  declined by 79%.Expedia believes that mobile phones are more popular for last minute  bookings while tablet users tend to behave similar to PC users. As per  its study report, 61% of travelers using mobile devices have made a  purchase on a tablet in the last six months while 51% have made a  purchase on a smartphone, implying that travelers are more likely to  purchase travel on tablets versus smartphones.Nevertheless, we consider growth in both tablets and smartphones to  be of strategic importance to Expedia and believe that the mobile space  is worth the investment as it could help expand the company’s user base  in the future.Our current price estimate of $68.30 for Expedia is at premium of over 10% to the current market price.Disclosure: No positions."
1151961,39791,2013-02-02T12:01:23-05:00,,"IntroductionExpedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) is the world's second largest online travel agency (OTA), with a market capitalization of ~$9 billion. The stock has more than doubled in the last year due to improving revenue growth. The company owns some of the leading travel websites such as expedia.com, hotels.com, venere.com and carrentals.com. The company has tie-ups with over 145,000 hotels in 100 countries and expanded into China in 2011 by buying eLong from RenRen (NYSE:RENN). The company restructured its operations in 2011 by spinning off Tripadvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP).Like most other OTAs, the company's revenues and profits mostly come from online hotel reservations, while the rest is contributed by airline, cruise and car rental bookings. Expedia has benefited in the recent past from consolidation in the OTA industry, as the top two players have gobbled up the smaller companies. Expedia has been one of the best performing technology stocks in the last year, giving a return of ~110%. EXPE has been a laggard compared with the market leader Priceline (PCLN), but its improving topline growth has led the market to rerate the stock. However, we think that the stock has climbed up a little too fast and it might be a good time to take some profits.Expedia IssuesWhat we like about ExpediaStock Price PerformanceExpedia stock has given a ~197% return over the past 5 years, with a 110% return over the last year. However, Expedia has been overshadowed by Priceline, which gave a ~597% return over the last 5 years. Expedia is currently trading at near its all time peak value of ~$67, after giving a good set of Q312 results. The company is expected to report Q412 results on February 5, 2013.SummaryExpedia has made strong efforts to catch up with market leader Priceline in the last year and the company has achieved some success. It has focused on its international operations and more of the company's revenues are coming from non-US sources now. However, after the sharp stock run up, we think it might be prudent to take some profits, as the company has entered into a slightly expensive territory. The company faces growing threats from existing OTA companies as well as bigger technology companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google, which are trying to extend into the travel space.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1064871,23479,2012-12-14T11:55:16-05:00,,"From around $30 in January 2012, Expedia’s (NASDAQ:EXPE) stock price has steadily increased to the current level of $60. Despite persistent weakness in the global economy, the company has registered a sequential increase in revenue so far this year, though the growth rate has slowed down.Defying macro headwinds, Expedia posted a stellar Q3 2012 with 17% y-o-y growth in revenues, though its net income decline by 17%. While the short-term macro environment remains uncertain, Expedia claims that a strong global brand name has helped it perform well. (Read Our Earnings Article: Expedia Shows Growing Strength In Hotels & International Markets)With good execution, innovative technology, expanding international presence and a robust hotel business, we believe in Expedia’s long-term growth potential. However, while there are many favorable trends driving its valuation, we feel that the company might not be able to sustain the current growth rate in the future.Our price estimate of $63 for Expedia is almost in-line with the current market price. In this article we discuss the various factors driving its valuation as well as certain potential risks/drawbacks in the same.International Expansion To Drive Growth Expedia is the biggest U.S. online travel agency in terms of gross bookings, and the company has been focused on expanding its leadership position in international markets as well. Expedia’s revenue contribution from international markets has nearly doubled in the past five years, from 24% in 2007 to around 42% at present. For the first time last quarter, the international points of sale accounted for 50% of total room nights booked.The fragmented European hotel market and rising per capita income in emerging economies provide tremendous growth opportunities for travel agencies. Additionally, Internet penetration in these economies is relatively low but is expected to grow at a rapid pace, which leaves immense potential for growth for the online travel industry as a whole.The acquisition of VIA Travel by Egencia, the Air-Asia Expedia joint venture, rising popularity of hotel.com, the collaboration with Fotopedia Paris & Fotopedia Japan, and the eLong partnership to expand presence in China are factors that have contributed to Expedia’s growth in international hotel bookings, and we believe these will continue to be the guiding factors for its future growth as well.Potential Risks – Decline In Revenue Per Room Night: Despite a 27% increase in global room nights booked in Q3 2012, Expedia posted only a 20% year-over-year growth in hotel revenue as it registered a 6% decline in revenue per room night. We believe a greater mix toward hotels outside U.S. will put downward pressure on revenue per room night in the future as well. However, international markets, particularly Europe & Asia-Pacific, present a tremendous growth opportunity for Expedia and the company feels that the robust increase in volume will more than compensate for the decline in revenue per room night.Growing Strength In Hotel BookingsContributing over 66% to Expedia’s valuation, as per our estimate, hotel bookings is the most important division in the company’s portfolio. In addition to accounting for majority of its revenue, hotel bookings offer around 23% revenue margin, which also makes it the most profitable division, compared with airlines (3%) and car rentals & cruises (9%).Backed by a 27% increase in global room nights booked, Expedia’s hotel revenue registered a 20% y-o-y growth in Q3 2012. Despite macro headwinds, the company posted a 17% increase in domestic hotel bookings while international bookings witnessed robust growth of 38%. Driven by increasing collaborations in international markets, we estimate a marginal increase in Expedia’s market share in hotel bookings.Potential Risks – The increasing shift toward the agency model could have a negative impact on margins. As the merchant of record, Expedia has the discretion to establish prices charged to travelers as opposed to “agency” transactions in which Expedia does not set prices but merely collects a commission on prices set by the travel product supplier. During 2010-11, while agency revenue grew at 8% y-o-y, merchant revenue registered 16% growth. Though Expedia expects the merchant model will continue to have a significant impact on its business, the broader acceptance of the “Expedia Travelers Preference” (ETP) program is likely to drive back growth in agency model and reduce the share of merchant model revenue.Increasing Usage Trends In Mobile With an increasing number of people using mobile devices to go online, we believe the mobile platform offers immense growth potential for travel services. Eying growth in the mobile travel space, Expedia added yet another dimension to its growth strategy last year by launching a number of applications for iPhone and Android users.In October this year, Expedia launched a new update for its mobile application. The Expedia application, which previously featured only hotels, now offers millions of flight options for users to view and book from, on more than 200 airlines in the U.S. The updated application also offers better visuals for more than 140,000 hotel properties worldwide. Additionally, people using Expedia’s mobile application have access to exclusive deals (only for mobile users) which offers lucrative discounts, which can go up to 60%, on hotel bookings.Currently, Expedia receives around 4% of its traffic via mobile devices. The company claims that the Expedia hotels app has been downloaded approximately 5 million times in 220 different countries and territories, and 10% of its customers today are engaging in mobile [Expedia Mobile Takes Flight: New App Update Combines Simplicity of Mobile with Robust Flight and Hotel Booking Intelligence, Expedia Media Room, November 14, 2012].  It aims to continue investing and innovating in this segment as it forecasts a significant expansion in its mobile user base in the future.Potential Risks – The conversion rate (percentage of people browsing Expedia’s website who actually make a booking) for mobile could be much lower compared with PCs. Additionally, developing the mobile platform poses a number of challenges in terms of design and developments and requires a significant amount of investment.Pressure of Investments To Restrict Growth In MarginsThe online travel services is a highly competitive niche segment with stiff competition among OTAs. In an effort to gain competitive advantage, travel companies are creating new promotions and consumer value features such as eliminating processing fees, waiving cancellation and change fees, etc.The intense price competition affects operating margins in two ways:The macro headwinds have led to lower revenue margins and high promotional spending, in turn further squeezing operating margins. Despite solid top-line growth in Q3 2012, Expedia’s net income decline by 18% on a sequential basis. Nevertheless, the company intends to continue innovating and improving its products and services to drive growth across geographic segments.The high expenditure puts pressure on the company’s operating leverage and we estimate Expedia’s EBITDA margin to register a marginal decline by the end of our forecast period. However, we believe that high expenditure incurred would help drive Expedia’s future growth.Disclaimer: No positions"
1162091,23479,2013-02-06T17:11:34-05:00,,"Backed by continued acceleration in hotel bookings and higher international revenues, leading online travel agency Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) posted yet another quarter of solid growth despite a weak  macro environment. The company closed its fiscal 2012 with $4.03  billion in annual revenues, a 17% increase compared to 2011, and marked  24% year-over-year growth in Q4 2012 earnings.Owing to higher bonus funding, the year-over-year impact of the  VIA acquisition and professional fees associated with the Trivago  transaction, Expedia's general and administrative expenditures in Q4  2012 increased in proportion to its revenue growth. Additionally, the  company incurred a $110 million charge related to an unfavorable Hawaii  tax court ruling, which it intends to appeal. Excluding the charge,  Expedia posted a 10% year-over-year increase in Q4 2012 net income.With a goal of growing its user base, Expedia aims to continue  investing in developing its technology and content to improve its  product offerings and expand its presence across geographical  segments. While it remains positive about its long-term  growth potential, it is wary of increasing competition in international  as well as domestic markets. Nevertheless, we believe that with an expanding international  presence, robust growth in hotel bookings, and a focus on developing its  mobile platform Expedia is well-positioned to leverage growth in the  online travel market.Higher Revenue Contribution From International MarketsMuch of Expedia's revenue growth was driven by a 33% annual increase  in global room night booked in Q4 2012, which translated to a 15% year-over-year  increase in hotel revenues. While domestic hotel bookings increased by  19%, international room bookings' annual growth accelerated to 49% in Q4  2012 compared to 38% in Q3 2012. Expedia's revenue contribution from  international markets has nearly doubled in the past five years and the  company claims to be gaining additional market share in the $1 trillion  global travel market.The fragmented European hotel market and rising per capita income in  emerging economies provide tremendous growth opportunities for travel  agencies. Additionally, Internet penetration in these economies is  relatively low but is expected to grow at a rapid pace, which leaves  immense potential for growth for the online travel industry as a whole.Strong global growth in Hotels.com, international expansion of  Hotwire, the acquisition of VIA Travel by Egencia, the Air-Asia Expedia  joint venture, the collaboration with Fotopedia Paris and Fotopedia  Japan, and the eLong partnership to expand presence in China are factors  that have contributed to Expedia's growth in international hotel  bookings, and we believe these will continue to be the guiding factors  for future growth as well.Increasing Threat From Priceline in the U.S. MarketExpedia continues to account for the highest market share of the  agency model in U.S. Under the agency model, an OTA like Expedia acts as  the agent in the transaction, passing reservations booked by travelers  to the relevant airline, hotel, car rental company or cruise lines.  While Expedia accounts for 14.23% of the market, Priceline (PCLN) has 11.6%  market share.  Over the years Priceline has been successful in narrowing the market  share gap in the domestic (U.S.) market with Expedia. After Priceline's  acquisition of meta-search engine Kayak, Expedia anticipates the  competition from Priceline to intensify in the domestic market. The  acquisition of Kayak could increase traffic to Priceline's website in  turn increasing booking transactions. In addition, Priceline recently  introduced an aggressive advertising compaction for the U.S. market, which  shows its commitment to increase its market share.Trivago Acquisition Expands Expedia's Hotel Presence in EuropeIn December 2012, Expedia announced its acquisition of  Trivago, one  of the leading meta-search engines for hotel bookings in Europe. The two  companies have signed a definitive agreement wherein Expedia will  acquire a 61.6% share in Trivago for an estimated price of 477 million  euros.Trivago is one of the leading meta-search engines for hotel bookings  in Europe. Established in 2005, the website now has over 600,000 hotels  across 140 booking sites in 30 countries. Expedia claims that Trivago  has a significant presence in many European countries, which is of  strategic importance for its international business.Priceline has a larger presence in the European hotel market, which  has contributed to its robust growth over the years. We feel that apart  from marking Expedia's entry in the meta-search space, Trivago will help  fuel the company's strategy to leverage growth in the European hotel  market (see ""Trivago's Acquisition Expands Expedia's Hotel Portfolio In Europe"").Outlook for 2013We are in the process of updating our current price estimate of $63.12 for Expedia.Disclosure: No positions."
1079141,25120,2012-12-23T06:11:01-05:00,,"Shares of Expedia (EXPE) fell 2.2% in Friday's trading session after the online travel agency announced that it has agreed to acquire a majority stake in German based Trivago, in order to boost its European operations.The DealExpedia announced that is has entered into an agreement to acquire a majority 61.6% equity stake in Trivago. Expedia will pay a total of 477 million Euro for the stake, or roughly $632 million. This includes a 434 million Euro cash payment, while the remainder will be paid in Expedia's stock.Trivago, which is a leading metasearch company, was founded seven years ago. It features search results of 600,000 hotels across a range of booking sites in many countries.For the full year of 2012, Trivago is on track to deliver approximately 100 million Euro in net revenue, or around $130 million. Through its cost-per-click revenue and business model, the company has doubled its revenues every year since 2008. The deal values the firm at roughly 8 times annual revenues.Expedia expects the deal to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share in 2013.Expedia anticipates to close the deal in the first half of 2013, pending regulatory and anti-trust approval.ValuationExpedia ended its third quarter with $2.36 billion in cash, equivalents and short term investment. The company operates with $1.25 billion in short and long term debt, for a net cash position of $1.1 billion. As such, Expedia has sufficient financial resources to acquire Trivago.For the first nine months of the year, Expedia generated revenues of $3.06 billion. The company reported net income attributable to its shareholders of $273.4 million, or $1.96 per diluted share. The company is on track to generate annual revenues of $3.9 billion. Net income could come in around $350 million, or roughly $2.50 per share.The market currently values Expedia at $8.0 billion, which values operating assets at roughly $6.9 billion. This values the operating assets at roughly 1.8 times annual earnings and 20 times annual earnings.Expedia pays an annual dividend yield of $0.52 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 0.9%.Some Historical PerspectiveYear to date, shares of Expedia have more than doubled. Shares started the year around $29 per share and rose to highs of $63 earlier this month. The continued boom in the online travel sector boosted operating performance which drove shares higher, despite intense competition. Shares fell back slightly, currently exchanging hands at $59.50 per share.Between 2008 and 2012, Expedia grew its revenues by more than 35% to an estimated $3.8 billion this year.Investment ThesisFriday's announced deal highlights that the online travel industry continues to consolidate. If Expedia fully consolidates Travigo, the company could boost its annual revenues by some 3.3%.The deal comes at a price, valued at roughly 8 times annual revenues, which compares to a multiple of 1.8 times for Expedia itself. However the business model differs from Expedia as Trivago is merely a metasearch company, while Expedia is a online travel company.In November, competitor Priceline.com (PCLN) announced the acquisition of Kayak Software (KYAK) in a $1.8 billion deal. That deal valued Kayak at roughly 5.5 times estimated annual revenues, valuing the firm at 60 times annual earnings.I remain on the sidelines. Expedia has very strong cash balances and uses it to make bolt-on acquisitions, this time to boost its presence in Europe. As a result of the continued revenue and earnings growth, shares trade at a fair earnings multiple, with shares currently valued at 20 times annual earnings. I remain cautious, as I expect competition between online travel companies to intensify.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

955301,23479,2012-10-26T15:12:17-04:00,,"Robust growth in hotel bookings, an expanding presence in the international market and increasing mobile application downloads are factors that helped Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) post solid quarterly growth despite the global economic slowdown. Expedia, one of the leading online travel agencies in the world, posted its Q3 2012 earnings on Thursday, October 25. Though net income registered an 18% decline, the company posted a 17% year-over-year growth in its revenue.While the short-term macro situation remains uncertain with the U.S.  elections, a change of government in China and the ongoing debt and euro crisis in Europe,  Expedia claims not to have had any adverse effect on its brand due to the above factors, which is impressive. With a goal of growing its user base, the company aims to continue  innovating and improving its products and services to drive growth in  all its geographic segments.Our price estimate of $61.62 for Expedia places our valuation at a premium of around 15% to the current market price. Here we highlight certain key trends in the quarter release that reiterate our belief in the same.Growing Strength in Hotel Business In Asia-Pacific & EuropeBacked by a 27% increase in global room nights booked, Expedia’s hotel revenue registered a 20% y-o-y growth in Q3 2012. Despite macro headwinds, the company posted a 17% increase in domestic hotel bookings while the international bookings witnessed robust growth of 38%.Expedia is the biggest U.S. online travel agency in terms of gross  bookings, and the company has been focused on expanding its leadership  position in international markets as well. Expedia’s revenue  contribution from international markets has nearly doubled in the past  five years, from 24% in 2007 to around 42% at present. For the first time this quarter, the international points of sale accounted for 50% of the total room nights booked.The fragmented European hotel market and rising per capita income in  emerging economies provide tremendous growth opportunities for travel  agencies. Additionally, internet penetration in these economies is  relatively low but is expected to grow at a rapid pace, which leaves  immense potential for growth for the online travel industry as a whole.The acquisition of VIA travel by Egencia, the Air-Asia Expedia joint  venture, rising popularity of hotel.com, the collaboration with  Fotopedia Paris & Fotopedia Japan, and the eLong partnership to  expand presence in China – are factors that contributed to Expedia’s growth in international hotel bookings in Q3, and we believe will continue to be the guiding factors for its future growth as well.Apart from increasing competition from Priceline, the decline in revenue per room night is one of the factors that is detrimental to Expedia’s growth in this segment. The company registered a 6% decline in its revenue per room night and a 3% decline in the average daily room rates. However, we believe that the significant growth in hotel gross bookings volume will compensate for a potential decline in the room rates and the hotel division will continue to be a positive guiding factor for Expedia’s valuation.Increase In Bookings Via Mobile Devices Receiving only 4% traffic through mobile bookings in 2011, Expedia aims to introduce innovative offerings in this segment to tap the rapidly expanding mobile user base.  The company launched a number of applications for iPhone and Android users last year to stay in line with changing consumer trends.Last quarter, the Hotels.com application launched an updated version for Android and iPad tablets. Expedia also launched a new update and an exclusive feature for its hotel mobile application last month. The recently launched mobile application by Hotwire gets close to 20% of its hotel bookings via mobile devices. Additionally, the Expedia application crossed the 10 million mobile app download milestone across all mobile platforms.We expect the company to continue innovating in this space and foresee an increasing percentage contribution of bookings done via mobile devices.Slight Increase In Expedia’s Share In Air Tickets While the hotel division is growing strong, the airline segment has been struggling amid macro headwinds. Though the ticket volume grew by 11%, it was mainly on account of the VIA Travel acquisition and would have remained more or less flat in the absence of the same. Expedia’s revenue from air tickets was down 10% and the revenue per ticket was down 19% on a yearly basis. Though the company expects the same to normalize 2013 onwards, on account of the newer supplier agreement, we forecast the revenue margins on airline tickets to continue declining for the rest of our review period.However, with its technology projects gaining momentum, Expedia aims for   rapid innovation and fundamental changes for its air ticket   business. Amidst rising competition and squeezing revenue margins, we believe that the bigger  players have a better chance of survival since they are better placed in  bundling different products into holiday packages and to offer  complementary destination services to gain traffic. Given that Expedia is the leading online travel agency, we forecast a slight increase in  its market share in the years ahead.We are in the process of updating our price estimate of $61.62 for Expedia for the Q3 2012 earnings release.

1030721,23022,2012-11-27T11:59:16-05:00,,"Expedia Incorporated (NASDAQ:EXPE) owns and operates dozens of websites worldwide that offer extensive services related to travel. The company is a clear ""second-best-in-class"" behind Priceline (PCLN) in the online travel agency market, which has all but eliminated brick and mortar counterparts. From flagship North American site Expedia.com to majority owned Chinese subsidiary eLong (NASDAQ:LONG), Expedia is integrated globally as an established player in hotel, airline, car rental, excursion and other bookings.Over the last two decades consumer habits have progressively shifted to web-based storefronts based on price and convenience. Twenty and thirty-somethings hardly remember the good ol' days and younger generations have grown up with the internet in their pockets. Even most 60 and 70 year olds who failed to embrace this paradigm shift at first now embrace it fully.Bankrupt Blockbuster has left the movie rental equation, now comprised solely of web-based players Netflix, Hulu and others. While cloud storage companies and other technology innovators may be justifiably priced for rapid growth in coming years, internet storefronts are not.Like many other consumer companies Expedia recovered from the abyss thanks to actual monetary stimulus (unlike QE3) in FY2009 and managed to grow top and bottom lines substantially in FY2010. Still, net income in 2009 barely equaled that of 2007 and growth was minimal in FY2011. With a paltry sub-1% dividend yield, Expedia's P/E ratio in excess of 23 is exorbitant at almost twice that of the S&P 500.Another major headwind for Expedia is Priceline's recent purchase of Kayak, a price comparison platform on which Expedia is the leading advertiser. Furthermore, online travel agents such as Expedia and Priceline face continually amplifying online competition from originators of the services they resell. Airlines and hotel chains offer the same prices through their own websites and offer loyalty rewards programs.Much like Netflix, currently trading near $80/share, which rallied from $3 in 2003 to $300 in 2011, Expedia's days of rapid growth have come and gone. The stock currently sits just above $60/share, a level that has proven to be a major ceiling first in 2007, then again each of the last three years. The stock underperformed significantly, as did PCLN, over the markets Thanksgiving week surge.Selling EXPE short is an appealing play with potential upside in excess of 60% in a likely economic downturn. Given the competitive landscape, technical resistance, uncertainty throughout developed economies and tightening consumer wallets, shares have limited room to run. Long dated put options on the stock are expensive, however January 2013 $55 and $65 puts offer an attractive risk/reward ratio at the current price of $1 and $5.40, respectively.Disclosure: I am short EXPE.

It operates online travel portals such as expedia.com, hotels.com and hotwire.com that help connect travelers with travel suppliers such as hotels, airlines, cruises and car rental companies. Expedia also operates a corporate travel business, Egencia (egencia.com), which offers custom travel products and services to corporate travelers and businesses, helping then optimize travel costs and improve their employees travel experiences.Despite persistent weakness in the global economy, Expedia’s top line has witnessed an y-o-y increase, though the growth rate has slowed down. With a price estimate of $63, we believe that the current market price assigns a fair valuation to Expedia. (Read: Here’s Why We Feel Expedia’s Stock Is Capped At $63)In this article we provide a snapshot of how Expedia makes money and the important segments that contribute to its growth.See our complete analysis for ExpediaWho are Expedia’s customers? How does the company make money?Expedia simplifies its user’s travel search by providing them easy access to booking details for airlines, hotel, cruises and car rental packages on a single platform. Expedia’s customers include users looking for travel products/deals for leisure or business purpose. Expedia’s customer base also covers the various travel products and services suppliers who advertise on its website.Expedia makes money via -1) Booking/ processing fees on transactions or buying travel inventory in bulk at discounted prices and selling the same to its customers at a premium, and2) Advertising fees – either pay-per click or a flat fees for the duration of advertising.Important segments that contribute to Expedia’s GrowthHistorically, Expedia’s top-line has increased at a steady pace. Expedia made close to $3.5 billion in 2011 and earned 20% operating profit on the same. We expect Expedia’s growth to continue in the future as well, albeit at a slower pace. With good execution, innovative technology, an expanding international presence and a robust hotel business, we believe Expedia has strong fundamentals to grow its business in the future.These are the key business segments that contribute to Expedia’s growth -1. HotelsWith a 73% revenue contribution, hotel bookings is the most important division in Expedia’s portfolio. In addition to accounting for majority of its revenue, hotel bookings offer around 23% revenue margin which also makes it the most profitable division, compared to airlines (3%) and car rentals & cruises (9%).We estimate that the hotels division to be an important driving force for Expedia’s growth. However, while we forecast a rapid increase in gross bookings in the future, we expect the revenue margins to decline slightly. Competition from large hotel chains directly selling via their website and the intense competition from other OTA’s in the market would put a downward pressure on margins.Expedia saw 10.7 billion units in hotel gross bookings in 2011 and we forecast the number to almost double by 2019. Apart from an improving economic situation, we believe that an increasing network of hotels and expanding international presence will help drive growth in Expedia’s gross hotel bookings.Expedia earns around 21% operating margins on hotels, air tickets, car rentals & cruises as well as advertising. We expect the company to mark a slight decline in margins over our review period.The online travel market is a highly competitive niche segment with stiff competition among OTAs. In an effort to gain competitive advantage, travel companies are creating new promotions and consumer value features such as eliminating processing fees, waiving cancellation and change fees, etc. We believe that the intense price competition would put a downward pressure on operating margins.2. AirlinesWhile airline tickets contribute over 50% to Expedia’s gross bookings, it accounts for only 10% of the company’s revenue. The airline industry is perhaps the most competitive of all travel products. It has been suffering from chronic overcapacity leading to lower occupancy rates. This coupled with high volatility in fuel prices has led to structural changes in the aviation industry.Additionally, airlines are increasingly selling tickets online directly from their own websites, thereby eliminating the need for online travel agents. As a result, online travel service providers have been compelled to remove processing fees on air ticket bookings and the cancellation and rescheduling of fees in excess of that charged by the airline itself.Nevertheless, booking an airline ticket remains an integral part of the entire travel plan. We believe that Expedia has been doing well to stay in line with changing consumer trend, primarily the increasing usage trends in mobile. With an improvement in the global economy and an increasing proportion of travel booking occurring online, we expect the gross bookings to continue increasing in the future. However, due to intense competition in the market, we forecast the booking commission on airline tickets to remain under pressure.2. Cruises & Car RentalsCar rentals and cruise bookings account for 9% of Expedia’s overall revenue. Cruises and car rental services have historically been clubbed together with destination services and offered complementary as part of holiday packages. However, with rising bookings recently, there has been an emergence of cruises as a separate travel product. Thus, going forward we estimate a marginal increase in revenue from cruise bookings and car rental services.Expedia currently earns around 9% booking commission on these travel products. However, we forecast a decline in Expedia’s booking commission as we expect the suppliers to lower their distribution costs amid rising competition.3. AdvertisingAdvertising revenue contribute a mere 3% to Expedia’s overall revenue. On account of the recessionary macroeconomic outlook, businesses across the globe tightened their advertising budget which impacted growth in Expedia’s advertising revenue. However, as the macro conditions stabilize and the user traffic on Expedia’s website increase with expanding international presence, we expect a steady increase in its advertising revenue.4. Egencia Corporate TravelExpedia offers travel products and services to corporate travelers in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific through Egencia. The company earns around 5% of its revenue from corporate deals and earns 12% operating profit on the same.We believe Egencia will see high single digit growth in the future as it invests in and expands the geographic footprint and technology infrastructure of Egencia. Additionally, the acquisition of VIA travel,the largest management company in Nordic countries, will help Expedia further enhance its growing corporate travel service portfolio, strengthening its position in international markets.As the global economy recovers from the recession and business travel picks up, we expect the fixed costs and expenses to decline over higher booking volumes for corporate travel, thereby leading to a rise in margins in the future.Disclosure: No positions"
993411,23479,2012-11-08T20:37:34-05:00,,"Defying macro headwinds, Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) posted a stellar Q3 2012 with 17% y-o-y growth in  revenues. Robust growth in room nights booked, both domestic and  international, was the primary reason for the quarter's revenue coming in  ahead of the company’s expectation. Expedia claims not to have had any  adverse effect on its brand due to the global economic slowdown. The  company feels confident that with its ongoing technology projects, as  well as rapid innovation and fundamental changes in the hotel and air  platforms, it is in a good position to leverage growth in online travel.  (Read Our Earnings Article: Expedia Shows Growing Strength In Hotels & International Markets)With good execution, innovative technology, expanding international  presence and a robust hotel business, we think the company is growing  strong. While there are some favorable trends driving growth for  Expedia, here we list down certain drawbacks of the same.Increasing Shift Towards Agency Model Could Impact Revenue MarginsLast quarter, Expedia rolled out its “Expedia Travelers Preference”  (ETP) program, which offers consumers a choice to either pay Expedia in  advance or pay the hotel at the time of their stay. The  company seems to have gained a good response from its partners, with  close to 13,000 hotels signed up so far. Expedia claims that the  majority of users are opting to pay at the time of their stay via the  ETP program. Thus, the broader acceptance of this scheme is likely to  drive back growth in agency model and reduce the share of merchant model  revenue.As the merchant of record, Expedia has the discretion to establish  prices  charged to travelers as opposed to “agency” transactions in  which  Expedia does not set prices, but merely collects a commission on  prices  set by the travel product supplier. This could further put a  downward pressure on hotel revenue margins, which we estimate to decline  on account of rising competition among various OTAs.The shift to an agency model will have a negative  impact on working  capital as well, but Expedia feels that it has a strong balance  sheet  to support the same. During 2010-11, while the agency revenues grew at  8% y-o-y, merchant revenues registered 16% growth. Though Expedia   expects the merchant model to continue having a significant impact on   its business, we estimate the proportion of the agency model to increase in  the future.Expanding International Business Might Reduce Revenue Per Room NightWe estimate hotel bookings to contribute over 66% to Expedia’s  valuation, making it the most important division in the company’s  portfolio. With revenue margins in excess of 20%, it is also the most  profitable compared to air tickets (3%) and car rentals & cruises  (9%). Apart from certain regions in Southern Europe, Expedia is  witnessing growth in all the international markets.However, despite a 27% increase in global room nights booked, Expedia  posted only a 20% y-o-y growth in hotel revenue, as it registered a 6%  decline in revenue per room night. We believe a greater mix towards  hotels outside U.S. would put a downward pressure   on revenue per room  night in the future as well. However, international markets,  particularly Europe and Asia-Pacific, present a tremendous growth  opportunity for Expedia, and the company feels that the robust   increase  in volume will more than compensate for the decline in revenue per room  night.Lower Conversion Rates For The Mobile Platform The company is witnessing an increasing proportion of its traffic  moving to the mobile platform. Expedia got approximately 4% of its traffic  through mobile bookings in 2011, but aims to further introduce   innovative offerings in this segment to tap the rapidly expanding mobile   user base. So far, the Expedia app has been downloaded 5 million times  in 220 different countries.With an increasing number of people using mobile devices to go  online, we think this is definitely a platform that offers immense  growth potential and could significantly impact Expedia’s future growth  prospects. However, as per Expedia, the conversion rate (percentage of  people browsing Expedia’s website who actually make a booking) for  mobile is much lower compared to PCs.However, Expedia claims that expanding its mobile platform has helped  it penetrate the last-minute bookings business. Around 60-70% of the  mobile bookings received for Expedia are for the same day (24 hour)  hotel bookings. The company feels that mobile phones are more popular  for last-minute bookings while tablet users tend to behave similar to PC  users.While the mobile space poses a number of challenges in terms of  design and developments, we believe that it is worth the investment, and  would help expand Expedia’s user base in the future. The company is  currently working on introducing an air experience on its iOS app, and  expects mobile penetration to increase in the future.Our price estimate of $63.12 for Expedia is almost in-line with the current market price.See our complete analysis for ExpediaDisclosure: No positions"
1139691,38201,2013-01-29T06:50:33-05:00,,"Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) will be acquiring a 62% stake in Trivago, the European online travel meta search site at a $632 million valuation. Trivago, with an already established position in Europe is known for its unique feature of comparing rates online of more than 619,000 hotels with 143 booking sites. The company has expanded globally in 30 countries with its main market in Spain and Germany. Its team is known for building the biggest and fastest growing travel sites in Europe with ~100 million hotel searches every year. Trivago is already a known brand in two third of the consumers in Europe and will give Expedia an entry in the hotel meta-search business. Every month around 20 million people visit Trivago and this acquisition should proportionally increase traffic at Expedia. The deal will be closed in the first half of 2013.Meanwhile Expedia's close competitor Priceline.com (PCLN) also acquired Kayak, a Meta search engine for $1.8 billion of which $500 million was paid in cash and $1.3 billion in Priceline's stock. Kayak is majorly known for developing internet applications that allows its users to compare hundreds of travel sites at once when searching for flights, hotels and rental cars. It will give Priceline a strong position in the United States as Kayak captures the maximum market share in the US. Revenue expected from the KAYAK acquisition is expected to be $376 million in 2013 and $475 million in 2014. Additionally Priceline's Booking.com acquisition which was done in 2005 is showing positive results generating 85% of its revenue. This acquisition has benefited the company significantly by increasing its hotel properties as in 3Q12 it reported 245,000 hotel properties in its network which is almost 44% up compared to last years. With such an outperformance the stock of the company is trading at ~$718 which is up 11% year to date.Mobile FocusExpedia also remains focused to reach its consumers via Mobile looking at the incremental trend of users making a shift towards the mobile platform for making online travel bookings. Expedia took this opportunity to increase traffic on mobile by launching various applications for iPhone and Android consumers. The company in October launched an Expedia Application giving one million flight and hotel options to its users where they can view and make bookings. This application was further upgraded to give better visuals for 140,000 hotel properties worldwide. With its existing presence on iPhone and Android, Expedia has expanded its platform on Windows 8 too. The users can now have access to ~140,000 hotels and special mobile deals with up to 60% off. In Windows, Expedia is currently the only application which gives exclusive mobile deals to its users who can also earn reward points which can later be redeemed to make hotel or flight bookings.In 2011 Expedia spun off TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP), which holds a dominant position when it comes to travel reviews with 50 million users visiting its site every month. Recently Liberty Interactive purchased 4.8 MM shares of TripAdvisor for $300 million and now holds 22% of the equity and 57% of total votes. However, I don't think Liberty is here for a long haul, and they will make an exit from this position very soon. Talking about TripAdvisor's mobile growth TripAdvisor is making continuous efforts in the mobile and tablet segments by launching new apps on iPhone, Android and Nokia (NYSE:NOK). To increase its user engagement it launched an application Seatguru for iPhone and Android users which provides more than 700 seat recommendations from 100 airlines. TripAdvisor's monetization from Tablets is ~50% and from Smartphone is ~10% and these new initiatives will further improvise it. On the other side, its click based advertisements seems to be bidding well, which represents 80% of its total revenue. Its main customers in advertising include airlines, cruise packages, casinos, Hotel owners and Destination market services. In 3Q12 it reported a 15% increase in revenue from the click based advertisements as compared to the same quarter last year and is expected to be up 11% in 2014.The Investing OpportunityComing back to Expedia, the company, with its acquisition of Trivago and mobile innovation, gives an optimistic view. While the Trivago deal will not shuffle up the positions of dominant OTAs in Europe, but it will definitely give Expedia a growth ride in Europe as well as slow down Kayak's unchallenged triumph. The performance of the stock is quite evident from the upside seen in the stock in the last one year and this also vouches for the excellent execution by Expedia management. I would be bullish on this stock anticipating further upside.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

953401,25120,2012-10-26T01:38:18-04:00,,"Shares of Expedia (EXPE) traded with gains of over 15% in after hours trading. The online travel company reported a strong set of third quarter results on Thursday after the close.Third Quarter ResultsExpedia reported third quarter revenues of $1.20 billion, up 17% on the year. Growth was driven by a 27% increase in the number of room nights booked via the company's websites. The number of air tickets sold rose 11%. Gross bookings rose 19% to $9.05 billion.Net income fell 18.1% on the year to $171.5 million. Net income per diluted share fell from $1.50 per share last year to $1.21 over the past quarter. Last year's earnings received a boost of $38.6 million related to discontinued operations. Adjusted earnings per share rose to $1.32 per share, beating analysts expectations of $1.26 per share.So far this year, Expedia repurchased 10.7 million shares for a total consideration of $397 million. Third quarter repurchase activity slowed down to 1.1 million shares.Segmental InformationGrowth of Expedia was solid, but driven by the international activities. US gross bookings rose 13% to $5.22 billion, while international revenues rose 27% to $3.84 billion.Expedia had a very strong mobile performance. Some 20% of total bookings were booked through mobile devices, and the hotels.com app has been downloaded over 10 million times. In total, Expedia boosted its bookable properties by some 14% to 160,000.ValuationExpedia ended its third quarter with $2.4 billion in cash, equivalents, restricted cash and short term investments. The company operates with $1.2 billion in long term debt, for a net cash position of $1.2 billion.For the first nine months of 2012, Expedia generated revenues of $3.06 billion. The company net earned $273.5 million, or $1.96 per diluted share. Full year revenues could come in around $4.2 billion. Net income could come in around $350 million, or $2.50 per diluted share.Factoring in a 15% increase in after hours trading, the market values the firm at roughly $8 billion. Excluding the net cash position of $1.2 billion, the operating assets are valued around $6.8 billion. This values operating assets at 1.6 times annual revenues and 19 times annual earnings.The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 1.0%.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of Expedia have roughly doubled. Shares started the year at $30 per share and jumped up to $40 on the back of strong first quarter results accompanied by a strong outlook. Shareholders reacted favorably to second quarter earnings as well, sending shares to highs of $60. Shares fell back to $51 in recent weeks, but rose to $59 in after hours trading.The company has shown strong growth in recent years. Between 2009 and 2012, annual revenues rose from $2.7 billion, to an expected $4.2 billion this year. Net income rose from $300 million, to an estimated $350 million this year.Expedia's strong results come as a surprise to the market. Notably the international activities performed very strong, despite ongoing weakness in Europe. International revenue growth was more than double the growth rate in the US, despite currency headwinds. International revenues now make up 45% of Expedia's quarterly revenues. The strong international performance is promising for Priceline.com (PCLN) which generates some 60% of revenues abroad. Shares of the larger competitor, rose 5% in after hours trading.At the release of the first quarter results, I already looked at the prospects for Expedia. At the time I argued that the company traded at a fair valuation at 11 times earnings, given the healthy growth and strong financial position. Shares have risen another 50% from that point in time. I congratulate all investors who stepped in around that time, but remain on the sidelines around $60 per share.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

860111,29461,2012-09-11T12:28:47-04:00,,"Given the recent appreciation following Q2 2012, in which Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) beat analyst expectations for both revenues and EPS, the company has limited upside remaining at current earnings. The company, nonetheless, has a strong free cash flow position and is less affected by economic conditions as compared to the industry leader, Priceline (PCLN).  Expedia is taking new initiatives to maintain growth.Financial Performance and New Initiatives:Expedia recently acquired VIA Travel (the largest travel management company in the Nordic region) and Traveldoo, in line with its growth strategy. It continues to expand its services to more countries like Costa Rica and Venezuela, and it continues to enter into partnerships with airlines like Alaska Airlines. Like Priceline, the biggest source of revenue for EXPE is hotel bookings (78% of revenues), which were up 16% in 2Q2012.Gross bookings increased by 13%, while revenues grew by 14%, 2% of which were due to VIA Travel.Via Tarvel also led to a 3% increase in air tickets sale. International bookings make up 38% of Expedia's worldwide bookings as compared to Priceline's 78%. Therefore, Expedia is a little less affected by the European economy as compared to Priceline. This is why PCLN has a beta of 1.9 versus EXPE's 0.97. Expedia is a safer option during economic uncertainty, as Priceline recently gave a weak Q3 outlook. The earning surprise for Expedia was 25% in the last quarter, as compared to Priceline's 6.7%Expedia recently introduced upgrades and new features for its hotel mobile app, based on studies of mobile travel bookers' habits. For more details of the study, see the news release. The app now provides exclusive discount deals at more than 2,000 hotels across the world. This move is in line with the growing trend of using mobile devices like smartphones to make hotel bookings. Expedia is not alone in its emphasis on mobile apps, since Priceline too has taken steps, like giving more flexibility to customers regarding the time that they book their hotels.The total debt-to-equity ratio is 58%. The long-term debt in the form of senior notes matures in 2018 and 2020. Interest coverage ratio of almost 7 shows that the company's earnings can easily cover interest payments. The operating cash flow and free cash flow continue to increase every year, while cash and cash equivalents stood at $2.4 billion at the end of the last quarter. It also has a $727 million credit facility available.The company also pays dividends and repurchases shares. The dividend yield is almost 1%, but there is room for growth, as the free cash flow yield (trailing twelve months) is 12%. The YTD share repurchase is $8.8 million or 3 million shares, which leaves 20 million to be repurchased in the future under the current repurchase plan.Valuations:The forward P/E for Expedia is 15x as compared to Priceline's 17x and Orbitz's (NYSE:OWW) 7x. The average P/E for Expedia is 14x over the last 5 years. The valuations using the forward and average multiples are:*2014 EPS were calculated by using the long-term earnings growth rate for EXPE of 12%.The short ratio is 2 days, with 11% of the float being short. The stock is trading at a discount of 14% to its 52-week high of $60.We recommend a hold position for EXPE because of the recent appreciation from $44 at the end of July to $52 at present. Investors can wait for a better entry point. We believe that once the economy gets better, especially in Europe, Priceline will be a better option considering that it has a larger exposure to international operations (78% of revenues) and can grow more rapidly.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Retail Analyst.

881271,27151,2012-09-21T14:26:15-04:00,,"On Friday, September 21st, analysts at Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) upgraded shares of Expedia, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE). The firm raised its rating on the stock from a Hold to a Buy and set a $51.00/share price target. As a result of the upgrade, shares of EXPE reacted quite nicely, trading up 5.18% since the opening of trading on Friday. That said I wanted to examine the company a bit further and take a look at how it compares (and outpaces) to some of its industry-based competitors in terms of Profit Margin and Operating Margin. The three companies within the Online Travel sector I chose to compare with Expedia, Inc. are: Orbitz Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE:OWW), Kayak Software Group (NASDAQ:KYAK), Inc., and Priceline.com, Inc. (PCLN).Overview: Expedia, Inc.Expedia, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, operates as an online travel company in the United States and internationally. It provides travel products and services to leisure and corporate travelers, offline retail travel agents, and travel service providers through a portfolio of brands, including Expedia.com, hotels.com, Hotwire.com, Expedia Affiliate Network, Classic Vacations, Expedia Local Expert, Expedia Cruise Ship Centers, Egencia, eLong, Inc., and Venere Net SpA. The company's travel offerings consist of airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, destination services, cruises, and package travel provided by various commercial airlines, lodging properties, car rental companies, destination service providers, cruise lines, and other travel product and service companies on a stand-alone and package basis. It also facilitates the booking of hotel rooms, airline seats, car rentals, and destination services from its travel suppliers; and acts as an agent in the transaction, passing reservations booked by its travelers to the relevant travel provider. The company was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in Bellevue, Washington.Profit Margin Comparison: Online Travel ProvidersAs a whole, and in my opinion, the Online Travel sector has one of the widest ranges of profit margins when compared to some of the other industries I've written articles on. That said the average profit margin of the four companies featured is a pretty mediocre 10.08%. The good thing about those numbers is the fact Expedia is a very strong #2 within the space as the company's profit margins over the last 12 months have been a very solid 10.42%. Who was #1 within in the sector? Priceline.com was the leading competitor within the sector as the company demonstrated a profit margin of 25.58%. It should be noted that both Kayak and Orbitz trailed the group with profit margins of 9.15% and -4.83% respectively.Operating Margin Comparison: Online Travel ProvidersAs was the case with Profit Margins, and in my opinion, the Online Travel sector also has some of the widest ranging operating margins I've seen since I began writing comparative articles a while back. That said the average operating margin of the four companies featured is a pretty mediocre 17.85%. The good thing about those numbers is the fact that, Expedia is a very strong #3 within the space as the company's operating margins over the last 12 months have been a very solid 14.22%. Who was #1 within in the sector? Priceline.com was the leading competitor within the sector as the company demonstrated a profit margin of 33.76%. It should be noted that Orbitz trailed the group with an operating margin of 6.71%.Final AnalysisShould potential investors jump at the chance to establish a position in Expedia, especially after the Deutsche Bank upgrade? From comparative standpoint with regard to the company's margin relative to some of the biggest names in the online travel sector, I think the number present a solid opportunity however I'd remain cautious as Priceline dominates the space in terms of both Profit and Operating margin.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

945711,23479,2012-10-24T11:35:59-04:00,,"Fueled by robust growth in its hotel booking business, online travel agency Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) posted a 13% increase in gross bookings and a 14% increase in revenues last quarter. The company is set to announce its Q3 2012 earnings Thursday, October 25. Like many other online travel agencies, Expedia’s top-line faces pressures from the tough macroeconomic conditions and a volatile exchange rate. However, we believe the company could post another quarter of strong earnings. The increasing number of partnerships in Asia and Europe, an increase in hotel bookings, and a focus on tapping potential growth in mobile traffic are some of the key trends that will help fuel Expedia’s growth in the current quarter and beyond.Increasing Presence in International MarketsExpedia is the biggest U.S. online travel agency in terms of gross bookings, and the company has been focused on expanding its leadership position in international markets as well. Expedia’s revenue contribution from international markets has nearly doubled in the past five years, from 24% in 2007 to around 42% at present.The fragmented European hotel market and rising per capita income in emerging economies provide tremendous growth opportunities for travel agencies. Additionally, Internet penetration in these economies is relatively low but is expected to grow at a rapid pace, which leaves immense potential for growth for the online travel industry as a whole.The acquisition of VIA travel by Egencia, the Air-Asia Expedia joint venture, rising popularity of hotel.com, the collaboration with Fotopedia Paris & Fotopedia Japan, and the eLong partnership to expand presence in China are a few examples that reiterate our belief of the company’s potential to successfully leverage opportunities in international markets.Growth in Expedia’s Hotel Business We estimate hotel bookings to contribute close to 65% to Expedia’s valuation, making it the most important division in the company’s portfolio. Apart from a majority contribution to Expedia’s revenue, hotel bookings is also the most profitable business (>20% revenue margins) compared to air tickets, car rentals and cruises.Despite economic weakness, the company saw a 22% increase in global room night bookings last quarter, which we believe is reminiscent of Expedia’s continuing strength in the hotel business. However, while we estimate Expedia to continue posting rapid growth in hotel gross bookings, we think the intense competition among OTAs will put a downward pressure on revenue margins.Potential Increase in Mobile TrafficThe emergence of alternate platforms – such as smartphones and tablets – have registered significant growth, which is expected to continue at a rapid pace in the years ahead. Targeting the mobile travel space, Expedia added yet another dimension to its growth strategy last year by launching a number of applications for iPhone and Android users.Aiming to tap into the rapidly growing user base of online travel bookings via mobile devices, Expedia launched a new update and an exclusive feature for its hotel mobile application last month. The company now offers discounts ranging from 10% to 30%, at more than 2,000 hotels in the U.S., Canada and Europe, off hotel desktop rates on its mobile application. (Read: Expedia Taps The Mobile Travel Space With Exclusive Deals)Expedia received ~4% traffic through mobile bookings in 2011, and we believe that with the introduction of Exclusive deals the figure could increase this year. The company’s focus on introducing innovative offerings to tap potential growth in this segment fares well for its valuation.We will update our price estimate of $61.62 for Expedia post the Q3 2012 earnings release.Disclosure: No Positions"
735671,24414,2012-07-20T10:11:11-04:00,,"The large bulk of e-commerce is business-to-business (B2B), with the more commonly recognized business-to-consumer (B2C) segment accounting for just about a tenth of the overall total. While only a small share of retail and service activity occurs online, with online retail sales accounting for 4.9% of total retail sales in Q1, their share of the overall pie keeps rising every year. This trend is expected to accelerate worldwide with the growing popularity of smartphones and apps that make it easy to comparison shop and get ""social"" opinions and reviews.For those wishing to take advantage of this trend, we present here our analysis of the investments of 25 of the world's largest or mega fund managers in the e-commerce group (our prior-quarter analysis can be found here). These mega fund managers together account for almost 40% of the assets invested in the U.S. equity markets and manage between $100 billion and over $1 trillion each. Also, together, they are bullish on the e-commerce group, adding a net $660 million in Q1 to their $99.13 billion prior-quarter position in the group.Among well-known e-commerce companies, Expedia Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) is the favorite pick among the world's largest or mega fund managers. It is one of the largest online travel companies in the world, and provides travel products and services to leisure and corporate travelers, offline retail travel agents, and travel service providers. Mega funds together added a net 9.52 million shares (or $443 million) in Q1 to their 42.83 million share prior-quarter position in the company, and taken together mega funds held $2.43 billion or 41.2% of the outstanding shares.The top buyer was JPMorgan Chase, with $1.4 trillion in assets under management, which purchased 5.53 million shares. Other large mega fund purchasers included Los Angeles-based Capital World Investors (1.73 million shares), with over $294 billion in 13-F assets, and the world's largest and most prominent asset manager, BlackRock (1.13 million shares), with over $3.5 trillion in assets under management. Overall, institutional investors loaded up heavily on EXPE in Q1, adding 16.8 million shares to their 102.5 million share prior-quarter position.In its latest Q1 (March), EXPE delivered blow-out results, handily beating analyst revenue and earnings estimates (26 cents vs. 16 cents), driven by worldwide travel demand that continues unabated despite the macroeconomic backdrop, as well as a gradual shift to online purchasing for travel services. The stock gapped up strongly after the report, and has since continued higher, up over 60% YTD, and trading at a 14-15 forward P/E compared to the average of 24.3 for its peers in the Internet services group. Earnings, meanwhile, are expected to continue their trajectory higher, rising from $2.75 in 2011 to $3.25 in 2013, at an 8.7% annual rate.We believe that EXPE is in a multiyear growth trend, and that conditions will be even more favorable once the macroeconomic picture improves, and leads to a resurgence in personal travel spending. However, with the stock up about 50% since the Q1 report, the shares are a little too rich for our taste. As such, we would wait and take advantage of any dips below the $40 range to load up on this mega fund favorite.Other e-commerce companies that mega fund managers are bullish about include:The following are e-commerce companies that mega funds are bearish about (see the table below):Furthermore, the following are additional notable holdings of mega funds in the e-commerce group:TableClick to enlarge image.General Methodology and Background InformationThe latest available institutional 13-F filings of the largest 25 mega hedge fund and mutual fund managers were analyzed to determine their capital allocation among different industry groupings, and to determine their favorite picks and pans in each group. These mega fund managers number less than 1% of all funds and yet they control almost half of the U.S. equity discretionary fund assets. The argument is that mega institutional investors have the resources and the access to information, knowledge and expertise to conduct extensive due diligence in informing their investment decisions. When mega Institutional Investors invest and maybe even converge on a specific investment idea, the idea deserves consideration for further investigation. The savvy investor may then leverage this information either as a starting point to conduct his or her own due diligence.This article is part of a series on institutional holdings in various industry groups and sectors, and other articles in the series for this and prior quarters can be accessed from our author page.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: Material presented here is for informational purposes only.

There has been a proliferation of internet sites over the last decade to help people planning a perfect vacation, and getting it at a discount. The opportunity in the Asia/Pacific region is significant and is likely to remain one of the strongest drivers of the company's business over the next few quarters, particularly since online penetration in many Asia/Pacific markets remains relatively low.Expedia will continue to face challenges from players like Priceline.com (PCLN), Orbitz Worldwide (OWW) and Travelzoo (TZOO) as well as a growing number of local Chinese players that could make expansion in the fast-growing Chinese market difficult. Additionally, Google's (GOOG) venture into the travel market is expected to increase costs for Expedia.Expedia: Short Term Outlook(Click to enlarge)The stock has been rising steadily since the last four months. The Stochastics and MACD indicate there's room for some more expansion in the short term and we expect the stock to touch $61 shortly.Expedia: Medium Term OutlookMedium term outlook for the online travel industry remains fairly bullish. Most of the companies in this sector are profitable. Some of those are growing quickly while others are not. Priceline.com has a one year forward PE of 21 on a market cap of $33,062 million. Orbitz has a forward PE of 15 on a market cap of only $444 million while Travelzoo has a forward PE 15 too on a small market cap of $348 million.Expedia Earnings Estimates(Source: Zacks)We are bullish on the companies for the medium term. The long term picture is still not clear given the macro economic headwinds the world is facing. We are most bullish on Expedia with a forward PE multiple of 19 on a market cap of $7,798 Million. Expedia's dividend yield stands at 0.91%. We expect the stock to trade in the region of $69 to $75 within the next six months to one year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

That would be the business of deciding how much to pay up for earnings that have broadly exceeded expectations.Some three-quarters of the S&P 500 companies reporting so far have posted positive surprises, and more impressively still they were, as of last week on pace for year-over-year earnings growth just shy of 10%, well ahead of the 2% consensus forecast.As discussed here a week ago, the global economy of the multinationals overlaps only coincidentally with the national accounts measured by GDP reports.And if Honeywell (NYSE:HON), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) haven’t driven that point home yet, here comes Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), the latest port of call for belated buyers.The online travel marketer’s stock has been up as much as 30% to an all-time high this morning after it reported adjusted earnings of 26 cents a share, vs. the consensus estimate of 15 cents a share. Revenue rose 12% in a year’s time, also beating expectations. Plumping the growth was the 24% surge in the number of hotel nights booked through the various corporate sites, notably through Hotels.com and Hotwire.I’m kicking myself here, because I haven’t given Expedia much thought since recommending it in January of last year, when it could have been had 38% cheaper. I returned to Expedia’s inexpensive earnings multiple in December after singing the praises of its TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) spinoff, but didn’t buy then either.Another chance came and went yesterday after what should have been the dead giveaway of very strong results from Starwood Hotels (HOT), the operator of Westin, Sheraton, and other major brands. And it wasn’t just the strong results or the stock’s 4.4% pop to a new ten-month high, but this quote from the CEO: “Seemingly unstoppable demographic and economic trends are fueling global growth in demand for high-end travel.”The people who can afford to travel are really getting out there, and what’s good for Starwood and Wyndham (NYSE:WYN) is great for Expedia, Priceline.com (PCLN), or TripAdvisor, for that matter.It’s not too late to get in, no matter how daunting the big jump in Expedia’s shares might make it. It’s not just that studies old and new have shown that stocks jumping on earnings surprises tend to outperform the market from there.It’s also the fact that even after its big jump, Expedia sells for less than nine times its trailing EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), while growing at a double-digit rate. And that measure of cash earnings was up 23% year-over-year in the latest quarter.All this implies a cash earnings yield of at least 10%, at a time when the ten-year Treasury note yields less than 2%. That makes Expedia a steal even after Friday’s takeoff. And that’s also why the GDP data earned a shrug.Disclosure: None"
686011,24491,2012-06-27T02:11:49-04:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In this report, we walk through how we evaluate Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE).For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for more info on our methodology). The Valuentum Buying Index ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Expedia posts a VBI score of 7 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the firm, its attractive relative valuation versus peers, and bullish techinicals. We use Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Liberty Interactive (LINTA), and Priceline.com (PCLN) for our peer group analysis.Our Report on Expedia imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsExpedia earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 73.4% during the past three years.The firm is trading at attractive valuation mulitples relative to peers, but our DCF process indicates a less compelling opportunity. We'd wait for a clearer signal on valuation before jumping into the firm's shares.Expedia has a good combination of strong free cash flow generation and manageable financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 13.1% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 2 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 36.2%.Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company.The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $41, we'd take a closer look at adding it to the market-beating portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter. In the spirit of transparency, we show the performance of our Best Ideas Newsletter below:The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 5.5% during the past 3 years. We expect its revenue growth to be below that of its peer median during the next five years.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Expedia's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 73.4%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 11.6%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Expedia's free cash flow margin has averaged about 19.3% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Expedia, cash flow from operations increased about 30% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 126% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Expedia's shares are worth between $41.00 - $75.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $58 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 24.8 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 12.5 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 9.4% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 5.5%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 14.4%, which is below Expedia's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Expedia, we use a 11.6% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $58 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Expedia. We think the firm is attractive below $41 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $75 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Expedia's fair value at this point in time to be about $58 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Expedia's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $81 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $58 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: EBAY is included in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter."
616171,29781,2012-05-24T14:49:08-04:00,,"Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN) are both online travel companies. Priceline has been the darling of the momentum trade for the first half of 2012. From a current technical perspective based on the current corrective bias of the markets Expedia is rising on higher volume while Priceline is in a corrective pattern. We may start to see a transition to Expedia as the new momentum stock as we head into the second half of the year. Both companies are locked into a battle for the European markets and European sales are both critical to Expedia and Priceline growth.Fundamentally The companies are vastly different. Although both support a very similar PE with Priceline at 30 and Expedia at 26. Priceline is the undisputed choice for travel sites. But due to explosive website hits reported by Piper Jaffray in Expedia's European websites things are about to possibly change for Expedia's share holders. They believe that Expedia's European domains grew to 32% year over year in April compared with just 7% in March. This alone can lead to faster than normal growth expectation.PRICELINEPriceline has been one of the darling momentum trades for 2012, appreciating 61% in four short months. Priceline has also been the undisputed market leader in the online travel business for years now.Fundamentally Priceline has a 70% Gross Profit margin, which adds a great deal of free cash flow to the growing balance sheet. Current EPS is 7.39 but Priceline's EPS is expected to swell to $39.50 next fiscal year. Growth currently is at 35% but it is expected to slow next fiscal year to 24%.EXPEDIAExpedia is under the watchful eyes of the momentum community which consists of Hedge funds and certain institutional investors. They are watching the revenue streams, growth targets and balance sheet to see if Expedia can capture the same share appreciation as Priceline has.Expedia has a slightly better Growth profit rate at 78% which again can add healthy free cash flow to the balance sheet. The current EPS is .72 cents but that is expected to grow to $3.29 next fiscal year. One of the areas that the momentum investors are currently watching is the growth rate of the company. Expedia has recently revamped several of its business processing models and growth is expected to move from a negative 36% to a positive 18%, far out pacing Priceline over the next 2 years.Although the battle between Priceline and Expedia has currently been dominated by Priceline there may be a paradigm shift in the process that will propel Expedia into the momentum spotlight over the next 12 months. Both are very good positioned companies in the on site travel industry with very recognizable names. We will now watch to see if Expedia can execute its business model as well as Priceline has and become the next momentum trade.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Expedia's main competitors are Priceline (PCLN) and Orbitz (OWW). Expedia's stock is currently trading for around $33.25 with a 52-week range of $20.69-$35.57.Click to enlargeExpedia's stock has risen about 50% in the last year. Let's take a look at the financials:Owner EarningsOwner Earnings is a better measure for valuation purposes than free cash flow. Warren Buffett defines Owner Earnings as follows:I'll calculate Owner Earnings by taking the 5-year average capital expenditure and subtracting that from the operating cash flow. I'll also subtract stock-based compensation from the operating cash flow since it has a dilutive effect on the company but is routinely included in the cash flow figure. I'll also add interest payments adjusted for taxes since interest is tax deductible. Owner Earnings smooth out capital expenditures and provide a clearer picture of the profitability of the company. Let's use the Owner Earnings figures to determine Expedia's Cash Return on Invested Capital, or CROIC. This is the cash return generated by the company on invested capital, and is simply the Owner Earnings divided by the total invested capital. This is a better measure than ROIC because ROIC relies on earnings, which is a poor measure of profitability.ValuationI use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of a company. I use a discount rate of 15%, and you can read about my view on discount rates here. I will set the initial growth rate to 7%, which is in line with the lower end of historical CROIC, and let the growth rate decay over 10 years to 3%, which will then be the perpetual growth rate. The growth schedule is shown below.Using these parameters I arrive at a fair value of $66.99, which is twice the current stock price. Buy targets for various margins of safety are listed below.ConclusionExpedia is currently trading with a 50% margin of safety to my fair value estimate. I believe that the growth rates I used are conservative; analysts' estimate for earnings growth is 9.81% for the next five years for comparison. I think Expedia offers a compelling value and is dramatically undervalued.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in EXPE over the next 72 hours."
540751,25120,2012-04-30T00:18:14-04:00,,"Shares of online travel company Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) closed 23% higher on Friday after publishing its first quarter results. Shares have seen an aggressive move towards the upside as the results blew analysts away.First Quarter ResultsExpedia reported a 61% growth in first quarter adjusted net income to $36.9 million. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.15 vs. $0.04 last year. Earnings per share excluding certain items came in at $0.26 for the quarter, beating the analyst consensus of $0.14. The company reported a net loss of $3.3 million after taking a $23.9 million charge related to discontinued operations.Revenues rose 12% to $816 million as the gross bookings increased 15% to $8.4 billion. Reported revenues came in ahead of analysts consensus around $790 million. The total number of room nights grew 24% driven by a strong growth of 37% at Hotels.comBookingsGross bookings increased 15% driven by a 24% increase in hotel room nights. Revenues increased 12% which was driven by an increase in hotel rooms stayed which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue room per night. The revenue as percentage of gross bookings fell 28 basis points to 9.7%Revenue mixHotels services account for 70% for worldwide revenue, air tickets 11% and the remainder for 19%. Hotel revenues increased 18% driven by a 24% increase in the number of room nights stayed, partially offset by a 6% decrease in revenues per night. Air revenues decreased 17% driven by a 20% decrease in revenues per ticket, while the number of tickets sold increased 5%. Other revenues increased 15% driven by strong growth in car rentals, advertising and corporate fees.ValuationExpedia ended the first quarter with $2.0 billion in cash, equivalents and short term investments. It has $1.2 billion in long term debt for a net cash position of roughly $800 million. After Friday's jump in the share price the company is valued at 1.5 times annual revenues and 11 times 2011's annual profit. The valuation multiple compares to a revenue multiple of 5.6 times for Ctrip (CTRP), 8.4 times for Priceline.com (PCLN) and 7.2 times for Tripadvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP). These competitors trade at 19, 37 and 27 times annual earnings, respectively.The company has repurchased 8.8 million shares in the first quarter of 2012 for a total consideration of $291 million. It still has 11.2 million shares authorized for a buyback.Investment ThesisShares of Expedia hit fresh highs after the strong first quarter earnings report. Shares have already returned 39% year to date. While the company did not specify financial targets for the entire year of 2012 it seems that this year is going to be another year of revenues and profit growth.Shares have hit new highs as a result of the jump of Friday and still trade at a significant discount compared to its competitors on both a revenue and profit multiple. Shares have a lot of upside before trading anywhere close to the valuation multiples of its competitors, which on average have seen stronger growth.The company trades at a reasonably fair valuation, especially in relationship to its competitors, shows healthy growth, room for margin improvement and has a strong financial position.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
376781,24866,2012-02-19T05:06:31-05:00,,"Amidst all of the valuation talk surrounding Facebook, which sounds eerily reminiscent of the chatter leading up to the dot-com crash, investors are forgetting about online firms with stronger, albeit more mundane, fundamentals. Based on my multiples analysis and DCF model, I find tremendous upside for Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and challenges for Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA).From a multiples perspective, only Expedia comes across as the true objective value play. It trades at only a respective 9.8x and 10.7x past and forward earnings with a dividend yield of 1.7%. To put this into perspective, consider that Expedia is valued at less than half of the 3 Digit MG Group average PE multiple! Zynga, on the other hand, is valued at 54.8x forward earnings off of an uncertain bet in social media.At the fourth quarter earnings call, Expedia noted a strong finish to the year:Fourth quarter gross bookings of $6.3B beat expectations with domestic growth of 7% and international growth of 15% y-o-y. On the other hand, competitive pressures and FX headwinds are hindering gains in hotels as the air travel business concurrently flounders. Top-line for the latter declined by 19% y-o-y, driven in large part by lower value per ticket. But, even still, net debt of $532M is rapidly turning into a net cash position, and the high beta will help drive strong risk-adjusted returns. The company spun off TripAvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) late last year and thus far TripAdvisor has appreciated by 24% while Expedia has gained 14.7% for the year to date.Consensus estimates for Expedia's EPS forecast that it will grow by 0.4% to $2.76 in 2012 and then by 14.5% and 8.5% in the following tow years. Modeling a 3-year CAGR of 7.6% for EPS and then discounting backwards by a WACC of 9% yields a fair value figure of $43.89, implying 31.9% upside.While Expedia has demonstrated a strong business model, Zynga's business model is highly uncertain. On the positive side, greater mobile usage will be a strong secular driver of value creation. Late 2011 launches Adventure World and CastleVille will further provide strong momentum going into 2012. On the other hand, I expect a significant decline in the interest surrounding Facebook, which, in my view, is nothing short of a craze (remember instant messaging?) Moreover, Zynga had only a sequential 5% top-line bookings growth in 3Q11, which was only a fraction of that achieved by Facebook over the same time period.Consensus estimates for Zynga's EPS forecast that it will decline by 4.2% to $0.23 in 2012 and then grow by 43.5% and 27.3% in the following two years. This means that the company is currently valued at around 36.5x the consensus 2013 EPS target.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in EXPE over the next 72 hours."
297275,24866,2011-10-03T14:39:36-04:00,,"With a 21.7% discount to its 52 week high and strong fundamentals, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) appears at first to be an attractive value play. The stock trades at 16.5x and 11.6x past and forward earnings, respectively, which is well below top competitor Priceline.com (PCLN). At the same time, the stock only offers a dividend yield of 1.1% and is currently rated by analysts more towards a ""hold"" than a ""buy."" I expect that the company will slightly outperform the market in the next five years and is a safe investment for those afraid about a double dip.The travel industry is relatively more recession proof than what the market has acknowledged. Travel sales are expected to increase by around 5% annualized over the next six years or so, with solid growth amongst all categories relevant to Expedia: hotels, airlines, and online services. Travel revenue grew 3% last year and is expected to incrementally increase over time.As the industry grows, Expedia is well positioned to win the lion's share and gain market share. It is currently the global leader of OTA, which is crucial for the travel industry. Suppliers want access to more customers and customers want cheaper rates, so suppliers slowly cut back rates for Expedia and the savings is passed partially onto the consumer. This positive feedback loop will weed out of much of Expedia's competition, since the firm has better negotiating power over suppliers with its strong customer base.Expedia is also well diversified abroad, reaching out to more than 200 nations. Approximately 33.3% of its revenue came outside of the United States and this figure is expected to experience strong growth in the years ahead. Expedia owns 55% of eLong, which gives it nice exposure to Chine, and Venere. With a growing population and increased wealth in China, Expedia has done a phenomenal job in building an international brand for long-term value creation.By offering hotel reservation services with airline ticket deals, the company also faces the tremendous upside that success in one category will drive success in another category. The opposite, that failure in one category will result in failure in another, does not have nearly as significant of an effect, thus providing for favorable risk/reward. Towards this end, Expedia holds a variety of strong brand name entities -- Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Hotwire.com, eLong, among others -- to unlock revenue synergies.Improvements in technology and a spinoff of TripAdvisor will further benefit the firm by improving margins and growth opportunities. Online usage is increasing globally and Expedia is becoming more popular among travel agencies in the process. I expect this trend to continue over the next decade and that Expedia will not face as much competition as the market has anticipated, especially in regards to Google. By spinning off TripAdvisor, Expedia made a step in the right direction to clarify its core business.Consensus estimates for EPS are that it will increase by 19.5% to $1.95 in 2011 and then by 13.8% and 15.3% in the following two years. I forecast growing by 19.5% to $4B in 2011 and then by 11.4% the following year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The TripAdvisor spin off will include TripAdvisor Media Group which is the world’s largest travel site. I believe the spin off will provide a catalyst to a higher Expedia share price. In this article I will discuss the spin off catalyst so investors on the sidelines can consider buying Expedia shares. Expedia has provided investors, in my personal 'snap shot' view below, what the company looks like now and what the company will look like in two weeks: Expedia Background Expedia is a leading global online travel company. Expedia's brands provide synergies to provide low cost travel services to businesses and consumers. The company offers hotel rooms, car rentals, airline tickets, and complete vacation packages. The company’s brands include Expedia web sites, Hotwire.com, Classic Vacations, Egencia, TripAdvisor, eLong, Venere NetSpA, and Hotels.com. The brand eLong is China's second largest travel booking site. Classic Vacations provides luxurious travel accommodations. Hotwire.com provides discount travel accommodations within the United States.Priceline.com Incorporated (PCLN) is a competitor to Expedia and TripAdvisor. Priceline.com is an online travel company that offers airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, and vacation packages. The company is well known for their ""name your own price"" service. This service allows potential customers to bid their maximum price for travel accommodations. Many consumers are aware of Priceline due to William Shatner's commercials over the years. Mr. Shatner has become a billionaire due to the Priceline stock appreciation. Orbitz Worldwide, Inc. (OWW) is a competitor to Expedia and TripAdvisor. Orbitz is a smaller enterprise with a market value of $350 million. The travel industry operator's size does matter because of the ability to agree upon favorable terms with third parties. Orbitz allows businesses and consumers to research and book travel accommodations. Brands include Orbitz, CheapTickets, ebookers, RatesToGo, and HotelClub. Ctrip.com International Ltd. (CTRP) is in prime real estate when it pertains to travel planning. The Chinese business has a balance sheet with zero debt and a market cap of $5 billion. The company offers travel packages, travel planning, and travel services within the People’s Republic of China. Priceline, Orbitz, Expedia, and TripAdvisor all desire growth in the Chinese travel industry. Ctrip.com assists consumers with booking and purchasing domestic and international flights from China. Insider Ownership Barry Diller, Expedia’s Executive Chairman, owns 27.2% of Expedia common “A” shares and 100% of Expedia Class “B” shares. The “B” shares are equal to 10x an “A” share in terms of corporate governance voting power. Liberty Media owns 24% of Expedia shares.Expedia’s capital share structure includes 274,255,669 common “A” shares. In addition, the company has 25,599,998 Class “B” shares. Institutional ownership is strong with T. Rowe Price owning 14% of Expedia shares.TripAdvisor Background TripAdvisor's travel research platform consolidates traveler reviews and opinions. The reviews and opinions pertain to visited global destinations, accommodation experiences, and restaurant insights.2010 Earnings and Revenue TripAdvisor, separated from Expedia, in 2010 earned $261 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). TripAdvisor's 2010 revenue was $485 million. Current Expedia Valuation The reason I recommend buying Expedia shares is due to the actual growth and the future growth prospects. In 2011, the Expedia should earn approximately $1.75 per share in 2011. Earnings estimates for 2012 are approximately $2.15 per share. This represents a 22.8% anticipated earnings per share growth rate. Expedia is currently trading at a 16.7x price to earnings multiple. Expedia, for 2012’s $2.15 earnings per share expectations, is trading at a 13.59x price to earnings multiple. The 13.59x is low considering a projected 22.8% growth rate in 2012 earnings per share. The company is aggressive in buying back shares. In 2005, Expedia had about 348 million shares outstanding. In 2011, Expedia's share buy backs reduced this number to 270 million shares. The fewer number of shares outstanding, the higher the earnings per share everything being equal. The company continues to sign 3rd party partnership agreements to enhance revenues and earnings for future years. The two separate companies can thrive on their unique business models. Expedia, on December 6th, signed a new agreement with United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL). United Continental and Expedia have worked together for almost 15 years. Expedia and Hotwire will have access to all United and Continental fares, and schedules for booking flights. Expedia began a 7 cent per share quarterly dividend during the 1st quarter of 2010. This equates to a 28 cent annual dividend. This amount is likely to increase in future quarters. The yield right now is less than 1%, but the catalyst for the spin off should awaken shareholders to the growth potential of each unique company. Spin Off Terms The Expedia spin off will result in two publicly traded companies. The first is Expedia, which will retain domestic and international operations of travel transaction brands including Expedia.com, Hotels.com, eLong, Hotwire, Egencia, Expedia Affiliate Network, CruiseShipCenters, Venere, Classic Vacations and carrentals.com.The second company is TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor assets include the domestic and international operations associated with the TripAdvisor Media Group, which includes its flagship brand as well as 18 other travel media brands. Summary The Expedia spin off of TripAdvisor Media has the potential to unleash a significant growth story. Travelers are increasingly shopping online for the best travel packages. Expedia and TripAdvisor both play a key role in providing a positive and inexpensive traveling consumer experience. The potential for increased mobile travel purchases is in its infancy. The potential for increased travel to China, India, and Latin America is increasing ever year. TripAdvisor’s growth strategy is impressive. Per the November 25th road show presentation, TripAdvisor is actively growing in China. A growth initiative via the mobile platform is gaining increasing traction. The company has significant market share presence and visitors to its web sites. The current Expedia is trading at a very low valuation. For the almost complete 2011 fiscal year, Expedia is trading at a 13.59x price to earnings ratio. The company is anticipated to grow earnings at 22.8% for 2012. The company's stock price is dislocated from projected 2012 earnings per share multiples. Disclosure: I am long EXPE."
263295,22675,2011-04-13T10:52:01-04:00,,"It was a surprise to most analysts and I’ve gotta say that I was also surprised by the move. Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) announced late last week that it was going to spin off Tripadvisor, as an independent company. For outsiders, Expedia is itself the result of a spinoff by IAC Interactive (IACI) a few years back, it is a group of internet travel properties.That certainly brings up a lot of interesting questions and after doing some research, here are some answers to go with them.I knew the answer to this one of course but since some of you might not. TripAdvisor is basically a community of travelers that have come together to review, rate and comment their favorite hotels, restaurants, things to see & do and much more in virtually every place worth seeing around the world. Many other properties have tried building something similar but nothing comes close to TripAdvisor in my opinion mostly because of the incredible community. The business idea behind it is to then help the users book the activities gaining a cut in the process while also selling advertising.As this is a move done by Expedia, I think it’s important to consider their point of view. The most likely explanation is that the board has been unhappy with its valuation and that makes sense given the multiples that some competitors such as Travelzoo have been able to generate. The easiest way to “realize” the value of what they consider to be an “undervalued” asset” is to sell it. In this case, Expedia has decided to simply spin it out which might actually work. The stock did rise 14% which would tend to indicate that it was right. I’m sure there was and doing a spinoff for that reason seems a bit extreme. But what’s done is done right? No doubt, I’m thrilled. I do see a lot of value in TripAdvisor because it has a strong community and is a good mix between social and commerce/travel. I think the company could end up doing very well. Also, the internet travel category which has already provided many good trading opportunities now has one additional stock and that means I will have more trading opportunitiesThat is certainly a possibility, at least for a long term trade. I think the user loyalty towards Expedia is very very low compared to TripAdvisors’s and that will certainly have a long impact. No way. I still want to find out more about TripAdvisor’s financials and there will be other parts of Expedia that will be included in the new group. Tripadvisor did claim 15% of Expedia’s revenues last year and grew those at 38% which sounds like a lot but I would actually expect more from this property.Disclosure: No position on EXPE, short IACI"
263779,23479,2011-04-15T14:29:59-04:00,,"Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), which competes with Priceline (NASDAQ:PCLN) and Kayak in the online travel industry, announced its plans to spin-off its media and advertising business arm TripAdvisor into a separate publically traded company.Founded in 2000 and acquired by Expedia in 2004, TripAdvisor gathers and publishes user-generated content such as hotels, restaurants and travel destination reviews that travelers use for research prior to making bookings. With over 50 million unique monthly visitors at its 18 popular travel-brand sites in 27 countries across the globe, TripAdvisor generates revenue by offering advertising placements at its websites and accounted for a substantial 15% of Expedia’s revenues and close to 35% of Expedia’s operating income in 2010. [1]TripAdvisor constitutes almost 24% of our $29 price estimate for Expedia’s stock, making it the second largest value driver for the company after hotel bookings. Our price estimate implies a roughly 20% premium to market price.Here we explore the rationale behind the proposed spin-off and the impact this might have on Expedia’s stock value.Why TripAdvisor’s Spin-Off Makes Sense?Different BusinessesWhile both Expedia and TripAdvisor cater to the travel industry, they actually have very different businesses. Expedia is an online travel agent and earns a commission on travel bookings via Expedia.com, Hotels.com and Hotwire.com. TripAdvisor is a travel-media company driven by advertising revenues. Since the businesses are so different in nature, operating these as separate entities lets management better concentrate on each.Potential to Unlock TripAdvisor’s ValueTripAdvisor’s strong revenue growth has until now been overshadowed by Expedia’s relatively sluggish performance. TripAdvisor’s revenues grew 38% in 2010, far outpacing the company as a whole, which reported a 13% growth in revenues.Expedia announced in February that it has impending investments in technology and marketing. As Expedia expands in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, it is considering new social media and mobile platforms as well as loyalty programs that could drain cash reserves in the future. The spin off should remove the burden of these impending expenses from TripAdvisor.Timing of the AnnouncementThe timing of this announcement is particularly appropriate given the recent regulatory approval for Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) acquisition of ITA Software, the provider of air travel schedules and fares. Since this acquisition is expected to strengthen Google’s “Places” offering, it increases competition for TripAdvisor. Hence, any loss in TripAdvisor’s market share to Google Places would not impact Expedia’s stock value.How Does TripAdvisor’s Spin-Off Affect Expedia?Expedia acquired TripAdvisor in 2004 for $200 million. TripAdvisor represents roughly 24% of our $8 billion valuation for Expedia stock, implying a $1.9 billion valuation for TripAdvisor. The spin-off could reportedly value the travel-media entity as high as $4 billion, [1] more than 2x our implied valuation. Beyond that, the $4 billion estimate would give Expedia a 1900% return on investment, given its $200 million purchase price for TripAdvisor.The transaction is expected to be tax-free and take the form of a distribution of TripAdvisor’s stock to existing Expedia shareholders. While further details are yet to be revealed, it seems that Expedia shareholder’s stand to make handsome gains.See our complete analysis of Expedia stock hereNotes:Disclosure: No positions"

This puts EXPE back to where it was in July as it recovered from the 52-week lows. Shares almost broke $30 in late September but were trending lower into yesterday's trade, which saw the stock close at $25.69.Not surprisingly, today's option action is in the puts. More than 46,000 contracts have changed hands already this morning, more than 10 times Expedia's average for a full day.Puts outnumber calls by almost 2 to 1. Leading the volume is action in the March 20 strike, where more than 18,000 puts have traded against zero open interest.Most of those contracts went for $0.30, and 20 minutes later another big block of 5,000 traded for $0.35. It appears that the institutional size blocks were all sold.There is obviously a lot of trading in the stock, so it could be that these puts were sold against short shares. But this also continues the interesting theme that we have been following of put selling after earnings. For the most part we have seen it done on stocks that have risen, but it appears that at least one fund likes selling near-term puts after earnings releases to capture the volatility premium once the news is out."
262168,23479,2011-04-06T14:52:11-04:00,,"Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) could be facing a very serious threat to its business, although not from the usual suspects like Priceline (NASDAQ:PCLN) or Kayak. This time, it comes in the form of a new social network for travelers, Gogobot. [1]. Still in the Beta phase, Gogobot combines social networking and online travel research and bookings into one seamless platform. Backed by $4 million in funding from Battery Ventures, [2] Gogobot is poised to elbow its way into the online travel space.Expedia, the world leading online travel portal does not just make money from travel bookings but also through advertising on its websites. Expedia’s Tripadvisor is the #1 online travel community operating in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. The site aggregates opinions and offers rich user-generated travel-related content including millions of reviews on destinations, hotels, restaurants. The sheer number of reviews adds to its credibility and draws traffic to tripadvisor.com, which Expedia then monetizes in the form of revenue from advertising placements on the website.Our price estimate for Expedia stock stands at $29.12, roughly 30% ahead of market price.How does Gogobot threaten Expedia?1) Absence of Social Networking at TripadvisorTripadvisor lacks real social networking functionality. Gogobot offers to fill this gap by providing users with travel advice from their personal social network connections on Facebook and Twitter. The reasoning for this is obvious – people care much more about their friends’ opinions than those of the endless stream of anonymous reviewers. We’re much more likely to act on a tip from a friend than a stranger.2) Gogobot to Offer Bookings on its Own WebsiteGogobot announced partnerships with established online travel agencies like Priceline, Orbitz, Kayak and even Expedia to allow users to book flights and hotels from these sites without actually being directed to the sites. Expedia doesn’t really have a choice here. The company has to partner with Gogobot or risk losing booking volumes to other agencies that do. This, unfortunately, reduces the number of visitors that would otherwise find their way onto Expedia’s site. Reduced traffic will likely put a dent in advertising revenues for Expedia as well as other online travel agencies.3) A More User-Friendly and Interactive Interface at GogobotGogobot was awarded the 2010 Techcrunch Crunchie award for best design. The site comes with integrated maps and a Yahoo Answers-style question-and-advice feature. The user-friendly interface at Gogobot could help attract and retain more traffic to its website. This could be a serious blow to Expedia’s advertising revenues from its Tripadvisor network.What is the Potential Impact on Expedia?Gogobot poses a real threat to Tripadvisor’s visitation, and could cause the sites revenue from advertising to slip. Although Gogobot is nowhere near the millions of reviews for hotels and destinations that Tripadvisor currently boasts, the social networking element could spur a rapid surge in Gogobot’s content. Facebook’s over half a billion users could quickly turn the tide in Gogobot’s favor.So how important is Tripadvisor to Expedia? We estimate that this site’s operations represent 23% of the company’s stock value, which we peg at $29.12. This is a good chunk of Expedia’s value, so don’t expect the company to give up it’s position atop the online travel community hill without a fight.See our complete analysis of Expedia’s stock hereNotes:Disclosure: No positions"
256390,23479,2011-03-04T04:42:05-05:00,,"Expedia’s  (NASDAQ:EXPE) stock took a hit in the markets dropping almost 17% on  the release of its FY 2010 earnings on February 10. The response was  largely on account of the overall decline in the company’s EBITDA margin  from over 32% in 2009 to around 25% by the end of 2010. Clearly the  market is concerned about Expedia’s outlook on the heels of this.  Expedia competes with other online travel agents like Priceline (NASDAQ:PCLN), Orbitz (NYSE:OWW) and Travelocity as well as hotel chains that offer their own online booking services.Unfavorable Industry Trends But Value RemainsThe online travel industry continues to  face increasing competition from airlines and large hotel chains  offering bookings directly at their websites leading to online travel  agencies removing the booking fees to match the prices quoted by the  suppliers themselves. The squeezing revenue margin (revenue earned by  the online travel agency as a percentage of the dollar size of bookings)  has been widely accepted as the fate of this industry going forward.  However a rise in operating expenses in such a competitive market is  crimping profit margins, measured by EBITDA margin, in addition to this.We  have updated our Trefis price estimates  of Expedia’s stock to $29.12 factoring some lower assumptions for  profit margins going forward; however we still see plenty of value left.The two largest segments are hotel bookings  that constitutes more than 55% of Expedia’s stock value by our    estimates and TripAdvisor another 23%.For the hotel segment, we forecast that  EBITDA margins will trend at around 23% and slowly decrease to around  21% going forward. For TripAdvisor we forecast this will remain around  44%.Hotel Bookings EBITDA MarginTripadvisor EBITDA Margin(Charts created by using Trefis' app)One silver lining is that there has been  much needed improvement in Expedia’s   Egencia corporate travel services  from under 8% in 2009 to over 12% in   2010, but it is still much below  the company’s overall EBITDA margin   which is still in excess of 25%.While there is much scope for further    improvement in Egencia corporate travel services EBITDA margin, given    the it contributes around 4% to Expedia’s total revenues, we do not    expect a significant impact on the company’s overall profits.Nonetheless, the market seems overly bearish following this announcement relative to our estimates.Disclosure: No positions"
252645,23679,2011-02-14T10:35:49-05:00,,"Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) is the leader in online travel accommodations and services.  They released earnings recently and have since encountered bumpy roads in terms of stock price.  EXPE was down 17% last Friday and briefly hit $20.99 in intraday trading.So, what was in that earnings call (see transcript here) that rattled investors so?  It is pretty simple, really: Expedia seems to be making some investments in their business that will increase returns later at the expense of short term earnings.  This is an absolute crime in the eyes of Wall Street, as evidenced by the downgrades in price targets and analyst ratings across the board.However, for the long term, fundamental investor, this could be a great time to get in on a value stock.  Let’s take a deeper look at that earnings call and see what there is to see.Increased costs:  One of the main points of concern for analysts covering Expedia is an increase in costs that is being used to expand into lower monetization rate markets.  These include APAC, China, Brazil, and more.  Michael Adler, CFO of Expedia said that they are:However, these markets are highly fragmented and the sooner a company can capitalize on imprinting a brand the better.  It does Expedia no good to rest on its laurels and wait until the internet travel sector is attractive in China; the time is now to invest and act in the best interest of creating a future presence.  As a result, there may be a lower margin associated with these investments initially.  The alternative, however, is a future where Expedia is a late mover in some of the larger travel markets in the world.In addition to expanding into international markets, Expedia has been making investments and acquisitions in many different parts of their business.  Adler said that Expedia is:Now, on the surface this looks like margins squeezing in an increasingly competitive online travel market while the CFO feebly tries to justify this by pointing to various investments the company is making.  However, if you take a close look at those investments you’ll see a few key words.  China.  Mobile.  Social.  Any company not caught in the flurry of investments in these three spheres might as well close their doors and turn out the lights.  This is the trifecta of growth, especially in the online sense.  If EXPE were not investing in all three of these things, and doing so aggressively, I would be concerned.Another factor was a change in fee recognition that drove cost of revenue for the quarter.  Adler points out that:So, if you take all these pieces into consideration, you might get a different picture than a industry leader that is losing its edge.  Not to say there aren’t concerns in the long term profitability and competitive position of a company like Expedia, but it seems the ambulance chasers have gotten to the scene a bit early.Investments in Technology:  One of the most attractive things about EXPE is their constant investment in areas vital to long term success.  Their new platform for Hotels.com is now running at full tilt, and the same steps are scheduled to be taken to further optimize Expedia.  Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Expedia, said that Expedia has:Their new platform for Hotels.com has improved conversion and allowed them to test the foundation they will build out for Expedia’s more complex business lines.  Dara noted this when he explained the steps in optimizing that platform for Hotels.com:So, what happens when you take a tested plan of action and apply it in a more complex fashion?  Hopefully, the same result.  With the platform already running strong on Hotels.com, EXPE hopes to apply that to Expedia as well.  Dara is confident the same recipe will work:This is a risk point for EXPE that may be a determining factor in their future.  If they can apply their new platform to Expedia.com in a way that will increase conversion rates in the same fashion it has with their hotel line, then their numbers will reflect that success.TripAdvisor:  TripAdvisor is one of the differentiators for Expedia that has recently come under attack.  With Google now giving preference to their Google Places in search, some expect TripAdvisor to basically go extinct.  Let’s remember that just because Google does something doesn’t mean their competition will wither and die (Google Buzz vs Twitter ring a bell?).  Also, take into consideration that the market Google Places will primarily hit is the United States market, which is less important to TripAdvisor on a volume base. Khosrowshahi noted that:However, TripAdvisor is no doubt more profitable in the US, so how long will this lower monetization rate last for international?  There was no clear guidance on this, but they were confident the monetization would converge with US rates in the future, as the CEO stated:TripAdvisor is also still making moves to stay relevant.  Take their recent acquisition of EveryTrail, which Dara explains:Although growth rates slowed for TripAdvisor in the latter part of 2010, the trend should be offset long term by the international footprint it is already making.  Also, take into consideration the power of social, which TripAdvisor is practically made for.  They recently put themselves on Facebook and are now trying to tap into those five hundred million potential users.Mobiata: The Mobile Approach:  Mobile is another area that Expedia is investing in.  Although not a huge source of traffic yet, their forward looking strategists realize the importance of a mobile presence. The acquisition of Mobiata will help Expedia in this realm.  Dara explains:The popular iPhone app team is now being used across EXPE to add a different mindset to the way they approach mobile.  Some of those benefits may manifest in 2011, as Dara explains:How big of a piece of the pie will mobile be in the near future?  A material one, as Mr. Khosrowshahi states:I wouldn’t say easily, but certainly within reason.  The acquisition of Mobiata could be a big differentiator in the mobile sphere.International Investment:  Expansion into the international realm is something that Expedia has seemed to lag on in comparison to their rival Priceline; PCLN has been eroding their market lead in international growth.  However, they appear committed to making up that ground, and will embark on an aggressive expansion in 2011.  Dara states:This schedule will represent costs that will be negative to margin over the short term, but potentially offer lucrative payouts for the patient investor.  In addition to these seven countries, China represents a bulls-eye in terms of travel in many different ways.  Dara addressed a question about this in the call, saying:This position in China will be huge.  In addition, their subsidiary eLong Inc. (NASDAQ:LONG) is making a push to be one of the top online providers of travel in the mainland.American Airlines Riff:  Much is being made of the riff between online sites and American Airlines.  AA was recently allowed to cut contractual ties with Orbitz by a judge in Illinois.  Shortly after doing so, American was distinguished from other airlines on Expedia by having an extra click required to see a price for a ticket.  Expedia made a statement about this action:This is certainly not a best case scenario for Expedia, as their dealings with airlines are reliant on terms being mutually beneficial.  However, the fact that they are not the only site being impacted by this move makes me more comfortable with the situation.  Dara also addressed this issue in the earnings call.  He said that Expedia had to:I am expecting this to be a minor setback for a company that otherwise has a great product.  American stands to hurt from this situation, as the internet becomes more and more important in the online travel sphere.  As a result, I expect this to end amicably, although the time line is not so clear.Conclusions:  While some are hammering Expedia for their lack of profitability or apparently competitive dullness, I will contrarily congratulate them on being more forward looking than a quarterly earnings release.  Their investments in the mobile, social and international spheres make me optimistic about there being an upside to this stock.  Market forces notwithstanding, Expedia is making the right moves.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
152635,21435,2009-07-30T17:03:07-04:00,,"Expedia Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) stock is surging in Thursday afternoon trading advancing 13%, as the online travel site reported earnings that eclipsed Wall Street estimates. The company reported EPS ex-items of $.38 while the analysts expected just $.31. Revenue was better than estimated coming in at $769 million for the quarter. However, the company was not able to top last years sales results as they fell by 3.2%, and overall bookings slipped by 5%. So, although sales have fallen somewhat from a year ago, consumers are making travel arrangements through Expedia more than the experts thought. Like most other companies right now, Expedia touted aggressive cost cutting which dropped cost of service by about 13%. “To deliver 26% worldwide room night and continued OIBA growth in this environment speaks volumes about the abilities and execution of the global Expedia team,” said Dara Khosrowshahi, the company’s CEO and President. “Significant improvements in our customer value proposition, marketing efficiencies and improved cost control are just a few of the many accomplishments driving our businesses forward. There is much environmental uncertainty and a lot of hard work left to do, but we are well on our way.”Expedia is the largest U.S. online travel agency, and the stock has taken a hit from the fact that the recession has strained most consumers ability to travel for pleasure. The  “staycation” has been a theme for many households as budgets are crimped. Businesses effected by leisure travel are getting banged up right now (see airlines and hotels), and Expedia’s worldwide airfare revenue sank 20% in the quarter. Domestic travel bookings held up better than international bookings by an order of 4% compared to 8% declines.Given the current operating environment we are reiterating our Fairly Valued stance on EXPE shares. We have been impressed by the resiliency of earnings results during this difficult period. However, we think that investing in a business that relies so much on the leisure traveler is a dangerous proposition, with U.S. consumers increasing savings rates and unemployment rising. Those consumers that are traveling are often driving to closer destinations rather than flying when possible, and this is a trend that we think is likely to continue. The stock is trading (at the time of writing) at about 17.2x TTM earnings, and 18.3x expected full year 2009 earnings estimates. That is not particularly cheap for a stock that has a fair amount of risk. This stock is up 155% since the beginning of the year, which should give any value investor pause about investing after a huge ramp up. Expedia is managing to perform reasonably well given the circumstance, but we are not recommending buying unless it drops into the mid to low teens."
221112,23599,2010-08-18T07:17:11-04:00,,"Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) is the world's leader in Internet based travel sales servicing audiences from casual to corporate including airline, hotel, car rental, and cruise bookings.  Based in Bellevue, Washington, Expedia was divested from the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) family.  Expedia currently markets it services to 20 countries worldwide.  Moody's currently has this issue rated at BA1 while S&P has it listed at a BBB-.At Durig Capital, we have developed a process for our clients to review, select, purchase and monitor corporate bonds. Enclosed is our review along with supporting documents showing why we believe it makes sense with our corporate bond clients' portfolios. We reviewed 10,000 separate corporate bond listings to find what, we believe, is currently the best corporate bond for investors. The following includes our selection criteria.Step 1 - Yield curve at 4-8 years out.In our current interest rate environment, we like the 4 to 8 year range because we see long term inflation as a real risk.  With that being said, short term savings and CD rates are almost non existent.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has made public the Fed’s pledge to keep interest rates at historic lows for the foreseeable future.  Understanding, the undesirable nature of the two ends of the interest rate term structure, Durig Capital is recommending clients hold fixed income that matures in the handle portion of the barbell structure.  If inflation expectations are realized sooner than expected, principal loses may occur.Step 2 - We like companies that are profitable.For the last quarter, Expedia’s net income was $114.26 million, or $.40 a share, compared with a net income of $40.9 million, or $.14 a share that was earned in 2nd quarter 2009. Expedia’s net income as a run rate (last quarter's net income times four) is $ 456 million a year, or about half their total debt, meaning with only their net income, they could repay 100% of the debt in just two years.   Expedia Inc has instituted a $.07 quarterly dividend as of March 2010 signaling financial strength from management. Step 3 - We like companies with debt to cash ratios under one.Expedia’s existing long term debt is $895.37 million, and their cash was $1.13 billion last quarter ended June 2010.  This means that if Expedia wanted or needed to it could settle all of its debt with cash and still have over $230 million extra to boot.  Their current balance sheet can be viewed here. For a company approaching $833 million in total revenues for the quarter, it's hard for to understand why their debt has such low ratings.Step 4 - We like companies that are flexible with there capital structure.Currently Expedia has a capital structure that is made up of $6.78 billion of equity and $895.37 million of debt which presents a debt to equity ratio of .132.  This is a low number, all things considered.  If Expedia were in a situation where it needed to raise cash and/or pay off debt, they are in a great position to do so by issuing equity via a secondary offering while not diluting existing shareholders a lot.  They would only have to issue an additional 13% of the existing float in order to cover their debt obligations.Step 5- We like higher yields.Expedia bonds currently have a 5.494% yield. With the corresponding Treasury yielding 2.00%, this gives Expedia an attractive 3.49 % spread over Treasuries.Step 5 - We currently like shorter maturities.This Expedia issue mature in 08/15/2018, which is at the outer end of our time horizon.  While a change in the yield curve could affect the principal, we would plan on holding this issue until maturity.SummaryThis is a good yielding bond for 8 years.  These bonds should act similar to other bonds like Interpublic,  Unitrin and Fidelity National Financial that have high yields and great balance sheets that we provided updated reports on.  It is my belief that with the low levels of debt, good profitability, and a flexible balance sheet, they are well situated for an upgraded bond rating.

202054,20568,2010-04-30T15:01:38-04:00,,"Expedia Inc.’s (NASDAQ:EXPE) first quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus by 4 cents, or 17.4%. Revenue was in line with expectations. Shares opened slightly higher this morning, but have been down roughly 3% since then. This could be because of the continued decline in sequential earnings despite the solid revenue growth that is an indication of shrinking margins at Expedia.RevenueRevenue for the quarter was $717.9 million, up 2.9% sequentially and 12.9% year over year. The sequential increase was in line with seasonal trends. The increase from the year-ago period was helped by higher volumes, partially offset by lower fees charged to customers.Revenue by SegmentLeisure customers remained the largest revenue contributors, generating 81% of revenue. Corporate customers (Egencia) generated a little over 4%, while TripAdvisor brought in the remaning 15%. The three categories grew -0.6%, 17.2% and 42.5%, respectively, from the Dec 09 quarter. They were up 9.7%, 36.0% and 119.2%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter.The strong performance from the year-ago quarter was helped by weak comps, as the recession impacted corporate spending on travel and the company made use of promotional and discounted inventories to boost sales. TripAdvisor, in particular, did exceptionally well, as traffic grew very strongly, as evidenced by the strong pickup in click rates.Additionally, more than 12,000 subscribers were signed up for the new business listings product. Acquisitions had a 0.4% positive impact on year-over-year comps in the last quarter.Revenue by ChannelAround 63% of total revenue was generated through the merchant business (direct sales), another 23% came through the agency model (where Expedia operates as an agent of the supplier) and roughly 14% from Advertising and Media.The 15.9% and 9.1% sequential and year-over-year increases in the agency business were attributable to better product selection, which helped growth in traffic.The merchant business was down 5.1% seqentially and up 10.3% from the year-ago quarter. The sequential decline was on account of seasonality. The year-over-year increase was attributable to the company’s marketing iniatives and investment in an experienced marketing team, as well as the addition of properties. Management stated that the number of hotels doing business through Expedia increased 24% from the year-ago quarter.Advertising and Media saw robust growth in the last quarter, with revenue increasing 34.2% sequentially and 13.7% year over year. The company is making strategic investments in this area, which along with a recovering travel market should continue to generate strong growth.Revenue by Product LineAlthough both Hotel and Air -- the two main product lines -- grew from the year-ago period, the growth in hotel revenue was more robust at 12.0%. While hotel room nights continued to grow at a double-digit clip (up 17.8%), the most encouraging factor was the flat average daily rate (ADR). The ADR has been sliding in four straight quarters prior to the March quarter, three of which were double-digit declines.With the number of hotels increasing rapidly, the revenue per night growth declined 5% from the year-ago period. Ticket volume growth of 22.0% was also strong, although it was lower than in the preceding two quarters. Airfares were up 9.0%, with revenue per ticket declining 13.0% from the year-ago quarter.Last year, the company decided to reduce and/or waive booking fees, which impacted both revenue and margins. With improving market conditions, we may expect booking fees to return.Revenue by Geography Around 65% of first quarter revenue was generated from the domestic market, while 35% came from international sources. Although the domestic market grew 12.8% sequentially, the international market down 11.7%. However, International was up 31.6% from the year-ago quarter, fueled by solid growth in hotel room nights.Bookings and Revenue MarginGross bookings were $6.6 billion in the last quarter, up 31.4% sequentially and 26.9% year over year. Acquisitions had a 2.0% positive impact on gross bookings in the last quarter.The percentage of bookings converted to revenue (revenue margin) was 11.5%, a decline of 290 bps sequentially and 70 bps from the year-ago quarter. The international revenue margin was better than the domestic. All segments and channels contributed to both the sequential and year-over-year declines, although the merchant business and leisure segments suffered more.The decline in revenue margin is largely attributable to service and booking fee reductions at hotels and helped by revenue offsets from the welcome rewards loyalty program. However, comps will get easier from next year, as most of the fee reductions were implemented in the first quarter of 2009.MarginsThe pro forma gross margin for the quarter was 78.0%, down 115 bps sequentially and up 56 bps year over year. Despite volume increases, fee waivers and other promotions impacted the gross margin negatively. Credit card processing costs and customer operation costs were significantly higher in the last quarter, although the increase in data center costs moderated.The operating expenses of $438.7 million were up 9.0% sequentially. The operating margin was 16.9%, down 456 bps sequentially and up 54 bps from the year-ago period. The sequential increase in selling and marketing expenses in the last quarter was necessitated by higher business volumes. Overall, COGS and selling & marketing expenses were up 115 bps and 545 bps, respectively, while technology & content and general and administrative expenses declined 17 bps and 186 bps, respectively.Net IncomeOn a pro forma basis, EXPE generated a net income of $66.7 million, or a 9.3% net income margin compared to a $99.3 million, or 14.2% in the previous quarter and $51.7 million or 8.1% net income margin in the same quarter last year. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share (EPS) were $0.23, compared to $0.34 in the Dec 2009 quarter and $0.18 in the prior-year quarter.Our pro forma estimate excludes intangibles amortization charges on a tax-adjusted basis, but includes deferred stock compensation. Our pro forma calculations may differ from management’s presentation due to the inclusion/exclusion of some items that were not considered by management.Including the special items, the GAAP net income was $59.4 million ($0.20 a share) compared to $102.2 million ($0.35 a share) in the previous quarter and a $39.4 million ($0.14 a share) in the year-ago quarter.Balance SheetCash and short-term investments totaled $1.04 billion at quarter-end, up $355.6 million during the quarter, resulting in a net cash position of $148.7 million. Including long-term liabilities, the debt-to-total-capital ratio was 35.0%. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went up slightly from 40 to around 48 days.The company generated $619.5 million of cash from operations, compared to a cash usage of $144.3 million in the previous quarter. Expedia spent $29.7 million on capex, $20.2 million on dividends and $197.6 million on share repurchases.We have a Neutral rating on EXPE shares."

The Street had been looking for $828 million and 40 cents. In a conference call with the Street Thursday morning, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said that the key development since the end of the second quarter was that the softness the company had been seeing in the U.S. and the U.K. has extended to “nearly all” geographies and all key product areas, including air, hotels and car rentals. Khosrowshahi said transactions dropped off during the week Lehman went bankrupt, and have not rebounded much since.  CFO Mike Adler added on the call that “clearly the global economy, the consumer, and in turn the travel industry are in meaningfully worse shape today than 90 days ago, and we are seeing these trends significantly impacting the top line of the company.”EXPE closed down Thursday $1.85, or 15.4%, to $10.15."

This would represent a 9% increase in revenues from last year’s $759.6 million in the same period. The current analyst consensus calls for revenues of $837.2 million and $.40 EPS. The company has given no guidance.

110859,20856,2008-12-16T03:22:04-05:00,,"Last week I traveled to Baltimore for the monthly editorial meeting for Taipan Publishing Group.  Shortly before leaving my home office in Atlanta, I booked a hotel using Expedia Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE).  Similar to previous trips, I was pleased with the choices available both from a price standpoint as well as the number of available choices.  After a few short clicks I was on my way.The past year has not been kind to companies operating in the travel industry.  First high oil prices caused fares to quickly rise - dampening demand for transportation.  Then, as if one crisis wasn’t enough, a global slowdown and lack of consumer credit hit travel demand from the other side.  The result  has been a sharp decline in the share price and extreme pessimism around the industry.To illustrate the uncertainty surrounding the  travel business, consider this quote from Barry Diller, Chairman of Expedia. Mr. Diller states that it is a “difficult environment… any predictions about its depth or duration would be foolish.”  However, despite the difficulties, Diller states that the company is well capitalized, extremely focused on the travel business with no distractions, and he is convinced that it will emerge a stronger competitor.Interestingly, despite the dour environment, the company still managed to grow revenue (if only by 10%).  While trends in October may cause the fourth quarter revenue to be below last year, the situation is not so dour as to cancel out positive earnings.  And a stock price in the mid 7 dollar range seems to more than adequately discount the challenges and uncertainty.Expedia is not sitting idly by and hoping this storm will blow over.  Instead, management is active in paring back any unnecessary expenses.  Since sales and marketing were at levels that equal 35.6% of the revenue for the quarter, this is likely an area that will be trimmed.  However, management is cognizant that investments must still be made in order to maintain market share and emerge as a strong player.  Encouraging data points include new signed agreements with major hotel chains (including Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR)) and a completed acquisition of Venere SpA.  This acquisition will expand the company’s footprint in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  Since most sales growth is coming from International markets, this move appears to be worthwhile.Management appears to have a very strong commitment to protect the capital base of the company.  This is especially important during a period where access to funding is very tight.  This limited credit will likely cause a few competitors to go out of business, making for a better playing field for the company when better days arrive.One final headwind noted by the company appears to be reversing.  Previously, a strong US Dollar has caused international travel to become more expensive.  However, it now appears that the Dollar is backing off its highs, which could reverse the trend and cause it to become less expensive to visit foreign destinations.  Time will tell if this new trend will follow through, but with the amount of cash flooding the US economy, it wouldn’t surprise me to see the Dollar drop in relation to a basket of other currencies.So in summary, despite a challenging environment, it appears that EXPE offers investors an interesting value.  There will certainly be plenty of volatility in this name and a turnaround won’t happen overnight.  But I do expect that in six to twelve months, we will see better prices as fear becomes less of an issue.EXPE NotesDisclosure: Author does not have a position in EXPE."

Based on our analysis, we at eChristianInvesting are expecting EXPE to report disappointing results that fail to meet Wall Street’s expectations. Analyst ExpectationsWe are forecasting revenues of $630.5 million and EPS of $.23. This would represent a 5% drop in revenues from last year’s $665.3 million in the same period. The current analyst consensus calls for revenues of $634.9 million and $.24 EPS.  Air travel volume has continued to decline in this difficult economic environment. By our calculations, air passenger traffic was down 8% in the fourth quarter. Expedia and Orbitz (NYSE:OWW) stand to feel the effects of this downturn in spending more severely than Priceline (PCLN).  It is also interesting to note that Travel Zoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) posted a much stronger than expected quarter. We believe this indicates a higher level of unsold inventory as travelers moved away from the traditional travel portals. Our checks seem to confirm this with traffic to the Expedia.com website falling y/y in October and November.  In 2009, we expect that consumer spending on leisure travel will continue to be tempered. Realistic expectations are likely in the neighborhood of a 5 – 10% decline in revenues. This would be worst than the 4% decline that Wall Street is currently forecasting. Share PerformanceExpedia’s shares have increased 10% since the beginning of the year. Although 2008 was extremely difficult for EXPE shareholders as the stock dropped 74% compared a 34% drop in the Dow Jones index. ValuationShares are now trading at 8x consensus 2009 EPS estimates.

With annual global bookings just short of $20 billion, it is the world’s largest online travel agency. I have covered Expedia’s business offerings in the Web 3.0 series in detail. Let’s take a look at the company's latest financials. Its Q4 gross bookings increased by 25% to $4.6 billion compared to the previous year. Its revenues on these bookings totaled $665.3 million for the quarter, i.e. a revenue margin of 14.47%. For the corresponding period in the previous year, its revenue margin was 14.41% and gross revenues were $531.3 million. Region-wise, its North American revenues rose by 19%, European revenues by 39% and Other regions by 42%. Recently, Expedia has even launched an Indian website as part of the company's added focus to the APAC region. Segment-wise, the merchant hotel revenue increased by 23%, worldwide air revenue rose by 13%, package revenue rose by 20% and other services and product revenues increased by 42%, for the quarter. For the year 2007, gross bookings reached $19.98 billion, registering a 16% increase over the previous year's bookings of $17.16 billion. For the year, these bookings converted to revenues of $2.66 billion i.e. 13.34% revenue margin compared to previous year's margins of 13.04% or revenues of $2.23 billion. For the year, while its merchant hotel revenue increased by 19%, package revenue increased by 7% and other services and product revenues increased by 38%, its worldwide air revenue reduced by 2%. The company's quarter EPS of $0.31 met analyst expectations. It was higher than the previous year's EPS of $0.28 by 10.7%. For the year, the EPS stood at $1.22, again equating to market expectations. Compared to 2006, the EPS has risen by 11.9% over $1.09. During the year, the company repurchased 55 million shares from the market.   The company does not publish its outlook, but has suggested that the Easter holidays will pull in additional revenue for the quarter. Currently, the global travel industry is going through a crunch. Expedia’s shares have been trading at $21.17. Its 52-week low price of $20.72 was a year ago. Expedia’s management, however, does not share the glum view. They maintain that the climate is a “mixed bag.” They point out the fact that despite airline fares having increased, air traffic still continues to be high. Similarly, American hotel occupancies might be low, but they expect that to translate to better deals and thus higher sales. There have been talks recently of Expedia wanting to spin off TripAdvisor. But, as of now, the company seems to have put these thoughts on hold. In fact, it has increased TripAdvisor’s reach by launching travel applications such as Cities I have visited, Traveler IQ Challenge, and Local Picks on Facebook. Expedia's Cities I have visited application is the lead ad and media revenue generator. Expedia continues to innovate on its business model. Hotels.com has created customized versions for the iPhone and iPod and also used Facebook to expand its network through Hotels Near Friends application. It recently teamed up with Hawaiian Air to come up with the NFL pro bowl promotion, featuring first co-branded campaign offerings giving exclusive rates to travelers for the Honolulu big game. It added a co-branded credit card to its portfolio which was named the best card for travel rewards by SmartMoney within three months of its launch. It has also teamed up with Cruise Ship Centers International Inc. to offer travel products through home-based agents in the U.S. and through a co-branded store. For my other analysis on Online Travel, read the Web 3.0 segment analysis, as well as discussions on the vertical search engines, and vertical ad networks, both trends that Expedia needs to pay attention to."

(Read my Interview with Groople CEO Mike Stacy) Groople is different from Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Kayak in that it serves only group travelers, no individuals, and is thus a great focus on a specific “Context.“
Unlike any other travel site, Groople serves different segments like sports teams, student groups, families, as well as corporate travel. Currently it provides booking services at more than 60,000 hotels.
Recently, it has added a special feature called Groopvine where customers can easily and quickly create their own group trip planning page, invite guests, upload photos, and take advantage of a dozen other community features.
In 2003 it raised $5 million in seed funding from Boulder-based Fatty Tuna, and in 2004 it secured $4.4 million in a Series A round from Colorado’s Vista Ventures and New Mexico’s Flywheel Ventures. In August 2006, led by ArrowPath Venture Partners, it raised an additional $6 million. Its existing investor further invested $5.2 million in 2007.
The site earns its revenues through commissions from its inventory suppliers, which ranges between 12%- 25% per transaction. The company claims that it has generated triple-digit revenue growth while transactions have grown by 80%. Its partnership with Travelocity is also monetizing very well.
Its single major competition is from Group Travel Planet.
Acc. to CEO Mike Stacey, Groople’s revenue increased 100% from 2006 to 2007 and transactions increased 70% during the same period.
Other major accomplishments since the interview are as follows:
It looks like the company has very nice momentum, and is a good example of a company that aligns well with my Web 3.0 framework of focusing on a specific Context, and Personalizing within the nuances of that Context.
Groople could be a great acquisition target for many of the larger travel companies, especially Kayak, as part of its roll-up."

39033,20896,2007-06-21T06:05:30-04:00,,"Breakingviews is printed every day on the back page of the C section in the Wall Street Journal. The column sometimes has some interesting things to say, but most of the time it's dedicated to stating an opinion and backing it up with circumstantial evidence. Monday morning, the column (subscription required) stated quite confidently that Expedia's plan to buy back 42% of the company's shares was a waste of shareholder cash on an overvalued asset (Expedia shares being the overvalued asset). The evidence? Expedia is trading at 26x per share earnings, and the debt level would equal ~4.5x debt/EBITDA. Well, the problem with Breakingviews is that they take about ten minutes to research a company and not two weeks. I happen to have done a lot of research into Expedia, and while I did not own it in the Vestopia portfolio I manage, my hedge fund owned loads of it - we bought it at ~$18 late last year. Here's why Diller's buyback creates value: Expedia had about $600M in adjusted operating earning in the last 12 months. By ""adjusted"" I mean that I take out a lot of the accounting charges that the company is required to take for the amortization of intangibles. Anyway, let's assume that the company spends the $3.2B in debt to buy back shares at the top of the tender offer range - $30/share. That would retire ~107M shares, leaving Expedia with ~244M shares left (adjusted for outstanding options). Assuming an 8% cost of debt (which is mind-blowingly conservative - Expedia will likely pay 100bp below that), that means that from the $600M in operating earnings, ~$250M will go to interest payments. That leaves about $1.50 in operating earnings per share of Expedia stock. Tax that at 30%, and you get about $1/share in free cash flow. Now, one might argue that a 3.33% FCF yield is low (with the stock at ~30/share presently). I would argue that for a company with presently trough margins, incredibly low capital intensity, and high-single digit revenue growth for as far out as the eye could see, a 3.3% FCF yield is pretty good. Even a bit cheap. As for full disclosure, my hedge fund unloaded Expedia yesterday after the run-up. My fair value estimate for the stock before the buy-back announcement was ~$28/share. After the buyback announcement, I calculate a fair value of $35/share. Not a bad increase in value. Diller was simply selling a rich asset (debt) and buying back a relatively cheap asset (his stock). That's good capital allocation, and it's unsurprising from someone who own 50% of the company. EXPE 1-yr chart:"
54026,21279,2007-11-13T08:19:19-05:00,,"Expedia Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) announced its third quarter results on November 7 (see conference call transcript). The online travel company , which owns brands like Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Expedia Corporate Travel and TripAdvisor, surpassed analyst expectations on both topline and bottomline. The company reported a revenue growth of 24% YOY to $760M. The Non GAAP EPS came to 39c, a 15% improvement from that of Q3 '06. Online travel companies have been witnessing major growth on the European front and Expedia was no exception. European operations continue to provide stellar results with a revenue growth of 37% (30% excluding F/X impact). 47% YOY growth in European bookings was the prime contributor to the 21% YOY growth in the company's gross bookings (total retail value of transactions). With North American bookings growth remaining relatively stable, EXPE reporting that 32% of worldwide gross bookings came from Expedia Inc.'s international POS (27% in the comparable quarter), bodes well for the company. The company has already increased the number of merchant hotels in Europe to 13,000, a 12% YOY growth. This would help Expedia to maintain its revenue growth from European operations, going forward. With Priceline.com (PCLN) eliminating the airline booking fee, EXPE may have to follow suit. In such a scenario, only a significant increase in conversion rates and cross sell of other services can offset the lost revenue. Though the company has commented that it did not see any adverse results in this quarter due to elimination of booking fee by PCLN, we believe that the company is starting to feel the pinch. It has indicated a move towards low booking fee/ no booking fee service in the European market, stating its intention to pursue an aggressive growth strategy. The company has already tested waters by following a no booking fee procedure in markets like Spain. Initiatives to strengthen the European supplier base - like the agreements with British Airways, Air France KLM and Sky Europe would be helpful for the company to pursue its growth strategy. Advertising and Media Revenue has shown a good upward trend through the quarters of the past two years (For Q3 - 106% YOY growth to $51M). This indicates that the company is executing well its transformation towards being an online travel company from that of an online travel agency. Going forward, revenue from advertisement could see further upside, with the company launching the beta testing of TravelAds, a platform that enables hotels to bid for premium placement in hotel search results. Transactions, a key metric for assessing EXPE's performance, have been increasing through the past four quarters and reported a growth of 16% YOY in Q3. Aided by these developments, the company pegged its 2007 OIBA growth at low double digits, an improvement from the earlier guidance of high single digit growth. Despite these positives, the stock has been on a decline post results, obviously due to broad market weakness. The stock closed at $28.5 on November 9, and has now come to pre Q2 levels. With the strong fundamentals, we expect an upside potential of at least 15% in the short-term. Disclosure: none"
39566,20521,2007-06-27T14:39:22-04:00,,"Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) is the largest online travel content company, headquartered in Bellevue, WA. The Company through its portfolio of well-recognized brands like, Expedia.com, TripAdvisor.com, Hotwire.com, Hotels.com, Expedia Corporate Travel, Classic Vacations® and a range of other US-based and international businesses that provide travel products and services to leisure and corporate travelers.  The Company is the fourth largest travel company in the world and the third largest in the US. The Company’s brands operate international sites in the United Kingdom, Australia, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Canada, Japan and China. Expedia Inc. and its brands had more than $17 billion in annual gross travel bookings in 2006. According to Nielsen/NetRatings, Expedia and Hotwire.com received 20.5 million unique U.S. visitors in March 2007 up 9.3 percent from previous year. Microsoft founded Expedia in 1995 and the Expedia.com site was launched in 1996. In 1999, Microsoft took Expedia public. In 2002, Barry Diller, owner of USA Networks (currently InterActiveCorp / IAC) acquired a controlling stake in Expedia. In 2003 IAC purchased the remaining stake in Expedia. Expedia Inc. was spun off from IAC in 2005. On June 18, 2007, the Company announced that it will buyback 42% or 116.7 million shares at $27.50 to $30 each for $3.5 billion. Expedia Inc. stock jumped 14.3% or $3.64 on June 18, 2007 on the news, the highest since it’s listing in 1999. Expedia spent $660 million buying back 30 million shares in January.  There have been rumors of Barry Diller taking the Company private and spinning off TripAdvisor into a public company. Expedia trades at a significant discount to its peer Priceline (PCLN), which has appreciated 52% this year. At the close of market on Monday, June 18, 2007, Priceline was trading at $64.9, which is 47.2 times its trailing twelve months earning compared to 34 times earnings for Expedia. Expedia Inc. with its top brands and market leadership position is highly undervalued. The Company generates significant amount of cash from its operations. Expedia generated $520 million in free cash flow in 1Q 2007 and had $637.7 million in cash on its balance sheet. Even after the run-up, the Expedia stock is at a discount to Priceline and has a very low price to cash flow and book value compared to its peers. Online travel is  a booming industry and the total online sales in 2006 were $78.8 billion. The industry is expected to continue to grow at a CAGR of 16.6% to $145.8 billion in 2010. In such a scenario the industry has been experiencing renewed interest from both VCs and PE firms. In March 2007 Silver Lake and TPG acquired Sabre Holdings, owner of popular travel sites like Travelocity. The Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) along with its affiliates took over the Travelport business of Cendant Corporation for $4.3 billion in August 2006. In 1Q 2007 Expedia Inc. reported 12% increase in revenues to $550.5 million over $493.9 million recorded in 1Q 2006. Strong advertising and hotel revenues drove the growth in revenues. Merchant hotel revenues grew by 17% in the first quarter. Gross margins of Expedia increased by a healthy 163 points. The Company’s cost-cutting initiatives resulted in savings of almost $10 million during the quarter and the Company expects to achieve $50 million in saving by the 4Q 2007. The Company’s partner services group has been growing rapidly. Expedia.com has the highest click through rate of 4.9% for sponsored ads in the industry. Driven by the success of TripAdvisor’s user generated content, the Company has been looking at expanding its media business. The Company has acquired a number of smaller players in this space, including SmarterTravel, TravelPod, Travel Library and Steve’s group. The Company is also looking at ways for monetizing the 90% plus of the 60 million unique monthly visitors who don’t do any transaction with Expedia or its brands by introducing display advertising. Expedia Inc. experienced robust growth of 32% in the European market and gross bookings increased by 8% to $5 billion. The Company’s North America business has been experiencing stiff competition and this reflected in lower than expected growth of 1% in 1Q 2007. EPS for 1Q 2007 was 11 cents up from 6 cents in 1Q 2006. However, the Company has been experiencing strong demand from late March, which it expects to continue till the end of the summer season. It makes sense for Expedia to buyback its shares when it is highly undervalued as the Company has strong cash flow. Neither Barry Diller nor Liberty Media (LINTA) are selling any shares as they are bullish on the long-term prospects of the Company. The long term prospect of the company lies in building itself a juicy travel media business that generates high CPM display advertising revenues on the shoulder of TripAdvisor. I would not spin TripAdvisor out, but rather, integrate the 4 Cs. EXPE 1-yr chart:"

38702,20307,2007-06-19T00:42:05-04:00,,"On Friday, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) shares jumped on speculation that Executive Chairman Barry Diller was considering taking the company private at $30 a share, then spinning off TripAdvisor and cutting 400 jobs. The company put the kibosh on the rumors, saying “Expedia is not going private. We are not spinning off TripAdvisor and we’re not eliminating jobs.”
But maybe something else is happening. Scott Devitt, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus, says he now thinks the probability of an LBO in the next 3-6 months is “approaching 0%.” But he contends there is a greater than 50% probability that the company will alter its capital structure by issuing incremental debt and buying back stock. He says the company could take out 21% of it shares by boosting its gross debt position from $500 million to $2.2 billion.
Meanwhile, Devitt thinks that TripAdvisor is “materially undervalued” as an operating segment of Expedia, and that it could be worth $1.5 billion to $2 billion as a separate company. He theorizes that one recap scenario would be for the company to swap TripAdvisor to Liberty Interactive (LINTA) in exchange for that company’s 22% stake in Expedia."

Net earnings were up to $34.8 million ($0.11/share) from $23.3 million ($0.06) in the year-ago quarter. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $0.18 per share against $0.15 in Q1 2006. On that basis, analysts had forecast EPS of $0.20. Operating expenses were higher in the quarter, especially selling and marketing costs, which rose 10.6%. Expedia posted total bookings of $5.02 billion, up 8% from Q1 of last year. European bookings were up 32%. Revenue gained 11% to $550.5 million from $493.9 million, due in part to higher hotel and advertising revenue. Analysts had forecast revenue of $531.5 million.

In other words, the combination of Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Hotwire.com, Classic Vacations, eLong, and TripAdvisor only govern 1% of the entire travel market worldwide.  Needless to say, Expedia has a great opportunity for growth in all markets. With the travel segment of the US economy purring (with the exception of fuel prices and consequently airlines), Expedia is well positioned to benefit from the summer travel season. Its book value is a pretty $17.50 per share, while earnings growth is a spectacular 49%. One concern I have is the measly 11% revenue growth, and this is primarily due to a flat US domestic travel market. In their most recent quarter, growth came primarily from Europe, but the company seems to be making investments in the right areas with their recent announcement to purchase Bookingbuddy.com, SeatGuru.com, Travelpod.com etc. They are also signing on additional travel partners (Frontier Airlines, Omni Hotels and Hertz) to expand their offerings. Finally, Expedia recently entered into a partnership with Citigroup (NYSE:C) to offer rewards for eligible bookings. I believe Hotels.com will soon follow with an exclusive rewards program of its own. With over 24 million visitors to their TripAdvisor.com site, and cross-promotion opportunities across their sites, Expedia is the best travel bet going forward. And if they get bought out by someone like Yahoo! (YHOO) or private equity, that's an added bonus. EXPE 1-yr chart:"
